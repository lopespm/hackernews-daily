Now, even with little change to statutory law, most see that the best interpretation of the various traditional categories, exceptions, &amp; affordances of copyright law is the one that finds legal space for a Wayback Machine.Bulk-scanning books-still-in-copyright, even for private preservation/use? Was legally iffy when Google &amp; IA started doing it; now better recognized as legitimate.Accepting user/collector uploads of live concerts? Storing, serving, &amp; providing emulated environments for old still-in-copyright retail PC/game/arcade software? Bulk-archiving &amp; replaying TV news broadcasts? All iffy when IA started doing them, becoming accepted as reasonable over time by the demonstration-of-utility.An Internet Archive that waited for legal clarity before starting such projects would still be waiting today – and we&#39;d have neither the valuable projects, nor the accumulated experience/clarity, from the actual doing, about what is reasonable &amp; beneficial."</p>

Currently it&#39;s all located in the US and they have a huge focus on the US, both technically and politically.But why not try to replicate it all over the world? There seems to have been some smaller efforts inside the Internet Archive to make it more decentralized, but it feels like it should be a much bigger focus on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My interest in science started when a friend and I folded a few paper planes, tested them over a small downhill section outside my house, made notes about what worked, tweaked and experimented with new designs, and so on. It blew my little mind that with structured experimentation you could design things that actually got better with each generation. Where would the improvements stop?With hindsight, I realise that most of the improvements we measured were really just statistical noise. We never had a control plane, so if one by accident flew better one test, then we would tweak something and then we would naturally see regression to the mean, but we would record that as a tweak that made things worse.To little me it was a lesson in deliberate design. To grown-up me I guess it&#39;s a lesson in how easy it is to delude yourself without proper experiment design and statistics.Anyway, then after seeing my interest my father brought me an early Windows program that contained animated instructions on some paper plane designs. One of them was vastly superior to anything I had ever seen. But with the years, I forgot how to fold it. I had been looking for it for over 20 years when a few months ago, I wanted to show my son (of two years) a good paper plane and guess what? I think I&#39;ve found the design! But it took a blurry YouTube video and some trial and error. I ought to write it down some day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In fourth grade we had a paper airplane contest, but they had a restriction on the design: a circle about the size of a quarter was on the page, and no fold or crease could go through the circle.The circle was located a few inches above the exact center of the paper.Anyway I made a &#34;dart&#34;, and just offset the angle a little to avoid the circle. It was good, and most of the competition was incredibly bad. And a few maybe had a bad launch. One throw only.One clever design was submitted by a duo composed of my two worst nine year old enemies: Derek and Derek&#39;s sidekick. It was basically a UFO (saucer) made by carefully crumpling the edge until it was a nice size to throw. They threw it sidearm with one finger hooked around the rim.It really sailed, maybe went twice as far as the second best plane: my plane.But their plane was disqualified on the grounds that it wasn&#39;t a plane. So, I was deemed winner.For the announcements the next morning, my name was announced as the wrong-gendered version (something like Jesse announced as Jessica) and it definitely didn&#39;t feel like a win anymore.I still like paper airplanes, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a kid I had a great book with lots of science experiments in it called &#34;Science Is&#34; (Author: Susan V. Bosak)It had an entire section on airplanes but there was one that absolutely destroyed my intuition about flight and to this day confuses adults whenever I get the chance to make it (something like a team building event where we need to make paper airplanes).It&#39;s literally two hoops of paper and a stick. Here&#39;s a page I found with the design.https://www.exploratorium.edu/science_explorer/hoopster.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once had a contract where my client wanted me to do &#34;security work&#34;, which was initially meant to be for pentesting their clients, but it turned into me building their wifi auth system.At some point in the gig, one of their clients went to them asking them if it was possible to de-anonymize someone glassdoor review since someone still-employed worked with them. They then went to me to see if I could do it for them. They didn&#39;t clarifywhy they went to me, but I legitimately think they wanted me to &#34;hack&#34; glassdoor. I told them in no uncertain terms that I wouldn&#39;t do it and they backed off.A bit later they fired the employee..

Two weeks later, Glassdoor sends me an email notifying me that the employer is pursuing legal action and I have two options: 1) delete the review, or 2) stand by the review if it&#39;s true and, when it comes down to it, my identity may need to be revealed in court when necessary. That was my catalyst to quit.I stood by the review and Glassdoor notified me that the employer pulled back on the legal action. My review is still there. And Glassdoor did their best to not reveal my identity under the threat of legal action -- not until absolutely necessary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To everyone replying with their coffee preferences, you may be missing the point. This post isn’t about coffee, it’s about people and experiences in life being more important than products. It’s about a product’s quality being defined not by its substance but by its reminder of things that can’t be purchased. It’s one of the most beautiful posts I’ve seen in a long time. Hope you look beyond the coffee.Edit: Hope I didn&#39;t come across as too harsh to folks replying with their favourite coffee styles. I think I find myself in a near-constant state of, &#34;but what about the things that matter&#34; when spending time in VC/Startup/SV/AI/crypto/etc. culture. I know more unhappy-but-wildly-successful people here than I can shake a stick at, and I think we (as a community) are hugely complicit in pushing a consumerist culture where stuff&gt;people. I was deeply moved to see a piece surface to HN which poetically argued for the opposite value set, and I had a moment of frustration when it wasn&#39;t clear that it was coming across to people in the comments. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve gone through several coffee phases, some bordering on extreme — extremely sensitive weighing, timing, $2,000 grinders, $10k espresso machine, etc.My happy medium is just doing basic pour overs, but with really good locally roasted coffee. To me, this is the cheapest and best approach.In fact, even if pour overs require too much work (weighing, timing), then just do drip. But do it with quality coffee.Quality is really about roasting time and date. You don’t want old coffee (anything older than a few weeks isn’t good), and low temp. Dark roast is burnt. It’s not a flavor. It’s used to remove the taste from shitty beans. If you use quality beans you want light to medium. This usually isn’t an option with quality beans anyway. They typically only sell the coffee roasted one way. So in most cases, you won’t even have to worry about.Anyway, I guess my point is the opposite of the article. You don’t have to drink shit coffee to save money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a really beautiful post.As for coffee, like many other parts of life (movies, food, and music especially), I find that I like it very good or very bad—as long as it’s not down the middle, I can find a time/place to enjoy it.I have a fairly expensive Rocket Espresso machine, I’ve learned some latte art. I have every coffee making contraption out there. And I enjoy all of it, at times.When I’m in a hurry I’ll make instant or go to a gas station. Totally fine and the gas station coffee is kind of a favorite of mine for long trips in the car.What I almost never do is buy Starbucks because to me, it feels like that middle-of-the-road experience. I’m not making a statement about the company or the culture or anything like that. It just feels like going to Applebees or something (yes you’re out to eat, but shouldn’t you just go somewhere nice or, on the other hand, somewhere cheaper/faster where you don’t have to tip?). It’s too acidic and too expensive for what it is. I’d rather pay for something nicer or go cheap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read the books and enjoyed them.- To respond to one criticism seen widely here, the authors claim to have validated ages with historical municipal birth records in all the Blue Zones. I cannot speak to these particular zones, but I&#39;ve been doing genealogical research on my own ancestry and I am absolutely blown away by the ubiquity and detail of both municipal and Catholic church records in Sicily in the 1800s.  Preunification Italy was under the rule of various northern European countries and was heavily influenced by their standards of record keeping. I cannot say if this applies to the other countries in the book, but generally speaking, just because these records are old doesn&#39;t mean they are bad.- One thing that was very notable in the books but isn&#39;t discussed very much is that, with the exception of the Loma Linda cohort, the Blue Zone areas are all quite poor. They all primarily eat food they are able to grow or harvest themselves, out of necessity, which encourages simple and consistent diets. They have routine, simple lives that are made fulfilling by concentrating on community, family, and friends.  They are content with what little they have and do not strive for more than they need.I found the books quite inspiring.  I think the lessons learned are good, even if they won&#39;t get me to 100.  In any case I&#39;ve felt much better and lost weight on a closer-to-Blue-Zone diet than I did before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One Ikarian in particular, Stamatis Moraitis, moved to America when he was 22 years old to pursue the American dream. He was a painter, and immediately started having success, bought a house, married, and had 3 kids. At the age of 66 years, he developed terminal lung cancer. Instead of dying in America, he decided to move back to Ikaria and moved in with his parents. He started breathing the air, drinking the wine, and eating a Mediterranean diet. After a few months, he planted a garden not planning on ever getting to harvest the vegetables; 37 years later he has a vineyard producing 200 L of wine a year. His secret he says? “I just forgot to die.”This is where I think the article loses its credibility significantly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived in Loma Linda for a few years (in Southern California, 60 miles east of LA), which is one of the blue zonesIt is predominantly a 7th day Adventist community. Notably they prioritize healthy lifestyle and typically are vegetarian as well as avoiding alcohol, caffeine, etc.There is also a big medical school and hospital complex in the city and many people that live there work in the healthcare field.There are of course plenty of other explanations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I planted some thousands of trees in Iceland in the noughties. I believe the program was funded by Alcoa to offset the carbon produced by an aluminum plant they were building on the island. They paid farmers to plant trees on unused land, and the farmers hired and hosted us to do the work. It was an amazing way to see the country. We mostly planted larch, birch and alder from what I remember. It is a very beautiful country, like an arctic Hawaii."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Planting forests increases the overall amount of carbon stored in biomass, but the forestry program is also designed to harvest trees for use as fuel or building material (from the main article linked in the post):&gt; &#34;In the meantime, Iceland’s forests have begun to produce wood for a small timber market. Forests planted between 1950-1970 are now supplying around 5,000 square metres of wood per year: miniscule compared to industries abroad, but a start. The Icelandic birch, Siberian larch, Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine and balsam poplar are producing quality wood of equal or superior quality to that which Iceland imports from abroad. Yet an overwhelming 80% of the trees felled are burned as fuel in silicon smelting.&#34;Iceland has a silicon production industry, which relies on geothermal electricity interestingly enough.  The wood is included to grab the oxygen from silicon dioxide to produce elemental silicon metal (being emitted as carbon dioxide).  Overall, if they could eliminate the coal from the mix, this would be a carbon-neutral fossil-fuel free silicon production system:https://www.pcc.is/&gt; &#34;Silicon metal is extracted from quartzite, aided by the addition of wood chip and coal, in electric arc furnaces at temperatures of around 2,000 degrees Celsius. The new plant obtains its key raw material quartzite primarily from PCC’s own quarry in Zagórze, Poland. However, the related logistical costs are more than outweighed by the advantages of electricity procurement. And the dust emissions generated during silicon metal production are almost completely removed from the ambient air by high-performance filter systems installed in the PCC plant. Taken as a whole, therefore, the production process offers exceptional sustainability credentials.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just came from a trip to Iceland and most of the country had no trees. Some corners had a little, there were also obvious plantations. There was one place that had old forest and was in other respects very magical: Ásbyrgi Canyon. Just downstream from Dettifoss which was an insane experience by itself.From what I have gathered the biggest obstacle to tree regrowth in Iceland are sheep which can roam anywhere in the island for I think 4 months in the year and just eat saplings.Obviously the sheep farming industry does not want to hear about limiting their herding areas and you can guess the result."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite feature is &#34;video-sync=display-resample&#34;. This gives you perfect frame pacing by synchronizing the video to vertical refresh and resampling the audio to match. If you set your refresh rate to an integer multiple of the frame rate, every frame will be shown for the exact same time. The audio resampling compensates for very small discrepancies between speeds by imperceptibly changing the audio speed. It&#39;s similar to the proprietary DirectShow filter &#34;ReClock&#34;, but AFAIK ReClock does not dynamically adjust the speed to compensate for clock drift like MPV does, in which case you could theoretically still get imperfect frame pacing. (I haven&#39;t actually used ReClock so I could be mistaken here.)Also great is MPV&#39;s support for arbitrary OpenGL shaders. This can include very complicated shaders, e.g. real-time neural network upscaling:https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releasesSD video can look surprisingly good after upscaling with this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I highly recommend doing what I have done most of my career. Get a job at smaller to medium sized non-tech company. Every company, in any industry, has computers. They need you. You don&#39;t have to work with a bunch of tech or finance people. You can get a job working with chill people in some other industry with a better culture.When it comes time to negotiate, negotiate HARD. And not just for money, but especially time. Ask for so much that you think they will laugh or be scared away. If they say no, you lose nothing. Eventually the right opportunity will appear. I didn&#39;t think anyone would say yes to a 4-day work week, but I kept asking. Eventually someone said yes.The one worry I am having these days is how long this strategy will remain viable. As SaaS and low/no code solutions proliferate, it makes little sense for non-tech companies to build when they can buy. This is especially true as engineer compensation continues to rise. Engineers who congregate at SaaS companies can build better products than a handful out on their own who are building a solution for just one company. Increasingly, the only engineers that non-tech companies need are people to manage their data, people to glue the SaaS APIs together, and maybe some frontend people to put a custom interface on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think most people here can. That&#39;s why, when people have enough money to retire, they DO retire, and not continue working. Work for most people is trading  time and physical and mental health for money. In our profession, we got it better than most, but the underlying principle is still the same.Also, there are definitely better and worse companies. I&#39;m currently in the best job of my life (well paying, fully remote, very little meetings, no micromanagement, using interesting and cutting edge technology), but it took me 15 years to get there. The catch is that such companies don&#39;t have to hire that often (because people don&#39;t tend to leave them), so most openings at the market in any given moment are from shit companies where average tenure is 18-24 months and half of the staff has low-grade depression. The job market is essentially a market for lemons, unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel exactly the same. Programming professionally for a decade sucked all the joy out of it.My personal hypothesis is that we’re increasingly being treated like assembly line workers. We’re not paid to think but to implement the poorly thought out hare brained schemes from the higher ups who have no clue about programming. This externalizes all the cost of poor quality software onto the developers (unmaintainable code, constant outages…) while  reaping the short term benefits for themselves (promotions, raises)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s important everyone becomes educated about the fact that virtually every mobile app sells some part of your data that leads to some private company possessing the ability to draw a circle around your house on map and then detect all patterns of life without any PII.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to pit this as a US gov&#39;t surveillance problem. It&#39;s true though - the Government missions involved, where this type of data is relevant, face rather compelling offerings especially in complex times; e.g. immigrant/refugee surges where understanding the flow of people up to the border is important for stability.All of this data comes from Big/Small/all tech; usually branded as &#34;ad tech&#34; or &#34;mobility data&#34;. And the supply chain is rather murky, masked, and rebranded/repackaged numerous times between a network of data providers &amp; downstream businesses.Working close to Government... I&#39;ve never seen any mission specifically seeking large-scale citizen-based tracking capabilities.  US government in recent timeframes have seemed adamant about not purchasing any US-based location data &amp; are cautious even for non-US based monitoring; especially as they learn more about the origins &amp; scale of mobility data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Aside stopping the use of Facebook, which of course is the best solution but not doable for many, the AdNauseam (.io, browser extension) approach to pollute their tracking data might be inspirational.
The gist is: can&#39;t eliminate ad links? Then have an app &#34;click&#34; all of them randomly so that counters become irrelevant. So there is this link that identifies user X?, well then write an extension that distributes and &#34;clicks&#34; it around on say 1000 other machines in a p2p way so that it becomes meaningless.I have no idea if it&#39;s doable in this FB context, but usually when links can&#39;t be anonymized, the next move is to make them produce irrelevant data by adding noise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t used Facebook in quite a while, but when I did I had a set of userscripts to defuse this tracking. It worked similarly to Google link stripping, by defusing the JavaScript that rewrote the link between the time you clicked it and when your browser opened it. Initially I built it because the free wireless internet in my apartment was unreliable and the redirects could be enough to prevent a page from opening. My method was pretty blunt - I removed element entities that held the target URL, and that broke the listener function. A later iteration would actually unset the listener event. This all worked because it seemed important to FB that you be able to see where the link would take you (e.g. by hovering). I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Facebook&#39;s paternalism (and Google&#39;s for that matter, but I haven&#39;t seen it from them, though I mainly use DDG now) now led them to add this &#34;protection&#34; directly to links as they&#39;re served up. I can&#39;t tell from the article whether that&#39;s the case, and at this point I&#39;m not going to log in to FB to figure it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love to stop using Facebook, Instagram or Whatsapp, but I would really need to criple my social life if I&#39;d give up on any of these. And I&#39;m not even a very active person, it&#39;s just that so many people I want to engage with have a huge chunk of their lives tied to one of these.I can&#39;t understand the people saying there is a free market choice here, this can only be solved with simple regulation that targest large platforms.If the SEC can use its judgement on what constitutes a security, than we can have a social media comission to oversee Facebook."</p>

I mean, really—Orwell?I&#39;m referring to the omission of this passage: &#34;I should like to put it on record that I have never been able to dislike Hitler. Ever since he came to power—till then, like nearly everyone, I had been deceived into thinking that he did not matter—I have reflected that I would certainly kill him if I could get within reach of him, but that I could feel no personal animosity.... that several commenters pointed out:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32135108https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32133675https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32130897All: in the future, if you notice something like this, could you please send us a heads up at hn@ycombinator.com? We can&#39;t read all the articles or comments, but we do read all the emails, usually within a few hours. We will be especially grateful if you point out a howler as massive as this one.Edit: I couldn&#39;t resist diffing the bowdlerized text with the gutenberg.net.au one and the eliding of that bit is the only difference between the two, other than punctuation. How embarrassing.Edit 2: it turns out that bookmarks.reviews is guilty only of blogspam. They got the thing from https://www.openculture.com/2014/08/george-orwell-reviews-me..., which links to https://carnegiecouncil-media.storage.googleapis.com/files/v... (via https://boingboing.net/2014/08/17/orwells-review-of-mein-kam...). That looks like a decades-old copy of the 1968 edition, edited by Orwell&#39;s widow. I doubt that it was she who dropped that sentence—I bet it was whoever reprinted the essay. Considering that Orwell specifically wrote &#34;I should like to put it on record&#34;, that took some brass, or lack thereof.The degree to which Orwell practiced intellectual honesty is an endless marvel. If there&#39;s one thing we should learn from anybody, it&#39;s that from him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, there&#39;s a lot to be said about Hitler and fascism and propaganda and all the other fascinating topics Orwell brings up here, but I&#39;d just like to point out how routinely excellent Orwell&#39;s analysis is.  Of course I mostly see the best bits brought out and dusted off, no doubt he did mediocre stuff as well, but it is worth noticing how often it turns out that Orwell, nearly a century on, still has plenty in his writing worth revisiting."</p>

The app remembered the actual map data but did not remember the address I had just typed in to the program 15 minutes earlier. I had to guess what street address I was heading to! Why they designed the app to store all search history exclusively in the cloud and not keep a local copy is beyond me, but I presume when working at google they always have an excellent connection and hadn’t thought of what would happen if a user lost service.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One practice that&#39;s helped me is to always cancel immediately, which translates to only paying for one month. Ie. for spotify, netflix pay for the subscription, immediately jump through the hoops to cancel.Forgetfulness turns into money savings, and as a bonus I get to review whether I am getting much out of it. Especially for tv like disney/netflix/apple tv, I often run though everything interesting and don&#39;t have much else to watch with them.Also psychologically there&#39;s resistance to a boring to do that involves loss. I will put off &#34;go to netflix and figure out how to cancel.&#34; So do that work when you are excited to see the new show."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it typical to spend so much on software subscriptions? I pay for Spotify and a cheap VPS if that counts but that&#39;s it. I figured the average person probably has one or two media subscriptions (Netflix, Disney, Spotify, etc) and nothing else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I think may be underrated by many:We cancelled Amazon Prime, and besides the annual fee, we noticed that our household retail spending went down significantly. It turns out that when it takes more than 1-click to buy stuff… we buy less stuff.As far as convenience, one of the reasons we felt it was time to cancel is that we can just as easily get almost anything we wanted from Amazon direct from the seller or via Target/Best Buy/B&amp;N/B&amp;H. Surprisingly, this is often cheaper than Amazon (and almost never more expensive). While there’s a bit of added friction to think for two seconds which store to check, the benefit of fewer impulse buys seems worth it. Plus, we haven’t ended up with any crappy knockoffs since we bailed on Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The censoring is so horrible that Chinese are using other country&#39;s name to substitute China. For example, there is a question in Zhihu, &#34;Will China become the next technological powerhouse?&#34;. The answer is talking about Russia literally, but it&#39;s about China. (Below is the answer translated by deepl).I don&#39;t want to talk about China, I want to talk about Russia.Can Russia become the next technological powerhouse? Of course not.Because the ceiling of Russian intelligence or wisdom is Putin. There is no one in Russia who can claim to be more intelligent than Putin. Russia can do without anyone, but not without Putin. Although we do not know whether Putin has any relevant qualifications or experience in the industry, all Russian businesses and professions depend on Putin&#39;s guidance and must hold up Putin&#39;s ideas and banners, otherwise they will not be able to move forward. Putin is the ceiling of Russia. How can a country with a ceiling become a technological powerhouse?Look at the United States. Who dares to direct the work of Musk, whether Trump or Biden? Who dares to direct the business strategies of Apple and Google? I find that in the US, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president. The technology companies in the US seem to be able to run smoothly without the guidance of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be able to develop technology without raising the banner of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be doing quite well. I find that the US is a country that has no ceiling in terms of intelligence or ingenuity, and that is always improving. Only such a country can become a technological powerhouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The linked story kind of buries the context info:&gt; Nomura said the refusal to pay mortgages stems from the widespread practice in China of selling homes before they’re built. Funds from presales are kept in escrow accounts to use for construction. But confidence that projects will be completed has weakened as developers’ cash woes intensified.&gt; “Inappropriate usage of presale proceeds and the lack of adequate supervision of escrow accounts by local regulators and banks are likely associated with these mortgage suspension cases,” Zerlina Zeng, a senior analyst at CreditSights, wrote in a note."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The background for this is that most existing UI toolkits are a poor fit for Rust.Rust doesn&#39;t like having shared mutable state, but event-based UIs have a global event loop and can mutate anything at any time.Rust works best with strictly tree-shaped data structures, but event handlers turn trees of widgets into arbitrary webs with possibility of circular references.Rust prefers everything thread-safe, but many UI toolkits can&#39;t even be touched from a &#34;non-main&#34; thread.Rust&#39;s object-oriented programming features are pretty shallow, and Rust doesn&#39;t have inheritance. That makes it awkward to model most toolkits that have deep hierarchies with a base View type and a dozen of Button subclasses.So instead of retrofitting mutable single-threaded OOP to a functional multi-threaded language, there&#39;s a quest to find another approach for UIs. This change of approach has worked for games. Rust wasn&#39;t nice for &#34;class Player extends Entity&#34; design, but turned out to be a great fit the ECS pattern."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the web really killed the idea of &#34;native&#34; widgets. I think the rise of web apps just got everyone used to the idea that controls are just going to look different everywhere. Even on macOS, practically every app I use has a very distinct look and set of widgets (vscode, photoshop, blender, spotify -- two of those are electron, but even the non-electron stuff doesn&#39;t look very much like a &#34;mac&#34; app anymore). And in windows, microsoft really killed it themselves by constantly updating their own apps with non-standard widgets that everyone else wanted to clone (I remember the longest time it seemed like the only new things of note in every new version of ms office was how the toolbars looked). I suppose it&#39;s not a terrible thing, but I do kinda miss the days of windows 2000 and classic macos where the platform had a (somewhat) uniform look and feel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On macOS ... going forward, it’s likely that new capabilities and evolutions of the design language will be provided for the latter [SwiftUI] but not the former [AppKit].I think this is vastly over-stating the technical churn of UI development on macOS.While we&#39;re definitely seeing new UI toolkits introduced that are Swift-only (like the new Charts.framework[0]), nearly every Mac app Apple ships is written using AppKit.  For example, I just verified (`otool -l PATH_TO_APP_BINARY`) that Mail, App Store, Notes, Music, Xcode[1], and Photos all link against AppKit, and none link against SwiftUI (on macOS 12.4 21F79, which I&#39;m running).There is, in my opinion, approximately zero chance that Apple either:(A) rewrites all of the UI in all of their apps, replacing AppKit with SwiftUI, in even the medium-term, or(B) starts treating AppKit apps as second-class citizens by introducing a new design language only available from SwiftUI.Yes, we&#39;re going to keep seeing cool new widgets and features which are only available from Swift.  No, the platform&#39;s design language is not going change in a way that makes AppKit apps obsolete.[0]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts[1]I bet Xcode links SwiftUI somewhere for IDE integration, but I&#39;m specifically referring to the UI implementation, parts of which have been in development since, like, NeXTSTEP and are certainly built using Objective-C &amp; AppKit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Realistically an Amazon-wide union is the only way Amazon workers are going to get decent wage increases.  If the USA is going to allow manufacturers to outsource the majority of well-paid (~$30/hr avg) manufacturing jobs to Mexico and China, without having any cross-border capital flow penalities (neoliberal globalism in a nutshell), then the major employers like Amazon and Walmart are going to have to double their wages.Yes, that means less for the executives and shareholders.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like Scratch - my kid uses it and I worked briefly with the guy who made Blockly, the underlying visual programming toolkit - but the programming environment makes many things far too complicated with its singular focus on sprites.It&#39;s very, very difficult to do things as simple as display a number on screen. My 7yo was making a number guessing game, and to display a two-digit number we had to make two sprites that had 10 &#34;costumes&#34; (0-9) then do modular math to select the costume for each digit. Sprites also have their own code, and if you duplicate one and edit the code the edits don&#39;t apply to the duplicate - so there&#39;s no user library or abstraction power at all.This made dealing with Scratch far more complex and time-consuming than the logic of the game my kid was making, which is the exact opposite of what you want in a learning environment. I don&#39;t really want to focus on the idiosyncrasies of Scratch when teaching programming.Some simple text and drawing commands, user-defined functions, and a library would go a huge way towards making Scratch simpler. There are some other Blockly-based environments that may have this... but they&#39;re not as popular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At work we built a BI tool around Scratch (Blockly) back in 2013. It’s still seeing daily use: https://www.dialogic.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/demo1.gif"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is great that Scratch can be used as an introduction to programming, but that is not why it was created. It was part of the MIT MediaLab &#34;Computer Clubhouse&#34;[1] project where it would be used to enable a remix culture of cute animations and even simple games. Scratch&#39;s implementer, John Maloney, had already helped create a programming environment for kids called EToys[2] using Squeak Smalltalk, just as in the first versions of Scratch (later rewritten in Flash and then in Javascript).So the comments about how it is hard to do in Scratch something that would be trivial in Basic or some other language are not surprising. It is an animation system that allows you to use programming to increment that.As others have pointed out, a system with the same visual as Scratch but design for actually programming is Snap![3] so it is just a matter of using the tools for what they were created to do.[1] https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/Clubhouse/Clubhouse.h...[2] http://squeakland.org/[3] https://snap.berkeley.edu/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who are interested and may not know; Bill Watterson also ghost-drew a few strips for the comic Pearls Before Swine (part of an arc beginning on the 2nd of June 2014[0] and continuing till the 8th). There are a couple of neat references to who it is behind the better art (anyone who&#39;s read Watterson&#39;s complaints on shrinking panel space in print media will be familiar with the guest character&#39;s comments) and I recall an old blog post by the artist of Pearls describing what it was like to work with Bill (terrifying; the thought of the postal worker just chucking these, the only comics anyone had gotten out of Watterson in years, onto his porch in the rain was horrible), but I can&#39;t find it.[0]: https://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/02EDIT: Nevermind, found it! https://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/ever-wished-t..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running a Calvin &amp; Hobbes bot for ~20 years now.  Back when Google Reader was a thing, the bot published an RSS feed which had greater than &gt;1M subscribers.  It&#39;s now a bot on Reddit (/u/CalvinBot) with &gt;700k karma.During that time, I&#39;ve tried to be very mindful of Watterson&#39;s copyright and make sure I don&#39;t violate it anyway.This had led to some interesting &#34;bugs.&#34;  Specifically amuniversal.com only publishes the comic strip as a GIF.  But the official Reddit mobile app has a bug.  It treats all GIFs as a video &amp; disables other image features, like zooming.  The nature of C&amp;H is such that very often want to zoom to see all the wonderful details Mr. Watterson put into the strip.Because of that I routinely get complaints about it being in a GIF (&#34;GIFs are for movies!&#34; the whippersnappers say) and tell me to publish them as JPG or PNG.  Now converting a GIF to JPG or PNG is trivial, but there&#39;s no way I can do so without violating his copyright.  I&#39;d have to host the converted image myself, which I don&#39;t have the right the do.So I won&#39;t do it.It&#39;s minor, but knowing Watterson felt so passionate about copyright, I think it&#39;s important to honor.  But because the team at Reddit won&#39;t fix the bug, the complaints continue to come rolling in.  Enough that I wrote a FAQ about it:https://www.reddit.com/r/CalvinBot/comments/bdxb6h/why_are_p...If any C&amp;H fans knows anyone on the team at Reddit, I&#39;d much appreciate it if you could ask them to fix it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In the old days, there was this idea of “selling out” and we as a culture decided that it was bad. Monetizing a thing immediately called into question its integrity, and more importantly, the integrity of the artist. But then an interesting thing began happening in the late 90’s and early 00’s. The idea of selling out lost its negative connotation.It did? I completely missed that, but it&#39;s probably because I&#39;m old..."</p>

(Author misinterprets appearances of `www.domain` and `domain` in his source list as errant duplicates, when in fact that may be an indicator that those `www.domain` entries also have significant `subdomain.www.domain` extensions – depending on what Majestic means by &#39;subnets&#39;.)• Many sites may block `curl` requests because they only want attended human browser traffic, and such blocking (while usually accompanied with some error response) can be a more aggressive drop-connection.• `curl` given a naked hostname likely attempts a plain HTTP connection, and given that even browsers now auto-prefix `https:` for a naked hostname, some active sites likely have nothing listening on plain-HTTP port anymore.• Author&#39;s burst of activity could&#39;ve triggered other rate-limits/failures - either at shared hosts/inbound proxies servicing many of the target domains, or at local ISP egresses or DNS services. He&#39;d need to drill-down into individual failures to get a beter idea to what extent this might be happening.If you want to probe if domains are still active:• confirm they&#39;re still registered via a `whois`-like lookup• examine their DNS records for evidence of current services• ping them, or any DNS-evident subdomains• if there are any MX records, check if the related SMTP server will confirm any likely email addresses (like postmaster@) as deliverable. (But: don&#39;t send an actual email message.)• (more at risk of being perceived as aggressive) scan any extant domains (from DNS) for open ports running any popular (not just HTTP) servicesIf you want to probe if web sites are still active, start with an actual list of web site URLs that were known to have been active at some point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly dislike the idea of automatically jumping into a folder when there’s only one match: it feels like a feature optimised for very slow typers that actively penalises fast typers, because it makes things generally unpredictable: will one character be enough to navigate, or two, or three? It depends on the siblings, and if you type more characters than are required, you will be penalised by ending up somewhere else as the remaining letters are fed to the next level down that you haven’t even seen yet. My general habit in navigating is to type three characters and press Tab, because that’s almost always sufficient, and is plenty fast. I have a very few places where I’ve learned to do other things. Under my habit, I could end up as much as two levels down from where I wanted to be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting.OTOH, people have named a number of similar tools, and I&#39;m going to point out &#39;mc&#39;
 aka Midnight Commander, which is part of most linux distro&#39;s, and is a clone of the 1980&#39;s Norton commander. Its designed to be a command line TUI helper, sorta like the project here, with not only cursor/etc based directory navigation but copy/rename/delete/etc functionality just a keystroke away. Its fairly convenient because it overlays the command line rather than replacing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a lot of comments on this thread pointing out typical bandwidth usage of popular streaming services, games etc and claiming that there&#39;s no need for higher bandwidth connections.There&#39;s an important point that I think people are missing, which is that the bandwidth usage of internet services is going to be carefully tuned to balance quality and stability at typical internet speeds. When a large portion of consumers have &lt; 100Mbps down of course all services are going to use &lt; 100Mbps of bandwidth - you don&#39;t know what kind of stuff you&#39;re missing out on because of these slow internet speeds, because nobody is making it available, because it wouldn&#39;t work.The most obvious thing that we already know we&#39;re missing out on is video streaming quality. You&#39;ve possibly already noticed that low contrast dark scenes and scenes with snow/rainfall don&#39;t look very good on Netflix/YouTube/insert streaming service here - this is because these are the kind of scenes with the most obvious sacrifice of quality from video compression.

As others said, there is a lack of both competition and pricing to worry about too.In a major tech hub like San Francisco, where I live, it&#39;s possible to get 1gb/1gb in some areas for under $90, but which those are isn&#39;t consistent nor wide spread. Home cell coverage at 100/20 is spotty at best, and there is only one flat rate vendor (T-Mobile Home, no Verizon Home yet). For those outside of the Bay Area exurbs, I can only imagine the horrors of Comcast/Xfinity or only DSL people must deal with.Looking forward, the FCC is assuming that people are just watching Netflix, Tiktok, and making angry Karen posts on Nextdoor. We&#39;re not sure where web3 will lead, and how much bandwidth will that take: Distributed file systems/data privacy? Fast crypto transactions? Metaverse/VR/AR glasses/contacts? And what about latency?1000/500 should be the FCC goal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem, in the USA for most people, is Comcast.Downspeed hardly matters. It&#39;s been plenty for decades. Upload speed has stagnated. I uploaded as fast in 2003 as I do now in 2022. And as others have said, it&#39;s not so much about 1 fast provider as many providers and choice. In my comcast monopoly my plan started at $60/mo in 2011 and without any changes on my end and no change in my upload speed that price has increased to it&#39;s current $105/mo. In addition to the price increases they&#39;ve implemented a new system of total data transfer limits ((up/down)+internal overhead) meaning even if I could have a faster connection it&#39;d mean nothing if I used it in the first week and then got hit with multiple $10 overage &#34;fees&#34;.But I don&#39;t have a choice. It doesn&#39;t matter how good, or bad, Comcast is. They&#39;re the only game in town."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s actually some science behind this diet. Potatoes are the highest scoring food on the satiety index. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-incredibly-filling-f...Basically they&#39;re the most filling food per calorie. So if you subscribe to the idea that losing weight is mainly about how many calories you consume, a potato heavy diet should be effective.And an all potato diet, while monomaniacal, even more effective.Eggs and fish are also very high on the satiety index. If you threw in pretty much any vegetables and spices of your choosing and just stuck to those along with potatoes, even with a cheat day or three you&#39;d have a very healthy diet which I bet most people would lose weight on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a few weeks eating only potatoes and vegetable oil, several years ago. It wasn&#39;t for weight loss, it was because I was breastfeeding, and my baby had some kind of protein sensitivity we couldn&#39;t nail down. Potatoes turned out to be a safe food for him, so that&#39;s all I ate for a while. As it happens potatoes are my favorite food, and I had vegetable oil available so I could eat fries/chips/crisps, but even then I can&#39;t imagine doing it without a similarly serious motivation. When my choices were &#34;listen to the baby cry in pain every time he eats&#34; or &#34;eat potatoes until the allergist appointment,&#34; it was an easy choice. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t last long on the potato diet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only reason the potato diet is interesting to me (and presumably the reason it&#39;s interesting to the https://slimemoldtimemold.com/ folks) is the likely relationship to their environmental contaminant hypothesis for the public health issue of increasing body weights since 1980, outlined in a series of posts here: http://achemicalhunger.com/In short, while the variety and satiety explanations make a lot of sense subjectively for an individual on this diet, they don&#39;t match up with the empirical data on weight gain since 1980. Here are a few phenomena that are not explained by this hypothesis:* The inflection point at right around 1980. There&#39;s no specific change that occurred in 1980 that anyone can point to that indicates a major change in variety of food in the average diet.* The correllation of weight gain with location in watersheds: high altitude locales where surface water has not moved very far (e.g. Colorado) exhibit the weight gain phenomena much less than locales deeper down in the watershed (e.g. Mississippi and Louisiana)I&#39;m not interested in fad diets or disordered eating because they have a track record of bad long term outcomes, but I am interested in the potato diet as a blunt tool for taking action on this hypothesis, which looks pretty compelling to me. And if it doesn&#39;t work out, that&#39;s fine, too!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks very cool, kudos on the launch!I feel like vim tutorials mostly focus on navigating and editing a single file, which is great! But I mostly struggle with how to replicate opening a whole directory in VSCode, which makes it easy to browse the directory, switch between files, open multiple panels, etc.I&#39;m almost certain vim does all these things out of the box, but tutorials always end at &#34;this is how you edit some text quickly&#34; and never cover &#34;this is how you do software engineering&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  :set nu
  / whatever you want to find [return]
  i
  *edit stuff and use arrow keys for nav*
  :wq
  Or :q to quit without saving


That’s all the vim most people need.The fact that less is installed on many more systems than nano is a testament to the bad assumptions too many devs make about who will be using these systems in the future. And yes, it’s not hard to &#34;apt -y install nano&#34; except at work where we have proxies and internal repos, so now I need to use vim to reconfigure apt sources just so I can use a more normal editor that doesn’t require arcane incantations to perform basic config file editing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to like vim and I love some things about it, like the ability to move chunks about with only the keyboard. But so many things about it kill me. Like, why can&#39;t I hit right at the end of a line, and move to the next line? Who thinks that is a good idea? Also, why do I have to have a special mode to insert things? Having to change modes just seems so complex and unintuitive. And why does the help system never tell me what I want?The frustration is that probably there are fixes for all these things, which if I were an expert I would know. But meanwhile I can use an ordinary visual text editor and I don&#39;t have to learn anything new."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"TikTok is the most successful espionage operation of the 21st century so far, and it is based on a simple idea - people will happily give away their data and privacy if you consistently entertain them.In my opinion the application should be shut down as soon as possible, but there are many lessons to learn from it. And most of them have little to do with technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the privacy issues that will defeat TikTok, I think it&#39;s the deception of a success economy being possible on the platform.In the past few weeks I&#39;ve been observing a lot of marginal content trending on the platform which indicates to me that a lot of the more quality posters aren&#39;t posting new content.The minute quality creators leave a platform is the minute it dies. TikTok has not really been rewarding creators fairly, and pushes the idea that organic growth is possible, and that people have become really successful, but many creators realize after months of working for little to no reward that it&#39;s a false narrative.There are billions of accounts on these platforms yes, but the main question is are they actively posting, engaged, and satisfied? The answer is most likely no, and that&#39;s why Twitter didn&#39;t sell fast too.I wrote about this issue just earlier today -https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32046338"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Heya, I&#39;m the author of the article. I&#39;ve been working on Kandria full time for close to two years now, and on-and-off for some years while I was doing my Master&#39;s at ETH. The engine it&#39;s running on, Trial, is a few years older still, and initially just started out of the good ole university boredom and curiosity. Games is how I got into programming when I was about 6, and that particular fever hasn&#39;t left me yet it seems, ha ha!Kandria itself started as a &#34;more serious&#34; attempt at a game after I&#39;d been making jam games with Trial for some years. I wanted to create something bigger, and had just finished playing through Celeste, so I just set out to replicate its mechanics in my own way. You can still find some demos of those very early days on my YouTube channel, if you&#39;re curious. In any case, the project went through several big changes until it turned into what it is now. During the pandemic in 2020 I finally decided to drop out of my Master&#39;s to pursue the project full time. At that point I also brought on a couple more people to help with the writing, art, and sound.We&#39;re currently also running a Kickstarter to get us some extra funds for the project. It ends on Thursday 14th, 12:00 CEST, so there&#39;s not that much time left in it. If you&#39;d like to support our work, please have a look: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria
The campaign page has a lot more details on the project and the team, if you&#39;re curious about that.In the article I primarily cover the programming parts, giving a surface overview of the technologies involved and at least giving a brief hint at the methodology I employ to create games. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left out a lot of details that you might be curious about, so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask and I&#39;ll try my best to answer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice write up.The dark side is that they&#39;ve put years into developing the core infrastructure to empower their Lisp game journey. Ideally that&#39;s all usable by others to &#34;stand on the shoulders&#34;, so to speak, but that&#39;s always a challenge.I honestly have never had to work on a &#34;running image&#34; of any consequence. I&#39;ve never worked on anything more than a few thousand lines of code. I&#39;ve never needed any kind of source level &#34;step&#34; debugging. The ability to redefine a function quickly, I just throw in some prints to figure something out.Reloading the entire source file was always fast enough to now warrant hunting down any of the more interactive mechanisms available. This is all across using simple vi, or emacs, or even LispWorks.  (defun l () (load &#34;src.lisp&#34;))

Just save the file, and type that.All that said, my current low level fantasy is something akin to Electron, only with Common Lisp. First class DOM, first class event hooks, into a CL runtime that you can deploy cross platform. Dunno if that exists or not.I&#39;m sure at some point my codebase will grow to the point where I would need to &#34;level up&#34; and become more intimate with SLIME, packages, system definitions, etc.I&#39;ve just not crossed that threshold yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; One thing I do have to mention though is that the workflow in Lisp allows me to create these support libraries much faster than I can in other languages.I&#39;m at that stage in my lisp journey (~18 months) where i know enough to be dangerous to others around me, i.e. i&#39;m still a lisp n00b but have completed a few lisp &amp; scheme books and written enough projects that i feel fairly productive. BUT i haven&#39;t reached, never mind come out the other side of, the &#34;trough of disillusionment&#34; yet. So everything lisp is unreasonably tainted with a positive glow in my mind.TL;DR i still think lisp is pretty awesome. It&#39;s my newest hammer and everything looks like a lisp-shaped nail these days. So i have to be deliberate and careful not to over-use lisp but it&#39;s totally changed how i write js for example. It&#39;s infected my brain.Here&#39;s the thing - that workflow statement by the OP is a fair chunk of the attraction to lisp for me. Before lisp i &#34;knew&#34; what a REPL was - i&#39;ve been using python since i switched wholesale from Perl in the 00&#39;s, i thought you couldn&#39;t teach me anything new about REPLs, even quasi-REPLs like Jupyter were entirely familiar and &#34;basic&#34; to me. If you&#39;re a lisper, you know i was wrong about that, if you&#39;re not a lisper you&#39;re probably wondering what&#39;s the big deal.The other chunk - and i&#39;m only really scratching the surface so far - has been macros. I think so far i prefer the non-hygenic type, but i haven&#39;t gone through Let over Lambda yet (although the book is on my bookshelf and is only 2 titles away from being started)For me, lisp opened my eyes to a way of working that i just wish i could fully replicate in other languages. Lisp has made me re-appreciate python and js in different ways now.If you want a really short version - Brett Victor&#39;s famous inventing on principle talk sums it up for me (he was using JS there, so there is hope...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried to pick up Rust a few years ago, but there were too many sharp edges. I thought it was a nice language, but was too early for actual use. I played with some libraries (Apache Arrow, etc) and it was nice.About 2 months ago I wanted to use Arrow within Elixir, which required me to start using Rust again (Elixir uses Rustler to safely convert from Rust &lt;&gt; Elixir without theoretically crashing the beam). I am amazed how far it&#39;s come, and I&#39;ve actually been using it a lot over the last few months and haven&#39;t ran into any major issues. There is a fair amount of information out there, and the documentation as the OP pointed out is really fantastic.The libraries are really good now, and I&#39;ve had no issues using it on Linux or on my Macbook M1. Incredibly impressive speed results. SIMD is a game changer.Major shoutouts to arrow2 and Polars, I love using it for data analysis :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love rust.  I didn’t find it difficult to learn and at this point several others I’ve introduced it to also haven’t.  I’m baffled as to where that reputation comes from.I get that it makes you think about what you’re building a little more than something you can throw together like Python or Ruby but if the end goal is software that works correctly, getting there definitely isn’t harder with rust.  It’s the complete opposite :/."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been thinking to myself whether I should pick up Go or Rust as a new language this year.Coming from a NodeJS background, Rust looks a tad more complicated but it looks cooler. There are also more job listings looking for Golang than Rust which makes me wonder if Golang might be a more rewarding investment?What would be a good use case of Rust than Golang cannot do given its extra complexity and potentially lesser monetary reward? Any advice on which I should pick as a new language to learn?"</p>

I&#39;ve worked on OSS for ten years - opportunities have come out of it. Most of the time I was doing both I felt like I was doing something inconsequential that only meant something to me.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got my first paid work writing software because I got lucky on GitHub.Back in college, I simply commented on a peer&#39;s issue made for a local hackathon. He was confused about what direction to take for a webapp, and didn&#39;t have any experience in any frameworks. I just suggested Rails, and gave a few highlights for it and pointed him towards some starter guides.Within a couple hours a well connected student (I believe he ran the CS club) saw my comment, and forwarded it to an alumni who was doing local Rails work.I actually didn&#39;t have any experience in Rails beyond the tutorials of the day, and I made that clear. But he liked the look of my GitHub and was happy to give me the job.It was pretty good money for a college student. I recall not really knowing what to expect hourly wise, and when he brought up payment I wasn&#39;t able to give an answer so he immediately said 50/hr. To me, I was truly expecting like half of that. I tried to keep cool as I accepted.  My pricing mindset was definitely anchored by waiting tables, where 50/hr is something you might get if you got a really lucky shift and required busting ass. So to get that much for _sitting down_? Oh boy.After settling on the price, he stepped out of the room for a bit. This was a shared co-working space, and I recall looking over to the guy next to us (who I could tell was paying some attention to our conversation) and saying I did not expect that much money. He happened to work for Uber - and he agreed that I got a very good deal. Not sure why I remember that detail.Anyway: yes, working in public, and even being helpful in public, certainly can pay dividends."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The drastic move to organic farming is puzzling.Any level headed person, forget a politician, would want to experiment first, see the results, gauge and then expand selectively. That is common sense.I guess when you are a dictator ish government and you rule the country with an iron first, the institutions of the state stop being anything and simply become rubber stamps.This also underlines the importance of self sufficiency in necessities. A country ought to feed its people, provide basic services like power and medical facilities on its own, without depending on imports."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But the most boneheaded, bizarre mistake that the Sri Lankan government made was a disastrous plan to shift the entire country to organic agriculture. In April of 2021 the government banned the import and use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. This devastated Sri Lankan agriculture, since, as it turns out, fertilizer is really really important. Production of tea — Sri Lanka’s main cash crop — fell by 18% in a year. Production of rice — the main food crop — fell by even more.From https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/05/sri-lanka-organic-farmi... :&gt; By 2020, the total cost of fertilizer imports and subsidies was close to $500 million each year. With fertilizer prices rising, the tab was likely to increase further in 2021. Banning synthetic fertilizers seemingly allowed Rajapaksa to kill two birds with one stone: improving the nation’s foreign exchange situation while also cutting a massive expenditure on subsidies from the pandemic-hit public budget.&gt; But when it comes to agricultural practices and yields, there is no free lunch. Agricultural inputs—chemicals, nutrients, land, labor, and irrigation—bear a critical relationship to agricultural output. From the moment the plan was announced, agronomists in Sri Lanka and around the world warned that agricultural yields would fall substantially. The government claimed it would increase the production of manure and other organic fertilizers in place of imported synthetic fertilizers. But there was no conceivable way the nation could produce enough fertilizer domestically to make up for the shortfall.You don&#39;t get anything &#34;for free&#34;, and cutting supports like this will inevitably doom a sputtering economy, when the actual solution was almost certainly more government spending, not less.The US is actually lucky to understand this at the deepest levels of policy and law making, with massive aid packages to prevent total collapse. Even Europe tried harsh austerity in the wake of 2008, and the fad lasted way too long there.The Sri Lankan leader&#39;s hostile attitude towards the Sri Lankan population is what made protesters storm the leader&#39;s home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first part of the article about how Sri Lanka would get foreign currency 
(swap, export or borrow) almost completely ignores the well documented devastation of the tourist industry, where people bring euros or dollars, due to covid19 and shutdowns of travel.Yes I suppose it falls into the category of swap, because people bring euros and exchange them for local currency to buy local goods and services. But it was a big part of the &#34;swap&#34; that vanished for 2+ years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the idea of searching a curated list of domains, but I&#39;m not sure that doing the curation yourself is the best approach considering the huge number of useful but niche websites in existence.I wonder if simply parsing all of Wikipedia (dumps are available, and so are parsers capable of handling them) and building a list of all domains used in external links would do the trick. Wikipedia already has substantial quality control mechanisms, and the resulting list should be essentially free of blog spam and other low-quality content. Wikipedia also maintains &#34;official website&#34; links for many topics, which can be obtained by parsing the infobox from the article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Somewhere I read a quote from some cranky business analyst complaining about how the low prices, quality products and high wages impact profits. &#34;It&#39;s better to be a Costco customer or Costco employee than it is to be a Costco shareholder.&#34;To which I responded &#34;That sounds like a well run company!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2005 my wife and I lived in a part of the USA that had no Costco within a half day&#39;s drive.  We soon secured jobs in a part of the USA that had two (two!) Costcos in the same city that we would live.  True story - before we even looked for housing, I went online and joined Costco.  Years later my diabetic cat even had a Costco pharmacy account (best place to buy insulin by far) and received a discount for being without health insurance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related to the story&#39;s underlying topic, as an immigrant I find significant attitudinal/philosophical differences in how I regard saving money and spending money versus, for example, my American coworkers and friends, especially younger ones who grew up around relatively well-off families.  Maybe the affection for Costco embodies that.   I&#39;m sure I sound like an old fart for saying this, like &#34;those younguns don&#39;t know the value of a dollar any more&#34;.By comparison at least, they are much freer with their money and don&#39;t have the same baggage about it.   An example especially apparent for me is their willingness to spend on clothing, where I just can&#39;t bring myself to do it.  Maybe just not having been brought up around parents who were ever dressed that nice, or allowed me and siblings to be.   Or for example, their lack of concern about overpaying for small things, which yes in the bigger picture, who cares if you&#39;re overcharged for a drink once in a while?I suppose it&#39;s because the information or concern about not having money was already passed down or imposed on me as a lesson early in life (whether intentionally or not).  Sometimes I view it as an advantage as I see that my friends (those spending freely) will encounter those lessons when they get married, have kids, etc. and need to save.   On the other hand, I wonder if I&#39;m just handicapping myself with that baggage and not allowing myself to enjoy the freedom that a good income now brings, and living too  much in the restraints of my family&#39;s past..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that is missing from this simulation is that (at least some) ant species walk straight back to their nest once they found some food. They do this (as far as we know) by accumulating each step they take into what is called the &#34;home vector&#34;, effectively integrating the whole path they took. That way they always know which way is &#34;back to the nest&#34;. There is a vast amount of papers on the topic. Some (personal) highlights:If you put the ants on stilts they will follow the same home vector, but because each step on stilts is effectively longer they will overshoot the target: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig4-Odometry-by-stride-...If the ant is placed close to the nest after gathering food, it will still follow its home vector ... away from the nest: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2004...Crazy little buggers these ants."</p>

There&#39;s a lot of papers from back then if you&#39;re looking for other ideas for agent based simulations or complex systems.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think I can count the number of kernel changes I&#39;ve submitted on one hand, but I work on core virtualization that involves a lot of pretending to be hardware and (these days) a lot of poking directly at hardware registers.I would say James Mickens sums things up nicely in &#34;The Night Watch[0].&#34; For example, you mention debugging with logs and metrics -- this snippet came to mind:     “Yeah, that sounds bad. Have you checked the log files for
     errors?” I said, “Indeed, I would do that if I hadn’t broken every
     component that a logging system needs to log data. I have a
     network file system, and I have broken the network, and I have
     broken the file system, and my machines crash when I make
     eye contact with them. I HAVE NO TOOLS BECAUSE I’VE
     DESTROYED MY TOOLS WITH MY TOOLS. My only logging
     option is to hire monks to transcribe the subjective experience
     of watching my machines die as I weep tears of blood.”

Mind you, I absolutely _love_ working on low-level stuff, and I wouldn&#39;t trade the time I get to spend actually doing that for anything. That said, the complexity of modern operating systems, CPU architectures, interconnects, and peripherals creates opportunities for frustration and confusion that honor no bounds of reasonability or decency.[0]: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in the kernel team many moons ago helping improve the performance and then built the .net clr later. Also worked on a NT Filesystem called Cairo. So I guess I have experienced both kernel dev and backend framework dev.Kernel code is amazing, especially the parts written by the early members like DaveC, MarkZ and others.For me the biggest part was working with a group of extremely smart people who were very nearly the best programmers in the world.I really miss that outside of Microsoft. I would imagine that you can get the same experience if you worked with the Linux kernel dev team or some of the other few places in the world like FAMGA where you can work.My suggestion is to go for it. 
After leaving MS I found peace by working with the open source community and open source software.Hope that helps, happy to discuss further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bad stuff:1. There will be a lot of infrastructure complexity in the kernel, just prepare yourself for that. Even worse bugs! You&#39;ll be fixing a lot of bugs, or looking at a lot of bugs, and most of these bugs are from other teams who are interacting with your component! Just order a copy of Windows Internals and get yourself familiar with how thing work.2. Old ass engineering systems. Just as the interviewers said you will spend a lot of your time waiting for Windows builds.Good stuff:1. Work life balance is amazing actually. Most of the time there&#39;s very little pressure for you to get work done, as long as you&#39;re doing something no one really bothers you.2. Since you said you hate designing systems, good news, everything has been designed for you! Your, job will mostly be implementing new features for a component.3. Windbg is actually great and I will die on this hill. You might have to print some debug logs but you won&#39;t be looking at metrics because there&#39;s whole teams dedicated to doing that stuff. There&#39;s also tools which quickly spin up VMs for you to do some live kernel debugging.Meh stuff:1. The pay, could be better. That might change soon though."</p>

And personally, I greatly prefer this sort of frank talk to run-of-the-mill generic PR speak that usually comes from CEO interviews.The next thing he says in the interview:&gt; I’ve been in the gaming industry longer than most anybody – getting to the grey hair and all that. It used to be the case that developers would throw their game over the wall to the publicist and sales force with literally no interaction beforehand.

A compulsion loop may be distinguished further from a core loop; while many games have a core loop of activities that a player may repeat over and over again, such as combat within a role-playing game, a compulsion loop is particularly designed to guide the player into anticipation for the potential reward from specific activitiesFor some reason, all I can think of is that game from ST:TNG [2].

She was actually being kind to him by doing him a favor, and then he basically ran away and stuck her with them. That&#39;s not kind at all, it&#39;s pushy and exploitative.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Man, not putting Fully Qualified Domain Names in code has been such a recurring source of pain in my software life. You make so many assumptions about the way people parse domain names and all of them are wrong. Vendors do all kinds of things to &#34;simplify&#34; their workflows internally and sometimes they just parse URLs and domains in all kinds of ways that break your brain.Reminds me so much of the way &#34;smart&#34; telecom engineers bastardized SS7 to ship new features onto legacy telco infrastructure. SS7 is like 20M lines of C. You can&#39;t really change it without breaking it in many other places, AT&amp;T used to have a metric which was something like &#34;for every 10 lines of code you alter in SS7, you create 8 bugs in other parts of the code.&#34; So &#34;smart&#34; telecom engineers would take existing fields in the SS7 logic and use them for different functions inside of their telco. A billing field could instead be used as a feature flag for some sort of customer state, but only inside of the telco&#39;s network (and re-written back to the compliant SS7 standard when the data was headed out of the network). This was called encapsulation and wrapping and un-wrapping packets just in time was the source of many many problems in my telecom life.Just in time editing of network packets at the boundary is always fun. Most of the problems that would happen would come from forgetting to rewrite back to SS7 and transmitting the internal codes out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks Justine, you&#39;re doing the Lord&#39;s work here.One of the best introductions I&#39;ve seen to pledge() is Kristaps Dzonson&#39;s writeup on it that you can find here [1]. The whole website in general is furthermore a guide on how to write webapps in C, which may sound like a crazy idea to some people who have written it off as everything from an elaborate joke to a security nightmare that nobody should ever consider doing [2], but for people like me who end up having to write that kind of code in constrained execution environments it&#39;s been extremely enlightening and I really appreciate knowing how to do it more securely. If pledge is something I can access in Linux it really helps me out for things in the future going forward, I hope to create some cool things with it![1] https://learnbchs.org/pledge.html[2] https://learnbchs.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh god yes please. If pledge() makes it into the mainline kernel, we OpenBSD-type people seem less weird when submitting patches for some syscall &#34;nobody uses&#34;.Many OpenBSD ports contain pledge() support. Steal all you can. OpenBSD does &#34;hoisting&#34; in many userland programs, meaning all the open calls and such take place at the very start but isn&#39;t actually parsed until after we have locked ourselves in with pledge() and unveil(). I hope this also means many non-base programs are redesigned in this manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi jart,I noticed that you&#39;re missing the sendfd promise. Is there a reason for that omission? Also you&#39;ve added a number of extensions that perhaps should be documented as such.Also there&#39;s a pretty significant undocumented difference between your implementation and OpenBSD, in that promises are by inherited across exec in yours, and not on OpenBSD.OpenBSD experimented with that by specifying the second argument as execpromises, but discovered that it was extremely difficult if not impossible to write meaningful execpromises in the parent for potentially unrelated programs, it&#39;s also happening too early before dynamic linking, and before the program has had an opportunity to &#34;initialize&#34; or &#34;do privileged stuff&#34; and call pledge(2) later itself with more accurate knowledge of what to self-restrict. As such, no calls with execpromises set to anything but NULL/0 exist today. I&#39;m curious how to reconcile those differences."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About a decade ago, I briefly worked for a company with the same business model. Since most Windows installers require Administrator privileges, the DLLs that they side-load will inherit these elevated privileges and can scan the user&#39;s machine for anything they are interested in.The way this software worked (as far as I can recall): The installer bundled a DLL from which only a few minor functions were exposed to display offers within the host process. Usually, the only thing the client portion of this DLL needed was a HWND. During initialization, the DLL stored a copy of itself in the user&#39;s temp directory. The host application unknowingly then used rundll32 to load this copy as a separate (also elevated) process. This process would run at least as long as the calling process would. Once in place, the process would scan the user&#39;s computer for specific use patterns (geoinformation; MS Office presence; what language; etc.). In order to retrieve the latest advertising &#34;offers&#34;, the DLL called home with this information over a secure pipe and checked for updates. This data was stored and referenced if the same user invoked the DLL again at some point. Only at this point would any actual targeted ads be displayed in the client application&#39;s window.Things may have changed since then - these were the pre-Windows 10 days - but if it&#39;s anything like this, it&#39;s wise to avoid the Unity installer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All of this makes me ask the question of, &#34;How does a company go public without losing themselves? Is that even possible?&#34;This type of going public and chasing shareholder, share selling, cash infusion (sorry for the word salad, I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to put it) - which is often needed for growth past a certain point - how does a company not compromise their vision and bow to the shareholders once they go public, when their directive then becomes &#34;Maximize stock value for the shareholders&#34;?NOTE: I&#39;m an engineer who graduated with an art degree, so this is way out of my wheel house. I&#39;ve always built things, and have not been privy to the business side of the show. It&#39;s a bit foreign to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like there may be a typo with the estimated year of deployment in Ontario: the estimate is likely for 2028, not 2018.The article was published on July 11, 2022, but opens with: &#34;Saskatchewan and Ontario have each chosen GE-Hitachi as the supplier of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), which could be deployed in the Prairie province by the 2030s and in Ontario by 2018.&#34; Then, the article concludes with: &#34;GEH and Ontario plan to construct up to four 300 MWe small module reactors, with the first coming online by 2028.&#34;A separate source by The Canadian Press [0] also reflects an estimate of 2028 for Ontario: &#34;The governments of Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Alberta have put forward a nuclear plan that they say will transition them toward cleaner energy. The provinces’ energy ministers agreed today to a joint plan for small modular reactors, with the first 300-megawatt plant to be built in Darlington, Ont., by 2028.&#34;[0] https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/renewables/onta..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that nuclear is pretty well loved in Ontario. Around 2/3 of our energy is coming from it already.https://www.ieso.ca/power-dataNuclear is the base load, alternatives supply what they can, and hydroelectric dams and gas plants act as the variable load supply.If we can just lose the gas plants, we&#39;d be pretty close to zero carbon. And I think that achievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They looked at the price tags of these reactors vs solar and wind, and chose the lowest number, fine.  But I&#39;ve never heard of a nuclear project coming in at under multiple times its original estimate, and taking a decade or more longer than expected.    Has any new nuclear power come online anywhere since Fukushima?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a very nasty case of insomnia 7 years ago. Without going into details of my associated illness, I went 2-3 months with almost no sleep due to hypnic jerks/sleep starts. When I told people I couldn&#39;t sleep, they assumed I just had difficulty falling asleep, but I literally could not fall asleep. It is terrifying. For whatever reason, whenever I miss a significant amount of sleep (one or two nights) I get very bad sleep jerks to the point I would start to fall asleep 30+ times a night and then wake back up immediately. The only two ways past it I found was a benzo sleeping pill or alcohol and both were hit and miss (just to inhibit the jerks - I had no problem starting to actually fall asleep). Even then, my body seems to build up massive adrenaline after sleep deprivation, so I would wake up 1-2 hours later in a cold sweat and have to start all over. The more sleep I miss, the worse it gets, and after you miss several nights in a row you get VERY &#34;sleep anxious&#34;, and so the cycle continues. Once I&#39;m caught up, I&#39;m fine and the jerks disappear completely, but it takes a while. I just had another case of the jerks this year for the first time since then but I was able to get over it in about 3 weeks this time. Still, it freaked me out as I had considered myself past that and had gotten a little bit careless.The point of this long winded intro: Don&#39;t take sleep for granted. If you sleep well, cherish it. Ever since this time I keep immaculate sleep hygiene. I go to bed on time, at the same time, get daily sunlight, don&#39;t eat before bed, and 9/10 times I&#39;m asleep in minutes and sleep great. I still have occasional early wake insomnia, but for the most part sleep well.Occasionally I think about things like mentioned in this article and what the long term effects will be, but mostly I just don&#39;t worry about it. There isn&#39;t anything I can do about it at this point except try to sleep as best I can from this point forward."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like no one read the entire article, and it&#39;s partially the fault of traditional newspaper writing style for sticking the juiciest stuff up from, but the article concludes there&#39;s no consensus on what chronic sleep deprivation does to humans.&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists said that the new research should not be cause for panic. “It is possible that sleep deprivation damages rat and mouse brains, but that doesn’t mean that you should get stressed about not getting enough sleep,” said Jerome Siegel, a sleep scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who did not contribute to the review.&gt; Dr. Siegel noted that neural injury comes in degrees, and that the extent of sleep deprivation’s effect on the human brain is still largely unknown. He also expressed concern that undue worry about the long-term effects of sleep deprivation could lead people to try to sleep more, unnecessarily and with medication.The opinion of a single review paper on effects in mice is not conclusive science. So, in other words, there&#39;s no news here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With 4.0 getting more and more advanced features [0] and Unity merging with an Ad company [1], Godot is looking like it could be an attractive proposition for a lot of Unity shops.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32003065[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32081051"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I&#39;d like to use Godot, there are two features missing that I really don&#39;t think I could do without:- Asset store. I totally get it, handling payments, curating, etc. are a huge task... but man, I&#39;m a coder, and I don&#39;t have the funds to pay an artist or a musician full time. Being able to just go buy a pack of trees for $20 or something is a huge timer saver.- Animation re-targeting. It seems like there&#39;s a 3rd party plugin for this but it also seems like it hasn&#39;t been updated in a year. In unity I can buy a big pack of animations for pretty cheap and reuse it on almost all my humanoid characters. That&#39;s huge. I think this can be done in Blender or Maya, but it&#39;s so seamless in the engine compared to using a 3rd party tool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Godot for hobby projects on-and-off for a while now, and overall I vastly prefer it to Unity. The scene hierarchy of Godot is a better mental model (for me) than the GameObject/MonoBehavior ever was.That said, I have a _few_ items that I think are absolute showstoppers for solo-dev side projects.1. The asset pipeline is simply not as clean as Unity&#39;s. The ability to drop a .blend file in the project in Unity is so underrated. In Godot FBX imports are unreliable, texture imports misbehave frequently, and rigging goes wrong even in the recommended file formats. There&#39;s a lot less clarity around the path to getting real assets in game, which can be a major pain point for solo devs.2. Along the same lines, there is no equivalent of Unity&#39;s mecanim. With Unity, if you can model and rig a character in Blender, you can pull free mocap or other animations from the asset store and get to work. In Godot you&#39;re still best off authoring your own animations for each character. This drastically increases the amount of time spent making assets.3. Godot is in a weird spot version wise for anyone who wants to use C#; the beta version of 4.0 is rapidly approaching, and guarantees to break any project you start in 3.x --- but 4.0 still doesn&#39;t come built with C# support. Hopefully this gets resolved soon."</p>

Listening as a skill is very important for roles like this, and anything that can help people be a bit more conscious about this is great.A top bar icon for this could also be useful, so not to take up too my screen real estate, e.g. for example if you are giving a sales demo, you may want to hide the application, but still see visually how you are doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey there, great app.By way of feedback:* The play icon with the strike through is not meaningful to me. I recommend a popover on hover to explain what this means. You probably thought about a log of different icons but might be worth polling for a few or letting the user pick one of a few a preference (At first I thought it &#34;wasn&#39;t working&#34;)* It would be nice to be able to add meta to the session, i.e. &#34;1:1 with joseph&#34; that automatically gets timestamped for start and end. Then be able to show the graphs from a day of meetings stacked.* Analysis would be good. Being able to say how many others are in the meeting so it makes more sense when there are longer gaps.* Someone mentioned additional recommendations, that would be awesome if it had a guidance mode where I could fit a template over this thing and have it help keep the meeting on track. 5 mins introductions / waiting for quorum, 5 mins agenda, 10 mins topic 1 etc.I realize the idea for this is to be a simple private app and its great at that. If necessary, I&#39;d suggest offering something more complex that might require greater buy in privacy wise so it can do more.I&#39;d still recommend requiring zero network requests as you&#39;ve done on this version, even though the analytics might be useful.I use an network filter and manually allow connections from apps.Starting with this high level of privacy is how you get someone like me to be comfortable allowing your app to run on my machine."</p>

I worry that because it’s decided by the police and by somebody at Ring, there will be temptation to use that for increasingly less urgent situations.”Many people (I would argue anybody with common sense) predicted Ring would get used as a surveillance tool. This quote correctly states the nearly-inevitable next step, which will also be ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO the primary utility of Ring is for Amazon to surveil their delivery contractors, without a doorbell cam it’s trivial for a delivery person to set the package on the porch, photograph it as “proof of delivery”, and then walk away with said package.So the deterrent effect is good for the consumer in that it prevents theft, and good for Amazon because they can contract out to just about anyone to deliver packages, no trust required (or, “trust but verify”)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My next door neighbor (we share a wall) had their bicycles stolen twice, so they installed Ring (floodlight) cameras in both the backyard and the front porch. After a year, the cameras have yielded no added security, or caught any &#34;bad guys&#34; as far as I can tell and from what they told me.What I realized, is they use it to keep track of their kids, funny cat videos that trigger the recording, and most importantly, as a 2 way radio to talk or listen to the kids. That last point, well, I found out they can also listen to my conversations an my kids.I asked them to point their front porch camera so that it doesn&#39;t record my front driveway, just theirs. and they lost their shit. They confirmed they record audio and video. They asked if there was a problem. I said no problem with them. I&#39;m not comfortable with the audio/video recording me or my friends conversations if company comes over to talk to me on my porch or driveway.I really didn&#39;t need to tell them anything, it&#39;s self evident why someone wants a camera point away. Needless to say, after I asked them in the winter, one of them refuses to speak to me and crosses the street and avoids me.These people use surveillance to supervise their kids, and don&#39;t care about the fact that their neighbors (me) could be recorded, and they could be hacked or footage access by random people, because Amazon isn&#39;t exactly the king of privacy.I believe these cameras haven&#39;t decreased crime. They also don&#39;t really add more security. It&#39;s a shame though they are everywhere, with disregard for privacy right on people&#39;s property. So yes, I&#39;m biased. I have no love for Ring."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This period has been very special because of the 401k, which is itself part of the growth story of the corporate legal structure. I think this is coming to an end. Corporate boards and officers no longer represent the best long-term interests of the companies and shareholders they represent. It’s also a very precarious legal status as an arbitrary judicial ruling can make or break a company. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the corporate bubble is based on arbitrary tax codes that both advantage corporations and push worker savings into the stock market.Even if these conditions continue unabated, the cash flows from working class into the stock market will eventually hit equilibrium with capital extraction from the owner class. If the extractions return to the same markets, then things stay in equilibrium. They won’t, however, because the tax advantaged assets are different for them. They may seek hyper-volatility, or government bond shelters, but will generally avoid the assets on the working class tax treadmill.There are fundamentals to financial assets that have nothing to do with “number go up”, and these will ultimately dictate reality, with the caveat that “the markets will remain irrational longer than you will remain solvent”.  Rationals get wrecked too, except every once in a while when one gets lucky on their timing and makes so much money that they become a hero and we make movies about them. We cheer because it gives us hope that our intuition will serve us too. Unlikely.This is all to say that such charts are using an inductive hypothesis to predict an inherently anti-inductive phenomenon. People tithe and sacrifice to their church for a promise of rewards in the afterlife. The stonk religion is the same; well worth the price for your peace of mind. True or not, you’d be a mess without it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having all lines normalized so they start from a common point at x = 0 would be helpful. That would allow reading the total returns as percentage of the initial (1987) investment and compare them.Similarly in the drawdown chart, if it starts at 1987, it makes no sense to start the dollar at -81%. If I am looking at a chart from 1987 to 2022, I want to see how the dollar did compared to other assets in that time period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the goal is to demonstrate relative performance over time, wouldn&#39;t it be useful to use a normalization such that all lines either start at the same point (e.g. simulating investing X amount) or ending at the same point (showing requirement to get to X final amount)?"</p>

The exploit can extract kernel memory from AMD CPUs with a bandwidth of 3.9 kB per second.&gt; The researchers said that it’s capable of locating and leaking a Linux computer’s root password hash from physical memory in about 28 minutes when running the Intel CPUs and in about 6 minutes for AMD CPUs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lets have no illusions. Teams is the absolute worst I have seen for teams. Basically every other tool I tried worked better.However, Slack isn&#39;t that much better. It still gaslights Firefox users and tells them their browser is not supported. What a nice way to put it, that after friggin&#39; years, they still have not managed to implement voice chat in a standard conform way. Discord and others have had this for years! Only Slack and Teams (in browser) seem to have incapable development teams behind them, who are comfortable with gaslighting unsuspecting users into using Chromium-based browsers, furthering web mono-culture.There are so many issues with Teams, that I am wondering, what they are even working on. Surely they cannot be bugfixing all day, if so many bugs remain after years. We&#39;ve had 2-3 years of pandemic now. What the heck are they doing!? They could have made the business. Instead they shove this broken thing down our throats and time will come, when people will just run away screaming, just like they did with Skype. Another business opportunity of MS ruined by bad quality software output.Stuff like that should get banned immediately, before it can harm the web any more, than it already has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Discord is probably the only company that can make voice+chat+streaming software right.It&#39;s insane how bad Teams&#39; chat is.I don&#39;t know who was crazy enough to paste fucking formating with text,so when you copy from IDE/docs/whatever then Teams applies font sizes / colors and makes mess, so you have to copy stuff to e.g notepad and then to Teams. Additionally leaving `` block sometime doesn&#39;t work &lt;wtf&gt;Cool software doesn&#39;t do crazy shit with Clipboard and Links__________lack of Push2Talk option (not mute/unmute btn) is tragedy, did those people ever play some video games with teams/guilds?Ventrilo had this feature in probably 2003, Discord uses it too, but enterprise communicators struggle to figure this simple feature despite being so good, especially when everybody was WFH and had people in the house talking.____________On the positives side - calendar and its integrations are unparalleled and meetings are decent."</p>

Note that this technique is valid for specifying only static SSID passwords (i.e. PSK); dynamic user credentials (i.e. Enterprise/802.1x) cannot be encoded in this manner.The format of the encoded string is:  WIFI:S:&lt;SSID&gt;;T:&lt;WPA|WEP|&gt;;P:&lt;password&gt;;H:&lt;true|false|&gt;;

Special characters &#34;&#34;&#34; (quotation mark), &#34;;&#34; (semicolon), &#34;,&#34; (comma), &#34;:&#34; (colon) and &#34;\&#34; (backslash) should be escaped with a backslash (&#34;\&#34;) as in MECARD encoding.

I don&#39;t mean one of the purely no-code products, but like a literal &#34;create a new page, drag a button, then double click it to hop into the code for a new route and a new component and go straight into the onclick handler&#34;.Maybe that&#39;s harder than I can imagine, or it exists and just isn&#39;t a very good idea in practice (how would you even do responsive?) so it&#39;s not that popular.VB was a garbage language by modern standards but I always liked that they gave you a visual builder, but didn&#39;t try to hide the coding from you too much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depending on if you count it as a serious programming language, Racket has pretty much all the contract stuff. It has dedicated syntax for contracts, tight integration with the module system, and contract-random-generate attempts to generate a value satisfying a contract so writing an auto fuzzer wouldn&#39;t be too hard. In fact, I think Racket&#39;s system predates Clojure since there was the 2002 paper &#34;Contracts for Higher-Order Functions&#34; discussing it and Clojure first appeared in 2007.The only reason I would ever use Clojure instead of Racket would be if I needed to work with the JVM ecosystem or the browser via Clojurescript (which are compelling reasons).Totally agree about a good calculator language."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sounds like the same anti competitive behavior that MS was punished for two decades ago. Making it a requirement to only boot software approved by them excludes a whole range of competitors from using the same hardware. Making that a condition for OEMs to even get a license is the problem here.Lenovo is otherwise known for supporting Linux on their laptops. And yes I know you can jump through hoops and fiddle with scary (for ordinary users) bios options to &#34;fix&#34; this. The point is that you shouldn&#39;t have to and this is a bit too convenient for MS to keep competitors off laptops.Basically, what is needed here is a neutral certificate authority not controlled by a single company with a reasonable process for independent operating systems to get a certificate.I recently ran into this trying to boot linux on my old imac. Ubuntu actually works but forget about arch, manjaro, and a whole lot of other distributions. Imacs have no off-switch for secure boot that I know off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HP should open OS/8 and RT-11, the two big influences on CP/M.  OS/8 is kind of remarkable, running on a system arguably less powerful than the first 8-bit home computers (I would say they are closer to PIC microcontrollers, but with more RAM):https://www.pdp8online.com/os/os8/index.shtmlPDP-8 memory is heavily paged.  There are 128 word pages- direct addresses can only reach within the current page, and literals (immediate data including addresses to other pages) have to be allocated out of this current page along with the instructions.  Second, there are 4K-word fields.  So you need to use far jumps and returns to access outside the current field.  This is just like PIC microcontroller pages.OS/8 reserved only two pages for itself.  Things like the command interpreter were swapped out to disk or DECTape.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECtapeIf the application needed device drivers, it got to choose which pages the drivers would occupy- meaning the device drivers had to be written as position independent code.  Also I think each driver was limited to two pages.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In high school in 1980 we had Commodore PETs. They had no tangible OS, just a BASIC interpreter in ROM. There was an easter egg that made it say Microsoft or wasn&#39;t it spelled MicroSoft? Either way a company nobody had ever heard of.CP/M had the aura of being something for real pros. Read some journal articles and it looked really complicated. But without suitable hardware I had never any chance to touch it.In 1983 I went to university where beginner courses happened on VAX/VMS and my definition of &#34;pro&#34; got shifted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember, when I was a kid, having a CP/M diskette for the Amstrad CPC. It was provided with the machine. Every now and then I would try it out, not really understanding what it was about.Years later I learned, reading about it, that it was some sort of &#34;professional&#34; OS on which productivity software would be used.Does anyone actually used that OS on CPC or any other 8bits machine of the 80s to do anything remotely useful? Genuinely interested."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the professional (or former professional) astronomers among us, I will make my somewhat amused observation that what people are most paying attention to is not really the distinguishing features of JWST.People seem most impressed by the apparent increase in resolution of the images, which is not from a certain point of view the hardest thing to do .  HST might have done that if its instruments had been of different pixel size or imaging array size / focal length.   Ok, the much larger mirror is an achievement.   But anyway, the resolution of the images is often not what really is the limiting factor for photometric observations.  Yes it is sharper/higher resolution, but that wasn&#39;t the key selling point.The new thing is observations in the IR, which is somewhat a technical footnote in many gushing announcements of these images (or some discussion here too).   And the general public knows little about that detail&#39;s importance, especially since the images are stylized / colored anyway to look just like RGB images that we are so familiar with.   But everyone can easily appreciate a sharper image.Anyway, still a momentous achievement.  And thank god we have a scientific field where stunning images was enough to get the public to support a $10B project.**Edit to add: I did not mean to detract from or diminish anyone&#39;s appreciation of the images and accomplishment at whatever level they are enjoyed.   And of course many here are technically knowledgeable about the IR aspect.   I just write to point out that for the most headline-grabbing images and newspaper writers, the sharpness of the images over the actual IR frontier is what grabs the attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a backyard telescope versus Webb: https://twitter.com/AJamesMcCarthy/status/154694183270093209...More comparisons on Twitter, some zoomed in:- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546899241880240128- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546900387931766784- https://twitter.com/JBWillcox/status/1546881033597075457- https://twitter.com/jason4short/status/1546626672488632321I&#39;m not a physicist, so I&#39;ve only recently learned about redshift. Hubble&#39;s deep field images were very dark red/orange because further objects appear redder (into infrared) before they disappear to the observer. Webb&#39;s sensors are more red/infrared-sensitive than Hubble&#39;s, so along with extremely fine, super-cooled optics using exotic materials to align and capture every single photon, its red sensitivity allows Webb to peer deeper, further, and dimmer than we&#39;ve ever been able to before.And I&#39;ve read that the &#34;spikes&#34; coming off the brighter stars are generally from stars in our own galaxy and they&#39;re not lens flares. They&#39;re caused by the edges of the telescope. Hubble&#39;s stars would have 4 spikes in a cross; Webb has 6 in a snowflake because of the shape of Webb&#39;s mirrors having 6 sides. Or something like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Question for anyone who happens to be an expert: Is there any way to quantify how much better Webb is independently of the amount of time used to take the exposures? Like, could Hubble achieve the same quality of images as Webb if it was given 100x (or whatever) more time exposure?I&#39;m trying to understand how much the improvement is &#34;speed of convergence&#34; vs. &#34;quality of asymptotic result&#34;. (Though... is that even a valid way of trying to understand things?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching the livestream i was more than surprised, that color correction actually happens in Photoshop.Also, there seem to be multiple layer-masks involved for specific regions and objects.I get that you can shift and composite color, based on hue, apply filters etc, but: Photoshop?Curious if anyone can explain, that what we see is actual science or some touched up version of objects in our universe.p.s.: What struck me the most is the absence of noise, especially for the deep field photo. Hubble took many exposures over weeks, which normally would allow for reliable reduction of noise, webb took some shots over the course of hours and there’s hardly any noise to see. Weirdest part is seeing them just “healing brushing” away some dots - how is the decision process on altering images like that?(edit for typos)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the NASA stream online was a disaster. Choppy video and it seemed like nobody had prepared anything. Also 720p in 2022...Don&#39;t get me wrong, the images are amazing, but when small startups like Rocket Lab can have uninterrupted streams all the way to the orbit, but NASA stream from a studio looks more amateurish than your average 13-year-old Fortnite player on Twitch, it leaves a pretty bad impression."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Meta - I am honestly surprised, and sightly appalled at the general attitude in these comments (and also in yesterday&#39;s thread).Uber has essentially not just broken laws, but outright exploited workers/drivers... and people comment &#34;Aah but the local taxi mafia was bad&#34;...??!? I&#39;m sorry but that does not justify exploiting workers. That does not justify using political influence to enter/gain markets. This isn&#39;t some messiah coming to save us all from the &#34;horridness of local transport&#34;.I&#39;m not saying that having Uber as a player is necessarily bad, mind you. But it&#39;s possible to have some positive benefits for some people while hurting a lot of others. I sincerely doubt too many HN users have driven taxis, but my conversations with Uber/regular taxi drivers hardly painted a favorable picture of Uber. (Nuance - please note that my taxi drivers doesn&#39;t represent all drivers. There will be happy and sad drivers, my point being it&#39;s not always sunshine and rainbows... which the article speaks about too.)I wonder if this being a YC owned communication platform affects/biases users (some of whom I&#39;m sure are YC founders etc themselves), however the ratio of apathy/&#34;taxis were already bad&#34; to &#34;Uber shouldn&#39;t exploit workers, nothing justifies it&#34; is disappointingly low.(I know this is a particularly ranty comment and I had kept quiet on the last thread but seeing the same type of comments here pushed me.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personnal experience.
I come back from a trip in romania - bucharest.
At first I didn&#39;t take Uber but tried for the regular Taxi from the airport.
All of them requesting ~40USD.
At the end I go with one who put the meter and indeed arrived to 200 Lei (~40 USD). I payed in euro because I didn&#39;t have enough local currency, hopefully I had some and the driver accept.Taking some information it&#39;s way too much, but would I have argue with how the meter was operating anyway?Now, I need to comeback to the airport at 4am.So instead, I reserve a airport transfer from the airline itself, pay in advance something like 30 USD this time.And... no one show up at 4am. Mobile phone of the transfer is not answering... I never heard of them *So I install Uber, hopefully it&#39;s working, enter my visa (from my country, no need for local currency at all), after 10 minutes, someone very nice take me and I just paid like 15 USD to get to the airport, at 5 in the morning, with the invoice by mail.How do you compete with that? Taxi business need to reflect. And every country is the same strangely, it&#39;s as universal than taxes: you can&#39;t escape!* Edit: In fact I know what happened, and there is nothing to do, because I looked at the invoice and on the third page of the voucher PDF there, it&#39;s said that I needed to call 24h before to confirm the transfer... They don&#39;t call, you have to call. Even after the first confirmation I already did for confirming the pickup address some days before, I wasn&#39;t feeling paranoid enough. So you can&#39;t say nothing because I didn&#39;t read the last page, but it&#39;s a dumb heavy process, do people changes their mind and decide to live forever in the country frequently?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shocking stuff like this, weaponising drivers against city governments to do Uber&#39;s bidding to lobby:&gt; MacGann insists that Uber drivers were seen by some at the company as pawns who could be used to put pressure on governments. “And if that meant Uber drivers going on strike, Uber drivers doing a demo in the streets, Uber drivers blocking Barcelona, blocking Berlin, blocking Paris, then that was the way to go,” he said. “In a sense, it was considered beneficial to weaponise Uber drivers in this way.”&gt; The files show MacGann’s fingerprints on this strategy, too. In one email, he praised staffers in Amsterdam who leaked stories to the press about attacks on drivers to “keep the violence narrative” and pressure the Dutch government.Uber was weaponising their workers (while fighting as hard as possible to not call them workers and pay for workers&#39; benefits) against local governments, they were behaving like a tech-mafia, a mob with sprawling power across the globe.What the actual fuck?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the interesting aspects of giving a shit is that it will lead sometimes to you doing things which are not in your short-term selfish narrowly-defined &#34;best interest&#34; but because you give a shit you&#39;ll do it anyway.  Some of these lead to long-term value that is very significant but you can&#39;t know at the time.I was once asked by a client (bank) to take a call with one of _their_ clients (a pretty important hedge fund). I did this as a courtesy even though I thought our product wasn&#39;t appropriate for the hedge fund.  Anyhow I get on the call and it&#39;s the COO, the Chief Investment Officer, the CTO and a couple of other _very_ important people at this big fund. (ie a much more senior call than I really expected).  Anyway, because I give a shit, I told them our product wouldn&#39;t really be right for them and explained why.  They thanked me and I heard nothing more of it.Until a couple of years later where I offered a job out of the blue because one of the people on the call had been impressed by how I had dealt with it, and by pure coincidence his partner was a recruiter who was tasked with headhunting for a CTO role and he said &#34;hey you should check this guy out&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone saying it doesn&#39;t scale is missing the point.Scaling is a winner-take-all, venture capital mindset. The article is about service businesses, which do not need to hit web scale! We are talking about services here not your web startup.Even beyond services, giving a shit and building saas is not impossible. In fact, I wish more tech companies started small and stayed small. I absolutely want to run a digital small business and I want to give a shit, it makes the building feel purposeful instead of this product-led growth at all costs bullshit.I hope we see a software middle class grow in the next decade. Middle class tech companies are going to be coming from the bootstrapper + founder focused funds (TinySeed / Calm) and they are going to have a distinct advantage if they understand their strategy/context in their chosen verticals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Are you saying I can outsource my shit-giving activities?Sign me up. I&#39;ve been unable to give a shit for quite some time. I wish I could give a shit, but the world has become a pretty ugly place, in large part because of deliberate attempts to demoralize those who give a shit.You see it all over the place on social media. People do a weak-ass form of shit-giving in the form of &#34;raising awareness&#34;, the least conceivable level of effort for something you wish you could give a shit about, but don&#39;t actually give a shit.Of course even if somebody tried to GaSaaS, the space would promptly fill with people giving as few shits as possible for as much money as possible. Too many major charities do that: they&#39;ll take your money and spend it mostly on advertising for other people to give their money, too, and very little on the things you&#39;d expect if they actually gave a shit.I know TFA is more about the business sense of giving a shit, but I&#39;d love to see somebody able to give a shit in a larger sense. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t give a shit because it seems nobody gives a shit any more -- except the people who are passionately devoted to making sure other people feel miserable instead."</p>

Worse, we&#39;ll cemenent the current duopoly of browser engines, because we&#39;ll make it (again) so complex that no-one can create an alternative.We shouldn&#39;t have GC, Exceptions or Tail calls in WASM, as long as the compiler can provide them.What we should have is multi memory support and memory read permissions, because without them WASM lacks basic security primitives.[1]Reference types maybe.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;As an experiment, I went through a list of holiday weekend sales, and opened all the sites. They all — all, 100% — interrupted my attempt to give them some money.&#34;This is a good touchstone to use for &#34;you&#39;ve overoptimized your site, tone it back&#34;. I am also taken aback every time I&#39;m on a site, I&#39;ve got something in my shopping cart, I&#39;m headed for the &#34;check out&#34; button, or I&#39;m even on the checkout page, and some stupid interstitial pops up. Dude, I&#39;m trying to enter my credit card information! Back off! Especially stupid for a &#34;sign up for our newsletter&#34; popup; we all know that unclicking the &#34;yes, we can email you every 17 seconds from now until the heat death of the universe with valuable offers from &#39;our affiliates&#39; which we define as &#39;anyone we share a species with&#39;!&#34; box on the checkout form is mandatory, and if we don&#39;t see it immediately we&#39;d best go hunting for it. You&#39;ve already default populating the checkbox to &#34;yes&#34; on this very screen, get out of the way!Less unbelievably stupid, but related, is when I&#39;m examining product X and just after I scroll down a bit to read more you pop up something related to... well... anything other than product X! I&#39;m signalling interest in product X as hard as I can, and you&#39;ve AB tested that this is a great time to jangle your keys over there instead? Your AB testing is stupid and can&#39;t possibly fail to be some stupid statistical fluke or other terrible error. What fisherman goes out on his boat, hooks a fish, and then rushes to throw another completely different lure out to the hooked fish and get them on that hook instead?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve talked about this on HN but I&#39;ll say it again.A couple years ago, after being an Android fan for the better part of a decade, I finally bought myself an iPhone and pried myself away from Google&#39;s ecosystem wherever I could. And Apple didn&#39;t even need to do any work for me to make this decision. It was the years of abuse from Google that you experience when you decide to use a Google product or service. And a big part of that was the constant A/B/C/D/E/F testing. I never felt like I was using a complete product, everything felt like a constant beta that could be changed or rearranged at any point, and I was just doing free testing work for them while they harvest all my data.Every app update was a risk of the app rearranging itself, or features appearing/disappearing. Eventually it didn&#39;t even come from app updates in the Play Store, and new interfaces would just appear one day when a server somewhere marked your account as being in the group that gets the new UI. This app that you were familiar with could at any point be rearranged when you open it on any given day. Then maybe a week later you open it and it&#39;s back to how it was before. A button you thought was here suddenly isn&#39;t, and you question whether something actually changed or if you&#39;re losing your mind. It&#39;s a subtle gaslighting that eventually I couldn&#39;t stand any more.To me, A/B testing means you don&#39;t respect your users. You see them as just one factor in your money machine that can be poked and prodded to optimize how much money you can squeeze out of them. That&#39;s not to say a company like Apple is creating products out of the goodness of their heart, but at least it feels like it was developed by humans who made an opinionated call as to what they thought was the right design decision, and what they would want to use. And in my 2 years of owning an iPhone, I&#39;ve never opened my reminders app to find out that it&#39;s completely unrecognizable, or my messages app has been renamed or rethemed for the umpteenth time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with AB testing is that it&#39;s a short-term strategy. For example, if a news site runs AB testing with headlines, they&#39;ll find that bullshit clickbait headlines get more pageviews than concise, accurate headlines, but the constant use of clickbait headlines will over time destroy overall traffic to your site. More frustratingly, sites run by smart people tend to fall into a balance where the worst articles get the most alluring headlines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I really don&#39;t understand about this shitcoins is the scale of it. When I read this story I basically thought &#34;ok, but you&#39;re going to spend a load of money pumping but there&#39;s no way there&#39;s liquidity for you to actually perform your dump&#34;. But if you look up DOCK today you&#39;ll see its market cap is $14m and it&#39;s daily traded volume is $1.5m. I would get it that you could move some of these coins using a few bill boards and some sponsored ad reads if they were tiny volume traded, but the implication of this is that millions of dollars are moving back and forth every day on a coin that has absolutely nothing going for it. Who is doing that? There can&#39;t possibly be retail moving in and out of this stuff. Really I kind of assume this all has to be wash trading right?"</p>

So cool!After an image loads, you can resize your browser text (Ctrl + / Ctrl -) to instantly reveal a different image with each resize event. By sweeping through very small and very large zoom levels, you can make peoples&#39; fingers trace out a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right as the registered point moves with the underlying voronoi canvas as it scales up and down.Side note: how hard would it be to reduce the time delay between identifying a point and displaying an image? Could this be made realtime by preloading all images? The flicker would be terrible but I&#39;d want to try it at least briefly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not a historic low, but a definitive low. There are several reasons for this.- in time of a crisis, the world seems to ralley around the dollar, as it is backed by the strongest economy and the strongest military.- this crisis has hit Europe hard, as it is not only close to the war, but of course, too dependant on Russian oil and especially gas.- there was a lot of inflation internationally, the US federal bank was the first to raise interest to combat inflation. The EU lags behind and is limited in action due to the fear of destabilizing some of its member countries with too high of a debt.Consequently, there is a lot of good reason for the Euro to be weak at these times. However, if the energy crisis can be solved and the war contained, a weak Euro also is also pushing exports from the EU. So there is a lot of reason for this trend to be stopped, if not reversed, until the other extreme is reached again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bad for Europe because our salaries (before tax) have already been lower than US salaries. Additionally we pay much more taxes than you guys on salaries (up to 50%) and on VAT (~20%).Means at the moment until salaries get inflation adjusted that we pay a premium price for everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PepsiCo Inc (PEP, Nasdaq) isn&#39;t merely a beverage company - as explained in this strategy document - it is a space company. The Pepsi Universe, with respect to its 8 light year characteristic length, reflects the scale of the total addressable market (TAM) that PepsiCo can expand into.Noted short-seller and equity valuation skeptic Jim Chanos once described the TAM of space companies as infinite, because space itself is infinite. This pessimistic take anchors our low-end fair value estimate of PEP to $infinity / share. Since PEP currently trades at around $170 / share, we believe there is considerable upside to the long term buy and hold investor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can someone explain why this won&#39;t result in a renaissance for peer to peer and e2e encrypted chat/forums/social media etc.? When government or industry makes it nearly impossible for consumer needs to be met we inevitably see a grey and black market spring up to meet those needs. My prediction is that if legislation like this becomes widespread we&#39;ll see a freely distributed application rise to prominence among a gaggle of others, it&#39;ll dominate the chat and social market until even grandma is using it and the establishment will have a right proper freak out as other social media giants implode and everyone is communicating anything they want with zero oversight from the government or industry. This is roughly how I remember the Napster affair going when DRM was pushed hard by the recording industry, it eventually collapsed but not before dealing a massive blow to the status quo and forcing a transition to streaming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If UK government really cared about children, and not about surveillance and censorship, they would solve the problem another way.The only way protect children online is to ban them from Internet. Children should not have access to normal laptops and smartphones, instead they should use &#34;kid phones&#34;. Such phones would allow children to communicate only with people approved by parents or teachers and visit only approved sites. This way they will enjoy perfect safety which this Bill fails to provide.Every site which wants to become approved, must fulfill all the requirements from the Bill and indicate this with a HTTP header. Kid phones and laptops should allow only to visit such compliant sites.Kid-oriented phones and laptops must be visually distinctive: for example, have a shape of a cute animal. In this case teachers, parents or police will be able to instantly spot and confiscate illegal devices.This is a win-win plan: kids would be safe and adults would be safe from government overreach. Obviously no government will agree to such plan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With respect to the politicians not turning up, it&#39;s worth noting that at least some of the candidates for PM are against the Online Safety Bill and want to scrap it. So for them, campaigning to become the next leader may actually be a more useful way to spend time than hearing what they already know.It appears the OSB has become a victim of incoherent requirements specifications. It&#39;s grown enormously during its gestation period and is now trying to do way too much, including things that are self-contradictory. Some politicians recognize this, for example Kemi Badenoch:https://order-order.com/2022/07/11/watch-badenoch-slams-onli...but I recall others saying similar things. I just can&#39;t find the references right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This comment is from the perspective of a Calibre power-user, and someone who has been involved with the software for years now.I must admit, I&#39;m slightly shocked at some of the comments here. Kovid puts in an extraordinary amount of work (nearly 80 hours a week) into Calibre - of which most is for free, in the name of open source software. Anyone who has spent a decent amount of time on the mobileread forums will also know him as a remarkably intelligent, dedicated, and all-round fantastic guy. He&#39;s very patient and kind with beginners, responsive to feedback, and rarely loses his cool with anyone. His only &#39;crime&#39; was being blunt with a bug report around eleven years ago, and I&#39;m struggling to see why people are so myopic as to turn that into their entire perception of him. Add to the fact that he eventually fixed every bug in that thread as well as second-language difficulties that he likely experiences, and the vitriol that people have for him is undeserved.The proof of the pudding is Calibre itself, which is a joy to use. It is hands down one of the most useful programs on my computer. It&#39;s rarely buggy, fast, logical to use, very feature-rich, and rather customisable. I&#39;m perplexed as to whether some of the people in this thread and I are using the same software. It&#39;s very easy to set up, as all you do is either point to a pre-existing library of files or create a new one. Adding books is trivial, as is editing metadata, and the reader itself is splendid. That&#39;s really what most people need out of e-book software, but Calibre really does go above and beyond any e-book software on the market right now. The only close competitor is Foliate, which is not cross-platform like Calibre, and even then it simply lacks many useful features that I rely on with Calibre, despite having a much cleaner UI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kovid Goyal, the developer of Calibre, is a very responsive, very gentle person. Whenever I needed help, I have gotten help from him. [1] - Calibre is an indispensable tool for me to manage my digital library with close to 800 books.I support him regularly. Consinder doing it as well if you appreciate the app. Go to https://calibre-ebook.com/ , there’s a support link on the top right.[1] This is the forum dedicated to Calibre

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Calibre does its job so well it&#39;s downright essential for anyone thinking about dealing with ebooks. Glad to hear that full text search is added in this version, using it with a bunch of reference books saved will be so useful. It might be worth splitting out the fiction books I have to clean up the results. Maybe it works with tag filtering, I&#39;ll have to check."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great! Gcc support opens up more platforms, more targets, and the opportunity to more easily integrate with the various common embedded toolchains that are built around gcc.And it&#39;s free software, for those that care, this matters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have mixed feelings about the idea of a GCC frontend for Rust.On one hand, having frontend diversity for a language helps bring new people into the language; think of the groups who can&#39;t use Rust because it doesn&#39;t support certain targets or can&#39;t integrate with their existing toolchain. There is a lot of talent that could be brought into Rust just by virtue of them being able to be included and the less barriers of entry, the better.But on the other hand, I don&#39;t want to have to think of implementation specific behaviors, bugs, quirks, et cetera. Having an ecosystem built with thousands of people wrestling with that problem seems like a recipe for buggy software and burnout. People say that a spec would help with this aspect but I&#39;m sceptical; a spec doesn&#39;t prevent divergence from happening, it just gives you a frame of reference for what is correct. You also don&#39;t need multiple implementations to have a spec either!I fear that the way this is going to pan out is that we&#39;ll have multiple frontends for Rust, but the vast majority of engineers using the language will only ever think about &#34;true&#34; Rust: the current mainstream implementation. Issues in crates that primarily affect &#34;alternative&#34; Rusts will go unacknowledged, be tossed out, or have hacky patch jobs. We&#39;ll end up with either a) two separate, but high quality, ecosystems or b) one shared, lower quality ecosystem that is constantly fighting itself. I hold Rust in really high regard and it&#39;s my favorite language at the moment, so this thought is scary to me.Though, there are a lot of smart people involved so maybe it doesn&#39;t have to be so doom and gloom. A couple of years ago I thought that cross-platform software was really messy and hard to get right but languages like Rust have the proper language features to make things like this much easier (though not perfect!). It could be that the emergence of multiple frontends could necessitate features and tooling for the Rust itself which makes all of that I said a non-issue. Maybe. Hopefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am the author of this feature.  The background here is that the SQL standard was ambiguous about which of the two ways an implementation should behave.  So in the upcoming SQL:202x, this was addressed by making the behavior implementation-defined and adding this NULLS [NOT] DISTINCT option to pick the other behavior.Personally, I think that the existing PostgreSQL behavior (NULLS DISTINCT) is the &#34;right&#34; one, and the other option was mainly intended for compatibility with other SQL implementations.  But I&#39;m glad that people are also finding other uses for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great! I have multiple places in our code where I&#39;ve had to define multiple unique indexes (with conditionals) to get around this. It&#39;s definitely confusing behaviour the first time you encounter it.Honestly I think SQL already breaks it&#39;s own standard of &#34;NULL = unknown&#34;. One example: If you do a LEFT OUTER JOIN and the joined data is missing, you get NULL in the resultset. But in that case, it&#39;s not &#34;unknown&#34; whether there are records that can be joined to, the answer is that there are definitively no records there.NULL is univerally considered by most programming languages to equal &#34;not present&#34; vs &#34;unknown&#34;, and in many cases by SQL in practice. The ship has probably sailed on actually changing the default behaviour, but optional flags like these are a good step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is amazing. We moved from Oracle to Postgres after being on Oracle for 15+ years. That was a huge move that took 2 years. One of the biggest hurdles was rewriting thousands of sql queries. One of the biggest things we had to change was accounting for how oracle handled nulls versus how Postgres handled nulls. However, we missed this nuance about how Postgres treated nulls and unique. It wasn’t until about 2 years into using Postgres, and running into so many issues, that we finally stumbled upon this nuance in the documentation. Crap. That required making a bunch of more changes to account for this. At this point I’m firmly convinced that null handling is the hardest part of database work ;-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Per the article this came in response to questions raised by a Columbia faculty member critiquing the university&#39;s data. I thought that report[1] was actually more interesting than the original article.As per the quote at the top of the report:&gt; Rankings create powerful incentives to manipulate data and distort institutional behavior for the sole or primary purpose of inflating one’s score...It would be shocking to me if Columbia was the only institution that fudged its numbers a bit in pursuit of a higher US News ranking. Given how important that ranking has become in US culture, I wonder if it&#39;s time for the methodology to change to require audited/auditable metrics rather than continuing to allow self-reporting.1: http://www.math.columbia.edu/~thaddeus/ranking/investigation..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For context, U.S. News and World Report used to be a trusted periodical that reported national and international news. In the 80&#39;s they started ranking colleges and selling it as a separate publication, which turned out to be pretty profitable, so they repeated the trick by ranking hospitals (1990), cars (2007), and then states (2017). The news business went online only in 2011, then shuttered in 2015. Since then they&#39;ve just been a rankings company, but they kept the name to trade on their reputation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You are describing the hedonic treadmill. Essentially, you become used to your surroundings, and while they are objectively great, from the perspective of inside your own head, this is now normal and you / your monkey mind wants more.There have been a lot of post floating around the internet with various solutions, the most popular being Stoicism &gt; Positive Psychology / Happiness research &gt; Buddhism / Meditation. I&#39;ve dabbled a little in all of them and they all have something to offer.Essentially, you are experiencing a disconnect between how it feels to be you and how you expected to feel. As someone only a little older than yourself, I would say this: your job will never love you back, and especially in the software realm, it may not be as fulfilling as something like woodworking or therapy. It does pay the bills, though.The above mentioned happiness research / positive psychology suggests that having multiple, meaningful social roles that you can fulfill outside of work will allow you to shoulder more responsibility and find meaning in your life.What I&#39;m trying say is that in the second half of life, it is our job to give back. So start there.Also, this is in my morning bookmarks to revisit:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some advice from someone a bit further down the career path:* If you want to try something, try it! Save up some runway, do your own thing. Try some other projects right now, don&#39;t wait. (You won&#39;t be able to devote full time effort to them, but can still make progress.) You may find that what you dream about isn&#39;t all that, or maybe it is. Either way you can take steps forward.* I learned to be happy with my life after I&#39;d taken a few alternative paths. Nothing like jumping to a situation, realizing it wasn&#39;t what you thought it was, and then jumping to a different situation, then realizing it wasn&#39;t all that great, then jumping to a different situation... After I did this a few times, I learned that I needed to create happiness where I was, not try to find it elsewhere. YMMV.* It is a cliche, but kids are only young once. Enjoy that time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was there 5 years ago. My psychology was getting worse by the month as everything I did seemed more and more futile.I quit my job, travelled to some bucket list destinations like Japan, Fiji, Galapagos, machu piccu, then went on a 5 month backpacking trip across both islands of New Zealand with my (ridiculously) supportive wife. I immersed myself the whole time in zen philosophy and tried to lose my egocentric placement in the universe.It was a great reset for my depression, but did nothing to erase the fundamental feeling that all of reality and my actions within it are pointless.For the first year I took my passion projects seriously, devoting almost a full work week of attention to them. At a certain point, I stopped those too. I realized I was merely creating my own flavor of the distractions I&#39;d tired of.Now the only things that bring me real joy are improving my home environment, the health of my family, and getting out in the sun and playing sports. That kind of &#34;out there, just around the corner&#34; abstract life satisfaction I was chasing seem as ridiculous to me now as participating in US politics. It is all ephemeral."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being the same vintage as Jim, much of this brought back memories.There really wasn&#39;t any such thing as a tech stack - our company would produce software for various Unixen and, especially, Vax, and the language was alway C, with some Pascal on the Vax side (as, I was told, the Vax Pascal compiler produced far more optimal code than the C compiler).Being a software engineer was like being a furniture-maker. You had to master a small number of tools - the saw, the chisel - and then craftsmanship consisted of discovering an affinity with these tools and a love of getting ever more skilled at using them. This path wasn&#39;t for everyone, which was fine - plenty of management and other non-tech roles for those folks - but if you grooved with your tools it was a real joy to be able to move from chair- to table- to cabinet-making and carry and refine your skills as you went.This idyll could not last, however. Before too long it became uneconomical to make furniture this way, so for your chair making project you instead had to learn how to run a chair-making machine. When you moved onto a tables project, the machines there were infuriatingly dissimilar to the chair-making ones you&#39;d just mastered. Worse still, moving back to chair-making after a year or two, you discover that the old machines you knew are now obsolete and you have to re-learn how to run their replacements. This stops being fun, or interesting, after a while, and yet sadly it&#39;s all that most younger software engineers know.Occasionally, there is the need to make some shim or gizmo that the machines don&#39;t cover, so out come the trusty saw and chisel of yore - much to the amazement of the young&#39;uns, who are astonished that an old-timer can still wield these antiques so effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thing I hear from a lot of software engineers from the time-frame of 1980-2000 is how much software engineering - to engineers at least - was about the craft. It was all about the craft of making good software. People invested real energy into trying to do it right, and treated it as such. This is of course likely colored by experience and &#34;rose tinted&#34; glasses, however, I think we as an industry have let this go, especially since the rise of bootcamps. It just isn&#39;t about the craft anymore, its all about &#34;hustle&#34;. There is some truth to the fact that engineering in this time there was more caring about it as a craft, caring about performance, caring about shipping quality etc.I like thinking about things as a craft, I don&#39;t always like the &#34;hustle&#34; aspect that is pervasive now, it guarantees shipping too early and never taking quality &amp; craftsmanship seriously, I feel like.I want to work somewhere again that sees engineering software as a craft again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Even if we did see then (and we mostly didn’t) that small, frequent releases were better in a whole bunch of ways, we couldn’t really do it. It was expensive to ship on physical media, and disruptive to our customers to have to do frequent installs.It&#39;s still disruptive to customers. As a software engineer I love CD/CI. It makes the entire process much smoother and more efficient.As a customer / end-user, though? Nope. I absolutely hate it. Maybe I&#39;m just getting old but I&#39;m extremely nostalgic for the days where I got to decide if I the upgrade was worth it to me or not. These days things will change and move you on without any notice or opt-in what-so-ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This area of finance is utterly, completely backwards and seems like one of the most (evil)successful bits of proper-burden reversal in existence. The entire concept of &#34;identity theft&#34; as it exists now is 100% pure industry propaganda. Nobody is cloning bodies and transplanting brains or something. It&#39;s not that anyone is &#34;stealing my identity&#34; it&#39;s the financial institutions don&#39;t bother to verify it and then somehow have managed to make a system where this is my problem. If I haven&#39;t chosen to have a business relationship with a given financial institution or credit bureau, and they choose to give somebody else financial services, it shouldn&#39;t matter if that person used my name or widely circulated information about me, anything less then full biometrics/video for signup and establishing mutual certificates and cryptographically signed interactions thereafter should be presumptively invalid. If Person M lies to a Bank A about their info claiming to be Person A and tries to escape their commitments sure they&#39;ve committed fraud, but if the Bank A then tries to go after Person A then the bank are literally accessories to fraud and should face criminal prosecution or at the least massive financial penalties (with both expenses and punitive fines paid to Person A). If the banks want to have private credit bureaus to help them with scaling, abstracting and reducing bias in the risk aspect sure; there are reasonable arguments for that. But said credit bureaus should have no role in identity verification, and if they are lying about people (claiming financial things about them which are not true) that again should be on them, with serious statutory penalties.All the burdens are completely backwards, in turn massively perverting the incentives. And it&#39;s eternally infuriating. Some rando applying for a credit line on the opposite side of the country should be Not My Problem, 100% of the time, whether they have my name or address or a random symmetric 9 digit number some government assigned me. All the tools exist for financial institutions to manage their risk/convenience tradeoff, but they&#39;re the ones who have the power, information and should have the incentive to do so. They are externalizing onto the general public instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s shocking to me that this type of email change swapping still works. I might have to write up a blog post explaining how to fix it permanently.It&#39;s a fairly simple process though.1. Create a table that tracks every email address change on the account. It can&#39;t just be a single field because once compromised, people have learned to just change the email address twice.2. That table should contain fields for: user_id, email_from, email_to, confirm_key, reversal_key, created_at, confirmed_at, reversed_at, created_ip, confirmed_ip, reversed_ip3. When an email change is initiated, an email should be sent to the new email address with the confirmation_key to have them verify the new email address before making the change.4. Once verified, an email should be sent to the OLD email address notifying them of the change and including a link to the reversal_key to use if they did not make this switch, including the IP address and approximate geolocation of the IP address for some context.5. If the user clicks the reversal link it will clear the confirmation and reversal links of every email change that came after the link that was clicked,  ensuring that the original change can always be reversed no matter how many changes were made afterwards, revert the email address change and force the user to update the password. This password change screen should warn them that their account was likely compromised and strongly recommend they enable MFA (if available on the site) to prevent it from happening again.I spent a year working on a site that dealt with a TON of fraud and phishing against the user base. This was one of the biggest issues that we dealt with, but this approach completely resolved the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Moderately tangential, but I just had my Uber account hacked today. I also used a strong, unique password managed by a password manager. As far as I can tell, my email wasn’t hacked (Google Workspace account backed by a physical security key). My best guess is they scammed support, but I am just taking a stab in the dark.The worst part is, you can’t even talk to Uber support chat unless you put in the account’s current email, phone number, and last 6 digits of the credit card on the account. I have the attacker’s email address, but not the phone number, so I couldn’t even chat with support. They have an “email support” form, but it asks for the same info. I put in what I knew, but I haven’t heard back from support since the attacker took my account this afternoon, and I fear I’m not going to get it back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What annoys me about this the most is the message from Steam, that sort of plays along with this.&#34;This game is no longer available for sale on Steam&#34;. No big deal, right.Ok, fine, but it doesn&#39;t imply the servers going down and the title becoming unplayable...Then 2nd message:&#34;Please note this title won&#39;t be accessible from &lt;date&gt;...&#34;Once again, accessible doesn&#39;t imply &#34;the game won&#39;t start, thanks for the monies&#34;.It&#39;s a bloody shame that I can start any games from the 90s on an emulator and they run just as fine, even content heavy. While these titles are completely riddled with DRM and screw you over after X years.Publishers need to come clean, and after years of milking the cow, they must have a plan allowing paying customers to play the title they&#39;ve been enjoying all these years. Otherwise, they should be forced to include the verbiage at release date &#34;This title will stop working as of &lt;date in the future&gt;&#34;.This kind of nonsense only promotes cracked games."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Still a million times better than what it replaced. About 20 years ago I was working with the Australian taxi cab industry. The hq of the regulatory authority shared the address of the main payment system. The regulatory authority was made up of representatives of each taxi cab company that each had one vote. There was one taxi company (the one that controlled the payment system allowed) with 200+ subsidiaries that made up that organization. If anyone tried to get into the taxi industry they&#39;d use their 200 votes to say they are not allowed by regulations. This was a company making 2billion a year in one state of Australia alone (NSW). It was so incredibly fucking corrupt and i am thankful to Uber Lyft and all the other incumbents for managing to get their foot in. It required dirty dealing to get past this corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Uber isn&#39;t the most ethical company for sure but here in Brussels the taxi industry is pretty shady as well.Getting a taxi license costs an exorbitant amount of money and it&#39;s done through all kinds of dodgy deals.There&#39;s 1-2 companies that have a monopoly on the whole industry.There&#39;s weird rules about which types of taxis can &#34;serve&#34; the airport, akin to what mobsters are responsible for collecting trash in what areas.You&#39;ll often get &#34;sorry the payment terminal is out of order, cash only&#34; BS.A study a few years ago showed the main taxi company, according to their tax documents, earned a ridiculously low amount of money per day (= obvious dodging of taxes).They clearly refused to innovate for years. When you called their number you&#39;d get some unintelligible voice on the other end that would give you about 10 sec to state your details before they&#39;d clearly run out of patience.You could only request pickups at specific addresses that would then be connected to your phone number / profile. So &#34;pick me up on this street corner&#34; was impossible.The last time we called one for a ride to the airport they didn&#39;t show up at the agreed time so we got an Uber. Taxi company called us many times screaming insults down the phone, followed by an offensive email with an invitation to pay and threats of small claims courts.In light of all that, I have zero problems with someone else moving in fast to break things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually joined a political party in my country, because they had the intention of protecting Uber.Some people wonder, but why? Why protect such scummy company?Well, it was literally to save lives, as much illegal Uber behaviour is, what they were trying to replace was worse, MUCH worse.Where I live &#34;Taxi Mafia&#34; was a thing, not just in the usual sense people imagine, like blocking competitors using regulations, but people were murdering others, there were beatings, assassinations, theft, high level government corruption, the Taxi Mafia was evil and destructive as any other &#34;&lt;drugs/guns/slavery&gt; Mafia&#34; you can imagine.A lot of people claim Uber is evil because they say their workers are contractors and not employees. Well, before Uber if you wanted to be a driver, you had to purchase your own car, open your own company, and then give 50k USD to the local mafia boss, and promise to join combat whenever called. Combat? Yes, combat, gathering up drivers to kill a competitor was a thing, one infamous case for example: out of town driver parked near airport to deliver someone, a client in a hurry got on his cab as the other client was leaving, the local mafia didn&#39;t like this happened, so they surrounded the car and invited the driver for a &#34;walk&#34;, took him under a nearby bridge, and they all kicked him until he was a mangled mess, and then they kicked him some more to make sure he was dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Google makes $40bn...If I can create something that just a tiny fraction of people find useful, then I can create a huge amount of value.You conflate two meanings of value: monetary value, and intrinsic value. Search engines are intrinsically but not monetarily valuable to users. Search engines are monetarily, but not intrinsically, valuable to advertisers. You can get into trouble when you conflate these two meaning of &#34;value&#34;.In fact, right here is the pivot on which the internet goes from an idealistic shang-ri-la for geeks, to a commercial hellscape for the unwashed masses. It is surprisingly easy to create intrinsic value with computers! You see it all day every day on HN: some geek had a thought, spends a weekend making it, and then deploys a solution.It is surprisingly hard to extract monetary value from an intrinsically valuable solution. In fact, I believe that creating artificial scarcity is the hardest part of building an internet business, requiring invention on par with the intrinsically valuable part - and yet its the very thing that idealists rail against.(And making something artificially scarce does seem morally repugnant. And yet I don&#39;t see any other way to pay developers. Full stop. Open source software + consulting fees is a good way to go, but that can&#39;t apply to hosted search for the public. Well I guess it could, you could teach businesses how to game your own engine!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps a better approach would be building an open source www index or even a full current cache - as an enabler for people to build their own search engines?Right now it is extremely difficult to build your own web crawler that would compete with Google. And that is not because of the technology, but because multiple sites will prevent your bot from accessing them if you&#39;re not Google or Bing - either through robots.txt, or through directly banning your IP if it&#39;s trying to crawl and it&#39;s not a confirmed google-bot.Having a non-profit, open source, crawler that keeps an up to date index (or web cache) of the web would help competition spring up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I work for Google, though far away from Search.Regardless of search engine design, there&#39;s HUGE money in SEO. Any successful search engine will be gamed. Do you have the developer power to go red-queen against all the large companies in the world?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(disclaimer: lead brand manager, been at the table of a lot of the meetings where these logo changes happen.)There&#39;s a few different reasons (especially depending on the company) why that these happen, but I personally think it boils down to two unintuitive quasi-psychological reasons.- When suits are fumbling around looking for a new shiny project that&#39;ll give them a sense of &#34;legacy&#34; and their fingerpints all over (that won&#39;t affect immediate profits), somewhere in marketing and brand is usually the first place they&#39;ll grab.  If wins, fantastic, they&#39;ve secured their legacy both in a career-spanning sense and at the company itself with a bonus. If it fails disastrously, easy enough to quietly switch back to the old and to save face by tackling a different project.- Sort of relatedly, a lot of marketing suits hate feeling &#34;left out&#34; of trends; it&#39;s something I loathe about the industry, the hyper-focus and optimization of being at the crest of new trends (when arguably they&#39;re usually shittier than the previous ones). Oftentimes their entire salary / sense of purpose of being at the job is tied into with presenting the latest and greatest, and insecure designers will be too happy to be enablers.(My opinion may be a minority of the industry itself as if it were me, we&#39;d be back to 90&#39;s era logos for the sheer zany quality.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is confused about the difference between a logo and a word mark, which is what they are showing. Big brands are super pedantic about how and where logo marks and word marks are used. You shouldn&#39;t be seeing these word marks in contexts that are not already dripping in branding for the company.Look at the Pinterest Brand guidelines (https://business.pinterest.com/en-au/brand-guidelines/) and you well find them saying: &#34;Only use the Pinterest badge (please don’t use our word mark)&#34;. The Pinterest badge is the exact same stylised letter P from the old wordmark. So, almost everywhere you encounter a Pinterest logo it will be the stylised graphic. They can do that because enough people recognise the brand that they can drop the &#34;interest&#34;.The Facebook logo is an even weirder example because they are comparing the old Facebook app word mark with the newer Facebook-the-company word mark. That logo was specifically designed to look different from the app. Now that Facebook is now Meta, that uppercase logo has been retired.Microsoft, Facebook, Pinterest, Spotify and Airbnb all have stylised logo marks. eBay and Google use word marks, but are brightly coloured and immediately recognisable 99% of the time they are seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These are just the word marks, not the full logos.I mocked up a comparison of the logos (Microsoft/Airbnb/Spotify/Pinterest rarely use their word marks without the accompanying icon) and they start to retain a _little_ more personality, at least for the tech comparison.https://imgur.com/a/v5yKD3oIt still seems fair to say they&#39;re more bland than past iterations, though. The theme is ”[optional icon] + sans serif word mark”, and it&#39;s a good example of “small m minimalism” — a kind of unthinking collective march toward an absence of detail — touched on by The Cultural Tutor in this thread:https://twitter.com/culturaltutor/status/1538211892707086338&gt; Perhaps minimalist design is so prevalent because we no longer have anything to say.&gt; You don&#39;t need me to explain what the Gothic cathedral says, for example.&gt; But the skyscraper? It doesn&#39;t say anything, really. It&#39;s just... there.&gt; And suddenly everything, everywhere starts to look the same.&gt; Absolute neutrality. No detail. No identity.&gt; What does that say about us?"</p>

It’s all over Twitter etc., too.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20220710064519/https://www.daily...[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20220710061754/https://gendai.is...[3] https://web.archive.org/web/20220710062542/https://news.yaho..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a lot of words for the basic conjecture that he was killed by/for being a moonie.The problem with this reporting is that it takes the killer&#39;s supposed words at face value. This is a big risk, especially as at this stage we are not entirely certain that those words are accurate.Now, this may eventually appear to be the case, but the level of certainty presented in this article is unfounded."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lichess is amazing given how little they receive in funding. The interface is miles ahead of commercial competitors.They also handle guest plays much better. I&#39;ve faced less cheating bots and no annoying pop ups on lichess when playing as a guest compared to chess.comCan anyone point me to how they handle cheating detection? I would love a high level overview of how it works especially when you have no data on the player.fun nugget: HN users hosted tournaments on lichess at the start of the pandemic [0]0] https://lichess.org/team/hacker-news"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always excited when chess pops up on HN once a month or so. As someone who picked it up as a hobby in December, I can attest that lichess is a great app and site for folks looking to get back into the game or get started (I’m also a premium chess.com member as I use both products).For those of you thinking about picking up chess, I’d highly recommend watching the Chess Brah “Building Habits” series on YouTube. Watch the first five or so videos, and just start practicing those habits in rapid games (recommend 15 minute with 10 second increment on lichess, which shows up as 15+10). Embrace the losses, and just keep working on not hanging your pieces for free.If you’re intimidated by playing other humans, you can try the “Maia 1” bot on Lichess. It’ll likely beat you up for a while if you’re a beginner, but it’s a bot designed to play more like a human, and it’ll help you get the reps to feel more comfortable playing other humans.From there, just enjoy yourself. Chess can be frustrating because by design you always lose about 50% or your takes, but once you learn to accept the losses, it can be a great mental exercise to keep your brain sharp."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes! The front-end code for Lichess is what got me to learn Mithril years ago. Really clean code for such a complex application. Here’s a great example:https://github.com/lichess-org/lichobile/blob/master/src/ui/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the past few weeks, I&#39;ve been collecting and refining prompting tricks for getting GPT-3 to emit and understand various types of non-prose output. Many of these are discussed in the Twitter thread the OP links to, but I&#39;d like to highlight a few of my favorites here too.- GPT-3 can produce simple SVG diagrams (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545883023719239689) from an English description, or incrementally modify a given SVG diagram (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545888869207400454).- GPT-3 can produce diagrams using Graphviz dot notation (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545109709035900928), including diagrams that incorporate real-world context (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545112039147847682) not given in the prompt.- It can emit and understand HTML and Markdown, including table markup — e.g., &#34;Produce an HTML table giving the members of the Beatles and their instruments&#34;- It can accept/emit multiple named files, with arbitrary content, simply by embedding those files as values in a larger JSON/YAML document. Here, (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545848754883919872) I demonstrate completing the file tree of a trivial Python package given a README.md.- It can understand the raw JSON file contents of .ipynb files, successfully following directions given to it in markdown cells, emitting multiple code cells, etc.While all this is fun, as many people have pointed out the model has a bad habit of &#34;hallucinating&#34; — producing highly specific, wrong output. Avoiding this (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545793388871651330) is more of an art than a science. Be highly skeptical of any output you get from GPT-3, and search for verification methods where you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fascinating use case that wouldn&#39;t have occurred to me at all, quite cool, even if it &#34;doesn&#39;t know anything about anything at all&#34;.It even does pretty good with Verilog, which I assumed it would have issues with, admittedly some of this is just &#34;google-able&#34;, but even so. It can even create a reasonable attempt at a testbench (even though it doesn&#39;t quite get it right), which is crazy to me.*Explain this code:module my_module(a,c,y);
 input a,c;
 output y;
 assign y= c ? a : 1&#39;bz; 
endmodule*This code is a Verilog module that defines three inputs (a, c, y) and one output (y). The output y is assigned to the value of a if c is true, otherwise it is assigned to 1&#39;bz.*What is 1&#39;bz ?*1&#39;bz is a Verilog constant that represents a bit value of &#39;z&#39;, which is used to indicate a high impedance state.*Why is high impedance used ?*High impedance is used in digital circuits to allow multiple drivers to share a single bus without contention. When two or more drivers attempt to drive the same bus at the same time, a contention can occur and the bus voltage can become undefined. By using high impedance, drivers can avoid contention and allow the bus to remain stable.*Give me a testbench for this module*module testbench;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just biology. It&#39;s basically every subject in high school. The amount of knowledge in the world has exploded in the last 100 - 150 years, yet our school system refuses to adapt and pretends we&#39;re still in the early 1900s. Back then you actually could get a good and reasonably in-depth overview of what makes the world work before going to college or work.But those kinds of aspirations are completely futile these days. People in the ministries of education and other responsible bodies will argue that high school&#39;s purpose is not to educate on a subject in depth but to give a broad overview of many subjects but that&#39;s completely besides the point. Because the point is that the only way that they are able to &#34;give you a broad overview&#34; these days is by force-feeding you ever more facts and knowledge in sliced up classes, compressed into ever more shallow and boring text books and then letting you puke it all out in brain dead exams, many times a year for many different subjects, in parallel. Bulimia learning.Which is beyond sad, because basically every subject can be the source of wonder and amazement if taught the right way and with enough time to explain and explore. Which is why we need to let our kids choose the subjects they are interested early in school and get comfortable with the fact that they won&#39;t have any knowledge about other subjects when they leave high school. There simply isn&#39;t any other way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had been putting off quantum physics and time was running out. I was worried forth semester physics at MIT was going to be tough, but then through some miracle of providence the EE department decided that a solid state chemistry chemistry class plus Into to Biology could be substituted for quantum physics.Because I had already taken a solid state chemistry class, all I had to do was take a basic introductory biology class; how difficult could that be? It turns out that biology is hard, very hard.The other students that filled the large lecture hall weren’t ordinary first year students; they were pre-med students. Instead of relaxing by the swimming pool reading a colorful text with pictures of jelly fish and beetles, it felt more like I was taking swim lessons with a few hundred sharks.The lectures by Professor Luria were great (he had won the Nobel prize four years before) but the number of facts seemed impossible to remember. My fellow students were writing down literally every word written or uttered during each lecture. There wasn’t any mention of jelly fish or bugs or pea plants, but there were complex diagrams depicting even more complex biochemical pathways. I was accustomed to math classes and engineering classes and computer science classes. Biology was very different, more facts and less study of how to apply fundamental principles to prove some theorem or solve some engineering problem.I survived the Biology class, but it would have been a lot easier for me to take the physics class."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During the first part of the pandemic I watched the lectures for the Introductory Biology course [1] from MIT OpenCourseWare. I cannot recommend those highly enough!Almost every lecture brought up and highlighted something really cool and fascinating. Like how RNA sequencing over the last couple of years has gone from expensive to almost free, and what its uses are. Or time-lapse of bacteria adapting to antibiotics. Or just the first lecture showing a video of someone sticking a syringe into a cell. There were even some labs that could be done via a normal web browser.For me this was so much more engaging than the biology I was thought in high school, where we mostly learned things from outdated books.[1]: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-016-introductory-biology-fall-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This exact thing happened to us. We have a store located in Puerto Rico and Shopify would randomly stop payouts every 3-4 months or so because they needed to re-verify our owner address information. Apparently, most of Puerto Rico is not verifiable by their shitty address verification API, so it triggers the freeze every time it retries the verification. It was one of the most frustrating experiences I&#39;ve ever had and cost us thousands of dollars.Stripe also did the same exact thing for very similar reasons and at one point we had over $300,000 USD frozen with them, which was basically our entire monthly payroll expense. We had to explain to our bank why our accounts were suddenly drained. This one was worse than Shopify&#39;s since we actually never received any communications notifying that this was going to happen. At least we got an email from Shopify that we just hadn&#39;t noticed.They&#39;re all broken. And Know Your Customer needs to eat shit and die."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This problem seems endemic to big tech platforms, particularly when money is involved. I remember hearing similar stories about PayPal a decade ago (still do for what it’s worth).While I can understand the desire to not interact with a user of the platform (shopify, google, PayPal, etc), because of the cost, and because many are likely to be bots or actually fraudulent. It’s precisely at these edge cases when computers and automated performs the worst.These are the situations where the scenario is imperfectly modelled in the system. Maybe the engineers didn’t think of the edge case, or an ML model never had training data to cover it.Point is, it doesn’t matter. People problems need people solutions. Remediating edge cases involving people’s livelihoods strikes me as most likely a people problem.When you’re asking a person or company to trust them in a business relationship into the future, such as by being their shopfront, there’s only so many you can destroy before word gets around. I haven’t used or recommended businesses to use PayPal for a decade, because I saw them time and again inflict pain and financial stress with no recourse.As another example, look at the general sentiment around Google Cloud. Would you build a business on top of it? Does that include an exit strategy to multi-cloud, because you’re unsure if they’ll support the service you use?If you can’t scale to provide a human to help other humans caught in the edge cases of your own system, then you need to acknowledge you’re causing harm.A dog food company that kills a puppy every week, is really a puppy killing company that sells dog food.It’s a matter of perspective yes, but if you got into it to help feed dogs, surely the last thing you would want to do is harm them?And if you became aware your killing puppies, would it not be the top priority to ensure it never happens again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shopify should be scrambling to do a public post-mortem right now. They &#34;Fixed&#34; the situation within a few hours of the tweetstorm, showing that they know they f&#39;d up. Shit happens - but how does shopify assuage small businesses that this won&#39;t happen to them next? A public apology, post-mortem and steps to make sure this never happens again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article says Musk agreed to buy Twitter mostly as a joke. I think there&#39;s a far better explanation. This wasn&#39;t a joke for Musk because after agreeing to buy Twitter he proceeded to sell billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA stock, supposedly to finance the purchase. Even for the richest man in the world that&#39;s not a joke.I think a better explanation is that Musk offered to buy Twitter as a cover for selling billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA.Look at this story: https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-sells-billions-of-dol...
The headline is: &#34;Elon Musk Sells $8.5 Billion of Tesla Shares After Deal to Buy Twitter&#34;Why does he need a cover? Because TSLA is way too overvalued. He has to know that it is overvalued. Tesla&#39;s market cap is double of Toyota, VW, Mercedes, BMW, GM, Honda, Ferrari and Volvo all combined! [1]. If you sell stock while knowing your company&#39;s stock is way too overvalued, you&#39;re fleecing unsophisticated investors. Pretending to buy Twitter provides a convenient cover.Musk pretended that TSLA valuation is reasonable. Musk even called out Gates for shorting TSLA stock [2]. If he didn&#39;t have a cover then Musk would look like a hypocrite for selling TSLA.In reality, both Musk and Gates sold TSLA, the only difference is that Musk sold stocks he owned, but Gates sold borrowed stocks. But Musk used buying Twitter as a cover, so he gets to pretend to be morally superior. Even though both men sold TSLA, according to Musk, Gates&#39; sales means that he isn&#39;t serious about climate change [3].[1] https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers...[2] https://nypost.com/2022/05/31/elon-musk-calls-out-bill-gates...[3] https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-shorting-tesla-wo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much noise here and ill-informed comments fail to give a broader understanding of  what&#39;s going on. Elon bought up Twitter shares early in the year for a reason, because he wanted more control over Twitter. He bought up so much Twitter shares that when it was announced via the SEC, Twitter offered a board seat under the clause that he wouldn&#39;t acquire too much % control over the company. He obliged, but then left when he realized he couldn&#39;t make the changes he desired at the company. Plus, people on the board at the time, specifically Dorsey, was nudging him to buy out the company as a whole. So he did, hastingly. That was an ill-informed decision and obviously a mistake made with respect to doing due-diligence. In hindsight, before the market crash that price may have made sense. But fast forward today with looming recession talk, it&#39;s pretty clear he realized it&#39;s overvalued (we know this from tweets about twitter deal being repriced). And so he needed an escape hatch, hence the issue with bots and the unverifiable mDAU was a great talking point. In fact, he may as well be right on the issue as Twitter doesn&#39;t want to reveal how they calculate it. What he&#39;s trying to do right now is pretty clearly force the board to give a better deal. He&#39;s not sold any stock and likely won&#39;t unless he&#39;s actually out for good. But given the amount of effort and thought he&#39;s put into it and making it clear that he should pay a lower price depending on the bot issue, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much doubt he&#39;s not actually leaving Twitter. Whether the courts will force an acquisition at the current price however, is a looming question. My bet is they settle at a lower price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not knowing anything about glyphosate, I went to the article before reading the comments. I’ll just put this here because it was clear the researchers wanted to be sure people see it. From the first paragraph of the article—&gt;&gt; In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer determined that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen” (IARC, 2015). However, the European Food Safety Authority and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Meeting on Pesticide Residues (EFSA 2015, FAO/WHO 2015) determined that glyphosate is unlikely to be a carcinogen. The US EPA concluded that “available data and weight-of-evidence clearly do not support the descriptors “carcinogenic to humans,” “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” or “inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential” (US EPA 2017a). Controversy and concern that the rising use of glyphosate may have adverse human-health effects exist (Myers et. al., 2016)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in the field for many years and I see the EU on the forefront of public chemical safety, both in terms of legislation and enforcement.
ECHA is transparent about glyphosate [1]. It is not even labelled as CMR on REACH Annex III [2], and that&#39;s saying a lot.
If you follow the developments, you will find that there is no way to prove a chemical as &#34;safe&#34;. All it takes is one bloke on record to develop any health condition which can be linked to a chemical, and it will be scrutinized six ways to Sundays. Often leading to the introduction or decrease of an OEL, or a classification of this substance. As new humans are born all of the time, and diagnostics and analysis methods are still being improved, the likelihood of any given chemical to be &#34;harmless&#34; asymptotically approaches zero.
1 in 2 people develop cancer during their lives [3]. There are currently &gt; 23000 chemicals on the EEA market at &gt;= 1 t/a [4].1 https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/glyphosate

I see nothing unreasonable about not allowing people to cross this boundary. The law does not prevent recording. It says you cannot record closer than 8ft. Why would somebody need to get closer than 8ft to an officer doing their job, when you have no involvement in the situation at hand? Adding more people to the situation simply increases the stress of all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the early 2000s someone (drunkmenworkhere is what I remember) made a blog post generator that you could sign up for, add some names, some interests, and it would generate blog posts with Markov chains and some other magic. I signed up, not fully understanding how it worked, added some friends and family as names, played around with it, it wasn&#39;t what I thought it was and moved on. Meanwhile it kept generating entries about me and my family doing fantastic things.At some point my then ex-wife (we&#39;ve since reconciled) was google-stalking me and came across these entries. At some point they became outlandish enough that she contacted me to ask what was going on in my life. There was a very confused conversation where I had no idea what she was talking about and she was somewhat concerned about my health and safety. It wasn&#39;t until I talked to a relative and started googling myself with some specific terms that I came across the entries and was able to figure out what was happening. I emailed the individual running the project and asked to end the entries and if possible remove them from the internet to avoid further confusion."</p>

Otherwise it would happily barf up random Markov walks from all of the other conversations without any consideration of context.In the span of one weekend at least five hundred unique users attempted to chat with it, some for hours on end. I only have a few logs left, but the conversations generally progressed from horny to irate or bizarre."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a nice article. Summary is they wanted lighter cars so accel/decel would require less power and the gas/brake system would be lighter/smaller. So then the wider gauge is helpful to increase lateral stability (to prevent tipping over) since the cars are so light.In my opinion these kinds of historical mechanical/civil engineering stories are quite interesting. Would love to see more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good to know it was for steadiness against the wind given its light construction and the original intent to have if go on (under?) the GGB deck.I’d like to know why the tracks are flat and not angled  and require regular grinding down to even out the washboard effect this causes… which results in that high pitched sound whenever it enters a curve due to slippage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Despite the District’s claim, I still wonder if the Southern Pacific had a hand in the choice of a non-standard gauge, to help make sure they’d never be ordered to take over BART and bear its operating losses. That risk might seem slight today, but it would have been more of a concern in that era, years before Amtrak, when railroads were being required by their regulators (ICC and CPUC) to operate other unprofitable passenger services.As the posting concedes, “The pamphlet does not specify why only the wide gauge of five-feet-six inches was tested and not others.”"</p>

It had polyphonic aftertouch, which most synths don&#39;t have today.Most have velocity sensitivity, meaning each note transmits how much initial force you applied. And most have aftertouch, meaning they transmit how much force you continue to apply after hitting bottom. But for most it&#39;s just channel aftertouch, meaning it transmits the aftertouch of the key you&#39;re pressing the hardest.The CS-80 transmitted aftertouch of each individual key, and had nice controls to to adjust how it used that information. A lot of synths can use polyphonic aftertouch but only a few new ones actually have poly-AT keyboards. The ones I know of are the Hydrasynth (out for a couple years now), the Behringer UB-Xa, and the Iridium keyboard (both introduced this year).Vangelis was also a huge CS-80 fan and used it on the Blade Runner soundtrack. Incidentally, a boutique synth that replicates the CS-80 pretty well (without keyboard) is the Deckard&#39;s Dream. It&#39;s $4000 but that&#39;s way less than a vintage CS-80."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone already probably knows this, but if you search &lt;Song Name&gt; acapella or &lt;song name&gt; isolated vocals on youtube you can get the vocals to songs you want to cover. Sometimes its the original isolated, but sometimes its just someone singing it. I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun with Reverbmachine&#39;s Legends bank and vocals from youtube. Eurythmics Sweet Dreams for example.On a tangent, when I was in prison my mom died, and Kate Bush was her favorite music. Also in prison as a coping mechanism I created my own superstition that music on the radio was a message for me (I know it isn&#39;t but I needed a way to just get a little space to breath). Like Tom Petty meant the the day was going to turn out ok. So I programmed myself to be super receptive to Kate Bush being popular again and it&#39;s been amazing for my mood and productivity. Programming little positive things into my makeup has been really important in getting through stuff, be it addiction or just day to day difficulties."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This brings me back to when I worked on Excel. The formatting structs (and most cell related ones) are so tightly packed and the byte code VM for the formulas is pretty neat.I wish I could have met duanec, that guy wrote probably 10% of the code for Excel. Sadly he had retired 2 years before I started working on Excel.Fun fact: when they were about to ship Excel 1.0, they didn’t know what to name it then so they had an internal poll. The name that garnered the most votes was “Mr Spreadsheet”. Needless to say, marketing vetoed it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work as a consultant and spend five out of eight hours a day in Excel, and I want the features in this app so bad.Sadly, the only way I’ll be able to use these features is if Microsoft bought them out and integrated them into Excel. It’s ubiquitous at almost every workplace you go to, but the only innovation of the past 20 years seems to be PQ (which is awesome), and xlookup."</p>
