								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really neat! My only complaint is that the handling is very sluggish. Also it might be nice to have a first-person vew, maybe the camera view contributes to the sluggish feeling.I love the procedurally-generated landscapes. It really captures the feeling of driving on unfamiliar roads.I&#39;m curious how the physics works. Is this using raycast wheels? A couple of years ago I made a racing game for Oculus Quest using Godot[0], based on Godot&#39;s &#34;VehicleBody&#34;, and getting the physics to work satisfactorily was a major headache. But a procedural world would have made it so much cooler.[0] https://sidequestvr.com/app/1403/ghost-racing-vr-wip"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A small note: 80 miles an hour on windy roads, driving in the middle of the road, is not slow and chill. That&#39;s &#34;I want to die&#34; fast and reckless... maybe have two autodrive settings. &#34;slow and chill&#34; going appropriate speeds and driving correctly (left/right toggle?) and &#34;landscape zoomies&#34; or something for what it currently does. Right now auto pilot is literally stress inducing =D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shuzo Fujimoto designed the most magical and startling origami model I&#39;ve ever seen, the Fujimoto Cube. Fortunately that one is famous enough that you can find instructions and videos online, but most of his designs are hard to find. I recently enquired on Twitter about his design for an octahedron, which I was able to find only because a kind stranger responded with a samizdat copy. It&#39;s very exciting that his wonderful designs are to become more readily accessible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having your own email/domain isn’t about privacy. Email has become essentially the key to almost everything in modern life. If I lose access to my email I lose access to basically everything I own and it would be a massive hassle to switch emails. Banks, schools, apps, etc. Often times these services won’t even let you change to a new email if you don’t have access to an existing one. Some use email as 2factor. It’s a nightmare. Owning your own domain separately is crucial. Who hosts your email matters less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is everywhere. In India, people in the departments, especially the Governments usually ask, &#34;What is your Gmail?&#34; Almost everyone uses Gmail here and it is extremely rare to find their own custom domain.I&#39;m actually surprised that the Government Departments do not have a service that takes care of these! They will fine Google but almost all of the government email IDs are Gmail.I was one of those that distributed hundreds if not thousands of Gmail invites when it started. However, since 2010-ish, I left Gmail to be just for Newsletters, and the ones that I&#39;m not serious about. I&#39;m always reminded that a day will come when I will just have no access, lock out and be done with it.I had used my name&#39;s domain and had used the web hosting provided email service and I felt nice using the likes of `webmaster@brajeshwar.com` (early 2000s). Then I got a shorter domain with our family domain and is, now, powered by Google Workspace (with a plan to move to the competitors soon before the yearly plan expires). I had so many domains under the Google Suite free version since its beta. I did upgraded my primary domain to the paid version, when I had few mail delivery issues so I can talk to a person and that was also the time I realize I cannot go back. That was almost/about 10 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular on HN, but I just don&#39;t see a problem with Google having my email, for what they provide me. Almost unlimited uptime, global redundancy, best search experience, storage all for free. I&#39;m ok with the trade off for now.Its just not worth the hassle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey HN - author here.This was my burnout recovery project in April of 2020. Very much a labor of love and a surprising way to realize I still liked programming. I wrote some scattered thoughts here [0]I also &#34;run&#34; this project quite differently than I usually do - when I receive a pull request instead of merging it I do a quick glance through the user&#39;s github to make sure they&#39;re not a spammer before giving them _commit access_ and asking them to merge their own PR [1]. It has worked wonders.[0]: https://notes.jordanscales.com/ffa53b57[1]: https://twitter.com/jdan/status/1528026508564078593"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tiny nitpick – buttons don&#39;t look like that when pressed in Windows 98 (or any version of Windows for that matter).This is what they&#39;re supposed to look like: https://imgur.com/a/iFMJCER (98.css on top, Windows 98 below)As far as I&#39;m aware, the only buttons that look like that when pressed are the Start menu button and taskbar buttons.Similarly, buttons are supposed to have a black border in addition to the dotted outline when they&#39;re focused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve previously attempted this for Windows 95. I tried very hard to be pixel-accurate. https://hikari.noyu.me/demos/ shows off a bit of what I achieved, but alas it lacks most of the UI elements.I learned some interesting things from the process. The biggest one for me is that web browsers have only one kind of focus, but Windows has two, a dotted line on the inside (element affected by space bar) and a black outline (element affected by return key). You therefore can&#39;t get exactly the same UI in a browser without adding some JS to simulate this second type of focus."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My biggest concern about this is that now it is in Emacs, there&#39;s no easy way to contribute to it, or follow development. Previously it was on GitHub and there was zero friction to contributing other than figuring out your elisp changes. But now, I think that Issues in the github site are discouraged, and so there will be no convenient way of watching issues and feature requests raised against the project, or of following discussion of proposed patches and code review. In principle of course, these things are possible by using old issue tracking applications and following often dysfunctional/cantankerous discussions in a email list, both of whose scope is the whole of emacs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, I&#39;ve been using &#34;the other one&#34;: lsp-mode, and have been quite happy with the results. Will see how eglot has progressed and if I can slim my config a bit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use eglot (via doom emacs) and it works but configuration always feels like a slog--the language server it wants to start is often not in the PATH, or is configured incorrectly or something. Javascript&#39;s eslint/prettier/tsc are particularly finicky. I&#39;d love to have some method to denote that the presence of .eslintrc/eslint in package.json means run format-on-save, otherwise don&#39;t. But I also can&#39;t really see how it could be _that_ much better on any other editor?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is really annoying is that Cloudflare pages will strip the file extension off of your html pages, and perform permanent redirects to those new URLs. Now if you&#39;re intending on moving to a new hosting service that doesn&#39;t do that (cgi-bin), all Google search results to your site will 404.Github pages and likely others also supports this format, so moving between those two services doesn&#39;t exhibit this problem. Moving to cgi-bin will.I&#39;d suggest Cloudflare shouldn&#39;t try to establish their scheme as canonical url and rather implement github pages behavior, but what do I know... I&#39;m just hosting an old fashioned blog, not a JAMstack/SPA/whatever thing"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 10 years time when cloudflare goes bankrupt/withdraws the free offering, will you be able to redeploy to another platform or will you start having to delve into 10 year old code and porting it to a new API?Is there at least an nginx-cloudflare module that lets you self-host this stuff?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone who actually used those models for more than few days and learns their strengths and weaknesses it is completely obvious all this talk of &#34;societal impact&#34;, or as you called it self imposed limits are 100% bulls**. Everyone in the field knows it.99% of those using this tactics use it to justify not releasing their models to avoid giving competition a leg up(Google, openAI) and to pretend they are for &#34;open research&#34;. As I said this is 100% bull.The remaining 1% are either doing this to inflate their egos (&#34;hey look how considerate and enlightened we are in everything we do!&#34;), or they pander to media/silly politicians/various clueless commentators whose level of knowledge about this technology is null. They regurgitate the same set of &#34;what ifs and horror stories&#34; to scare the public into standing by when they attempt to over regulate another field so they can be kingmakers within it(if you want an example how it works look at the energy sector).All this sillyness accomplishes is to raise a barrier to entry for potential commercial competition. Bad actors will have enough money/lack scruples to train their own models or to steal your best ones regardless how &#34;impact conscious&#34; your company it.Now, I don&#39;t claim everyone should be forced to publish their AI models. No, if you spent lots of money on training your model it is yours. But you can&#39;t lock all your work behind closed doors and call yourself open. It doesn&#39;t work like this. One important point is that there is value even in just publishing a paper demonstrating some achievements of a proprietary model, but if the experiment can&#39;t be reproduces based on description given that is not science and for sure it is not open."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s be realistic, just like building codes, medical procedures and car manufacturing sooner or later we will also be subject to regulations. The times where hacking culture and tech was left unbothered are over.Twenty years ago we were free to do whatever we want, because it didn&#39;t matter. Nowadays everyone uses tech as much as they use stairs. You can&#39;t build stairs without railings though.Keeping the window for abuse small is beneficial to the whole industry. Otherwise bad press will put pressure on politicians to &#34;do something about it&#34; resulting in faster and more excessive regulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really, really hope that there aren&#39;t any people who think the way you&#39;ve outlined. Technology has empowered small groups or even single individuals to create things that have the potential to change the course of civilization, so I for sure hope those individuals think twice about the potential consequences of their actions. How would you feel about people releasing a $100 &#39;build your own Covid-variant&#39; kit?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there is a bit of an issue here that isn&#39;t addressed in the article. They reference using the SpaceX published ephemerides which are created from the GPS receivers onboard the SpaceX satellites:&#34;SpaceX satellites regularly downlink accurate orbital information from onboard GPS. We use this orbital information, combined with planned maneuvers, to accurately predict future ephemerides, which are uploaded to Space-Track.org three times per day&#34; [0]So using the positioning information of the SpaceX satellites is already dependent on GPS. Saying that it could be used as a backup to GPS is a bit non-sensical to me. Sure you could go back to using ranging measurements for each of the satellites to get TLEs from NORAD or LeoLabs or one of the other commercial space tracking companies, but it would likely be less accurate and not updated as frequently as the SpaceX satellites don&#39;t have a precision clock onboard for timing and propagation like the GPS satellites do.[0] https://www.spacex.com/updates/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GPS is also coupled with WAAS which relies on a network of ground stations at known coordinates to determine GPS error. These errors are caused by bulges in the ionosphere that throw off timing. Error is calculated, broadcast up to satellites and then rebroadcast down to GPS receivers that are WAAS enabled. This is known as a satellite based augmentation system. The other satellite nav systems that compete with GPS are building similar augmentation systems (like GAGAN, EGNOS, MSAS and SDCM). These systems are required for precision approaches like LPV for aircraft on instrument flight plans. Regular GPS precision due to ionosphere changes is too low. They&#39;ve enabled the FAA to lower the minimums for GPS approaches down to levels that are close to ILS, removing the need for expensive ILS installations at many regional airports. So replacing GPS isn&#39;t just about creating a system to locate a point in space. You&#39;d need to replace critical systems like WAAS that enable precision approaches during instrument conditions, for example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Massively impressive! A very exciting paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12334v4 from the first two authors shows how Starlink can be fused with ordinary GNSS to get extremely impressive +56 dB anti-jam advantage (see Figure 1)."</p>

Pocket Casts is one of the only applications that&#39;s survived me bouncing between iOS and Android and back again over the last who-knows-how-many years and I paid for their web player a long time ago, too. I&#39;ve tried other players and none of them stick; the differences in affordances in something like Castro or Overcast send me back to Pocket Casts every time.They seem to have had a rough time of it over the last few years, and seeing them end up at Automattic (&#34;land of the misfit web toys&#34;) was nice. This is a cherry on top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After being a user for many many years, I just recently tested out to Snipd [1] and have not looked back since.  Pocket Cast were great but I don&#39;t see them innovating. With Snipd there is almost always a full text transcript available including a surprisingly accurate AI generated Table of Contents to cue through.  Then I can easily save a transcribed clip of some section I am listening to  for export to a TfT program like obsidian.  Not sure how I ever lived without these features now I am used to them lol.[1]  https://www.snipd.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great step.  Subscriptions errode first sale protections by subscription-gating physical objects, allowing OEMs a work-around to first-sale doctrine.  If you buy something, you should own it, and be able to fix it, scrap it, re-sell it, whatever you want.It&#39;s interesting NJ included self-driving in the subscription ban.  These require significant overhead in compute, engineering resources and greatly impact safety, and if Tesla&#39;s pricing is any indication of overall market, FSD will cost a pretty penny.If full self-driving was offered at 10k up front for the life of the car, or $80/mo, I would imagine many buyers of lower-end vehicles would prefer a subscription."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is great, and though I agree that determining whether there is an &#34;on-going cost to the manufacturer&#34; will be a gray area that automakers will try to game, I think that&#39;s a solvable problem.The heated seats example is a great one. There is no reason for this not be a one-time charge.On the other hand, I think it&#39;s fair to offer autopilot/&#34;full self driving&#34; on a subscription, or at least the upgrades as a subscription. Clearly there is a large ongoing cost to continually improve self-driving capabilities, and it seems reasonable to me to have a pricing model that reflects that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amsterdam local here — in fact, I live in exactly this street. Where the first cartel guy gets subdued is where I get my coffee, and the people that live in the canal houses are my neighbors. (My house may or may not be in the map, would have to play the game to check.)Fun facts:(1) A year or two ago several guys spent days using some sort of device to scan all buildings in our street. They got complaints from several bar owners and tenants as they appeared to be taking photographs inside the buildings, and they wouldn’t explain why. I wouldn’t be be surprised if it was for this map.(2) The footage is hyperrealistic not just graphically, they got the details right with surprising accuracy. Even the garbage bins are in exactly the right place. (It’s also not unlikely that a guy could be subdued like this without people being too surprised, as tourists like to use this district to get wasted 24/7.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though it does look great, i wish more games focused on actually being fun to play instead of having long cut scenes and micro transactions.Ironically other than the fact that you have to pay per game and that you’re often forced to die, I prefer arcade games. They generally minimize friction to playedit: to clarify, I mean games with good graphics specifically. There are many great games (especially indie) out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks incredible.Although this beautiful recreation is missing the endless tourists aimlessly walking on bike paths and the very loud conversations between Dutch people (their talking volume is what many of us consider yelling, but that&#39;s just normal).Once we get VR headsets that are maybe twice as good as the best now, and we have high quality simulations, the scifi stories of people choosing living in unreality seem more plausible."</p>

A small fine and a promise not to do it any more. This should basically be the end of that company entirely. Instead they just have to point the finger at some low-level managers, fire them, and keep on rolling. I would think criminal charges are warranted for importing 12 and 13 year-olds for labor. The children can&#39;t consent. That&#39;s essentially child slave labor.If Hyundai/Kia drops them, that would at least be a much bigger penalty than the DOL imposed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m bullish on this because mobile (and web) development is ridiculously overcomplicated to a beginner. I think it&#39;s a common misconception that coding/logic is difficult. I find the development setup and deployment to be much more complicated. As evidence, take a look at the impressive workarounds that citizen developers use to make things work in an easy environment like Excel.A keyboard and mouse probably solve most of the complaints in this thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want a token based keyboard with the following propertiesLanguage and syntax awareness. When I’m writing JavaScript - it should provide keys for ‘if’ ‘each’ ‘function’ etc.When I have unbalanced parens, braces etc, it should tell me how many levels deep I am and what context I’m in.Instead of me naming variables it should generate random names and let me declare with a single tap. Provide easy refactoring tools so I can rename them later.On mobile I want to manipulate symbols or the AST directly rather than rely on text input.Take advantage of a keyboard that can display infinite variation and change on the fly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a teacher the basic Replit stuff is great, but their class management stuff is atrocious and unintuitive. For example, under one class I created 9 units with a number of challenges under each unit. You copy that to a new class (Team is what they call it) and all sections disappear). Then if you want to reorganize, even if there are sections, you have to drag and drop, scrolling up or down the page and repeating the drag to get it to the right section.Another thing is when you organize sections there is no drag and drop, but arrows moving boxes up and down.I&#39;ve sent in dozens of issues for various bugs and annoyances, and even dug into the js to point out how to fix things, but after nearly 2 years they are still there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to use Ubuntu for everything and was very happy in the massive Ubuntu ecosystem with a .deb for everything till I was forced to use Snap a few releases ago for installing even some basic utils I used on a daily basis. I then had Snap constantly hang on installs and just break for no apparent reason and waste my time debugging it. It didn&#39;t &#34;just work&#34; anymore.Swapped to Arch and haven&#39;t looked back yet, Arch took me a lot more work to get set up but once it was it&#39;s been pretty invisible, which is how I like my OS to be.I&#39;d probably happily swap back to Ubuntu if I read somewhere that Snap was removed entirely/canceled or something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The regular as clockwork bi-yearly releases are one of the best things about Ubuntu. Ubuntu is the default supported Linux laptop/desktop env in so many tech orgs.If you use Ubuntu and want to help ensure it works for your env remember to test the upcoming release alphas / betas eg with USB boot stick and file bugs on Launchpad if you notice something broken.(Same goes for other distros your org may use, eg Debian, Fedora etc)Snaps mostly work great, and are a great improvement for keepign up to date sw available for people using LTS releases. This and the security improvements brought by the sandboxing greatly overshadow the sometime teething problems of the system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure precisely why, but when I first saw ads in Apt(8) I decided I wouldn&#39;t be using Ubuntu for any more personal projects. On one hand they obviously need to keep the project alive. On the other hand, putting your own ads on top of something that fundamental to the system just felt ... weird/narsty?Reading state information... DoneCalculating upgrade...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not surprising at all. All of these review-driven P2P marketplace businesses end up with the same problem. After the initial phase of early adopters that offer generally high quality products, a flood of fake or low-quality listing tries to squeeze money out of the platform. These people are not listing their homes on Airbnb, they are trying to make a living by extracting as much money from the platform as they possibly can. They don&#39;t care if they&#39;re banned or reported. They&#39;ll just make a new fake account. Low ratings? No problem, just pay for some fake reviews.The same is true for Amazon and other marketplace business. It&#39;s overrun by Amazon FBA sellers selling cheap low-quality white-labeled Alibaba products. It&#39;s almost impossible to find real brands or high-quality products these days, unless you specifically know what to search for.How to deal with it? Personally I&#39;ve started going back to hotels to be safe. If I do use Airbnb, I do a lot of research on the host and reviews and assume the place I&#39;m getting is 80% worse than what the pictures show.Other examples: App Store app reviews, restaurant review apps and food delivery apps. Fortunately it&#39;s not a big deal if these are scams. It&#39;s just a few dollars. Sucks much more when it&#39;s your vacation rental."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This stuff is incredibly common in short term rental market.  You are scraping the bottom of the barrel on landlord scruples.There was a recent fire in a summer vacation town popular with NYers.
The town requires summer short term rental landlords to get a permit &amp; inspection.
The landlord did not get one.
The landlord also had sketchy kitchen wiring that was probably some sort of DIY and not up to code.
The landlord had removed batteries and hardwiring from 3 smoke detectors.
These are the kind of things the inspector would have found immediately.A family visiting from out of state lost 2 of their 3 children in this fire.Apps like AirBnB create the facade of officialness on what are instead very sketchy markets.  Family probably thought they were doing the right thing going through an app and the landlord must be verified and more &#34;legit&#34;.  Being from out of state they wouldn&#39;t know the intricacies of local town permit&amp;inspection requirements and how to check if the landlord has one, etc.Likewise in my condo in NYC, we had one particular owner who was trying to use their unit as an Airbnb.  Regardless of the local laws which were tightening up at the time, our condo expressly forbid short term rentals, and had language around minimum length of stay and lease approval requirements.  It only stopped when we started fining them $1000 per incident.Stuff like this matters because you buy a condo to live in it and don&#39;t expect the unit on the other side of your bedroom wall to essentially be a hotel room with new neighbors every 3 days, staying up all hours (vacation, yay), dragging suitcases in&amp;out at odd hours multiple times per week.. forever.The building itself takes on a lot more wear &amp; tear, and they put a burden on staff as they think the building porter&amp;doorman are there for them like a hotel concierge and front desk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If only there was some regulation for such services that would require some sort of standard. You know some sort of licensing by the state. /sThis is what you get when you skirt laws, artificially lowering prices to kill competition and exploit workers. Stop complaining, it&#39;s your own doing for supporting this type of economy. Only because maybe some of those existing laws were cumbersome or outdated doesn&#39;t mean you just go around all of them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a programmer with MS.  Like you, diagnosed about 15 years ago, but still doing pretty well.  I feel like I’m starting to notice the gradual decline more and more, despite not having had a serious clinical relapse for about 10 years (some minor ones).Things you can try:
Changing your drugs - maybe going for something drastic like HSCT.Being patient and not panicking - if you’re currently having flare ups your symptoms will appear worse than they really are while there’s acute inflammation happening.  Don’t forget that.  If the flare ups get under control you’ll should see some recovery and improvement.Not giving up - keep pushing yourself as hard as you can, make sure you’re training whatever’s left of your central nervous capacity.  There’s probably still some left.  Keep trying to do as much as you can and you’ll get access to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also had it for 15 years, I was sharper in my 20s than now but now and I think age and MS have affected that. I realise I&#39;m at my best when not stressed, well rested and happy. However I&#39;m not always in control of those. Stress is easier to deal with as I talk to my employers about my condition and I avoid anything stressful when possible. I still feel useless some days and have bad brain fog and can&#39;t think clearly, it gives me a lot of imposter syndrome.Im currently moving somewhere else to get better rest. And my happiness is in progress, I tried anti depressants but I get anxiety and I tried CBT but it didn&#39;t work either. I do also swim regularly which helps too but still not enough. Im hoping this move will help. However its gone on for so many years that I think I will seek a professional soon.Covid and the pandemic definitely affected me, I couldn&#39;t walk properly for weeks after recovering from it. I used to do 20min walk every day to recover and just to keep active and get out. My depression got worse (was getting CBT in days before lockdown) but a few friends of mine play regularly online so I got to be social at least and talk about it. To add to this, I also quit my job before lockdown to travel so I was unemployed for a year in pandemic. I remember going to cafes when things partially opened to practise interview questions and did little projects. I finally got a job the next year.I&#39;m still worried I won&#39;t be strong enough to travel one day, my max distance walking is 1.5km, give or take, without a rest, I could go a lot further only a few years ago.I know MS affects everyone differently and it can be a very hidden condition. My life could of been quite different without it but it could have been worse. Im lucky to have found a job coding and the silver lining of the pandemic is wfh. I see it like you have to play with the cards your dealt and whatever you can change for the better then try to. It&#39;s not been an easy road till now but I try and remain hopeful for the future.I know it must be even harder considering your circumstances and your health. I hope this helps to know your not alone at least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have MS and definitely didn&#39;t know that the secondary progressive form of the disease was just a matter of time.  Now I&#39;m slowly losing the right side of my body after years of being in remission with numbness in my hands being the only symptom.
 There are definitely medical advances.  The one I&#39;m most excited about is nervgen. It&#39;s regenerative without the radiation and terribleness of stem cells.  But it&#39;s only starting phase two trials.
Hang in there, it sucks but the doctors reassure me that it&#39;s a good time to have MS as thirty years ago there were no treatments.
Now there is the walking pill to help nerves conduct and it really works for me. There are also dmts that slow the progression or stop future lesions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made that image![1]. And this is not the first time it&#39;s been on the front page of HN either[2]. So I&#39;d like to share some context that I&#39;ve not mentioned elsewhere before.My father died from alcoholism in 2004. He made his living writing software (hence why I do too, and why I enjoy HN). But he also, for a short time, taught Astronomy evening classes. I&#39;ve always felt short-changed by the emotional absence and traumatic passing of my male parent. But the continued virality of this image has been some sort of magical glimmer from the depths of the universe that it was still his shoulders that I stood on in order to reach where I am today. Maybe it was the glint in his eyes every time he showed me the latest APOD image[3], and the deep love with which he would explain their contexts. I made this composite image of Andromeda and the moon precisely because of that extra commentary, or rather I should say, extra love, of the night sky that my father gave me. Seeing it here, sparkling in the &#34;night sky&#34; of the HN front page stirs the same kind of wonder I sometimes feel catching those million year old specks of light above my head. Reminding me that though the universe is mostly cold and dark that doesn&#39;t diminish its warmth and brightness.1. https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceporn/comments/1u0dxs/andromeda...2. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=229923843. https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This (or some sort of very similar comparison) prompted me to figure out how to locate Andromeda. And I could not see anything, So I bought a nice pair of binoculars, and perhaps I could see something, but it was impossible to tell for sure. until I went camping in Arizona, I was looking at the stars, I remembered how to find Andromeda, remembered my binoculars. everything had came together and there it was! it looked like a blue mist.But really it was a nearly spiritual experience. Out in the cold Arizona desert, more stars than I have ever seen in my life and you bring up a pair of binoculars to what looks like an empty area of sky and it too is full of stars, And there is this blue mist, the furthest thing you can see with the naked eye(at least with better eyes than mine) with billions and billions of stars contained within. I don&#39;t know, but you feel stuff under those circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It may be obvious and this may be a bit pedantic, but the “actual size” and “size compared to the moon” part is confusing, as comparing the size of two objects is usually comparing two objects at the same scale.If someone was completely clueless, they would think Andromeda is a teeny tiny galaxy. But it’s actually 110,000 light years wide — quite a bit bigger than the moon. :)The title show just be something along the lines of “Andromeda in the sky if it were brighter, next to the moon”. Or just “Andromeda if it were brighter”.I say this because I’ve seen other “X compared to Y” articles on HN (one compared planets and the sun to the moon, where the moon was a pixel), and these are all at-scale comparisons. So I was expecting something similar here from the title."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s why interrupt is inherently more efficient: as long as both participants are willing to yield to interrupt-denies and counter-interrupts when interrupting, you have shifted the communication mode from:A) Anticipate up front what other person needs to hear and say it allB) Rapid adjustment to ideal info requirements as your model of their knowledge/interest is live-updated.But the trick people seem to miss is that interrupt-denies and counter-interrupts make the whole thing possible.When I&#39;m talking with someone for whom this style is natural, there can be many very rapid small gestures to interrupt, which sometimes are accepted and sometimes are rejected by a small &#34;just let me keep going, you&#39;ll see why&#34; gesture. Each of those gestures takes a fraction of a second (and generally does not actually break flow of speech, just eye contact + a little head motion), and conversations employing them are far more enjoyable because information flow is near optimal.On the other hand, when speaking with anti-interrupt people, I often get so bored it&#39;s hard to pay attention because either 1) they left something out that I wanted to ask about so I can&#39;t follow what they are saying, or 2) I already had a thorough understanding of something they insist on giving a long explanation of."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a strong habit of &#34;autocompleting&#34; people&#39;s thoughts in my head before they&#39;re done saying them. I&#39;m only right maybe ~60% of the time, but it comes with a strong urge to interrupt them and let them know where I think they&#39;re going. This is especially true if I can tell that it will take them multiple sentences to finish their thought. It does not come from a place of &#34;you&#39;re wasting my time, I get it, jeez&#34;, but more from a &#34;I understand the point you&#39;re making and I am eager to hear the next thing you have to share.&#34;What I&#39;ve noticed is that my habit of interruption is received wildly differently by different kinds of people. It drives some people absolutely crazy, and in these settings I&#39;ve learned to be a little more mindful and try to restrain myself from interjecting so frequently. However, for other people, it works wonderfully and we&#39;ll get into a really fast-moving conversation where less redundant information is shared.My theory is that two well-intentioned interrupters can have a pleasant conversation, and two well-intentioned waiters can have a pleasant conversation, but any pairing of an interrupter and a waiter will be disastrous unless both are very mindful of how they participate in the conversation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised no one here has mentioned the power dynamics of interruption.  It is well known in psychology that interrupting anothers speech is a way to exert power.  The boss can interrupt anyone, no one interrupts the boss.  It&#39;s one of several types of interruption:https://www.psychmechanics.com/psychology-of-interrupting/Interrupting someone can say &#34;I am more important than you&#34;.  This can also cause failures to communicate since the boss can change the subject and the interrupted speaker may never get to finish their thought.  I&#39;ve seen projects fail because a boss intentionally interrupted people who were trending in a direction they did not want to go, squashing anyone who was pointing out a major flaw in the bosses plans, which resulted in building things in a bad way and then having the flaw manifest and cause the project to fail.There are other types of interruption though that can be more supportive or more like parallel conversations.  The efficiency of those often depends on the quality of the participants memory and ability to follow multiple threads simultaneously."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool project! A true, open source alternative to Postman will be valuable. It seems like you’ve got the major elements in place.Unsolicited UX notes…I read Hacker News on mobile, so tried the app on mobile and ran into some challenges. In order to save space, eliminate the right click, and work on mobile please consider changing:    You can right click here to create a new request or a new folder

To the following (illustrated using pseudo markdown):    [Create request] or [Create a folder]

It would also be helpful to replace the GitHub star link with a link to your README. GitHub star links are problematic because they require a login that adds friction that prevents people from getting to your README page. People will login if they decide to star the project, but they might never get to your GitHub if they don’t have time to login or can’t easily login on the device where they’re reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Last time I posted this it didn&#39;t garner much interest.Looks good.  I use Postman daily and it sucks, so always open to alternatives.I don&#39;t recall what it looked like the last time you posted, but I wonder if part of the low interest is because upon arrival it doesn&#39;t instantly jump out to the visitor that this is something you can host/run locally.
It&#39;s very easy to miss the Github links top right.  And if you don&#39;t realise that, then what you see is a third party website expecting you to send your development requests through their UI, which is off-putting.As I say, I don&#39;t remember, but that may be why I skipped it last time.  I&#39;ll pay more attention this time!(Edit: split paragraphs for clarity)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always the same story. To me, it reads something like this:&gt; Child sexual abuse often happens in bathrooms. Therefore, all bathrooms should have cameras. The video feeds should be stored and analyzed for illegal behavior, and law enforcement should have access, ideally in real time and without a court order. The risk of leaks, hacking, or abuse by law enforcement or system administrators is negligible, so citizens need not worry.Historically, law enforcement has been chronically understaffed and generally ineffective enforcing these heinous crimes. Even credible and actionable reports that could lead to arrests often end up on a pile. When this system is deployed, the amount of flagged behavior will be 100x more than the reports of today, most of which will be false positives. This is ultimately what makes it obvious that these are bad faith arguments, and that the ulterior motive is good old mass surveillance."</p>

I started watching the video first and was a little troubled that the bellows appeared to be home-made, crappy looking, and not nearly as effective as they could be. Aftermarket bellows are not hard to find and are not even that expensive if you get them from China. But then I saw that he made them out of _floppy disks_ and decided that was pure genius.This also made me realize that a computer keyboard pretty closely resembles the right hand of a chromatic button accordion, so I assume that&#39;s how it&#39;s laid out.Anyway, he certainly plays this cobbled-together instrument far better than I&#39;ll ever play my analog accordion. There are MIDI and other &#34;digital&#34; accordions out there but they are either extremely expensive or limiting in terms of what you can do with them, or both.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think you&#39;re forgetting the main reason: the group of people using it to communicate is really small and shrinking every year.The only large group of people who still primarily use SMS to communicate person-to-person is Android users in the USA.Every other country has settled on either Telegram, WeChat, WhatsApp or FB Messenger, or other niche apps. These apps work on both iOS and Android and often also Windows. I haven&#39;t sent an SMS in probably 12 years. I don&#39;t know anyone who has.It&#39;s only in the US that iMessage is so prevalent that Android users have to use SMS, the only other way of messaging iOS devices. And the US is quickly becoming a de-facto iOS only country. It already has more than 50% market share, even 80% among young people.With the US going (almost) full iMessage and the rest of the world having already settled on another app there simply no point to supporting SMS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SMS was, in my opinion, the killer feature for Signal. Telling people to install yet-another-inbox which was only going to be used by their one privacy-weirdo friend was a non-starter.Saying &#34;this is a better SMS app&#34; got people on-board and let them &#34;upgrade&#34; to secure messaging.  That&#39;s why I started using it in the &#34;TextSecure&#34; days.But, sadly, I agree with Signal&#39;s reasoning here. Mixing the two protocols was annoyingly complex. If someone stopped using Signal, messages you sent to them would never arrive - with no notification.  And there&#39;s no obvious way to &#34;downgrade&#34; to SMS.I was working on RCS a decade ago. I&#39;m glad to see it is finally getting somewhere - but I&#39;m sad it is at the expense of better and more secure protocols."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once spend several euros sms-ing instead of what I thought was Signal-ing with someone in another country. Since then I keep the two strictly in 2 different apps.I certainly wont mourn for this. Sms gets super expensive to other countries (outside the EU), it also gets super expensive when you don&#39;t pre-pay for a bundle (it&#39;s 2 eur for 1000 messages, then 25ct per message after that, ridiculous). Imho dutch carriers did everything they could to kill sms, and now I&#39;m happy for it. The only bad thing is that my society at large seems to have chosen Whatsapp as it&#39;s replacement..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this point it&#39;s pretty much common knowledge that legislators engage in insider trading using nonpublic, oftentimes classified information and intelligence gathered on the taxpayer dime routinely and with no fear of political or legal repercussions.  They&#39;re not particularly motivated to close this loophole either, for reasons which should be obvious.This should be a much bigger issue, IMO.  We the People need to make them understand this blatant self dealing will not be tolerated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; That same day, while the stock market remained lofty, Dr. Auchincloss reported selling $15,001 to $50,000 of a stock mutual fund. Days later he sold two more mutual funds and a stock&gt; Dr. Auchincloss disclosed six sales of mutual funds that day, totaling between $111,006 and $315,000 in value.And&gt; The rate cuts hadn’t immediately calmed investors. Stock trading was halted for 15 minutes on the morning of March 16 when the S&amp;P 500 fell 7%, triggering a so-called circuit breaker. The index staggered to the closing bell, down 12%.&gt; That same day, Ms. Chao, the transportation secretary, made three purchases in stock funds that track the S&amp;P 500 and the U.S. stock market broadly, totaling between $600,003 and $1.2 million, according to her financial disclosures.Every time I click on one of these articles, I expect to find some individual stock trading related to specific companies on the receiving end of government action. However, when it ends up being vague examples of officials buying and selling broad-market or S&amp;P index funds, it&#39;s much harder to see where the &#34;insider trading&#34; angle comes from. Especially when we have examples of officials trading in March, a full month after the viral panic had already spread through even public forums like Twitter.The line needs to be drawn somewhere, and I&#39;m not convinced that forbidding public officials from buying and selling generic index and mutual funds is really that big of a concern, IMO.Now if someone can find evidence of government officials buying something like Moderna stock ahead of the FDA approval, then by all means let&#39;s prosecute with stiff consequences."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this topic is important in substance and the thing I&#39;m about to say is an aesthetic issue, but as an American watching this unfold I have admired the Brits for the sense of heart that still seems to be present in their politics.I&#39;m referring to the parliamentary sessions in which, even though they&#39;re savagely roasting each other, they&#39;re doing in a way that feels somehow good-hearted and doesn&#39;t lay bare the naked resentment and hatred that seems to be all we have left in the USA.Also, less amusing but still inspiring, has been articulate criticism from politicians and pundits who seem to actually care about the thing they&#39;re talking about; on this side of the Atlantic, it&#39;s easy to get the sense that anyone in front of a camera has a pile of talking points on a set of index cards in their lap that they pull out to memorize during commercial breaks.Charles Walker, giving an impromptu interview, seems to care about a thing:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What happens next will be interesting.At this point, a general election would be the obviously correct solution. It&#39;s clear that the conservative party don&#39;t have a platform and can&#39;t agree major policy points amongst themselves.However that would require conservative MPs to vote for it, which is the turkeys voting for Christmas so unlikely to happen, so I&#39;d expect we&#39;ll have to wait till 2024 for that election.The best likely outcome is that a set of senior people in the party agree a policy platform and try to steady things for now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might sound crazy... but if the UK is already de facto ruled by financial markets, in the sense that the PM has to step down if the markets don&#39;t like what they&#39;re doing, maybe it&#39;s time to try prediction market-based governance for real?What would&#39;ve happened if instead of simply announcing the proposal, Truss had described the proposal and the government had sponsored a conditional prediction market on the economic effects?She could&#39;ve run prediction markets for dozens of proposals, and selected a policy that was popular with both the markets and the public.(Lest this idea be seen as overly capitalist: there&#39;s no reason not to run a prediction market for &#34;degree to which this policy will reduce inequality&#34;, and incorporate the result into decisionmaking as well.  Imagine the irony: a bunch of rich hedge funds trying to figure out the best way to reduce inequality!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great trick and with practice you don&#39;t even need a watch, heck you don&#39;t even need an object to cast a shadow.The sun is over there, a shadow would be that way, it&#39;s about 5 o&#39;clock. That must be north!What I&#39;ve always thought of as witchcraft is this.Jab a stick in the ground, mark the end of the shadow. Come back some time later say 15-30mins. Mark the new end of the shadow.Draw a line between marks and that is an east-west line!In the Northern hemisphere the stick is south of that line, in the southern hemisphere it&#39;s North!What!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From some of the comments, I’m not sure people fully get this. It’s basically doing a geometric construction of the sun’s path across the sky, using the distance between the hour hand and the 12 on the watch face as one of the input angles in the calculation. That’s quick (important because you have to repeat it while you’re marching) and easy to remember (also important because you might need it in a situation without access to Wikipedia). Under the assumption that the sun rises at 06:00 in the exact East and sets at 18:00 in the exact West, the construction is almost perfect. Of course, that’s never exactly true in real life, but still a lot more accurate than “well I know the sun is roughly South”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this trick. You can also do this using your hands if you know roughly what time it is.For example, if it&#39;s sunny out, place your arm in your shadow, parallel to the ground. Keep it there. This arm represents the current time (say, 10 O&#39;clock).
Look at your shadow and point your other arm out, parallel to the ground, and adjust it until the arm&#39;s shadow points at &#34;12 O&#39;clock&#34; relative to your first arm (in your shadow).
Clap your hands together, and you&#39;re pointing north!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I kinda sorta see google’s side. 
There are just too many shady operators out there who will swear blind they’re completely honest, and maybe they are, but they also employed a third party to write code or maybe just imported a 3rd party lib (i am in no way saying this is the case)As to, why don’t they look at the code? bugger that being standard practise, i’m not handing over my code to google or apple.Even if they did, how to check final the uploaded binary?I’m not doubting the article, but the mobile app world is flooded with shady operators at all levels, and i don’t really buy the real paranoid arguments here"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course Google isn&#39;t going to look at the code. Most Google App Store apps are not open source, so why would that be a workflow at all?You have to evaluate those same deliverables that are downloaded to the user.To be able to infer properties of the build application from the source code review, it has to be shown that the two correspond; the shipped, built version comes from the code that was reviewed.Poring over someone&#39;s source code is a fool&#39;s errand. You will never catch everything; people find 25 year old bugs in code that have evaded all previous pairs of eyes.Google&#39;s approach here is poor though; they created these API&#39;s and permission model and now have to backpedal on it randomly.If you want untrusted applications to have access to Contacts, it should be done with abstract tokens that do not reveal any contact details. Each contact is represented by an object handle that provides every imaginable operation you might want to do to, with or by-means-of a contact.It&#39;s possible to design a system whereby some contact properties (e.g. mobilePhoneNumber) are accessible, but the result of the access is an abstract object that doesn&#39;t actually reveal the content, only represents its existence.  The user interface could be priviled so that, say, a text field widget can be given one of these opaque objects, and then display the actual phone number. The only way to get at it would be to have permission to take a screenshot, and then OCR it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not familiar with mobile app review process, would any change in code require a re-review/re-submit? If Google approved it as-is, could the developers add a few lines as an &#34;update&#34; and skip over the full review process?Seems like the ruling is being made on what can be done with the current permissions, rather than what is being done. If that&#39;s the case, I sympathize with the devs but I think I support the position Google is taking there.Off-topic comment: I use NoScript, and the entire text of the article renders for a half second before disappearing and for some inexplicable reason requiring JS to be enabled. If you can render it for that half second, why hide it? Why force me to use JS when you just proved that you can render it without?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We have been using KillBill for many years for our SaaS product.While it is very nice to own our data, we have had a huge lot of issues with it too.Beware that this is an &#34;industrial&#34; tool, meaning that it is very complex, written in Java, with a lot of quirks and sharp edges. The core team also seems to mainly  work on some closed-source version of it, for some not-very-clear-what big corp(s). They let you know sometimes that there exists a more feature-full closed-source version when asking questions in the support google group or on github issues, but it&#39;s not very transparent.If you are a startup with a small team or small budget and no real Java development skills, you&#39;ll probably want to be careful in considering to use it: many custom things you&#39;ll want to do will require contracting with one of their partners because it&#39;s too complicated to do yourself, and support will be limited, and debugging issues will be hugely complicated if you are not used to that tech stack...Just this week, we have had a major issue with it: after doing an `apt upgrade`, docker was updated and restarted. It restarted KillBill&#39;s docker images fine but KillBill itself restarted only the Stripe plugin, not the Avatax one, for an unknown reason. So the tool happily generated invoices and payments for a few hours without any taxes (!), until we noticed and started the plugin manually from the interface. This is the kind of issues we regularly have to deal with, and while the tool does a good job most of the time, it is mindblowingly annoying sometimes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Does Kill Bill support taxes?&gt; Kill Bill does not support taxes. Instead, we partner with Avalara to outsource tax compliance. Our AvaTax connector provides real-time and on-demand calculationsto prevent overcharging or undercharging tax.I expected as much. Handling taxes internationally is a major PITA and it changes all the time as politicians get new ideas how to make things even more complicated. I&#39;m pretty sure that many SaaS companies are unknowingly not compliant with all the rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Met with this team probably 8 years ago for consideration on a (at the time) large subscription product. Didn&#39;t go with it because of issues in the organization I was working with,  but KillBill folks were good people, impressive, good product. Glad to see them still around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is &#34;only&#34; two of the seven modules included in the desktop version, but even just one would be a breakthrough on the iPad.The full DaVinci Resolve is nuts: it covers a complete, Hollywood-level workflow of DAM, editing, grading, sound, and VFX (with probably the most generous freemium model in existence, by a good margin). The iPad version covers one of the two edit workflows (the one more tailored to broadcast than film) and color grading, which will cover quite a few use cases without anything else. I can especially see this being used by serious YouTubers and independent content creators.I wonder if the asset management module is planned, as that would seem to be the next-most broadly useful module."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is incredible on so many fronts. 5-10 years ago, I would choose my computer based on it&#39;s potential to edit video. A decade ago, most laptops couldn&#39;t handle the load of uncompressed video. 5 years ago, having iMovie on your Ipad allowed us to make sub &lt;5 minute videos of low-res/processed files. Now we have an intersection of 1. an Ipad is powerful enough to handle this type of data processing and 2. BMD has found ways of dealing with the huge file sizes and rendering / editing in real time. Unreal. I imagined this would come some day but not today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve long held this opinion but I consistently get drowned out.DevOps has different meaning depending on who you’re talking to, even some definitions that appear similar are different in nuanced but important ways.All “devops” as a job title has done has muddy responsibilities and given many folks the wrong impression of what an operations discipline should be.There is also a lot of rewriting of history that gets thrown in, similar to how when people talk about cloud then the only alternative is to start making CPUs by hand and begin building your own nuclear reactors. It’s the idea of what came before, not the reality, that people seem to be defensive of.It’s honestly exhausting to discuss.So instead I became CTO so I can solve this mess properly, I don’t hire devops, I hire infra engineers, build engineers, release engineers and: backend engineers.Roles so simple that you already have a clue what they do, which is sort of the point of job titles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have bewilderingly tried to discern why software development continues to grow more and more complex.It wasn’t always like this. There was a time when we talked about languages and OSes and libraries as if they made a difference on how much you could get done with as little people and cognitive load as possible (the claims were very much overrated, but the point was we acted like it mattered).And then it started ballooning. It seems to me that much of that coincides with a lot of new money being dumped into the economy, and software moving past the necessary-evil-so-how-do-I-drive-down-my-costs and on to the gold rush of you must have a web app for your service that rivals a video game in complexity and visual finesse. It seems to me that as long as their is so much free money sloshing around venture capital funding, that it was inevitable that the process of making software would complexify to soak up the extra cash. After all, you can only add so many levels and varieties of managers to add value.

That&#39;d be like driving a car by shouting directions at someone lying on the floorboards holding a wrench to the steering pinion.The job of DevOps is to build a steering wheel (and ideally, teach SWEs how to drive... at least enough that they understand what a &#34;road&#34; is and why it&#39;s a pleasant experience for everyone if you stay on it. If the road doesn&#39;t go where they need to be, then it&#39;s time to file a ticket, but that ticket had better be &#34;Build a new road,&#34; not &#34;Offroad this one car to the cabin in the woods and call it a job well done&#34;).The raw hardware of an enterprise deployment is so flexible it solves nobody&#39;s problem. DevOps is in the business of writing the operating system for a mega-computer physically represented by hundreds to possibly millions of heterogeneous computers. It&#39;s a process of continuous growth to make that work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using the web and it&#39;s services really feels more and more like tedious work which is simply not worth it anymore. I don&#39;t want to sound like some old grunt (not even 30 yet), but every modern service uses some kind of automatic banning system and everything you invested can be gone in seconds.To spice things up, all these services also stopped providing any kind of support regarding these kind of problems. Ever tried to get into contact with anybody about a banned account?Just some weeks ago Discord decided to ban my 6 year old account out of nowhere. I didn&#39;t used Discord for 4 weeks, since I was on vacation. Also I am pretty sure, that it wasn&#39;t hacked, because I used MFA and no other account was affected.I tried to contact the support, but only got a template response, that they don&#39;t talk about reasons and my account data will also be deleted in 14 days. I tried to contact them again, but they simply blocked my mail after that.I didn&#39;t do any suspicious on discord ever. So I really had no clue why this happened. While talking with friends and coworker I&#39;ve heard similar stories. And everybody of us changed their hardware multiple times beforehand (for example to test a specific component or for overclocking). Gotta love automatic banning systems..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked for a large grocery store chain between 2004 and 2010, there the AI had already taken over. Though we didn&#39;t call it an AI, just &#39;the system&#39;.The system was able to procure goods with stunning accuracy. Sometimes it even surprised us. For example: we&#39;d receive a much higher number of BBQ meat than typical, only to realise it was going to be amazing weather the coming days.The system was also making schedules for the re-stocking team with the same accuracy. It knew what it ordered, the exact time the truck was due to arrive, at which time the personnel was available (not at school, for example), etc. The system told us when to show up, and when we had to be finished.The system was even able to pinpoint cashiers that were stealing money from the register, by correlating cash count of the individual registers to the schedule (which the AI also created). It would then &#39;isolate&#39; the suspected employee to a single register and order a cash count (which was done by hand) at the end of the day.Basically the only reason why there still was a manager was for responsibility and babysitting (most employees were teens that did dumb stuff). And the occasional Karen who wanted to talk to a manager.I remember being being thoroughly impressed with the efficiency of the software back then. In some ways it must have influenced my career path (I now work in automating businesses). I left in 2010, I can only imagine how much more advanced this system has become since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this article fundamentally misunderstands the core function of middle management. You can boil it down to 2 key tasks (on the front lines of a very large organization).a) Interpreting: either top-&gt;down by explaining and enforcing corporate policy on hourly workers or bottom-&gt;up by ensuring workers enter data to be reported on correctlyb) &#34;Encouraging&#34;: an employee calls in sick, again. Neither firing them or giving them the day off every time are desirable. The managers role is to &#34;encourage&#34; the performance and attendance (in one way or another)Neither of these are low hanging fruit for automation or even middle hanging fruit for automation.edit: I would also add that the comment &#34;Union formation across the retail landscape will force corporations to reduce management head count&#34; is backwards. From a management perspective, if labor gets rowdy you need more overseers to keep them in line. More union activity = more management headcount"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a poorly reasoned or at least a poorly articulated essay. AI to this point is built to optimize some objective function. What is that function with respect to middle management? Some sort of mathematical expression would be interesting but even a plain-English expression would certainly be helpful. And what exactly are the inputs and output? I guess the inputs could be a roster of employees along with some performance metrics, and output is a list of who is kept and who is fired (?). That’s the best I can come up with, but I still think it’s an absurd and impractical eventuality. The article doesn’t even make an attempt to explain.This isn’t some sort of nitpick; AI to this point has not in any way encroached upon personnel management to my knowledge and a prediction in that direction ought to elucidate exactly how that could be expected to work. Managing workers involves empathy and understanding human emotions generally and I’ve seen no indication that AI has made advances into this space recently despite its rapid progress elsewhere."</p>

I made the decision to have the filter-list files hosted on our own domain and CDN (similar to what Adguard  does with their  filters.adtidy.org).This was done for 2 reasons:1- Avoid scenarios like this where you ship code (extension  in this case) that is hard to update. Then make that code depend on external resources outside of your control.2- Leak our users&#39; IP addresses to each random hosting provider.So the solution was simple: Run a CRON once a day then host the files ourselves.

Maybe it&#39;s extremely biased? Let the user decide! Maybe I want different news source profiles (one for serious, less biased sources; one for satire; one for local news; etc.)?What about localization? FASS.se is a popular medical database in Sweden, so I&#39;d like for those results to be displayed in my medical search profile.It would also be cool if the results in the Google column automatically filtered out the results available in the other columns. I mean, since I already have the Wikipedia results in its own column, I don&#39;t need the Google column to hand me a Wikipedia link.I&#39;ll stick to Brave search for now, but it&#39;s a cool tool!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s very good (will definitely consider moving). Some user feedback:1) Dark Mode please2) Toggleable websites; I saw that the websites I was seeing were black-circles in the panel below the search box. I instinctively tried to click on youtube to not see youtube box. It would also be nice to have a global panel where users can choose if they never want to see a certain website.But these^ are just me being super picky. Overall, a great UX."</p>

That&#39;s why you can find examples of typically huge particles inside protons.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I understand it, the reason Feynman diagrams in quantum electrodynamics (where the primary entities are electrons and photons) can be used to calculate properties very accurately is that the electromagnetic coupling constant (1/137) results in the higher-order terms in a series eventually vanishing away to nothing, while with the strong force the coupling constant is &gt;= 1, so the higher-order terms have to be included, leading to things like infinities (or at the very least, ratios of very large quantities with correspondingly large uncertainties).The strong force is a bit confusing, as it binds boths quarks with the proton and neutron, as well as binding the neutrons and protons into atomic nuclei, over short ranges (accounting for the upper size limit / stability limit of the largest nuclei).  Mesons are the force-carrying entity that bind the neutrons and protons together, but gluons are the force-carrying entity that bind the quarks together, as per this wiki article:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interactionIs it the case that theoretical strong-force calculations have just hit a dead-end and there&#39;s no way out in sight, due to the coupling constant issue?"</p>

If at all possible, include some application (or attempt at a globally) unique error code on each of your errors - i.e. YCOM-HN-9021.  When you provide a clearly googleable string you can help your users independently resolve the issue and you can also set up google alerts on the string - if you roll out a new feature that took 3 months to develop and a week later google tells you that YCOM-HN-9021 is up 9000% you probably broke something.  If at all possible make yourself open to client communication but most users won&#39;t reach out about an error - users have very low trust in customer care in the modern world (and it is, honestly, often more trouble than it&#39;s worth) and are more likely to turn to reddit/technical forums for a solution.

Once in a while, some unexpected whitespace sneaks in somewhere and this can be hard to figure out.Eg, don&#39;t just abort with &#34;Open failed: NOT_FOUND&#34;. Abort with &#34;job.c:2105 Failed to open job description file &#39;/var/spool/jobs/125.json&#39; when processing job #5 for user &#39;alice&#39;: NOT_FOUND&#34;.This way I don&#39;t have to strace the damn thing to try and figure out what&#39;s it looking for, and know which user it was for, so I don&#39;t have to dig around and try and figure out which entry in the database might contain the wrong information.Also, context-free, generic error messages are awful.

It&#39;s ideal if you can search the source code and instantly find where the error message originates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a previous job, writing unambiguous error messages was discouraged. Everything just had to be &#34;Oops! Something went wrong&#34;The reasoning was that &#34;users can&#39;t do anything with information we tell them anyways&#34;, despite the overwhelming number of help desk tickets we&#39;d get from &#34;Oops!&#34; appearing in a million different scenarios with no clear way for us to tell what error actually caused the message to appear.Users naturally report the messages that they see because they&#39;re helping us to see the problem. I didn&#39;t get why that was such a hard concept to understand"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When the iPhone launched, Apple talked a lot about how the typing system worked.What I remember is that it sounded like pretty simple lookups. As you typed, the software compared your word to, essentially, a weighted dictionary to guess what you were going to type next.If you typed “b” it was flummoxed. But if you typed “behav” it knew the next letter was almost certainly going to be “e” or “i” (for behavior). It may have been more complicated than that, but probably not much. It was 2007 and the phone CPU was not powerful.One interesting thing I remember is that they said the phone enlarged the touch targets for highly predicted next letters. For example it would be easier to type an “e” than a “w” after you had typed “behav”, because the tap boundary expanded around the “e”. Cool stuff!And if you did type behavw and hit space, it would autocorrect to behave.At some point I recall Apple announcing that they had switched autocorrect to a full machine learning implementation. Rather than a simple deterministic look-up, it was trained on a huge corpus of text, and reads the whole chunk of what you’ve written so far to make predictions. Everyone does this now, it’s how they deliver the (incredibly annoying and stupid IMO) one-tap suggestions for email and text replies. “Thanks!” “Noted.” “I’ll get right on that.”In my memory, that’s when typing got a lot more annoying on iPhones. The quality of suggestions went either down or weirdo or both. For example it just tried to sub-in “Quaker” for “quality” in the previous sentence. Why??"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, thank you for posting this, I was just thinking this!Most people here focus on autocorrect, which isn&#39;t such a big problem for me since I&#39;m used to having it off.But what the hell is wrong with the cursor placement? It is so incredibly broken, it has a mind of its own, and never goes to where I mean to put it.Simply tapping on text puts it in the wrong places, but holding and dragging cursor or holding and dragging on the spacebar to move it also works terribly, somehow it never does what I need it to.Selecting text is just as terrible.It&#39;s also impossible to put the cursor in the middle of a word. WHY NOT? Just put the cursor where I tap! It is so easy to do on Android.I find it much easier to type and move cursor on my Galaxy S9 than on my iPad mini, despite the iPad having a much bigger screen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using iPhone &gt;10 years and cannot agree more. One example: from iOS 7 (that flat UI), I began to make much more frequent typos than ever before. Before that, I didn&#39;t make much typo before the update even without looking at the keyboard but not anymore after the update. What I heard is that Apple did extensive studies on usability of virtual keyboard when it&#39;s launching iPhone and as a result keyboard visual on the screen was intentionally off from the actual layout based on actual typing patterns. And for some reason it seems they scrapped that idea, or at least changed it significantly. Don&#39;t know why. Maybe I&#39;m an outlier and everyone else is happier with the change.But this is just one example; almost every 2~3 years, I&#39;ve experienced a noticeable level of degradation of my typing accuracy, though not as much as the iOS 7 change. I wonder if there&#39;s anyone else whose experience matches to mine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once upon a time, all plane transmissions were pretty much air to ground. As inconsequential as it may seem, the positioning of antennas above the plane are a bit metaphoric for flipping things up side down. Looking out into space instead of back to earth.Also notable that SpaceX keeps finding these cool (revenue generating) use cases to further cheapen the cost of sending things up to space. Pretty much dogfooding their rockets via Starlink satellites.Edited with correction that most inflight wifi is actually air to space now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This advice is going to be hated by a lot of people but.. care less.You’re in an industry that values your skills and seems to always have demand. Whether or not that’s true in the future, it certainly is today, so the best thing you can do is put yourself first and worry less about work
as a whole. Especially if it’s not your own company.Spend more time on you, on activities with friends and family, on hobbies. If you don’t have particularly healthy hobbies, maybe start some.  Getting away from your work more and more will make it all the more bearable.These days work is close to the bottom of my list of concerns, which sounds really bad - BUT - I find I’m more productive than I’ve been in years because I’m not worrying if something takes longer than expected or is bigger than I realised. I can just enjoy the problem solving and shipping without the stress.If you’re burned out this badly I’d suggest it’s your soul’s way of telling yourself “hey this isn’t working for me”. As someone who has been to some pretty messed up depths with the anxiety monster, I’d heed that voice. Life isn’t long enough to stay stuck in a rut like this for any amount of time at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found that just moving teams and dropping a load of baggage made a huge difference and a huge improvement.I also found that regular physical exercise outside (running for me) is a game changer and totally allows your brain to disconnect.Finally, don&#39;t guilt trip yourself on your free time.  There is nothing you &#34;should&#34; be doing on your spare time.  Want to code?  Fine.  But do you really?  Want to just veg out and watch Netflix?  Also fine.  Want to do some &#34;junk food&#34; gaming?  Do it. Hang out with friends family and loved ones?  I encourage that. Don&#39;t pressure yourself about open source projects or side hustles etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can you afford a sabbatical?The term has roots in &#34;seven&#34;, just like Sabbath, so with 14 years in the industry, you&#39;ve skipped one.I think a solid half-year off every seven to ten years is an excellent practice for intellectually demanding labor.What makes it a sabbatical is that it&#39;s a change of pace which furthers your career. I&#39;d love to take a sabbatical and just work on building stuff, personally: from soldering, to designing boards, probing them, writing firmware, I&#39;m a rank amateur, and I&#39;d love to level up for awhile, while free of the burden of justifying my salary in the process.It could be painting, there&#39;s a popular author who wrote a book about the connection between painting and hacking, can&#39;t remember his name but his stuff gets posted here all the time.What it isn&#39;t, is a vacation, or a convalescence. It sounds like you haven&#39;t hit &#34;can&#39;t work&#34;, just &#34;sucks to work&#34;, which is a blessing.If you can&#39;t afford it, that&#39;s understandable, there are ways to get some of the benefit from a new job, but &#34;relieved of the burden of delivering value&#34; is an important factor.I&#39;ve known people who pushed &#34;sucks to work&#34; until it became &#34;can&#39;t work&#34;, and they don&#39;t all make it back to the profession, a bit less than half in fact. Whatever you do, I urge you to take burnout seriously, because at the limit it&#39;s a serious medical condition which can cripple or kill you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before the pandemic and surge of remote work, a lot of us complained not just about going to the office, but that the office itself was pretty crappy. The open plan creates an environment of high distraction, low privacy, and physical discomfort. Whether or not people wanted to listen to music or anything for hours at a time, they were pushed to do it just to drown out a constant background noise of words that are highly salient in your problem domain. You&#39;re probably constrained to the desk or chair set up that your office manager picked. The bottom line is you&#39;re spending a lot of time in an environment about which you may have zero input or control.At home, I can work in silence if I want. If I want background noise, I can play music on a stereo or turn on the TV in the next room. When my back hurts, I can lie down on the sofa, or stretch and foam roll in a way which would be conspicuous in the office. I can be barefoot all day if I want. I can snack on the food that I like enough to buy, without broadcasting the pretention of bringing my own food to the micro kitchen. I can eat healthier lunches than the office catered food.  Even without considering commuting, or the amount of time spent in synchronous interactions, just being able to control my own space is sooo much more comfortable. I injured my back this year, and taking care of it has been so much easier at home than it would have been in open plan hell.A bunch of that stuff is nominally compatible with being &#34;in the office&#34; -- just give me a private office, with real walls, the ability to buy my own furniture, etc. But tech long ago decided that engineers get cubicles or open plan desks, that the way you know we&#39;re working is seeing that we&#39;re looking at screens rather than seeing our actual output, that a clean modern spaceship aesthetic is more important than workers being able to control or customize their workspace. Is it that we don&#39;t value the office, or that the office has been created by people who don&#39;t value us?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you wonder why an argument might be controversial, it can helpful to imagine how it would sound like in mirror world:Assume for a moment that working remotly and a flexible workday would have been always the default. And now some companies decide: Hey let&#39;s contractually enforce a 9 hour continuous workday where all our workers will be locked in a big ugly building that we build just for that purpose (Btw. at least one of the 9 hours will be unpaid because this is where people will have lunch. Also we won&#39;t reimburse anyone for their traveling expenses or their time spent during the commute).Now read again the arguments you wrote to support this new idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I always saw tech as the field where a disproportionally large amount of people truly love what they do.You do confuse &#34;loving what they do&#34; with &#34;being at the office&#34; and &#34;socializing during slack time&#34;. I do love my job but I do hate socializing with people, which is definitely not my job. That is why I&#39;m working in IT, I don&#39;t have to socialize beyond the bare minimum to be successful. I think IT attracts introverts like me, and I do suspect we are the majority (but I have only anecdata for that).&gt; I know that &#34;the office&#34; is a bad place for a lot of people. [...] But shouldn&#39;t we rather work on fixing those things instead of making them bearable by just turning off a camera in a Zoom meeting?Things have gotten worse and worse around the office. Small one- or few-person offices gave way to cubicles, which gave way to open-plan offices, which gave way to open-plan seat-lottery not-even-your-own-desk offices. No amount of pushback changed this direction in the slightest. Meanwhile noise and interruptions got worse and worse, where in my private office people knocked politely before entering or were kept out by the DND sign, nowadays the seat lottery puts me next to a loudmouthed marketing phone-drone, who when not screaming into the mic drones on about his awesome sales statistics and his new yacht. At least the boss can&#39;t easily walk over anymore and breathe down my neck because the seat lottery put him somewhere else usually. Any and all things that have been tried to fix this are band-aids and lip-service. It only got worse and worse.WFH is great, finally a step in the right direction. I do have no sympathy for the extroverts, because they got us into the aforementioned mess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"+1 for the recommendation for &#34;The Scientist and Engineer&#39;s Guide to
Digital Signal Processing&#34; by Steven W. Smith. I spoke to Steven many
years ago about his putting all of the book PDFs online for free and
since then have recommended at least 5 university libraries to buy it
because the students could get free copies of a great book that can be
referenced in the library.FWIW the The Scientist and Engineer&#39;s Guide doesn&#39;t actually cover a
lot on sound. It starts in a particular DSP way with frequency domain
definitions and convolution - and I actually think Steven&#39;s background
is in medial imaging, though I could be mistaken."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Instagram&#39;s tagging system was actually really effective at categorizing content and discovery because each hashtag was treated as a node in a (giant) graph, where each node has multiple properties, including post count (number of posts using a tag), &#39;velocity&#39; (number of posts using a particular tag per unit time), etc. I could write up a big post about it as I made a study of it in when I created a web app for finding the most relevant tags a few years ago.All that to say there was a lot to their system and it worked because users became aware that they were rewarded for using the most relevant tags. Using irrelevant tags was punished. This guided users towards using a mix of relevant popular and niche tags to maximize their reach, which, in turn, further improved the tagging system.Instagram&#39;s tagging system isn&#39;t as important anymore as their algorithm has deemphasized it, in favor of other methods for classification and discovery, but there were a couple of golden years where it worked very well. Most users still look back on those years as the &#39;good times&#39; even if they don&#39;t know exactly why. I&#39;d go so far as to say they ruined the app after they deemphasized tags (and added way too many ads)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I adore tagging systems and have worked on them in several different applications and implementations, but there are always pitfalls and trade offs, and it’s possible to bury yourselfNowadays I nearly always store the assigned tags as an integer array column in Postgres, then use the intarray extension to handle the arbitrary boolean expression searches like “((1|2)&amp;(3)&amp;(！5))”. I still have a tags table that stores all the metadata / hierarchy / rules, but for performance I don’t use a join table. This has solved most of my problems. Supertags just expand to OR statements when I generate the expression. Performance has been excellent even with large tables thanks to pg indexing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with the Wikipedia category system a few years ago, and you could see the problems with hierarchical tagging systems right in action back then. (Though it may have gotten better in the meantime)The system appeared simple: There were just two relations, &#34;Article A is a member of category B&#34; and &#34;Category X is a subcategory of category Y&#34;.However, in practice, the community was using this system to represent a whole host of wildly different relationships between items, often with different implications what a category actually applied to.E.g., if A has a subcategory B, this could mean one of several things: B might be an additional constraint on the items in A (&#34;American writers&#34; -&gt; &#34;19th century American writers&#34;), the things in B might be more specific than the things in A: (&#34;Writers&#34; -&gt; &#34;Novelists&#34;), A might apply to the concept B, not the things in B (&#34;Occupations&#34; -&gt; &#34;Writers&#34;) or A might refer to the category B (&#34;Categories with more than 100 entries&#34; -&gt; &#34;Writers&#34;) and on and on...Of course those different aspects could even be combined. E.g. &#34;Categories with more than 100 entries&#34; might have a child &#34;Categories with more than 100 entries in need of review&#34;, which represents a constraint but might itself contain less than 100 entries...The basic question &#34;Is item X in category Y&#34; becomes impossible to answer generally, because there is no clear indication if a category only applies to its direct children or to all of its descendants or only to the subcategories itself.I&#39;m sure there are sophisticated ontological systems which would allow users to specify all those different relationships separately. I&#39;m also pretty sure that users would become sloppy after a short time or would disagree which particular relationship to use in a particular situation..."</p>

Haven&#39;t seen them but it will be filledSeriously, HN? This is the quality that you reward with hundreds of points? Unlike the author, I happen to have used this UI for the past five months and it solves many of my longstanding gripes with IntelliJ:- Gutters are now much better at highlighting local changes, while also being less visually obtrusive.- The shaded tool window background nicely separates them from the editor- Showing the git branch next to the title makes it so much easier to understand where I am, when I work with multiple projects and branches.- Breadcrumbs in the Statusbar save some space and look much cleaner---Also, many of the complaints that I&#39;ve seen in this thread are either wrong or exaggerated:- &#34;Monochrome icons&#34; - Only the toolbar icons are monochrome, everything else still uses coloured icons.- &#34;The toolbar has less icons now&#34; - It&#39;s customisable, you can put whatever you want in there. Yes, with colourful icons.- &#34;More Whitespace&#34; - The vertical space from the top of the screen to the editor is the exact same. The Project view actually looses some vertical space, but only because the font size is bigger (Which you can change obviously). The spacing between the list items is the same according to a designer on Slack.- &#34;This is just some incompetent designer pushing their agenda on us, breaking my workflow because something something trends&#34; - go touch grass.And finally, just to be clear: no, there are no animations - everything is instant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eh, I have used vim, spacemacs, sublime, vscode, atom, eclipse and netbeans. Jetbrains IDEs have superior functionality out of the box across languages and don’t require me to mess with and debug a million plugins. I don’t mind a UI refresh, it’s going to be just like the gmail refresh everyone hated it and now we’re all fine with it.I just wish they would invest more money into things that are actually a problem currently like how slow indexing is and how disruptive it is when you do a clean re-install and it indexes all your dependencies again.I have tried spacemacs which gives a lot of functionality out the box with less configuration needed than DIY vim or emacs but it still just doesn’t compare to the ease of use of Jetbrains IDEs across languages (I use Java, Python, Ruby and Typescript every week)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a situation once where we had a minor re-org and I ended up with a new manager. Literally day one, he made an attempt to change everyone&#39;s role. We were a team of developers and business analysts. He decided that everyone would become both and spend 50% of their time on each activity. Not sure why he thought this was a good idea, but he did.After he announced it, I had a 1x1 with him and clearly let him know that he was the boss and I&#39;d do my best to accomplish anything he assigned me. I also let him know that the business analyst duties didn&#39;t fit well with my skillset and that I would very likely struggle to produce output. We had a good, honest conversation about the situation and I ended up staying 100% as a developer. In the end he was happy and I was happy.Why am I telling you? It&#39;s that I&#39;ve learned it better to communicate and hopefully work things out then just pack up and head to another place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I think the concept of growth is a scam to get people to work harder for less. You can certainly grow your skill set, but intelligent people can rise to the occasion in most jobs. Including CEO/Director/High level decision making jobs.Everytime I have received some insultingly low offer from a startup, they start talking about &#34;growth&#34;, &#34;what I can own&#34;, &#34;wearing many hats&#34;. Meanwhile, the founder is sitting on some 40% equity grant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a leadership book called &#34;First Break all the Rules - What the World&#39;s Greatest Managers Do Differently&#34;.  It&#39;s data driven by a large meta-survey and research project.One of the conclusions was that, essentially, the normal instinct with Performance Management to focus on improving weaknesses is wrong and leads to sub-optimal outcomes.  The best managers actually doubled down on each individuals strengths, and simply accepted weaknesses as something to be smoothed out to the minimally acceptable level. (e.g. someone may not be &#34;good with people&#34;, but they can&#39;t be openly hostile with co-workers.)  Instead the manager would look for another employee which had that weakness as a strength, and manage responsibilities appropriately.It speaks exactly to what was wrong in OP&#39;s experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool page, though the Halting Problem brings with it a lot of stuff, so using it to prove Godel&#39;s first incompleteness theorem is (imo) a bit like cheating. I&#39;ve proven it before using diagonalization on my blog (but also using concepts like computability for free). At the end of the day, using these ideas, you get the Curry–Howard correspondence for free (which, again, is a bit like cheating).&gt; Gödel’s original proof was slightly strongerTechnically speaking, a lot stronger. Proving Godel&#39;s first incompleteness theorem (don&#39;t even get me started on the second) from first principles is actually much more involved; and certainly more difficult to make it intelligible for non-logicians."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using the halting problem here shows the consequences of the incompleteness theorem pretty well, but I don&#39;t think it explains it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things I have a hard time conveying to non-parents is that the most time-intensive parts of parenting don&#39;t last forever.I&#39;ve talked to a lot of young people who say they don&#39;t want kids because they think their personal lives will permanently halt the moment they have kids. I spend a lot of time trying to explain that:1) I still spend a lot of time with friends and can do most of my personal hobbies/activities on weekends. My wife and I are good at sharing the load. You don&#39;t need 2 parents watching kids 100% of the time.2) The sleepless nights and diaper changes are a mere blip on the scale of a lifetime with kids. You deal with it, then the kids grow up quicker than you think. Don&#39;t let the idea of the first few months/years define your entire decision for how you want to structure your family for the rest of your life.3) You actually like hanging out with your own kids. I talk to a lot of people who are anchored to some negative experience they had 10 years ago babysitting for someone else&#39;s kids, as if that was representative of parenting life. It&#39;s not at all. At the end of the day, I actually rush to finish up my work so I can have more kid time. It&#39;s fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A huge asterisk here is that this varies greatly by culture. For better or worse* certain cultures value strong family bonds and time spent with the parents, as well as bilateral support well into adulthood. Many cultures also encourage multigenerational living within a single household (or in extremely close proximity like my parents did).For example, my parents were happy to have me live at home as long as I wanted, and in fact encouraged me to stay so I could save up. Ideally in their eyes I wouldn&#39;t even move out until I was married. In my parent&#39;s culture, I&#39;m not seen as a loser or a burden because I&#39;m living with them as an adult, only if I wasn&#39;t contributing to the family&#39;s prosperity. Of course I wanted to live my own life sooner than that, but that doesn&#39;t mean I left as soon as I was 18.Because of these strong family ties I live within minutes of my parents, and still make sure to visit often, even if it&#39;s just for dinner.*Where this can breakdown is if one does not fit neatly within the boundaries and expectations set by cultural norms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it may be a true statistic, it seems to dramatically miss the boat. Time spent with a newborn, with an infant, with a four year old, with a ten year old, with a sixteen year old, with a twenty year old are not the same. You can have more interaction, more contentment, more sense of continuity, and more sense of family, in a Thanksgiving weekend spent with your adult child and their family than the entirety of your kid&#39;s first year."</p>

That said:A security reminder to anyone who is in the target audience here: if you&#39;re clever enough to have TOTP 2FA enabled on your Google account, get some cheap USB security keys and enable Advanced Protection, which completely disables non-hardware 2FA.  It requires two different tokens (and you should really get one for each computer you have/use, plus at least one offsite backup) because once enabled it actually and completely locks anyone out of the account that does not possess one of the enrolled tokens.https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/TOTP is not much better than SMS-based 2FA.  It&#39;s still vulnerable to phishing, local device malware (that attacks your TOTP in your password manager), etc.  It&#39;s best to use hardware tokens everywhere that support them, and both Google and GitHub do.  (And Google supports a special hardware token only mode which I wish more sites would adopt.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here are a few thoughts I haven&#39;t formulated before:It seems clear enough to me that training AIs on copyrighted works is typically or commonly a fair use under existing law, because the AIs can and commonly do learn non-copyrightable elements and aspects of those works. It&#39;s very obvious from enormous numbers of examples that current AI systems are capable of learning much more abstract features of human culture (grammar, concepts, facts, cultural tropes, and many others).A human being doesn&#39;t violate copyright in learning from a copyrighted work, including when that human being is later more able to produce other works based on that learning (e.g. reading fantasy novels and learning concepts, tropes, or vocabulary that one uses to produce other fantasy novels; reading a newspaper and learning facts that one incorporates into an essay; learning artistic techniques or stylistic conventions from studying existing artworks and using them when producing new artworks). Current AI systems are (amazingly) becoming capable of all of these things and may do them in ways that are somewhat akin to how human beings do them. (although I guess Jaron Lanier would object &#34;that&#39;s what they want you to think&#34;)But there are also examples in existing copyright doctrine where people accidentally repeat enough of a prior work to get in trouble for infringement -- most often with song composition (like George Harrison&#39;s &#34;My Sweet Lord&#34;) because relatively small pieces of melody (which a person might easily memorize) may be considered copyrightable.If human beings had much more accurate memories, copyright would be quite a bit more intrusive (and/or quite a bit less effective) because, following any exposure to some kinds of works, we could use our own memories to reproduce those entire works from scratch for our own use or pleasure without obtaining authorized copies from elsewhere.Computers do have such accurate memories, and machine learning systems, which are optimized for things like maximum likelihood estimation, can and do reproduce both copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of works that they&#39;ve been trained on. After all, the maximum likelihood continuation of a fragment of a text or a song is ... the complete original work. And the ability to reproduce the complete original work would, other things being equal, reduce loss in training. After all, that&#39;s something someone might specifically ask for, and if the system could oblige, it would be doing a better job of providing what the user wanted.It&#39;s relatively foreseeable that machine learning systems would potentially be able to reproduce both copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of various works, because the distinction between the two isn&#39;t especially clear from an algorithmic or mechanical point of view. (For instance, facts aren&#39;t copyrightable, but the notion of what constitutes a &#34;fact&#34; for this purpose is a culturally-bound legal notion and not at all straightforward to make precise.)But if you had a human author or artist or scholar or programmer who was &#34;trained on&#34; exposure to an enormous body of works, and that person had an exceptional eidetic memory, you could imagine that he or she would be perfectly capable of recreating many of those works from memory (and that other people might request such recreations). (Again, in music in particular, it&#39;s already routine that someone could have unambiguously copyrightable material memorized and be subject to copyright restrictions on performing songs. Like if a singer or band performs a cover from memory.)If you wanted to avoid this ability then you might need to build in an explicit notion of copyright that limits the accuracy or level of detail inside of the model in some way. This is tricky because (1) I don&#39;t think people have really tried to do this much so far, (2) copyright applies very differently to different categories of work, (3) it obviously wouldn&#39;t satisfy critics even if it mitigated the most extreme examples of &#34;regurgitation&#34;, and (4) it would be kind of weird because you would be intentionally limiting the quality and extent of learning that the system was allowed to do. (I imagine Jaron Lanier getting mad again about my repeated comparison between human learning and machine learning, and between human memory and machine memory)Some of the weirdness in point (4) is that accurate prediction is usually cool / great / impressive / accepted as an appropriate goal or capability, but if it&#39;s too accurate in certain contexts, it may be deemed a copyright infringement. Like if you said &#34;what word comes next? FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO OUR FATHERS&#34;, there&#39;s a clear correct answer and knowing it requires having a certain text memorized. OK, if you said &#34;what word comes next? MR. AND MRS. DURSLEY OF NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE WERE PROUD TO SAY&#34; ... same thing, but Bloomsbury Publishing may be unhappy if you have a system that can get all such questions right."</p>

I don&#39;t care that it reproduces copyrighted content. The only way you can get it to do that is to bait it with the function names of functions that have already been copy and pasted thousands of times onto GitHub without proper licenses.Luckily, someone will probably come out with a &#34;renegade&#34; version trained on whatever makes it a useful assistant to my coding. I won&#39;t be afraid of accidently violating copyright myself, because I won&#39;t be trying to bait it into reproducing heavily copy&amp;pasted cherrypicked examples, and I won&#39;t use 20 lines of its output with zero modification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A sizable, possibly plurality cohort of fully adult tech people is young enough to not know about United States v. Microsoft Corp. This would explain a lot of comments I see on this topic.If you don&#39;t know Microsoft&#39;s history, a lot of what more informed people are worried about seems overblown. Copilot was Microsoft&#39;s first test of people&#39;s trust after the GitHub acquisition. It&#39;s going very, very, very poorly. There were ways to do this with consent and collaboration with the people and projects it takes code from, but they&#39;re acting like classic Microsoft here.Too many people are focused on what&#39;s legal. It&#39;s fine to think of, but law is the last stop before the breakdown of society. Microsoft skipped society and went straight to sparking an inevitable test of and possible reshaping of copyright law."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m sad that this is happening to an app that&#39;s useful to its users, but the reality is that scraping is legal, always possible, but difficult.This particular case is a bit harder since it&#39;s not purely using public data, but may still qualify since it&#39;s likely scraping with legally-obtained credentials.I know of businesses (scraping for ride-sharing, scraping for business intelligence for retailers, scraping from LinkedIn - see HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn) that have continuously succeeded via scraping in ways that large businesses oppose.The key is: you must make enough profit to justify dedicating engineering and legal techniques to defend your scraping.- Scraping public data is legal, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in Van Buren v. United States [1] and HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn [2]. Defending yourself or suing the data owner in court are both expensive though- Defeating anti-scraping via technical means is pretty much always possible, but can be costly depending on the scraped site&#39;s technical expertise and value in keeping their data private. The benefit to you must exceed the cost to you, and ideally should also exceed the cost to the data owner- Mobilizing PR and internal resistance may also be effective, but it&#39;s usually hard to have outcry from a large enough group to change an organization&#39;s policies. In this case, the union can push for it, but AA may try to withhold improvements until the next set of union negotiations1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Buren_v._United_States2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really a story about a celebrity&#39;s mental illness and public breakdown. If you haven&#39;t been following the news, West has spent the week saying increasingly unhinged things, not just about politics but about Pete Davidson, his wife, and (if I&#39;m remembering right) his kids and the fake actor children that have been installed in his former home to corrupt them. He was interviewed for a show on Fox and a big chunk of what he said was edited out and later leaked; the &#34;people at the Gap&#34; knew about Uvalde, Kanye is now a Black Hebrew Israelite, &amp;c. He&#39;s quite evidently sick, and these Parler people are scamming him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Musk and everyone else is right that we do need a platform with free speech. The only problem is that all those free speech advocates are actually NIMBY&#39;s when it comes to free speech.I have been following self proclaimed free speech absolutists(because I too, believe in free speech but don&#39;t believe it exists) and they are totally not the kind of people that say &#34;I hate what you say but I will die defending your right to say it&#34;. In all places, these people are curating comments and posts to push agenda.The only somewhat free place I&#39;ve seen is 4Chan but it contains so much toxicity, that&#39;s its barely bearable.Yet again, I like that Musk and Kanye kind of people claim that they want free speech because at least we can hold them responsible when they don&#39;t deliver it. This is in contrast with the pure fascist where they cannot be held responsible for anything because they don&#39;t claim virtue in first place. It&#39;s a bit like companies doing greenwashing, which can be exposed when they don&#39;t deliver on their claimed virtues versus companies who don&#39;t even claim such virtues and instead pretend that it doesn&#39;t matter. Those who claim virtue are better even if they ultimately fail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How could an average outside observer distinguish between another&#39;s mental illness and a guy who&#39;s just a real out of the box thinker who might be wrong about many ideas but might also add value to the world by perceiving reality in an atypical way?A lot of posters are claiming Kanye is mentally ill and unable to manage his own affairs. What is the direct evidence of this? And I don&#39;t simply mean &#34;provide examples of opinions he&#39;s said that I don&#39;t understand or care for&#34;.I think it&#39;s pretty dangerous to be labeling people involved in the national dialogue as mentally ill without a diagnosis, or at least some substantial and direct evidence. This label could be weaponized by an authoritarian political movement in a very dangerous way if that&#39;s the precedent we&#39;re using."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m curious how Sci-hub&#39;s approach compares to the What.cd/Redacted approach.IIUC Sci-hub has scooped up science docs through a good enough UX that it was able to leverage the goodwill of science folks to upload docs (plus whatever other methods it has used to scoop up docs), and it uses a public blitzkrieg-style distribution mechanism. I.e., I guess if one had a big enough harddrive and a fast enough internet connection, one could start downloading the lib right now and see if they win the race against the copyright holders.On the other hand, the What.cd/Redacted approach seems to use Bittorrent ratios to create a private-tracker economy. New users get a few gigs free download on joining. But apparently because a) there&#39;s a 1:1 upload/download ratio, and b) a few first-mover fat cats are sitting on enormous ratios, this means there is a scramble by everyone else to upload new FLACs to build up their ratio so they can continue to be able to download FLACs. It seems that would mean the library-in-its-entirety cannot be easily replicated at will. Yet the tracker was apparently already nuked off the internet as What.cd and reappeared later as Redacted. Was any data lost between the two services?Oh yeah, there&#39;s also apparently another approach in rutracker, which seems to be blitzkrieg to add content and publish, at the (apparent?) cost of quality of content.It&#39;s really a shame that the nerdy, completist domain of digital archiving through torrents isn&#39;t covered by fair use. Perhaps we could exclude the most recent 10 years of music so that the hopeful young musician streamers can get paid a few hundred dollars for millions of streams and then receive the silver lining of fair use protection against a label refusing to release one of their albums."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Alexandra Elbakyan actually did not want to be revealed as the librarian behind Sci-Hub, it was her poor opsec that led to her being identified.Basically her servers were set up to emit detailed error messages from PHP, including full path of faulting source file, which was under directory /home/ringo-ring, which could be traced to a username she had online on an unrelated site, attached to her real name. Before this revelation, she was anonymous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an active hoarder I think there is problem with &#34;6. Distribution: Packaging it up in torrents, announcing it somewhere, getting people to spread it.&#34;.I miss a p2p application with torrent packaging and Kademlia like per-file advertising and discovery, where I could point it to my hefty NAS directory of random things and they could be wired to released torrents. This way we could make torrents live much longer, even partially complete. In super extra option the app could even notify me to load DVD because somebody asked for a file which I indexed and advertised previously.For years my program preferences changed, file locations changed - I have moved files around, made them offline, burned on DVDs, deleted some parts of torrent just to keep interesting stuff. Now these torrents are lost, at least my seeding contribution is gone. But I almost never change the content of these files, their checksum stays the same forever, so they could be still discoverable.The digital preservation needs better distribution system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have refused to shop at numerous stores because they make a point of not accepting cash. Cash is incredibly important for modern society due to actually being untraceable and allowing for private transactions. Plus, a society without cash is one where you are forced to use central banking. Blockchain is just trying to imitate cash digitally, which as it turns out is really hard to do. So it just ends up that people use central services anyways.The point is, cash is hard to trace. And that&#39;s a good thing. I personally refuse to shop anywhere that refuses cash, and I encourage you to do the same if possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, it&#39;s entirely built on the idea that every transaction is known by everyone. I think Lance is a bit confused.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi there - one of the few pro sellers on HN here.You&#39;re planning on prospecting into one of the most rejection-heavy domains out there with small physical business. These people get dozens of calls per day from companies they&#39;ve never heard of - many of whom are trying to rip them off - and even the best ones (Groupon, Yelp, google ads, etc.) are basically just rent-seeking. Oh, and most have gatekeepers who don&#39;t care the slightest bit about your pitch.Because of that I&#39;d stay away from all this &#34;smile and dial&#34; advice. You&#39;ll have no chance. Go out there and hit the pavement and meet these people at their establishments at off hours. If you catch the owner in there at a good time - do your best to inform them of your products benefits and come up with a really good offer to get started (something that loses you money and time). Free Trial, free month of services, whatever makes sense based on the context of your business. The goal is NOT to make money or build a book of business at this point - it&#39;s to get a person happy with your software to sell to later.If the owner is too busy or whatever - have some stuff printed out for them to read later that you can drop off. Ideally with a small gift (coffee, food, candy, etc.) and come back in a few weeks to see if you catch them at a better time (again with a gift, until they talk).A solid entry level book would be Fanatical Prospecting by Jeb Blount.Good Luck.*edit to fix book name"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be frank you&#39;ve already committed the classic blunder of developer initiated startups.  You built before you sold.  Now there&#39;s no telling if what you built is what anyone wants.IMHO, and extrapolating a lot here it&#39;s very unlikely you will get any sale based off your MVP.  It&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ve hit the right market fit without first having found customer #1.So I&#39;d back up a step and find someone with the problem you&#39;re trying to solve.  Offer the deal of a custom built solution to meet their need.  Once that&#39;s built and validated that it actually solves the problem then start selling to others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a difference between marketing and sales. You&#39;re building a solution to a problem. Marketing is about getting people who have the problem to know your solution exists. Sales is about convincing them to pay money to solve the problem.If you built the MVP but don&#39;t have customers yet, you should already have some people in mind who suffer from the problem your solution is supposed to solve. Selling is then just a conversation that loosely follows the following steps:  (a) Ask if they still have the problem
  (b) Ask if your proposed solution solves their problem
  (c) Ask them to spend money to buy your solution

Note that every step starts with &#34;ask&#34;. This means that you need to listen to their response. If they don&#39;t still have the problem, walk away. If your proposed solution doesn&#39;t solve their problem, listen to why not, and focus on improving your product until it does solve their problem (hopefully in a generic way such that your improvements will help you sell to other customers in the future). If they aren&#39;t willing to spend the price you&#39;re asking to buy a solution that they consider to be a solution to a problem they have, then find a way to add more value so that they will be willing to pay that price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Howdy, folks. Ryan here from the GitHub Copilot product team. I don’t know how the original poster’s machine was set-up, but I’m gonna throw out a few theories about what could be happening.If similar code is open in your VS Code project, Copilot can draw context from those adjacent files. This can make it appear that the public model was trained on your private code, when in fact the context is drawn from local files. For example, this is how Copilot includes variable and method names relevant to your project in suggestions.It’s also possible that your code – or very similar code – appears many times over in public repositories. While Copilot doesn’t suggest code from specific repositories, it does repeat patterns. The OpenAI codex model (from which Copilot is derived) works a lot like a translation tool. When you use Google to translate from English to Spanish, it’s not like the service has ever seen that particular sentence before. Instead, the translation service understands language patterns (i.e. syntax, semantics, common phrases). In the same way, Copilot translates from English to Python, Rust, JavaScript, etc. The model learns language patterns based on vast amounts of public data. Especially when a code fragment appears hundreds or thousands of times, the model can interpret it as a pattern. We’ve found this happens in &lt;1% of suggestions. To ensure every suggestion is unique, Copilot offers a filter to block suggestions &gt;150 characters that match public data. If you’re not already using the filter, I recommend turning it on by visiting the Copilot tab in user settings.This is a new area of development, and we’re all learning. I’m personally spending a lot of time chatting with developers, copyright experts, and community stakeholders to understand the most responsible way to leverage LLMs. My biggest take-away: LLM maintainers (like GitHub) must transparently discuss the way models are built and implemented. There’s a lot of reverse-engineering happening in the community which leads to skepticism and the occasional misunderstanding. We’ll be working to improve on that front with more blog posts from our engineers and data scientists over the coming months."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just tested it myself on a random c file I created in the middle of a rust project I&#39;m working on, it reproduced his full code verbatim from just the function header so clearly it does regurgitate proprietary code unlike some people have said, I do not have his source so co-pilot isn&#39;t just using existing context.I&#39;ve been finding co-pilot really useful but I&#39;ll be pausing it for now, and I&#39;m glad I have only been using it on personal projects and not anything for work. This crosses the line in my head from legal ambiguity to legal &#34;yeah that&#39;s gonna have to stop&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a heads-up that the person who writes this is Tim Davis[0], author of the legendary CHOLMOD solver[1], which hundreds of thousands of people use daily when they solve sparse symmetric linear systems in common numerical environments.Even if CHOLMOD is easily the best sparse symmetric solver, it is notoriously not used by scipy.linalg.solve, though, because numpy/scipy developers are anti-copyleft fundamentalists and have chosen not to use this excellent code for merely ideological  reasons... but this will not last: thanks to the copilot &#34;filtering&#34; described here, we can now recover a version of CHOLMOD unencumbered by the license that the author originaly distributed it under!  O brave new world, that has such people in it![0] https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html[1] https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love htmx and this talk is a brilliant run down of where it works well.But as always it’s about choosing the right tool for the job. Server rendered pages/fragments solve so many issues around security and time to develop a product, however it only gets you so far.Ultimately I think the decision when choosing a stack comes down to how much state you need to managed in browser. The vast majority of sites needs very little client side state management, htmx and other tools such as Alpine.js are perfect for this. But eventually as you reach a more “app like” experience with multiple layers of state control on the front end you need to reach for a front end JS framework.Now that doesn’t always mean going all in on a full SPA covering the whole of your product. It could just be a small fragment that requires that level of interaction.Point is, don’t pick a tool because it’s “in vogue”, pick one because it lets you build the best possible product as efficiently as possible. For 80% of websites that could be htmx, and for the next 15% htmx probably works for 90% of their pages. It’s the 5% where htmx is not one of the right choices at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years ago, a bright guy created something called 7 GUIs. It’s a collection of seven problems that all UI systems must successfully implement, and it was intended to act as a guide for comparisons.Unfortunately I think the author has passed away, but it would be interesting to see it rekindled and used for baseline comparisons like these.https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are four main problems in the React SPA world:- State management - hooks are awful for anything complex- Packaging + Bundling - Webpack kitchen sink, JS/TS, browser vs node vs random runtimes, packaging vs bundling, etc- Data/API binding - Adds distributed state to your data and the complexity that goes with that (cross dom reuse, caching, staleness, realtime updates, etc)- SEO/Prehydrating - Mostly applies to landing/CRM/blog type things.These &#39;old school&#39; solutions help you avoid some of these issues in favor of relocating the complexity a bit (those templates in the talk are absolutely gnarly and I&#39;m sure very bug prone) and reducing the experience. Also the API boundaries are blurred should you ever need one for non UI usage. Ignoring HackerNews taste for simpler websites, some complexity of UIs can and should only be captured with client sided javascript.With that said, after a few years of things shifting around I&#39;m really happy with the Typescript (lang) + Parcel (packaging) + MobX (state management) + Vercel (when server side rendering is needed). They&#39;ve been really stable, no fuss, always work. Especially MobX for state, absolutely game changing for the dev experience.As for the data binding problem, still sucks and my 4th attempt at solving it internally is still meh. This feels like it comes with the territory.As much as I loved my working with Django/Jinja2/etc, I think theres a light at  the end of this tunnel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"After seeing this, I can&#39;t be the only one who got curious as to how many emojis there actually are on iOS.Obviously, a quick google doesn&#39;t work right now.So I did this to try to figure out: emojipedia.org, the site that supposedly breaks google, has a page that appears to show all the available emojis on iOS [1]. On this page, all except the first 21 emojis are displayed in a way that uses lazy loading of the images. These images are contained in &lt;li class=&#34;lazyparent&#34;&gt; elements. Assuming that there are no other &lt;li class=&#34;lazyparent&#34;&gt; elements on the page, we should get the number of emojis on iOS simply by counting those elements.Opening up the console and running  document.getElementsByClassName(&#39;lazyparent&#39;).length

gives us 4037. So the total number of emojis on iOS should be 4037 + 21 = 4058. If the above method is correct, that is.[1] https://emojipedia.org/apple/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"[Firebase founder]I no longer work at Firebase / Google, but two points:1. There may be issues with the GCP integrations &amp; UX/DX, but GCP integration is good for many customers and necessary for the future of the business.One of the common failure modes for the 2011-2014 crop of Backend-as-a-Service offerings was their inability to technically support large customers. The economics of developer tooling are a super-power-law. So, if you hope to pay your employees you&#39;ll need to grow with your biggest customers.Eventually, as they become TheNextBigThing, your biggest customers end up wanting the bells and whistles that only a Big Cloud Platform provide.This was a part of the reason we chose to join Google, and why the Firebase team really really really pushed hard to integrate with GCP at a project, billing, and product level (philosophy: Firebase exposed the product from the client, GCP from the server) despite all the organizational/political overhead.2. I&#39;m excited to see the current crop of app platforms emerge. It has been 10 years since we launched (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3832877) and there are now some great innovations in the space. I like the way Supabase (https://supabase.com/) has exposed Postgres and InstantDB (https://www.instantdb.com) graphdb+realtime is really promising."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny because Google pretty much invented this model that users want and love. App Engine was launched in 2008, before GCP, before docker and before Cloud was a term, basically. It had a globally replicated persistence layer, job queues, auth, scale to 0, a generous free tier, a fully fledged local dev server and a single command to deploy, and all config lived in a single file. At the time it was really innovative, and attracted a lot of hip startup- and college grad types.The reason people liked it is, imo, because it was a single product with multiple features. GCP OTOH, has been about decoupling (or loosely coupling) the product suite, and users are supposed to pick and choose from a giant array of half-products. Simply being aware of all products, their interoperability and predicting the cost is a full time job, easily (it&#39;s mostly large enterprise who can absorb that cost). There&#39;s nothing wrong with the pick-and-choose model, if your products are simple, low level, and interoperable. But the product suite has grown organically, seemingly without coherence, so there&#39;s very little in terms of paved paths to walk – it&#39;s so confusing. When a shining star like Firebase comes along (2014) Google clearly knows not to mess with it too much. But even Firebase isn&#39;t strong enough to resist the gravitational pull of the GCP behemoth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, Firebase is mostly about convenience/development ease:
1. Authentication? Firebase Authentication2. Database? Firebase Cloud Firestore. Sometimes, you don&#39;t need SQL.3. Push notification? Firebase Cloud Messaging4. File storage? Firebase Cloud StorageAll of my needs are served by single platform. Seems like Supabase handles all of them, except #3. Let&#39;s try :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was electrifying. Understand that by 1984 there were millions of Americans using computers with a command line interface. While they could all do game graphics, you always started out in text mode and had to learn incantations that are familiar to many users of this site but which are no longer a part of most users’ daily life: dir, cd, del, etc.Seeing how dramatically different a computer experience could be was like opening a door to an alternate universe for people. The day after the Super Bowl in 1984 when their famous big Brother commercial ran, my girlfriend’s computer-illiterate father announced to us “I know how to use a computer now” and of course I knew exactly why."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is also my experience dealing with unions.  Management is legally required to make concessions during collective bargaining, so anything that can be considered an improvement to mandatory bargaining topics (pay, benefits, or working conditions) gets held back for the contract negotiation.In one case, management wanted to purchase sit/stand workstations for employees, but HR pointed out that this was a change to working conditions and should be included in the collective bargaining negotiation.  However management had already started taking measurements for the tables, so the union knew what management was intending.  During the negotiations, the union decided to try and call HR&#39;s bluff and refused to ask for the workstations as a concession.  So in the end, the whole plan was scrapped so that HR would have concessions available for future negotiations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"- Why did my store not get this new benefit that other non-unionized stores are getting?- Why was my store not affected by layoffs but other stores in the area were?- Why was my raise X% but employees at other stores got Y%?The answer to all of these is the same – you will get exactly what is in your collective bargaining agreement, not a penny more or less. If you want more perks, ask your union reps to bring it up in the next contract negotiation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main benefit mentioned in the article is a $400 annual credit to Coursera.  Everything else is &#34;some education&#34; or &#34;some doctors&#34;, which usually translates to practically nothing useful.They should have found out what the average pay is for union vs non-union, and then compared if the new benefits actually translated to something meaningful.My guess is that the union members earn more than $400/yr in cash, and then they can spend it on whatever they want - education, doctors, whatever."</p>

What if most women don&#39;t do science because they are smart?Young people don&#39;t care about the numbers, they are impressed by success, and bios of most obscure figures doing science, lets face the ugly truth... aren&#39;t good models of success.We are fixing the wrong problem here, with too simplistic premises (the problem is that people is ignorant / that we don&#39;t have exactly the same number of people in each demographic category doing science / That everybody should have the same interests and goals and think in the same way)When the real problem to address is that working conditions in science are, often, terrible and that our society punish people in many different ways for wanting to be scientists"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last I heard, Wikipedia doesn&#39;t want to carry an article for every university professor or scientist who has published some papers. In glancing through Wade&#39;s entries, it seems like many of them are just published scholars without any additional notability. I wonder if Wikipedia&#39;s notability rules are being uniformly respected here, or are they being selectively applied based on the gender of the person?I think it&#39;s great that Wade is bringing more visibility to lesser-known female scientists, but if we are valuing that, I think we should do so regardless of the subject&#39;s identity. Maybe Wikipedia should relax its notability rules a bit for scholars.If you are inspired to downvote this, I would be curious to know if you disagree with my proposal, or just dislike that I brought up the issue at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There seems to be a lot of confusion in this discussion about what the change is and how egrep and fgrep work. These are not symlinks like some have suggested but rather shell scripts. You can see the exact commit diff here:https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=grep.git;a=blobdiff;f...I remember around ~10 years ago being told &#34;you should never use `egrep` because it is slower than `grep -E`.&#34; precisely because the former requires extra forks() compared to the latter. However I&#39;d counter that advice saying &#34;if you&#39;re concerned about the performance of forks() then why are you running your code as a shell script to begin with?&#34;... and I stand by that assessment now. In fact it would probably take me longer to type `-E` than it would for any modern system to run fork() (and I&#39;m sure as hell not planning on using `grep` inside any hot loops!)I think what will likely happen here is that distro maintainers will either remove that warning themselves or take ownership of the `egrep` and `fgrep` shell scripts. I&#39;d be surprised if that warning made its way to the mainstream distros. I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the GNU grep maintainers did a u-turn on this change -- though it has already been committed to git for more than a year now and this is the first I&#39;ve heard people complain about the change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use fgrep all the time.  Why should I spend time converting scripts, and retraining my fingers, and forever after taking longer to type grep -F?  This is a breaking change that has no upside, only downside.  It is idiocy.Just to elaborate, there must be many thousands (hundreds of thousands? millions?) of shell scripts out there that use fgrep.  For no reason at all (whatever maintenance burden fgrep represents must be far outweighed by the time wasted debating this issue), these scripts will no longer work.  There is no guarantee that defining an alias somewhere is going to fix all your usages of fgrep.  And even if it did, the cost for every single installation that is affected of someone realizing there is a problem, finding the source of the problem, figuring out that an alias will fix it, making sure that that alias gets preserved after updates, and testing that everything now works will exceed the benefit to the maintainers of grep (which is actually negative, as explained above).  So looked at from a community-wide perspective, the cost is many thousands of times greater than any possible (but actually non-existent) benefit.And as the post mentions, there are also all the books, and all the stackoverflow answers, that use fgrep, and which will now have non-working code.As for the argument that this is open-source software maintained by volunteers, who can therefore do whatever they wish - if you are a maintainer of widely-used open-source software, and decide that you personally are not interested in working in a manner that benefits the community of users, then you should resign and let someone else take over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On my system, egrep and fgrep are _already_ shell scripts, just changed to add the stupid warning:    $ cat =egrep =fgrep
    #!/bin/sh
    cmd=${0##*/}
    echo &#34;$cmd: warning: $cmd is obsolescent; using grep -E&#34; &gt;&amp;2
    exec grep -E &#34;$@&#34;
    #!/bin/sh
    cmd=${0##*/}
    echo &#34;$cmd: warning: $cmd is obsolescent; using grep -F&#34; &gt;&amp;2
    exec grep -F &#34;$@&#34;

Looking at src/egrep.sh in the git repo[1], I see that before this warning was added in 2021, the last change was back in 2015. In fact, since the git repo history began in 1998, there have been a total of 4 changes to this file. Clearly the maintenance burden of these scripts is not sufficient to require the maintainers to drop them. My guess... this is being done out of some weird sense of purity over practicality. Bad call by Paul Eggert IMO[2].1: https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=grep2: commit a9515624709865d480e3142fd959bccd1c9372d1 added the warnings"</p>

One of the songs we’ve used is, aptly, America by Simon and Garfunkel.There are a bunch of books about hitchhiking across America. We have hitched a few rides ourselves. We picked up one called The Last American Hitchhiker by Mark Kneeskern, that we read aloud to each other during journeys. Fascinating vignettes of the culture across the continent.Thanks for the fun game and for bringing back some memories."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay so I got to the wrap-up at the end, about &#34;why did nobody else find this&#34;, the author sets up some logical dominoes but doesn&#39;t knock them down. Allow me to try:Earlier in the article, the author mentions that they recently upgraded some network hardware, and the problem seemed to become more frequent after that.Packet loss or other network issues would force the stack to fall out of fast-path and update the counter, avoiding the bug.Running over ssh would avoid the bug. The only time you&#39;d run rsync not over ssh would be within your own network.So it sounds like (this is my conjecture here) this would only appear to someone running rsync internally, over a high-performance network with no packet loss, and upgrading the switches might&#39;ve finally gotten the network good enough to expose the bug?"</p>

What if Westinghouse had just completely failed and ceased operations?  Who would support the remainder of projects like Vogtle 3 &amp; 4, and ongoing maintenance for the next however-many decades?I guess a company in a heavily-regulated sector like this must have some sort of succession plan, but it&#39;s not clear to me how this would work, in the case of e.g. the company going bankrupt, and all the staff with institutional knowledge about a reactor design dispersing to various other companies.

Websites, though, can still use analytics APIs, including things like Google Analytics, to track you within that Incognito Mode session. They may also be able to correlate you by, for example, matching your IP address. And, to be clear, the Incognito Mode new window has always made this clear.I can still be really concerned about Google&#39;s overall tracking and also point out this lawsuit is a bullshit money grab from lawyers hoping for a lotto payout."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(I work on Stripe Billing).  This is a question we raise fairly regularly internally at Stripe. The real, prosaic answer is because when we started working on Stripe Billing in 2017, Stripe had already built an internal billing system to bill its own customers. Stripe was 7 years old at that point.At the time, we got lots of feedback from the folks who had built that system. Our goal was to build a flexible billing system for all kinds of companies at different sizes, but we were definitely focused on smaller (doing maybe $100k–$10M of ARR) SaaS companies to start. We&#39;ve come a long way since then and now power billing for a number of large/public companies. Atlassian, Figma, Notion and Slack are either using or migrating onto Stripe Billing today.Stripe Billing is a powerful tool with a role to play in any company&#39;s revenue management system, including Stripe&#39;s. Newer Stripe products (such as Atlas) do build on top of Stripe Billing but we haven&#39;t gotten around to migrating our existing stack. That said, I do have a personal goal of taking on more internal billing responsibilities over time (e.g. I think we could easily use Stripe Invoices internally today, and it&#39;s mostly opportunity cost keeping us from actually doing so).I do want to say that the specific use case covered in the post is something we have thought about a lot. I think about it as a pipeline with stages for collecting high volumes of usage events, aggregating them, mapping them to rate cards based on usage, and then producing recurring bills, collecting payment, dunning, etc... The post claims we don’t do a good job on the first two stages (collecting usage events and aggregating them) is perhaps missing that the style of percentage-based fees is a one-line addition to a Connect integration as my colleague edwinwee mentioned below.  It is also possible to have a scalable usage event collection/aggregation pipeline integrated with Stripe Billing.  You can read this AWS blog post https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/building-a-third-party-saas... for information about how to build such a system according to our best practices.While I’m here, I’m always eager to hear feedback on Stripe Billing from folks who are using it.  My email is ark@stripe.com."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work at an HR/Payroll company with a phenomenal app that we put our blood, sweat, and tears into every single day. And every single day I clock in with Oracle Time and Labor. There&#39;s a legal reason for this and we do it for compliance. I&#39;m guessing Stripe is in the same boat with this product despite its flaws."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First off, yes, Stripe uses Stripe to bill our own customers. In fact, for our larger customers who have negotiated complex pricing plans, we&#39;re currently migrating much of our manual billing to a system that&#39;s inspired by Stripe Billing.Second, this article seems to miss the point of Stripe. It seems to want to build a platform, which is what Stripe Connect is designed for.For example, charging a percentage fee is just one line (https://stripe.com/docs/api/application_fees):` $application_fee_percent = 5`Slack, Atlassian, and Notion have all built their B2B billing on top of Stripe. But we don&#39;t target just B2B or B2C ecommerce in case a business has multiple revenue streams (which many businesses are increasingly adding). In fact, we designed Billing so it can flex across any business model—per-seat, usage-based, tiered, or even graduated.This is the point of Stripe. A single stack that flexes with your business as it grows and pricing that&#39;s public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that isn&#39;t really covered in this article is relevance calculations.A surprising (to me) thing about PostgreSQL FTS is that it doesn&#39;t do TF/IDF or BM25 relevance calculations.These calculations take statistics about the entire corpus into account - they do things like ranking a document higher if it contains terms from the search which are statistically rare in the overall corpus.PostgreSQL FTS uses how often the search terms appear in the document as part of the ranking score, but doesn&#39;t look at how common/rare individual terms are. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls....OpenSearch/Elasticsearch uses BM25: https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/expla...SQLite stores these kinds of statistics and can support BM25 or TF/IDF or custom ranking functions. I wrote more about that here: https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-releva...Meilisearch does something a bit different (on reading this I don&#39;t think it considers full corpus statistics, but I may be misinterpreting that): https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/relevancy.h...It looks like Typesense only considers the documents, not the overall corpus: https://typesense.org/docs/guide/ranking-and-relevance.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case you skip to the comments like I usually do, this post is a light comparison of Postgres FTS vs:  - MeiliSearch: https://www.meilisearch.com/
  - OpenSearch: https://opensearch.org/
  - SQLite FTS: https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html
  - Typesense: https://typesense.org/

Some of the callouts from the results:  - Even when consuming similar content, engines can produce different results, but generally ratios between queries on the same engine should be consistent.
  - Postgres FTS is quite close performance-wise to many other solutions, at least in their default configuration.
  - Only Typesense and MeiliSearch properly handled mis-spellings (the &#34;suprman&#34; query).
  - Typesense was relatively strict with matches compared to other engines.
  - OpenSearch was very fast with ingest, but also failed with the misspelling out of the box.
  - In-memory SQLite is by far the fastest, and PG isn&#39;t too far behind for this small data set."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty much all these engines (and PG) are fast enough.Gist/Gin indexes are great and do a fine job to make millions of records searchable in very few milliseconds.The problem is accuracy.I’ve tried a few of these and accuracy is wildly different with most of them.Accuracy depends on how much you index.For example, even with decently designed weighting: If you index title, subtitle, tags and content — too much of content ruin relevancy.And yes, we have proper relevancy sorting setup nicely.The best is something like elastic search, but it does not integrate nicely with PG for our use case. Because of the multi tenant nature of our data setup.PG will get us to that magic 80% but that leaves the all important 20% which is not great.Not to mention the inability to index and search Asian character sets.So even though we exclusively use it, it’s not great and every time our team can’t find something that drives my team into the Psql CLI — I start searching for alternatives again.The big brick wall is updating, inserting and deleting from an external solution fast enough so we don’t miss stuff.And quickly searching multi tenant records in that external solution.And no I’m not ready to use ES as my primary database."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey HN!Plane came from our desire to build tools that have the low friction to use of running in the browser, but use more memory and compute than the browser will allocate. The basic idea is to run a remote background process, connect to it over WebSocket, and stream data.This ends up being a surprisingly useful primitive to have, and it&#39;s been used to:- Pixel-stream X11 applications to the browser over WebRTC[1]- Run IDEs and notebooks- Power Figma-style realtime collaboration backends (including https://rayon.design).Here&#39;s a direct link to our repo: https://github.com/drifting-in-space/plane and docs: https://plane.dev/[1] https://twitter.com/drifting_corp/status/1552773567649091584"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A related and also very useful usage pattern: &#34;backend instance per customer&#34;.Because…There are many ways to implement multi-tenant SaaS; but a highly underrated approach is to write a single tenant app, then use infrastructure to run an instance of it per (currently logged in) customer. Plus a persistent database per customer of course.This has the tremendous advantage that you can add another column to your pricing page easily: the &#34;bring a truckload of money and we will set you up to run this behind your firewall&#34; tier. There are still a lot of orgs out there, large ones with considerable financial capacity, who really want this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The implementation makes some weird choices like rebuilding a bunch of services like DNS, cert, weird dependency on SQLite. Wish people would stop reimplementing Kubernetes and just build on top of it.I think &#34;per-user&#34; is probably the wrong killer feature for something like this. Much more potential in shared distributed processes that support multiple users (chat, CRDT/coauthoring). Appears that the underlying layer can probably do that.In any case, super cool idea, and I hope something like this lands in the serverless platforms from all the major cloud providers. It&#39;s always been mind blowing to me that Google Cloud Functions supports websockets without allowing you to route multiple incoming connections from different users to the same process. That simple change would unlock so many useful scenarios."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something similar happened to the cod fishing industry in Newfoundland and other parts of eastern Canada 30 years ago. The reason: overfishing, due in large part to technological advances. Here&#39;s what happened:Canada and NAFO continued to overestimate the abundance of cod in the Atlantic Ocean and therefore continued to set dangerously high [Total Allowable Catches]. This was in large part due to the widespread practice of calculating cod populations from catch rates in the commercial fishery – if fishers filled their quotas with ease, then officials believed the stock size was at adequately high levels. However, fishing technology had become so efficient by the 1970s that commercial catch rates remained high even as the cod population dropped to dangerously low levels. Electronic tracking devices could find fish no matter how small their numbers and trawlers could harvest most species with relative ease. ...Although overfishing in international waters did tremendous damage to northern cod, Canada also failed to maintain a sustainable fishery within its 200-mile limit. The government ignored warnings from inshore fishers and university scientists that cod stocks were in danger and chose to maintain quotas instead of scaling back the fishery, in large part to prevent economic losses and massive unemployment.By the early 1990s, after decades of sustained intensive fishing from Canadian and international fleets, the northern cod stocks collapsed. The spawning biomass of northern cod had dropped by about 93 per cent in only 30 years – from 1.6 million tonnes in 1962 to between 72,000 and 110,000 tonnes in 1992. In July of that year, Canada imposed a moratorium on the catching of northern cod and ended an international industry that had endured for close to 500 years.https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/economy/moratorium.phpThey called off the season in 1992 and it never came back. A pillar of the local economy in the Maritimes was wrecked.As for climate change and its impact on East Coast fishing, I&#39;ve read that lobster fishing is no longer a viable industry in Long Island and it&#39;s declining in southern New England as waters get warmer and the lobsters permanently migrate north."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overfishing is a classic problem of &#34;Tragedy of the Commons&#34;. The oceans are the commons.For example, nobody is predicting a catastrophic decline in the population of pigs, chickens, and cattle.Fish farming is the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"King Salmon fishing was shut down in much of Alaska this season as well. I was there during the time and driving through the Kenai Peninsula was much different than previous years. Normally, you&#39;ll see people lined up on the river all over the place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new coalition government has pledged $40B (approximately the market cap of Twitter, heh) in loan guarantees for nuclear power construction.They have also pledged to create legal guarantees that future politicians will not be able to shut down functioning nuclear power reactors without suitable monetary compensation to the owners/operators of these reactors.In addition to this, they are commissioning an urgent study on how to rebuild Ringhals 1 and 2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringhals_Nuclear_Power_Plant, about 1 GW each), two nuclear reactors that were prematurely decommissioned by the previous social-democratic government and shut down about 20 months ago.Personally I&#39;m really happy; I think massive expansion of 
 nuclear power is the only realistic way to fix climate change.The first reactors built will be modern but traditionally large. From then on: There has been a lot of interest in small modular reactors (SMR) from the political party that is driving all of this, and they actually got the nationally owned energy company Vattenfall to begin building prototypes at Ringhals a few months ago.In summary: Lots of champagne bottles popping tonight in Sweden in the homes of clean nuclear power proponents. We have been waiting for this for a very long time. Cheers!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit of context, the south area which this reactor is suggested to be built in has occasionally a 1000% electricity higher price from the northern regions. A big reason for this is that prices in the south is highly connected to markets that the south region is connected to, and those region are heavily importers of electricity creating a higher demand than there is available of cheap energy. For example, in order to address this there is a oil power plant operating basically 24/7 and does so very profitably even with high oil prices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something about this just seems very odd to me.As someone who grew up in the global South, this reads to me like a person from a privileged background trying to relate to the everyday people in other places and the marginalized- but it comes off sounding like a lot of projectionand assumptions- it would read much better if the conclusions were accompanied with dialogue from people, maybe explanations of where those statements are coming from.&gt;I don’t travel like most people do
I would think most travel is done by a wealthy few, but most travelers aren&#39;t wealthy- if that makes sense? It sounds like the &#34;travel&#34; being referred to here is &#34;flying somewhere and being a tourist&#34; but in fact to many people &#34;travel&#34; means taking the train/bus to another city, staying in a hostel, wandering around. Most people who go to see a wonder of the world do it because this might be the one time in their life they can afford to visit NYC, a place many people dream of seeing, and so they want to experience those things that are iconic there. I guess it really stands out to me, this writing sounds like &#34;I&#39;m not like those other stereotypical tourists&#34; and the stereotypes are those behaviors associated with privileged westerners- which isn&#39;t really an accurate representation of most travelers.From the Istanbul post:&gt;Most Turks are not secular though, and neither are they religious nuts like them ArabsHe considers education by traveling as sufficient, which I believe is not the best approach. Might be a good idea to read up a little about the history and cultures of a region before going.There is a lot going on with his writing that comes off ethnocentric, uninformed, insensitive. I&#39;m not going to dissect it, but I&#39;ll just say I recommend familiarization with cultural geography, anthropology, and ethnography if the topic of understanding people in different places interests you- because this blog is rife with problematic bias and some really broad generalizations that are prejudice at best, racism at worst."</p>

Just wanted to point out that Chris Arnade has done quite compelling photo journalism based on his way of engaging with communities, so what might seem like non sequitors or edge lord stuff might be in service of an implicit goal of his that most travelers don&#39;t share. Not that he does himself any favors with some of the framing.Highly recommend his book Dignity. https://www.amazon.com/Dignity-Seeking-Respect-Back-America/...Some of his work in the Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-arnade"</p>

This specific visit happened in 2018 IIRC. My eyes should have been opened after 2013/BLM but they weren&#39;t, what I saw/heard was shocking and completely altered my perception of the police, my mind was fertile ground for when 2020 rolled around.At of mid-2020 I was in full support of police reform but resisted &#34;ACAB&#34;. At this point no sane people could support the police and I fervently believe ACAB, the is no reform for this horribly broken system.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those not in the know the &#34;4080 12GB&#34; as compared to the 4080 16GB was not just the same card with a little less RAM, as you might assume from the name. It also had ~20% fewer GPU cores and was significantly slower for that reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My two cents on Nvidia&#39;s rollback reasoning:4080 12GB was universally panned. The 40 series launch also got heat for price gouging, particularly the higher cost for the low end of the launch (4080 12GB). They had to raise the cost of the lower end of the 40 series though if they wanted to maintain the value of the 30 series cards and clear out the remaining inventory. They couldn&#39;t just release a true 4070 for a true 4070 price. While the name was obviously bad, it seems likely that they wanted to obscure the release of a 4070-quality chip for a 4080-price while attempting to sell off remaining 30 series. Pure speculation: maybe they were hoping a &#34;cheaper 4080&#34; would come across to the uninformed as Nvidia trying to lower the entry cost for 40 series rather than raising it through an expensive 4070.Two potential reasons for the rollback come to mind:
1) higher than expected 4090 demand means they can wait to launch a 4070.
2) higher than expected heat for the thinly veiled 4070 price gouging made it worth it to wait on the release since it helps sell more 30 series cards by raising the entry price for a 40 series while getting better PR in the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just that the 12 GB 4080 was a confusing name - it wasn&#39;t the same class of card, at all.In previous generations when they&#39;ve had differing memory sizes for the same card, that was the ONLY change. So, it was useful for something like CUDA, but usually not for gaming. A specific audience.For the 4080, the 12GB version has the following changes:* 12GB VRAM vs. 16GB VRAM (the obvious one from the name)* 7,680 CUDA cores vs. 9,728 CUDA cores for the 16 GB.* 192-bit memory bus vs. 256-bit memory bus (understandable, since this scales with memory size... but also probably means the memory itself is slower).This isn&#39;t just a different amount of memory, it is fundamentally a different product and should be marketed as such. Instead it&#39;s Nvidia being greedy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Scientists used to use anagrams to register scientific discoveries without revealing them. Hooke registered his law of elastic extension using the letters &#34;ceiiinosssttuv”, which he later revealed to unscramble into &#34;ut tensio, sic vis&#34; (&#34;as the tension, so the force&#34;).People did try to brute-force the anagrams. On two occasions, Kepler unscrambled analgrams from Galileo into the statements that (i) Mars has two moons and (ii) Jupiter has red spots. Bizaarely, both turned out to be true facts, but not what Galileo&#39;s anagrams were about!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish there was a Missing Semester of Linear Algebra course to help people go from &#34;Okay I have a course or two in linear algebra, I know what span, vectors, basis and dimension mean, the formal definition of an inner product space, and I can do Gauss-Jordan elimination, determinants and eigenvalues for small matrices with paper and pencil&#34; to &#34;I have a 100x100 matrix of noisy data from sensors and this research paper I found tells me I can do some fantastic stuff if I compute such-and-such involving eigenvalues or inverses or whatnot.  Or maybe I have a process with 1000 states where I know the probability objects move from state i to state j for each pair (i, j) and I want to find the steady state.  How do I wrangle numpy into doing what I need?&#34;MIT has a course called The Missing Semester of Your CS Education [1].  It tells you about practical stuff that you need to know but isn&#39;t really taught in classes (shells, version control, build systems, package managers, VM&#39;s).There needs to be something similar for linear algebra, it seems like there&#39;s a lot of folk knowledge and a big gap between what typical undergrad courses train you to do and what you encounter in actual practical problems.(And don&#39;t get me started on all the weird linear algebra stuff they have going on in e.g. quantum physics.)[1] https://missing.csail.mit.edu/about/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prof Higham has quite the list of papers on the finer points of numerical algorithms going back to his MSc in 1983:http://www.ma.man.ac.uk/~higham/papers/bibbase.phpincluding a brief note on the comparing &#34;Top 10 Algorithms in Applied Mathematics&#34; between 2000 and 2016 that may interest some:https://nhigham.com/2016/03/29/the-top-10-algorithms-in-appl...It&#39;d be nice to see some meat on the bones and a few ripping yarns about the application end of applied math techniques .. eg: forming an enhanced image from tens (or hundreds) of thousands of multichannel spectral samples using a sensitivity adjusted SVD, and then removing the most common expected background to highlight the anomalies.It&#39;s dry stuff in Linear Algebra, somewhat more exciting when searching for nuclear weapons in a forest or gold in a desert."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can we please stop running network drivers and network stacks in kernel mode by default? It&#39;s 2022 and we&#39;ve got more than enough compute power nowadays that the performance hit for running these in user-land is negligible for most use cases. Smartphone, tablet or laptop users usually do not need the level of performance that requires running that stuff in the kernel when browsing the web.I get that there are some use cases where performance really matters to the point where kernel network stack and drivers make a difference (high-throughput and/or low-latency services running on servers, high-performance routers...), but that should not be the default for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Could someone more knowledgeable than me comment if this is as worse as it looks?As I understood the issues, this will probably lot&#39;s of &#34;fun&#34;. You can broadcast the pcap files with any monitor mode capable wifi router. Luckily it&#39;s 5.1+ so most devices run very old vendor patched kernels and are probably not affected but at least for causing havoc this is really bad. As one issue is using beacon frames just a scan for networks should be enough for a crash. So you can at least crash and maybe exploit any device running recent Linux that scans for wifi networks.I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s possible to do over the air remote code execution but I guess people are working on this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like these are all in mac80211. I&#39;m not 100% familiar with the intimate details of 802.11 but I have read the relevant parts of the standard, at least enough to RE some drivers, and a lot of things were clearly designed to be fixed and of a definite size so as to be implementable on a highly constrained embedded environment, so to see things like use-after-frees appear is a little disappointing."</p>
