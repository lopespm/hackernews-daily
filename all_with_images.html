								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in charge of sourcing components for multiple companies right now.  I believe they could double (100%) prices and companies would pay it.  There&#39;s chips that I&#39;m sourcing from obscure places in China just to get the part and paying whatever price they ask.Designers are getting overwhelmed because they&#39;re having to redesign boards for components that are available, only to realize by the time they finish the changes, the part they redesigned for is also out of stock.There&#39;s been some talk of a Chip-induced cold war, and I would say that&#39;s not crazy given the market conditions. I also love the guy who posts here all the time saying he works for the company that makes the machines that makes the chips and they can&#39;t make more machines because they don&#39;t have the chips that go in them.  XD"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Supply shortage is another way of saying demand excess. I don’t see much evidence that TSMC ever really slowed production, at least for their most advanced processes that are in high demand.This is yet another way we’re all forced to pay the price for cryptocurrency. As long as GPUs are profitable for mining, they will be purchased and put to work. The saddest part is that each additional GPU added to the mining networks only makes the overall system less efficient. Mining difficulty is automatically adjusted upward to cancel out the additional computing power. The networks processed just as many transactions last year as they do now, but countless new GPUs have been added to the mining network due to the incentive structure of mining. It’s a race to the bottom, consuming ever more GPUs and energy until equilibrium is reached.It’s frustrating to watch so much of the output of our most advanced chip manufacturing be diverted straight into making arbitrary proof-of-work systems less efficient so someone can capture incrementally more coins. And now we must all pay higher prices for everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. This is specifically mainstream node, or everything except leading edge 3nm / 5nm.2. Those price has been like that for sometime since the chip shortage. They just make it official now.3. The mainstream and social media will and always have been blaming it on TSMC.4. Everyone wants all the capacity they need, while not paying a cent more. This announcement will &#34;somehow&#34; made it fair for everyone in the industry.5. The current component price has very little to do with wafer pricing. As with all commodity pricing, they will only swing back once supply catches up.6. In general I think this is a good, TSMC has been leaving far too much money on the table and benefiting GF and SMIC."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We should also make caniusebutdoesitactuallyworkThis to refer to my annoyance of browser makers leaving incomplete implementations stagnant for years.As an example, the &lt;dialog&gt; element, a browser-native standardized spec as promising replacement for alert. Except that it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s inaccessible at its core.And nobody fixes it, it&#39;s just left in this broken state forever.&lt;section&gt;, the element that was supposed to cut up an HTML document into multiple outlines, hence making componentized SEO-optimized headings easy and better, do nothing at all.CSS columns, a simple and easy way to distribute text, were unusable for 8 years because Mozilla refused to fix their own small bug. Which pales compared to the extraordinary amount of Webkit bugs that are absolutely never ever fixed.Form controls, since the very invention of them, are terrible. It has cost the world billions, as worldwide every single developer and project has to reinvent some of them, often breaking basic accessibility in the process.I could go on, but I&#39;ll sum it up as the failure to address extremely common real world problems, and to just let broken buggy solutions linger. When you accept a standard and implement it, bloody finish the implementation. Fix bugs. Otherwise, what is the point?I&#39;d call this hardening the web. There&#39;s no reason I can see why you can&#39;t harden it whilst also making progress on new features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I think the web/browsers has churned far too much, and if that stopped happening, perhaps we would get more accessible sites and browser diversity as people &#34;stop looking for new dogs and start teaching new tricks to the old ones.&#34; Of course, Google would try its hardest to never let that happen, since change is its weapon of monopoly.Related: Stop Pushing the Web Forward (2015) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9961613"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another example of this is SharedWorker.Here it is in the standard: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#dom-shar...Safari/Webkit removed it in 2015 (edit: maybe even earlier!) and never reintroduced it:
https://caniuse.com/sharedworkersHere is the apparent reason for cherry picking features:&gt; The implementation of Shared Web Workers was imposing undesirable constraints on the engine. It never gained any adoption.https://stackoverflow.com/a/48193804Edit: Here is the ticket for it’s reinclusion https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149850Turns out it was removed temporarily because of internal architecture changes, and never reintroduced because of lack of adoption. Of course the biggest barrier of adoption is Safari not supporting them, so talk about a self fulfilling prophecy.&gt; This feature was originally removed temporarily during multiprocess bring-up, and actual usage on the web has been pretty low. We&#39;re willing to reconsider if there is significant demand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I manage hundreds of linux servers... from my windows desktop and mac laptop.This will be super unpopular, but Linux missed the desktop boat 20 years ago, and my feeling as someone who at the time built his gentoo OS&#39;s from source, it was the fault of a few things:1) Fragmented gui development. There were too many projects with none focusing on really making a better gui than mac/windows.2) A lack of bread and butter 1st class &#34;business&#34; apps - you know, office. OpenOffice is fine, IF you are ok with the janky ui and no one knowing how it works.3) lack of open source exchange type mail/cal/etc server and outlook-like client). Holy fudge, I tried to get this going and people just crapped on me for suggesting it.4) Until recently, installing on laptops was an absolute crap shoot.5) Just, apps, in general. Gimp is fine, but it has never been close to photoshop. GUI standards are all over the place, etc. People go to a platform because it has the tools they want. The real fallout from point 1 is no one would ever port apps to linux (a little hyperbolic - a lot of high-end post production apps and audio apps all made it over). Open source yadda yadda, thats nice (this is not a brush off, it IS nice), but the ecosystem could be light years ahead of where we are now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone new to Linux from 20 years on a Mac -- what&#39;s the deal with everything being free?Seriously, where are the &#34;take my money&#34; opportunities. I don&#39;t want free OpenOffice. I want to pay $100 for something better, whatever the heck that is, maybe a little less clunky. I don&#39;t want free open source Notes app, I want to pay for something that&#39;s polished.The Linux community is incredibly giving and passionate and it seems like it&#39;s all &#34;free&#34; but sucks up my time. I couldn&#39;t even figure out how to slow the scroll of my trackpad on Ubuntu after lots of digging.Please, coming as a Mac user, take my money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t use Linux b/c it&#39;s the best desktop.  I use it for two fundamental reasons:1. With enough time and effort I can make it do whatever I want it to do (that can be done).2. I&#39;m a Python web developer and we deploy to Linux so it means I only really need to learn one OS (time to learn is in limited supply for me as man who cares about family life).What this means practically for me is that 95% of what the OS provides works the way I want it to.  I have a handful of things I customize and I&#39;ve scripted those (Linux is great for scripting) so it&#39;s easy to apply when I refresh my OS every 1-2 years.It also means I don&#39;t have to do things the Apple way, I can make it work the way I want it to work (within reason).It also means I don&#39;t have an OS that will put advertisements in the start menu (that was the last straw for my family using Windows, everyone uses Linux now).I realize if I was a lawyer and needed Microsoft Office or a designer and needed the Adobe Suite, then I couldn&#39;t take this approach or would need to run a different OS in a VM.  I wish the Linux desktop would be an attractive target for all popular commercial apps to support it.  But I&#39;m not holding my breath, that&#39;s not why I use it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you for sharing. I read this a while back and it still hits me just as hard. My brother passed away nearly 6 years ago and left under similar circumstances to the author&#39;s father. He also left a tattered, and similarly-chaotic journal.I was really torn about reading it at first, but he was the type of person who wanted to go ahead of the pack and clear the path for others. His journal was the last way for him to do that.He was older than me and, reading it years after his death, it&#39;s shocking to see the differences between our lives at the same ages. He always seemed older and wiser, but now -- having just turned the age he was when he died -- I realize why he felt so lost and lonely. Being an adult in your mid-twenties is difficult. I have it easy, and I&#39;m having a hard time. Throw in years of battling addiction and no college education, and you can&#39;t help but feel the entire world is against you.Losing an older sibling is a strange experience. The longer you go without them, the smaller the age gap between you becomes. Eventually, you&#39;re older than they will ever be -- I haven&#39;t reached that point yet but just thinking about it puts a lump in my throat.I&#39;ve considered publishing bits and pieces of his story on a blog, or in a book, someday. Anything that could help people in his (or my) situation feel less alone. Although, I don&#39;t think it would be much help considering his story ended.Not sure why I posted this comment. There&#39;s not much substance here other than evidence of another touched soul."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for this article and hit me really hard. My mom passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago. She was just starting to enjoy retirement and time being a grandmom. Her journals were note books and mostly documents of what she had done in two year of retirement and things to do with the boys. It&#39;s so hard to look at the plans of things to come and what she was thinking of... like the planning of my oldest son&#39;s 9 3/4 birthday in a year because he&#39;s so in to Harry Potter. It&#39;s a unique treasure to see the inner workings of her mind and something I wish everyone got to experience after a parents passing. We&#39;ve left the stack of them out at her house so the rest of my siblings can go through them as the pass through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really moved me. My dad went through brain surgery last year and his four sons converged from around the country. We all barely speak to each other. A holographic will was produced, ten loose leaf pages in impossible handwriting, the last few pages written by him right before he went into surgery while his fourth wife held the pad and guided his hand with a pen. I wish we had conducted ourselves with grace, but two of my brothers are lawyers, so we&#39;re shouting at each other in his house while he&#39;s having a full craniotomy. Luckily he survived and is back somewhat in his faculties for now, and seems cognizant that he doesn&#39;t want to leave this strife behind between his wife and his kids. But this still made me choke up because there&#39;s not much anyone can do. I think about my dad&#39;s regrets and his father&#39;s and see them repeated in myself and my brothers. None of us knows what we&#39;re really doing, do we? We&#39;re all trying our best to pretend we have some control."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Agreed on all points.Interesting to see this:&gt; You can argue that all of this has existed for a very long time, back from the days of all kinds of toolbars and extensions that created multiple levels of address bar nesting in your web browser and taskbar.What I find ironic about the whole situation is, back then it was universally known that those toolbars and extensions are distributed by assholes. The whole software category was called by various pejorative names - &#34;adware&#34;, &#34;spyware&#34;, &#34;malware&#34;. There was a whole ecosystem of tools and tricks to get rid of them, as well as preventing them from being installed in the first place.Something weird happened over the past decade. We find ourselves in times where most mainstream software from renowned companies should be, by the standards of the toolbar era, classified as malware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is globally so true, but there is a major error:It is not &#34;needs of developers&#34; the problem, but the &#34;needs of product manager,  marketing, c-level asshole&#34;.Like for telemetry, most of the time the business side &#34;can&#34;, so they do.And again, for specific app and co, most developer would complain and not like release such user-hostile software but  they are forced by business to do it.Like this stupid project manager that thinks that his product/software is the most important in the world and there is no reason why a random user would not want to install it and also that the user computer belongs to him and to the company because he is using the product, without shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, I just ran into this. I work on a product that has a 3rd party API so other people can write plug-ins to extend the functionality of the app. It&#39;s great for users and developers. We received a bug report related to a particular plug-in, so I went to download their demo to see if the problem was on our end or theirs before contacting them. Here&#39;s how the process went:1) Go to their website and click &#34;Download&#34;
2) Prompted to enter email address with no way to opt out. Shit. Go to mailinator.com and create a fake email address to enter. Enter it.
3) Wait for them to send the real download link to my fake email.
4) It came in almost instantly. Great! Click on the link.
5) Click to download the installer package. Wait a few minutes.
6) Run the installer package.
7) It needs the same email address and password so it knows I&#39;m a &#34;legitimate user&#34; just to install the thing.
8) After entering it, it kicks me back to the web page for some reason. No idea what it&#39;s looking for or what I&#39;m supposed to do on the web site, so I go back to the installer. Oh it&#39;s not an installer. It&#39;s an installer installer. It&#39;s going to download the installer I want from a list of dozens of possible installers. Download the real installer.
9) Run the real installer - It lists dozens of products. Find the one I want. Install it.
10) Prompted for email and password again.And keep in mind this is all before I&#39;m actually a customer. I haven&#39;t paid anything and am trying to evaluate the software to determine if it fits my needs. (Or I would be if I were an end user.) Honestly, if this weren&#39;t for my job, I would have given up on step 2. Fuck these people. I&#39;m trying to save them time by seeing whether the bug is ours or theirs, but they&#39;re actively wasting mine and everyone else&#39;s who downloads this crap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This happens to video games also. Publishers give review copies with microtransactions not included, the reviewers review it, and then shortly after release they add their free-to-play garbage so they get reviews that don&#39;t take the microtransactions into account and then they add it later.The also do it during ESRB submission to get around having to have a label that mentions in-game purchases. I&#39;m surprised ESRB lets them get away with it, actually.Jimquisition on it: https://youtu.be/9LeZ89_u2GcArticle on it: https://www.tweaktown.com/news/66889/publishers-delaying-mic..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is this not fraud?If you as a company source a device for reviewers and then change the specs in a way that you do not communicate, that is intent to defraud.If you bought a corvette because all the car reviews said it went 0-60 in 5 seconds, and then you buy one and it takes 10 seconds to do the same thing, you’d have a pretty good argument - especially if everyone else experienced your same situation.I’d be surprised if a class action suit or FTC investigation doesn’t happens within the next year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ship the top tier hardware NVME drives to reviewers, wait a few months then start swapping out slower memory chips, controllers, go through multiple revisions while keeping the same name so when gamers look for reviews they see blinding speeds only to be duped.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very happy to see that Sailfish keeps shipping because more alternatives are always good.I tried to use it a while ago (Sailfish 3) but was driven off it because of the huge gap between the marketing and the actual reality.The claim that they are privacy and security focused was total bogus (and perhaps someone can comment if it still is).To use the phone features, a Jolla account is needed, so it will &#34;ping home to Jolla&#34;. Privacy policy is pretty standard, so they reserve the right to track you all they want and of course, this is tied to your license, payment method etc. So much for privacy focused...What fully drove me off was that they launched full disk &#34;encryption&#34;, but the LUKS encryption-key password they used was the user&#39;s numeric pin (4-8 digits long). So encryption keys could be bruteforced by a kid and they seemed to be fine with it (I don&#39;t know if nowadays it supports a passphrase).Then I also learned that apps in the &#34;app-store&#34; were not signed in any way so impossible to certify that what you are installing is actually coming from the app repository etc. the phone was just lacking basic security all over the place.I hope they are closer now to closing the &#34;gap&#34; between their marketing and the reality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m confused. Where does this say the vaccine is mRNA? The Valneva VLA15 website explicitly states &#34;VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine&#34; [1], and the linked press release calls it a &#34;investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine&#34;. Does nobody actually read these things?See [2], &#34;Subunit Vaccines&#34;.[1] https://valneva.com/research-development/lyme-disease/[2] https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/vaccine-types"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prepare to read the headline &#34;mRNA vaccine trial for &lt;...&gt;&#34; a lot in the future. My guess is that they are going to produce mRNA versions of basically any vaccine (and then some) in the future. The nice thing about the technology seems to be that you only need to exchange the mRNA payload while the surrounding delivery method can be reused. That makes it not only a fast method to create a vaccine but a very convenient way as well. Nice side effect might be that for the next pandemic, we might have doses for everyone ready at the moment the trials are done.
Take that with a giant grain of salt because I&#39;m not in the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually had Lyme disease when i was younger. Curiously enough, i didn&#39;t get the somewhat common rash after the tick bite, but instead it was discovered later, as a part of blood testing. I was submitted to that after my relatives had concerns about how lethargic i was being, as well as because i was experiencing joint pain, which the blood test later seemed to confirm.If i recall correctly, i was given antibiotics and felt pretty bad for a month onwards, though nowadays i&#39;m not aware of any lingering long term effects, apart from maybe my short term memory being slightly worse than i&#39;d expect it to. Of course, i think that in my case i had it pretty easy, since some other folks are known to develop symptoms that are considerably more worse. Whether there will be any lingering consequences in my future because of it, only time will tell.A vaccine would definitely be welcome, especially because of how common ticks are here in Eastern Europe - any walk in the forest might end with more than one of them on your clothes. If you have dogs, you&#39;ll probably have to remove dozens of those from their fur every summer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wrote the ad. Holy cow, I didn&#39;t expect to be #1 on Hacker News. Will answer any questions.Here&#39;s one you might ask: Why? I&#39;m pushing 60 and I&#39;ve attempted to interview for developer jobs over the last year. Got nowhere despite 40 years of experience. Getting really, really tired of this industry&#39;s attitude toward people like me.Based on questions below, I&#39;ll give a bit more. Earlier this year I had a personal referral into Facebook for a developer position. They do hiring centrally. A very young person in the HR department spoke to me, put me in the central database, and apparently shopped my experience around to a number of different groups. No takers. No one wanted to interview me, so the application died. Never did a tech assessment.So now I&#39;ve started a new group, and I expect this thing is going to generate a lot more money than any work at Facebook ever would. So Facebook did me a favor. Still, it rankles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The hiring process is in the form of a paid, short-term consulting gig that will lead to a full-time offer if we like you and you like us. We&#39;ll give you some tasks, you&#39;ll get them done, and then we&#39;ll talk. No need to quit your day job to do this gig; we&#39;ll work around your schedule.Interesting. I look forward to hearing if this works out long term. I&#39;d be worried about legal implications of something like this but IANAL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I naively moved from New York to Silicon Valley when I was 52. Not saying there isn’t age discrimination in NYC, but here it’s a nightmare.The drop in my interview track record since  my 40s is stark. 2 years ago, after 6 months during which I failed to get 6 jobs for which I interviewed, I made it to the final round for a position at a startup and was subjected to the usual all-day grilling. The CEO was an older man and the hiring manager was in her late 40s, but all the other interviewers were in their early 20s. I left convinced I had nailed the interview and feeling optimistic. On the way home, the hiring manager, bless her soul, took the unusual step of calling to tell me the team had overruled her own enthusiasm for hiring me and she felt terrible about it. Without saying it in so many words, she made it plain it was because of my age.The age discrimination here extends beyond getting hired. I’ve been subject to cruel jokes and shunning in the workplace that, were I in another disenfranchised group, would be labeled workplace harassment and likely subject to strong discouragement by management at the very least.Some people in these comments ask the source of the age discrimination as if they are skeptical and astonished, Astonished!! such a thing could be going on. They look for a rational explanation. Here’s the explanation: we are tribal animals. From young people’s perspective, they are “Us” and we olds are “Them.”Sometimes young people are conscious of their hostility toward us and sometimes not, but that’s it. It requires no explanation more than that.It’s traumatic to be subjected to treatment like this, to the point I have stopped looking for a job. Humans are not built to tolerate constant social rejection, and it’s more important for me to be alive than to be wealthy. I’ve withdrawn from the tech world and started a business that will not make me and my family wealthy, but will support us, albeit with modest means.I hate the fact that I have become a bitter old man at 57!! I hate that Silicon Valley has come to this!!I’m working through my bitterness and will get over it someday. And I will have the good fortune to leave this dystopia."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This are beautiful.I had a go at doing roughly the same thing a couple of years ago [0]. It was mostly straightforward, but the part I really struggled with were rendering the sea. The encoding of OSM coastline is quite quirky [1]. When the edge of the rendering intersects with the coastline it&#39;s very tricky to compute which side of a coastline is sea and which is land. As an example - how would you render this [2]?I wasn&#39;t sure how I could solve this, so I wrote up a more abstract formulation of the problem here [3], and asked for help. I think the proposed solution make sense, but I think I would have to implement it by rendering individual pixels and wouldn&#39;t be able to lean on a higher level graphics library.I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how the author solved this problem.[0] https://twitter.com/willsewell_/status/1172523752699113473[1] https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:natural%3Dcoastline#...[2] https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/22.0330/88.8819[3] https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1104642/im-s..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge fan of Readability Mode and use it often.  It&#39;s proof that Web design isn&#39;t the solution, Web design is the problem.For those who are using e-ink devices, or even just standard tablets, EInkBro is another immensely useful tool.  Yes, it&#39;s a standalone browser, not a mode on Firefox, Safari, Vivalti, etc.https://github.com/plateaukao/browser(Available through Google Play, F-Droid and other sources.  Android-only, sorry iOS fans.)What it offers over standard browsers is that it&#39;s optimised for e-ink displays.  That is, it favours pagination over scrolling, runs to full-screen, can easily adjust font size up or down (no more itsy-bitsy-teen-weenie-yellow-polka-dot HN fonts), bold text, and has its own reader mode as well.Even on a standard tablet, some of these features are a huge step above and beyond the mainstream browsers.The feature-set is limited, some of the UI is a bit rough, and a few things are just plain broken (if you need to edit entries in the JS or Cookie enabled/disabled sites ... you have to delete all data and start over again).That said, my usage is evolving from sending individual pages to EInkBrow when I want to do long-form reading, to using it at least part-time as a primary browser.  (Mozilla Fennec Fox is my first choice, still.)  The browser is stable and very much usable despite this.  The developer is responsive to requests and bug reports.What&#39;s most refreshing is that the design principle is readability of Web content, as determined by the user, and not by the page author or publisher."</p>

The voices don&#39;t sound human so it takes some getting used to.On linux the voices just sound more harsh. To the point I don&#39;t want to use it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a powerful piece that resonates with my own experience. I went through a period of severe burnout that took me a couple years to recover from. One of my later insights was that burnout doesn&#39;t merely entail working too much (although that&#39;s certainly part of it); burnout often involves pouring too much of your heart and soul into something that does not love you back. I describe burnout now as a kind of &#34;unrequited love.&#34;So many of us go above and beyond for our companies/projects/teams/whatever. The author here describes overcommitting at work. We might have the best of intentions, but at some point, we don&#39;t see the returns we yearned for and start to question what all this self-sacrificial giving is for.  That is when burnout really sets in. I&#39;ve had friends burn out while working for hostile or indifferent managers, startups that are trending the wrong direction, companies that engage in illegal or unethical behavior, etc.A second insight was that burnout can play a positive role in our lives. It&#39;s like a circuit breaker that trips to protect us from a damaging situation. When we feel burnout coming on, it&#39;s a warning to pay attention to an important misalignment in our lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This person understands what actual burnout is. You get really seriously fried, like &#39;can&#39;t function in any sense&#39; fried. The references to &#39;you have to decide what we&#39;ll watch on netflix because I literally cannot choose a thing&#39; rang very true to me.I generally needed more than a couple months but less than a year, and the removal of whatever it was that I&#39;d burnt myself to a crisp trying to control. Over my lifetime that&#39;s been everything from overcoming homelessness, starting a business, transitioning the business to Patreon, trying to have a relationship: it&#39;s been a lifelong process of learning that I can&#39;t have things (even very desirable things) just by pushing harder to earn them. Quite often I just have to give up and not have the thing.The more I learn that, the less I&#39;m riding the edge of burnout.:)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, I&#39;ve started feeling like I&#39;m close to burnout. But quitting doesn&#39;t really seem like a helpful option.Could I actually take months off recovering? No. I&#39;d have to immediately start leetcoding and remembering what all those trees are for so that I could become employed again later on. And risk having to take a job that pays way less than before.Which brings me to my main point: I don&#39;t see an option where the work ever actually truly ends. There&#39;s always more. Always things I need to be doing. And until I have enough to retire, I have to keep grinding.Vacation doesn&#39;t help. It just puts me farther behind."</p>

So stupid… at least CC merchants can blame chargebacks or something.I guess it’d help if laws were clarified, in the UK where they are  based as well.Maybe we’ll find out if something changed soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone think this was a failed pivot from the p0rn and the backlash was so great that they backpedaled?It actually reminds me of Ebay. Ebay became big with online auctions but as soon as they did they seemed to want to no longer be in the auction business. Instead they wanted to be in the online retail business. Maybe because there was more money per customer. Maybe because online retail was larger. Personally I always found Ebay&#39;s retail move to be weird and off-brand with a subpar user experience.Something about this Onlyfans move just doesn&#39;t sit right. Like who were the banks or payment processors that supposedly forced this? I haven&#39;t seen anyone claim responsibility (officially or not)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This distinction of changing the defacto ownership of your device and data is the real inflection point. The surveillance technology itself is not really that novel, as functionally it&#39;s applying established anti-virus techniques to data instead of code. Ask any AV company how their detection works, and it will include a variation on this.This same tech can (and will likely) be used to find the owners of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency wallets, honeypot tokens, community identities, and to provide profiling information to the company&#39;s political masters. The collisions in the hashing scheme mean that you can insert anything you want onto peoples devices and get them pulled into the legal system once it is flagged, where the process itself is the punishment. The whole scheme is too stupid to ever have been about reason, it&#39;s just pretexts and narrative, and this is as good a time as any to exit their ecosystem.Apple really picked the wrong time to attempt this, as I do not see anyone who understands how evil this is ever forgiving them. The most charitable thing I can say about it is that they&#39;re probably just doing it as part of a deal to avoid anti-trust plays, where Apple plays ball with the feds and its parties, and the storm just magically passes them over. The good news is running OSX made me lazy, and getting back into running a linux or freebsd laptop again is going to be fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;So what happens when, in a few years at the latest, a politician points that out, and—in order to protect the children—bills are passed in the legislature to prohibit this &#34;Disable&#34; bypass, effectively compelling Apple to scan photos that aren’t backed up to iCloud? What happens when a party in India demands they start scanning for memes associated with a separatist movement? What happens when the UK demands they scan for a library of terrorist imagery? How long do we have left before the iPhone in your pocket begins quietly filing reports about encountering “extremist” political material, or about your presence at a &#34;civil disturbance&#34;? Or simply about your iPhone&#39;s possession of a video clip that contains, or maybe-or-maybe-not contains, a blurry image of a passer-by who resembles, according to an algorithm, &#34;a person of interest&#34;?What I don&#39;t get is what prevented these things from happening last month?  Apple controls the hardware, the software, and the cloud services so the point at which the scanning is done is mostly arbitrary from a process standpoint (I understand people believe there are huge differences philosophically). They could have already scanned our files because they already have full control over the entire ecosystem.  If they can be corrupted by authoritative governments, then shouldn&#39;t we assume that have already been corrupted?  If so, why did we trust them with full control of the ecosystem?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very well-written post. Ever since this program has been announced I have struggled with talking about the implications succinctly.Online, I never know if an interlocutor is even arguing in good faith, but even in person it&#39;s difficult to balance talking about all the ways that the claimed safeguards are meaningless, how the benefits don&#39;t really make sense, how this is markedly different from other infringements on privacy with the need to be concise and explain that the real problems aren&#39;t just theoretical because similar invasions of privacy are killing actual people around the world already.Anyway, I think the only practical way that this could resolve well, is if Apple saw a precipitous decline in its iCloud brand, then it could be argued that they had to abandon this plan for purely business reasons. A serious movement to abandon Apple services ($17.5B revenue in 2021 q3), might empower the people within Apple who opposed this reckless plan from the beginning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s been frustrating watching the Spotify (and general movement) with podcasts fragmenting and going exclusive. Spotify won with music because it improved upon the existing state of listening to music and offered a free or cheap solution that was even a compelling alternative to piracy.Podcasts for the most part were in the ideal state for consumers, almost always free and mostly client independent distributed w/ RSS. I don&#39;t think there is much of any argument that Spotify can improve that state for consumers by taking a podcast exclusive. These deals are just payouts for the hosts not investments that make the shows better. Most even very successful podcasts likely have low opex (some exceptions like NYT Daily) and don&#39;t benefit from a big pile of cash.On a different note regarding the Rogan Deal, Spotify took ages to add video streaming support on Apple TV (main way I would catch Rogan) which basically caused me to quit casual watching. They also only recently added offline playback for Apple Watch and even then it&#39;s premium exclusive and requires manual downloading of eps. I don&#39;t understand at all why an enormous company like Spotify is so neglectful of the entire apple ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hearing &#34;Exclusively on Spotify&#34; on any podcast ad is a sure-fire way to make sure I never listen to an episode. One of the great features of podcasts is the flexibility in listening platform and I&#39;d really rather not switch to Spotify&#39;s substandard user experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spotify is just not set up for long-form video content. The discovery aspect of YouTube is one reason why it reels you in. You&#39;re scrolling through your feed, you see an interesting clip, and you click on it. Another big part of YouTube is the comment section. Spotify lacks on both fronts. I also think the JRE clips were a big part of what sucked people into watch full epsiodes. If a 5-7 minute JRE clip were interesting I might jump in and watch the whole episode. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve done that or done it as well on Spotify."</p>

You can think of it as a shorthand for [ .[] | ... ] and it comes up quite a bit in my experience, so it’s worth it committing to memory.From https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#map(x),map_values(x) :&gt; map(x) is equivalent to [.[] | x].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the author is on here - reckon you could beat up on simple random tokens a _little_ bit more? In particular how easy they are to identify and prevent leaking (easily fixed by adding a prefix).I work on secret scanning at GitHub. When token issuers use easily identifiable formats for their tokens we can easily spot them when they&#39;re accidentally committed. We can then work with the token issuer to automatically alert them of those leaks. A good example is AWS - if you commit an AWS key and secret to a public GitHub repo we will tell AWS about it and they will tell you about it (and quarantine the exposed keys) within a few seconds. We work with dozens of other token issuers too, though - some of the latest we added were Linear, PlanetScale and Ionic.The above relies on tokens being identifiable - we can&#39;t send hundreds of partners everything that looks like 32 hex chars. In future we want to be able to do even more sophisticated things, like ask users for confirmation before the push code that contains secrets. We recently changed our own token pattern for that reason.GitHub secret scanning program: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/secret-scanni...GitHub&#39;s updated token format: https://github.blog/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentica..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great.One thing that&#39;s worth remembering about randomly generated tokens is that it&#39;s important to always use safe comparison methods when comparing them to the stored one - otherwise you could be vulnerable to timing attacks.In Python you can use secrets.compare_digest(a, b) for this: https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.compa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post reminded me a little of https://blog.thea.codes/building-a-stateless-api-proxy/ from 2019, an absolutely brilliant hack that attempted to make up for GitHub&#39;s lack of finely-grained API tokens.The key idea there is to build your own custom proxy for the GitHub API, then issue tokens for it which are actually encrypted bundles of the full-permission API token plus a set of rules about what the proxy should allow it to do - only allow a GET to paths that match &#34;/gists/.*&#34; for example.It&#39;s somewhat similar to Biscuits storing a Datalog program &#34;to evaluate whether a token allows an operation.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was at IBM 15 years ago, IBM was far from being a monopoly, since there were plenty of competitors in the hardware space (HP, Sun, Dell, etc) and in the software space (Oracle, SAP, etc.) and in the Services space (Accenture, PwC, KPMG, etc.) employees still had to complete annual legal training that was very similar to what was described in the post.Any large company with half-way competent legal counsel is going to tell their employees not to say, &#34;our goal is to crush our competitors, dominate the market, and hear the lamentation of their women.&#34;  Instead they will tell their employees to focus on making life better for their customers.   It&#39;s a much healthier way for product managers to focus, and what you might do if the goal is &#34;crush/dominate the competition&#34; is *not* the same than if the goal is delight the customer.   So it&#39;s not just a messaging strategy to prevent embarassing e-mails from coming out at trial; it&#39;s a business strategy, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such an uncharitable interpretation of the training materials. The material there is not saying &#34;if you want to speak about things that raise antitrust concerns, use this coded language&#34;, it&#39;s saying &#34;don&#39;t do these things, and just focus on building a good product&#34;.Like, the thing here that really boggles my mind: if the training materials had said literally the exact opposite of what they do: &#34;crush the competition, find ways to prevent competitors from competing fairly with us&#34; etc. — someone like the author would write an article vilifying them. (And rightly so.) So the company instead says &#34;focus on our product; competition is good and okay&#34; and … they&#39;re vilified for it. Damned if they do, damned if they don&#39;t.By this article&#39;s twisted logic, any company focused on their product is just engaging in newspeak for thinly veiled anti-competitive behavior. Or is it just if Google does it?(It kills me to argue this, since I think normally these threads/articles spawn good debate about the size and scope of FAANG. But… this one is ridiculous.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is about being careful what you put in writing, because the discovery process for lawsuits will find your carelessly written email and opposing lawyers will take it out of context, and do you want to end up in court years later explaining what you meant?Google has so many employees that they need training to limit the damage from random chatter and speculation.It’s more cumbersome to have to talk about some things via video chat, but it’s not about limiting thought."</p>

The edge cases requiring immediate human attention are still too frequent for the human safety driver to be remote, as is the case in Phoenix.Also, just a reminder that Waymo in Phoenix is nowhere close to being level 5, since it is still heavily geofences and requires those remote safety monitors. I still think that true level 5 (i.e. ability to drive autonomously everywhere with zero human oversight with a safety record equivalent to the median human driver) requires AGI.

If they can nail it there, that&#39;s 2/2 for busy, urban street driving (SF) and &#34;boring&#34; suburban driving (Chandler, AZ). They&#39;ve been quietly very confident of their tech, but this is a real test.Tangentially, I&#39;ve also noticed that Waymo has picked up pace ever since the recent leadership changes. They are publishing more blog posts, offering more insights into their tech and generally seem to have increased their PR game. I wonder if that was a mandate from Alphabet leadership to show some urgency."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Actually this makes sense. Already since recent iOS versions have started popping up an alert to grant access to local network resources per app, I&#39;ve noticed this popping up on several apps that have no business mapping and fingerprinting my LAN. Including the Facebook app.It&#39;s weird how a company can be so internally disconnected. This entitlement is a good privacy-preserving hurdle to prevent scummy apps from interfering with your local network and fingerprinting you. On the other hand, the on-device scanning of nudes in imessage and csam in iphoto is a total snitchware swatting-as-a-service piece of software which only serves to incriminate and harass the owner of the device. Such a shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; you have to explain yourself to humans at AppleThis is such an honor. I was starting to suspect no actual humans other than the developers and the managers work at FFANG at all given how hard it is to contact them. Perhaps in this case it is not a human either but a neural network of a sort.Anyway, I believe everything should be done this way, through communicating with humans. Humans should study every ad and every app before it gets published (but I support side-loading for users willing to opt-out), humans should review every video before it gets de-monetized or removed, humans should communicate on every appeal. I would vote for a law mandating this.PS: The more news of this kind the more I feel like buying an iPhone perhaps. I don&#39;t like how they restrict the users but I bloody adore how they restrict the apps (with exception of some cases like iDOS, terminal apps, alternative-engine web browsers etc - I certainly don&#39;t like Apple banning them)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, this is about Bonjour, which is pretty cool. David Abramson and I released a multiplayer Horse Racing game, called PocketJockey on iOS 2.1. During game play each device would play its local copy of the William Tell Overture. We used packet latency to synchronize tracks. You would then bounce up and down as though you were a jockey. If you bounced in time to the music your horse would go faster. There was an announcer that would announce the status of your horse, which was also in synch. Up to 4 players could be playing in the same room with the exact same music and announcer emanating from their pocket. All on the original iPhone. To use an overused term, the experience was &#34;magical&#34; That&#39;s what you can do with Bonjour.So, what&#39;s the attack vector? A back door, perhaps? Bonjour requires a user approval dialog. A misleading title of the dialog may allow someone to connect. Maybe extract private data.Imagine a peer-to-peer chat app. Say, in Hong Kong --  during a protest. Or in Kabul -- during an evacuation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well... we have 3 node MongoDB cluster and are processing up to a million trades... per second. And a trade is way more complex than a chat message. Has tens to hundreds of fields, may require enriching with data from multiple external services and then requires to be stored, be searchable with unknown, arbitrary bitemporal queries and may need multiple downstream systems to be notified depending on a lot of factors when it is modified.All this happens on the aforementioned MongoDB cluster and just two server nodes. And the two server nodes are really only for redundancy, a single node easily fits the load.What I want to say is:-- processing a hundred million simple transactions per day is nothing difficult on modern hardware.-- modern servers have stupendous potential to process transactions which is 99.99% wasted by &#34;modern&#34; application stacks,-- if you are willing to spend a little bit of learning effort, it is easily possible to run millions of non trivial transactions per second on a single server,-- most databases (even as bad as MongoDB is) have a potential to handle much more load than people think they can. You just need to kind of understand how it works and what its strengths are and play into rather than against them.And if you think we are running Rust on bare metal and some super large servers -- you would be wrong. It is a normal Java reactive application running on OpenJDK on an 8 core server with couple hundred GB of memory. And the last time I needed to look at the profiler was about a year ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used cassandra quite a bit and even I had to go back and figure out what this primary key means:    ((channel_id, bucket), message_id)

The primary key consists of partition key + clustering columns, so this says that channel_id &amp; bucket are the partition key, and message_id is the one and only clustering column (you can have more).They also cite the most common cassandra mistake, which is not understanding that your partition key has to limit partition size to less than 300MB, and no surprise: They had to craft the &#34;bucket&#34; column as a function of message date-time because that&#39;s usually the only way to prevent a partition from eventually growing too large. Anyhow, this is incredibly important if you don&#39;t want to suffer a catastrophic failure months/years after you thought everything was good to go.They didn&#39;t mention this part: Oh, I have to include all partition key columns in every query&#39;s &#34;where&#34; clause, so... I have to run as many queries as are needed for the time period of data I want to see, and stitch the results together... ugh... Yeah it&#39;s a little messy."</p>

Customer service people have to listen to people yell at them when convenience is sacrificed and aren&#39;t held accountable for security problems.  They therefore optimize for customer convenience.  I don&#39;t completely fault them for it. If anyone has had the frustration of sitting on the phone with a customer service rep trying to remember a PIN code that was setup 5 years ago when signing up with an ISP and was never thought about since, you can probably understand it.It is easy to blame a single person or a single company for poor practices, but I have yet to encounter any real solution to this problem that allows someone to prove they are who they say they are which is able to hit the sweet spot between too many false positives (hijacked accounts) and too many false negatives (valid customers locked out).If I was a security-minded person looking for startup ideas, this is the problem I would be looking to solve."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can almost guarantee this is due to licensing issues with the camera firmware. Modern cameras aren&#39;t just hardware any more. They&#39;re a mix of hardware and advanced processing algorithms that really do make a huge difference in the final output. Those algorithms are often licensed from 3rd parties with specific licensing requirements.Sony has been reasonably good about enabling open-source and fixing these things in the past, so I&#39;d give them the benefit of the doubt that they&#39;ll try to find a way to enable the cameras on unlocked phones in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AFAIK similar thing happens with Sony smartphones. They claim to officially support AOSP. But:&#34;If you unlock the bootloader, you may void the warranty of your device and/or any warranty from your operator. See your device’s warranty statement for details. Additionally, due to the modified device software, Sony’s repair network will likely have to replace key components before it can properly test, repair and verify your device using our repair tools and software. Consequently, if Sony performs a warranty repair, Sony will likely charge you a significant service fee for the additional costs caused by your modification of the software.&#34;And regarding camera:&#34;Certain pre-loaded content on your device may also be inaccessible due to the removal of DRM security keys. For devices running recent software versions, for instance Xperia Z3, the removal of DRM security keys may affect advanced camera functionality. For example, noise reduction algorithms might be removed, and performance when taking photos in low-light conditions might be affected. The secure user data partition may also become inaccessible, and you will not be able to get any more official software upgrades if you unlock the bootloader.&#34;I was very enthusiastic about Sony smartphones when I first read about them officially supporting AOSP, but after reading those terms I just bought cheap Android One Xiaomi instead, who supports unlocking bootloader with a single click, does not void your warranty or break your camera and you can easily re-flash original firmware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the surface this seems blatantly illegal: after the sale is made the no-longer-owner removes functionality.Can someone please explain how this is legally not some sort of theft, or bait-and-switch, or ... something?I read comments about firmware licensing, or Japan&#39;s camera noise thing.  Those sound like Samsung problems, while disabling a camera sounds like an actionable user problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone interested in open hardware mice, I have to recommend Ploopy: https://ploopy.co/Plug-and-play, flash your own firmware if you like. Current models ship with QMK (open firmware), although I believe my older trackball didn&#39;t, I&#39;d have to flash it.I have both a left-handed trackball (rare!) and a right-handed mouse from them, I like to alternate.Two obvious complaints:- They&#39;re really expensive- They&#39;re 3D-printed, which means manufacturing isn&#39;t polished. My trackball had a sticky mousewheel, which I ultimately had to buy a replacement for and swap out. My mouse has some rough edges I haven&#39;t filed down yet, and the 3D-printed texture may not be for everyone.The good news is that it&#39;s easy to make replacement parts and repairs yourself!Still, I wish they would make mass-produced versions with more conventional and precise manufacturing techniques, just with the option to 3D-print your own parts if you feel like it / need to. Maybe that would bring the price down while also improving build quality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The transition to endemic COVID-19 is also a psychological one. When everyone has some immunity, a COVID-19 diagnosis becomes as routine as diagnosis of strep or flu—not good news, but not a reason for particular fear or worry or embarrassment either. That means unlearning a year of messaging that said COVID-19 was not just a flu. If the confusion around the CDC dropping mask recommendations for the vaccinated earlier this summer is any indication, this transition to endemicity might be psychologically rocky.&#34;Diseases that are endemic today, such as chicken pox, once caused epidemics with massive body counts, notably in North America.  No vaccines, no advanced medical care, and no natural immunity meant that some villages just ceased to exist.Today, thanks to air travel, the world is a village.  Wuhan is exposed one week, and the world the next.  We, the natives of that village, have vaccines and advanced medical care in finite quantities, plus a better understanding of how to reduce transmission rates.  That&#39;s gone a long way to soften the blow.  The transition from pandemic to endemic usually kills a lot more people in a given area, and the area effected right now is everywhere.The thing is, COVID-19 is not endemic yet and, even once it is, will likely retain the capability of mutating into a strain that causes a new deadly pandemic.  Flu is endemic, but another 1918 could happen at any time.  Until we&#39;ve built up immunity to several different strains of COVID-19, every new strain has the potential to overwhelm our medical systems, and a unusually contagious and deadly mutant will always be a possibility.It&#39;s not as simple as flipping a switch from &#34;life threatening pandemic&#34; to &#34;quotidian endemic&#34;.  There are shades of grey in between that cause varying strain on hospital ICU&#39;s, and the transition isn&#39;t one-way.Our village will be hit far less hard if we behave intelligently about disease prevention.  Turning vaccines into a political wedge issue is one of the stupidest things I&#39;ve seen in my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, but doesn&#39;t mention the other reason that covid-19 is never going completely away: animal reservoirs.  We know that dogs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, mink, white-tailed deer, a gorilla, and a tiger have been found to have been infected with covid-19.  It is implausible that it will ever cease to have an animal reservoir, especially given the finding in Canada of 30% of white-tailed deer having it.Of diseases that get as widespread as this, with animal reservoirs, I don&#39;t believe there is any case of eliminating it.  But, like vaccines can teach the immune system how to respond more intelligently (and less self-destructively) to covid-19, hopefully society can learn to respond more intelligently, and less self-destructively, to the fact that it&#39;s always in circulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I recall correctly, Specialized Bikes pulled all their products from Amazon a while ago, pointing to the failing local bike shops eventually hurting the bike business for everyone.Bicycles are not toys. They are vehicles that need maintenance. You can do much of that maintenance yourself if you&#39;re a nerd, but the vast majority of cyclists are dependent on local bike shops to sustain the cycling community.The bicycle/parts manufacturers need a large cycling community to sell products to. The large cycling community will have novice and intermediate cyclists that will abandon cycling if their bikes break down. The novice and intermediate cyclist need local bike shops to do maintenance on their bikes at affordable rates. The local bike shops need a revenue stream beyond labor for maintenance to be affordable. Thus, the major bicycle manufacturers need to give a oligopoly status to the local bike shops in order to keep their user base large.As a life long cyclist, I&#39;ve seen the industry grow and wane, and throughout it all, I&#39;ve seen the vast majority of people think bicycles are some type of sports-equipment. Decisions like this are one of only a few business models that I can see sustaining the community. I&#39;m actually surprised and optimistic to see the major manufacturer Trek start building their own brick and mortar shops in certain major cities, though I&#39;d prefer to see this happen through a major cooperative between the various brands. If you care about making cycling a serious, sustainable transit alternative, we need to maintain the entire ecosystem of ridership, which means the race to the bottom on amazon must be stopped."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: &#34;PNW wasn’t the only business growing tired of Amazon. Kerson and his team asked buyers at every retailer who stocks PNW parts to remove them from their Amazon stores too, so that everyone involved could maximize their profits and not undercut each other.&#34; ...  “We set up these calls and we were not expecting them to go very well,” says Marshall, “As soon as we started talking about it the buyers were really excited.”From the FTC: &#34;Price fixing is an agreement (written, verbal, or inferred from conduct) among competitors that raises, lowers, or stabilizes prices or competitive terms ... Price fixing relates not only to prices, but also to other terms that affect prices to consumers, such as shipping fees, warranties, discount programs, or financing rates. Antitrust scrutiny may occur when competitors discuss the following topics: ..., Capacity, Identity of customers, ... Defendants may not justify their behavior by arguing that the prices were reasonable to consumers, were necessary to avoid cut-throat competition, or stimulated competition.&#34; [1]Is there a lawer who can say if that was price fixing?[1] https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-a..."</p>

They are selling online, but your order/payment is sent directly to a local shop delivering to you (in Germany). I really like it.Some years ago, Amazon was pushing &#34;Ortlieb bag&#34; adverts on Google to redirect to Amazon where the bags were not to be found and was sued.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can someone &#34;sell me&#34; on Deno? I&#39;m still not sure why I should be interested in this versus for example NodeJS. Most of the features it lists seem rather dubious.&gt; Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.Great, but we&#39;re talking about server software so the first thing any project is going to do is enable all of that. And it&#39;s not like you can trust this on the server, you&#39;d still need to sandbox to process if you truly want isolation.&gt; Supports TypeScript out of the box.Okay so it&#39;s coupled to Microsoft&#39;s take on Javascript. What about Flow or any of the other compiles-to-Javascript languages? What&#39;s wrong with using Babel with sourcemaps?&gt; Ships only a single executable file.I guess that could be convenient but I&#39;m struggling to think of a situation where installing node has ever been a problem.&gt; Has built-in utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a code formatter (deno fmt).Is this not the job of the package manager? Or does deno force you to use itself as the package manager? Will that not just bring about another npm situation in a few years?I feel like I&#39;m clearly missing something with how excited everyone is about deno, but I have no idea what it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a long-time Node user but decided to use Deno for a personal project and found that it&#39;s is a pleasure to work with. Some highlights:  - TypeScript works out-of-the-box without configuration
  - includes modern browser APIs like fetch() without needing to import additional dependencies
  - The Deno-specific APIs (like Deno.readTextFile()[0]) are Promise-based and have intuitive interfaces
  - The Deno standard library[1] reduces the need for 3rd party dependencies, since it covers a lot of cases where one would be needed

I haven&#39;t yet used Deno in a commercial product, but I believe I will in the future because Deno seems ready for primetime.  [0]https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.readTextFile

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When this topic is applied at scale, I feel that the article is discussing &#34;Tech giants don&#39;t want to recruit the people they need to handle customer support&#34;, with extra steps.Tech scales cheaply. People do not.The argument here, which I wholeheartedly support, is that people deserve transparency - we should know what happens to our data. The sum of human interactions, our actions as a group, our foibles, best natures and choices are sitting behind NDAs and firms that are essentially imperial, a state that no one wants.Firms like the power, but not the cost. But any more equitable state will require legions of people to respond to all of those complaints raised in a day. Which costs money.Making that information transparent, giving reasons, creating an appeals process (the santa clara principles) is expense.I bet that no firm wants to, and if forced to do so, they will shift the costs to someone else. Either firms that treat all of those escalations as fodder to churn through or upsell, or to tax paying citizens.Kafkaesque bureaucracy? If anyone is willing to take the other side of a bet, I&#39;ll bet that there is ONLY Kafkaesque bureaucracy here. Get more people, then  you get more lopsided human bias influenced decisions. Get more automation, and then you have the current state of affairs - no nuance, no clarity and the unfeeling boot of an automaton on your account.&#34;Which KPI defined the fate of humanity? Appeals addressed per second&#34;Final point: In the real world, if you have open transparent rules, then it takes human time and physical action to appeal or tie up the system.In a digital system, open and transparent rules mean that someone will eventually automate a way to tie up your appeals que at no cost. Ban the user? New account shows up in 10 seconds.I have no idea how to address this last difference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What magnifies this problem is that unrelated, offline companies are more and more frequently requiring you to use these tech products in order to do business.  On United, you can&#39;t buy a drink on the airplane without installing an app (only available to serfs of the apple or google empires).  You can&#39;t attend a Cubs game in Chicago, again, without an app (no physical tickets, before pandemic).  You can&#39;t see a menu at a restaurant without a smartphone and personal internet connection.  Order carryout only through an app, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is what will happen with this technology... nothing. The company is an IP play where they have locked up this concept in IP and will try and force it on jurisdictions by various means of legislation to ensure they can get the highest prices possible for said IP. Incumbents will resist choosing to continue with current public domain technology. In 30 years when the IP expires it might possibly come into more common use. The current IP regimes are a complete disaster and are hamstringing human progress.PS: Also scroll compressors are substantially more energy efficient than rotary and various means of staging is even more efficient yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the explanation of the A/C fluid cycle is haphazard and the description of how forces relate to crankshaft position is completely wrong.  The crankshaft actually applies maximum force to the piston while approaching top and bottom dead center, when the mechanical advantage is greatest, and the least at mid stroke, where the torque of the motor is most directly opposed by the pressure of the gas against the face of the piston.   This is good, however, because it marries well to the available power through an alternating current system.The design described does seem to have fewer moving parts, which is good.  But the advantage of linear vs rotary motion with respect to forces seems sketchy.  Field strength in the linear system is likely to vary across the travel and would still need to be synchronized to the alternating current to prevent motor stalls.  (Edit 50 of this comment: this effect is actually illustrated directly in the video here: https://youtu.be/2TFiL5BM3ss?t=348  Imagine the field lines directly correlate with force applied, and mentally plot the quantity of field lines over time as you watch the animation.  Turns out it looks precisely like the force chart of a rotary compressor.)The primary advantage of this pump, to me, seems to be reduced weight/complexity and lower friction losses.  For it to operate with low starting load it would likely need to essentially vibrate its way to full travel (confirmed at 7:47 in the video), something rotary compressors can’t really do.  If you try to restart rotary compressors too quickly after stopping, the high head pressure will stall the motor.  This causes it to effectively be a dead short minus winding resistance, pulling much more current than average (known as LRA or locked rotor amps) with no cooling.  This will heat the motor quickly until it thermally trips or burns up.  This is why you will frequently see restart delays in A/C systems.For what its worth, scroll compressors have been around forever and share some of these advantages, but aren’t dominant in the industry because of the additional complexity in manufacturing.  They have an additional advantage of somewhat continous output pressure, which *significantly* reduces ambient noise and vibration.  They also have fewer moving parts and are generally more reliable.All of these advantages convey to standard air compressors by the way, something I&#39;m a little surprised they didn&#39;t mention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do note that Magtor is currently only claiming to be able to compress air, not air conditioning fluids / refrigerants. They add that &#34;[a]lthough air compression is a first milestone for Magtor, the medium-term goal is to bring Magtor efficiencies to climate control engineering allowing products such as fridges, heat pumps and air conditioning units to become 30+% more efficient&#34; [1].It&#39;s hard to verify more on the design. They offer a lot of explanation and tests, but no independent review is given. Main question on YouTube about scrolling compressors (used in newer fridges) is anwered a bit vaguely [2].The patent portfolio page is very grandiose [3] but doesn&#39;t care to link anything. A quick search doesn&#39;t turn up much to do with air or fluid compression, only &#34;Magnet device comprising stators and translators&#34; [4] and similar, which don&#39;t mention compression at all.[1] https://www.magtor.tech/who-we-are/[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TFiL5BM3ss&amp;lc=UgxHEJkjlZ9fZ...[3] https://www.magtor.tech/intellectual-property/[4] https://patents.google.com/patent/US10943721B2"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, surprised to find myself here and appreciate all the discussion. I&#39;m the author of the above project and wanted to shed some light on the inspiration for the project.It started as a simple weekend project based on an off-hand comment someone made in a security professional chat I&#39;m in. I had used duress words in military and translating the concept to a PAM seemed like a fun exercise. Also supports my current shift towards swapping careers from pure software engineering to cyber-research or cybersecurity generally. So in the end, it was a weekend project that served a dual purpose as a resume stamp.The design use case I had in mind was more benign; such as corporate espionage or journalists getting their devices confiscated (maybe keep a sticky note on the laptop that has a duress password on it as a red-herring). Comments to the effect that law enforcement would image a device are very relevant as any competent law enforcement agency should have their staff trained to get the device fully powered off and hand it to someone that can maintain a chain of custody and get a golden image for use in potential criminal charges.One thought I had was to apply this to SSH auth for honeypots and if a rockyou.txt password is attempted it runs some routines that aid in crafting the honeypot before the intruder drops to a shell prompt. Another even more light-hearted implementation could be you have password X is the one you login to normally and your &#34;duress&#34; password Y just clears your browser history and is the one you give your spouse for when they log into your computer :). I&#39;m sure there&#39;s use cases in the full spectrum and with it being a relatively simple implementation with user generated scripts, it&#39;d be easy to extend to any potential use case.In any case I&#39;m glad it prompted such a good discussion. Feel free to submit issues if there are particular feature requests or bugs that one might run across. Additionally if there&#39;s a PR up, I&#39;m currently the only dedicated dev on the project and welcome anyone that wants to review my PRs; always prefer a 3rd person review even on my own projects. I created a demo video using Pushover and in the process of doing the demo uncovered some bugs that I patched as well as some fixes to the documentation. Again, glad you all found this interesting and humbled it fostered such a good discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Training is very important in duress systems.I once worked in a place with a keypad duress code on the security system. If you prefixed your security PIN with NN-, it was the duress version of the code and would trigger a silent alarm.This was setup long-ago, and not communicated. One night, the keypad was acting glitchy. Partially out of frustration (countdown is running), and partially to test, I ended up accidentally engaging the duress code by tapping a convenient corner number, which resulted in NNNNNNNNN-PIN.After law enforcement had surrounded the building, a quick chat and search alongside a few officers got it all sorted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are multiple levels of protection one might want.I.e. when you are being selected for random questioning entering US as a non-US citizen, you&#39;d benefit from steganography-like approach: you give a password, and relatively bland, non-personal stuff shows up, giving appearance of full access to a system.If you only care about your privacy, the next one is to have a destroy-everything script (and it&#39;s not that hard: usually, passphrases are only used to decrypt the actual encryption keys, so overwriting those keys should be super fast).  This would also work against unsophisticated attacks which are not going to really cost you your life.If there is a potential for you to be a target of a sophisticated attack and the attacker does not care about taking your life, the biggest benefit is to have a way to inform someone of your whereabouts while you are actually giving access, ideally in a way that buys you time (eg. &#34;webcam has detected stress on your face, please wait another 6 hours before trying to log in again&#34; — sorry, company mandated software, when it happens usually, we call support)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few highlights from a conversation with a friend who works for Zeiss and regularly deals with ASML (take this with a grain of salt, I may have misunderstood some of it and he also may not be an expert in all of these areas):- The lenses (actually mirrors for EUV) only demagnify by a factor of 4. So your wafer template is already extremely small and costs millions to produce.- 13.5nm is pretty much the smallest wavelength you can reasonably handle. If you want to go smaller, you have to build a particle accelerator. (He heard that from a colleague, wasn&#39;t sure how much of that was actually true.)- The prices in this Twitter thread are pretty spot on. The EU wants to invest into chip making to become more independent in this area. But the sums they&#39;re talking about wouldn&#39;t even pay for one such machine. Politicians don&#39;t seem to be aware of the dimensions we&#39;re talking about here.- Also in the thread, ASML has a monopoly on this tech. Others have not invested into EUV and by now, it&#39;s pretty much impossible for anybody to catch up.- Everyone&#39;s hiring like crazy atm. He started home office during Covid and now Zeiss says he can&#39;t even go back to the office because they don&#39;t have enough office space anymore. He doesn&#39;t mind. Everyone&#39;s distributed all over the place anyway so whether he does conference calls at the office or at home makes no difference.- He said they&#39;re not very affected by the chip shortage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah yes, ASML. I have a number of friends and ex-colleagues who work there. Unsurprisingly, due to their importance, ASML are extremely well-known inside of the Netherlands. It&#39;s one of those companies that spun out of Philips Electronics and became very successful (NXP is another good example).A lot of research and development is still going on in the area where Philips had their research labs. If you&#39;re curious to see what kind of high-tech is being worked on in the &#34;Dutch silicon valley&#34; I suggest you Google &#34;Brainport Eindhoven&#34; or &#34;High Tech Campus Eindhoven&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like ASML is the company that almost everyone who would care has heard of at this point. Granted, I hadn&#39;t heard of them 3 years ago, even though I work directly with HW designers.Its just funny how they&#39;re going through the hype cycle in their level of public awareness. Give it 3 years and (hopefully) the &#34;general public&#34; won&#39;t have to care about them again, because chip shortages are resolved

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article says that employees of the AI company (ShotSpotter) manually reviewed and classified the sounds as gunshots:&gt; records showed that ShotSpotter actually initially picked up what sounded like a firework a mile away, and this was later reclassified by ShotSpotter staff to be a gunshot at the intersection where and when Williams was seen on camera.So the AI didn’t even make the call. The staff did, manually. I assume that means the actual audio is available and entered into evidence?If humans are making the call then blaming AI seems like a stretch. That’s almost like blaming the motion detection algorithms for triggering video recordings that were later reviewed by humans. It’s still humans reviewing the recordings and making decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve created ~five new projects over the past year using SQLite and I&#39;ve got into the habit of creating tables like this:  CREATE TABLE tIssue (
    id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL CHECK (typeof(id) = &#39;integer&#39;),
    col1 BLOB NOT NULL                CHECK (typeof(col1) = &#39;blob&#39;),
    col2 TEXT                         CHECK (typeof(col2) = &#39;text&#39; OR col2 IS NULL)
  );

This has saved me from a lot of errors and has been useful, but it&#39;s just so easy to let things drift, e.g. removing `NOT NULL` constraint and forgetting to also update the check constraints. I&#39;m also horrified at the auto-conversions that I&#39;ve just learned about from this link that I&#39;m not protected from.I&#39;m very much looking forward to using strict tables."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really welcome.  One idea for an approach I had a while back (but haven&#39;t attempted writing code yet) was to see if &#34;personalities&#34; could be implemented.For example a &#34;PostgreSQL&#34; personality (set via PRAGMA maybe?) which dynamically imposes the same type names and &#34;limitations&#34; on SQLite as PostgreSQL.Ditto for other SQL dialects (MySQL, etc).SQLite already has the flexibility to allow the data types, so this idea is a way of putting constraints in place that are really beneficial for a _lot_ of common use cases.eg &#34;You&#39;re using SQLite as a local test for a [PostgreSQL/MySQL/etc] prod database&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"2D games had so many tricks that they often looked better than their 3D replacements for quite some time. If you were able to do every pixel by hand for a few views you often ended up with more detail than you could in the low amount of polygons available early on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Fake perspective&#34; was problematic in early flight simulators as well where texture-mapping was used. The classic example being a long runway.If the runway was a long polygon and you had a long texture map (with a dashed centerline for example) the standard code to map the bitmap to the projected runway polygon would not in fact apply perspective to the bitmap — the intervals between the dashes would be a fixed not perspective distance.The solution was to break up the runway into a whole bunch of shorter polygons — each with a bitmap of perhaps one stripe/dash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nowdays, I make the distinction between maintainable programs and hackable ones, the later of course being, imo, way better. What I mean by that is essentially that the ratio # by-design features over simplicity of code of the hackable program is considerably higher than the maintainable program (but there is no method to write a hackable program, you either have the sensibility for that or you dont, from my own observation - I&#39;ll be happy to discuss the nuances of that statement).I don&#39;t know today but blizzard used to write its game in the hackable way - which is both a feat and rare. Take WoW for example, do you know how the 3d engine basically work? It&#39;s so simple and so powerful, you are not going to believe it. WoW is made of levels that are connected by portals. That&#39;s it. A level will have portals that will get you to other levels which in turn will have portals which lead to other levels. For example, when you are &#34;outdoor&#34; (with quotes because the engine doesn&#39;t know outdoor actually, it knows levels!), you may find a portal that leads you into a tavern for example. Once you are in the tavern, the program can ignore the rest of the world and focus the whole computer resources on the tavern, just like that, by-design. So you&#39;ll have taverns as detailed as all of what you can see in the exteriors. Better, you can have landscape in each and every level. (note when the player is in the air, say on a gryphon, some portals are ignored.)This is both incredible simple and powerful. Remember the game run on early-2000 PCs. Imagine what you can do with that. Caves? Done. Houses that leads into catacombs? Done. Incredibly detailed cities? Add walls and portals, done. Texture streaming? Well, d-o-n-e. Buildings that leads to indoor landscape? Done.I wouldnt make a game engine differently today.As a comparison, I&#39;m working on one of the most played game in the world atm which is a maintainable program. You have no idea the pain in the ass in comparison just to add simple features. Oh yeah the code is readable. You can fix bugs. But features, just forget it, it takes a shit load of money to get one done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nabokov&#39;s solution to this dilemma, reread. The only good reader is, as he said, a re-reader. If we&#39;re honest nobody can actually remember more than a dozen books, and if you pick the right ones there&#39;s more to learn in any of them than you can learn in years.It&#39;s similar to the sentiment that the only way to understand a poem is to be able to recite it from memory, or the fact that some pianists play nothing else but Bach and yet reach mastery. Everything&#39;s already in there, or most of it anyway.Requires a different mentality, one that treats reading or perception and deep study as the thing to care about, not &#39;absorbing information&#39; or &#39;knowledge&#39;.Umberto Eco once pointed out that the size of the unknown, the books one has not read are magnitudes larger than the books one has read, so to treat knowledge as some sort of priced possession to climb in the pecking order is meaningless, what matters is being adequate in understanding the few things one actually has the time to study."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Because when you’re finally in a situation where you could use its insights, you’ve completely forgotten them.I once read a short essay by Patrick Süskind (author of &#34;Perfume - The Story of a Murderer&#34;). I am paraphrasing, but in it, he discusses his embarrassment that he cannot remember even major plot details or character names of great works of world literature, although he has read them multiple times and they deeply inspired his own work. He then makes an interesting speculation: if a book really and deeply influences you, then maybe actively remembering facts and insights of the book becomes harder and harder, because the book&#39;s ideas have been so deeply ingrained into your brain and thinking that you cannot remember them as facts independent of your thinking. But this doesn&#39;t mean that you have &#34;forgotten&#34; them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way to remember what you read is to make sure you understand all the words in the text, the way they apply in context.It&#39;s the micro-misunderstandings that lead up to the macro-misunderstanding which manifests as &#34;forgetting&#34;.Other commenters also mention applying what&#39;s in the book. That is 100% true, when you&#39;re reading about how to do something. If you&#39;re reading a fact-based book (non-fiction) but not about doing something I usually take a break from the text and think about how it would apply to the subject I&#39;m studying. But it&#39;s just obvious that you can&#39;t get a concept if you don&#39;t understand the words that describe it.The target is conceptual understanding. It&#39;s got nothing to do with memorization. TO get the meaning of a song, for instance, it&#39;s not necessary to memorize the lyrics.One real-world example, I was taking care of my father in the hospital and I noticed one of the techs telling him that he needs to order his dinner from the &#34;dysphagia&#34; menu. I asked her if he could have some other soft foods from home and she said, &#34;all I know is that he needs to order from the menu.&#34; I asked her what dysphagia means, honestly I didn&#39;t know. She didn&#39;t know. I looked it up and told her it means &#34;difficulty in swallowing&#34;. She realized that she never actually understood the concept of WHY one needs to order from the menu. As if the food is somehow magic. So that helped her understand the concept of the rule, and why it applies and I am sure she hasn&#39;t forgotten it.I don&#39;t take notes, mark up pages or speed read or use any crutch, trick or technique to study. I just get the definitions of words that I don&#39;t understand and I do just fine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love walking and there are many parks next to where I live. However I am never able to fully enjoy it or indulge in any longer thinking activities as most of the time I&#39;ll be interrupted by either elderly people asking me &#34;to go back where I came from&#34; or random ID checks by undercover police. This happened a lot (5x times) over the last year when I decide to go and walk in a park, once even during an online call with my team. I live in a medium sized city in Germany and come from North Africa / France and it might show a bit too much.
As a mitigation I once seriously considered changing how I look by for example dressing more like a dad or walking the neighbors dog as an alibi for being &#34;normal&#34;. Maybe it would have interested the old ladies too, who knows. 
For the time being I&#39;ll keep at walking on streets or inside the city as it&#39;s less strange to see foreigners there. Can&#39;t wait to have my private forest :&#39;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a person who walked 8/15 hours for two months straight I can relate to most of the statements written by the author. I believe that listening to music or other recordings takes away from the experience and the mental gains that walking provides, and this is why I skip the headphones during my adventures.I can attest that after 10 days of continuous autonomous movement the mind switches to a &#34;primordial&#34; state that, as a non academic, I believe can be very easily attributable to our nomadic, hunter-gatherer past.Attention gets sharper, acumen rings free, the range of senses expands, creative impulses flourish and it&#39;s easier to perform tasks in unexpectedly smart ways.I suggest those who would like to give it a try embark on a walking adventure that is at least two weeks long, either on pilgrimage routes (which offer great views and allow one to save money thanks to the hospitality options available) like the Camino de Santiago de Compostela / Fatima or long trails such as the Appalachian Trail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yet another great mind (also an infamous introvert) who used to take long walks to refresh his mind was Paul Dirac.  From his 1963 interview [1] with Thomas Kuhn, he describes how a decisive Sunday walk made him see the analogy between commutators in quantum mechanics and Poisson brackets in classical mechanics:&gt; &#34;I used to take long walks on Sundays and get away from the work altogether, and at the end of those walks I would perhaps go on with my work a bit in a refreshed state of mind. And after one of these Sunday walks it occurred to me that the commutator might be the analogue of the Poisson bracket, but I didn’t know very well what a Poisson bracket was then. I had just read a bit about it and forgotten most of what I had read, and I wanted to check up on this idea, but I couldn’t do it because I didn’t have any book at home which gave Poisson brackets and all the libraries were closed. So I just had to wait impatiently until Monday morning when the libraries were open to go and check up on what Poisson brackets really were. Then I found that they did fit, but I had one impatient night of waiting.&#34;[1] https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral..."</p>

They had to bribe people at the passport office into fixing their biometrics etc.Now this sort of thing must make it almost impossible. You can&#39;t even leave your mobile at home accidentally - that would trip alarm bells, especially if your contact does it at the same lunch hour.Spying seems to be a necessary part of how States understand one another.  If human level intelligence work simply gets blown apart by technology then yeah we can keep track on what the other side is doing, but so very often we want to know why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Location history is default off - but in general is useful enough you&#39;ll want to turn it on. To have it turned on you would need to* Sign into your google account* Turned on location history (google account level) - default is off* Turn on location reporting (device level option).---A reasonable balance I&#39;ve found is to have Google delete old location history - to do that you go to Google Maps Timelinehttp://www.google.com/maps/timelineThen do automatically delete location history. This deletes after some time. So you get the benefits of history without the forever record.---You can also see what location history has been tracked for you with Takeout. Some cool visualizers there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One tip I picked up a while back is to be aware of the number of `it`s and other pronouns used. I realized that when my explanation were getting lengthy, I was tempted to avoid duplication by referring to previously mentioned nouns as `it`s, `they`s etc. This practice led to some very confusing sentences, where each `it` meant a different thing.My explanations got noticeably clearer once I started replacing the pronouns with whatever they would refer to instead. Sometimes I also add an additional noun (&#34;this practice&#34;) to make the pronoun clearer.I still overuse pronouns sometimes, but when I want to be extra sure my point gets across, I&#39;m trying to limit them as much as I can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is caused by The Curse of Knowledge:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledgeThat cognitive blind spot causes people to unwittingly write confusing explanations in all domains of life.It&#39;s frequently ironic when somebody writes a sentence following the rhetorical template:  &#34;Not really sure what the confusion is with &lt;X&gt;.   It&#39;s really simple. [blah blah blah...]  And that&#39;s it.&#34;Whether it&#39;s attempting to explain &#34;monads are like a burrito&#34;, or neural networks, Git, or how Federal Reserve works, people unintentionally write circular definitions.E.g.  &#34;Not sure what the issue is... Git is just a DAG directed-acyclic-graph.&#34; &lt;-- yes, in the mind of the author, that explanation is 100% self-explanatory!The only way to avoid the issue is to test your tutorials and explanations on a variety of readers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another pattern I usually encounter is explaining the how but not the why.Trying to understand how a complex mechanism works is hard, but it’s harder if you don’t know why the mechanism exists in the first place.It would be madness to start studying how an airplane engine works without knowing it is used to impulse a flying machine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like a family, eh? So let us see who from my office turns up and does my daily groceries, takes care of my kids and cleans my house if/when I am suffering from a sickness - doesn&#39;t even have to be a prolonged case, a few weeks would do. God forbid if it is prolonged - if the law of the land permits, the head of our &#34;family&#34; (a.k.a my boss) would, in varying levels of directness/corporate-speak, let me know what an &#34;incredibly difficult decision&#34; it has been to &#34;part ways&#34; before kicking me out of the firm. You know who are the people I can most expect to be actually there for me? My actual family.I know that all the families are not same and there are instances where one finds colleagues who go to great lengths to support each other while the dysfunctional family actually weighs things down. But that is not the norm (atleast not in the culture I am from). So if people of a firm use terms like &#34;family&#34;, they better back it up. Otherwise, just shut up and give each other the space that grown-ups deserve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work at a big corporate and we use a national workplace survey that asks if you have a best friend at the office. It’s one of the measures or organization health.I see the survey  results across a pretty big portion of the organization so I understand my answer is one of the lonely few. I always answer ‘no’ because I really don’t have a best friend at work.A best friend is someone you like, enjoy loads of spending time with and maybe most importantly can trust with just about anything. It happens that I don’t really have true friends at work but I have people I care for and would be there for if they needed. That doesn’t make us friends, it makes us decent people.I try to keep a healthy level of separation between work life and home life. I don’t want to know office gossip because I want to be able to continue looking at my colleagues as professionals. I also want the diversification that should I ever leave the company my whole life won’t be blown up because it was attached to the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The workplace described in the article absolutely sounds like a hostile environment. The asker’s bosses are using “family” as an excuse to justify working longer hours. Families don’t do that.That said: Personally, I do want my coworkers and I to be something akin to a family. If I’m going to spend around a third of my life working, I want to do it with a group of people I like and care about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, this is exactly what&#39;s happening in the console gaming market today; Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft have been paying subsidies of millions dollar to renowned studios as well as various preferential treatments on advertising, publishing and marketing of their games.The difference is that the console market has real competitions which gives more leverages to developers. Google didn&#39;t have to do this thanks to its iron grip on the market until Epic have revealed its arsenal. This is why we need to bring more competitions in the app store market; Even if it doesn&#39;t bring any real alternatives, this tiny possibility of competition will force Google and Apple to yield more and more to developers.The first step should be breaking the Duopoly cartel. It&#39;s only possible because Apple has no competitions and Google simply enjoys its follower-ship, enabled by their non-aggression pact. Force Apple to allow third party store and payment solutions to dismantle its unfair advantages against competitor apps thanks to 30% fee. This will force Apple to develop Web and Android version of its services which will effectively nullify the non-aggression pact."</p>

    the Legislature may amend this chapter by a statute
    passed in each house of the Legislature by rollcall
    vote entered into the journal, seven-eighths of the
    membership concurring, provided that the statute is
    consistent with, and furthers the purpose of, this
    chapter. 

Prop 22 was intended to be almost impossible to overturn, requiring a higher bar for amendment than even the state constitution, and only permitting the legislature to amend it if the amendment was &#34;consistent with&#34; Prop 22.Regardless of one&#39;s opinion about Prop 22 and AB5, this provision was undemocratic at its core because it deprived future citizens and their representatives of their ability to modify the law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It took me a few seconds to learn there are two kinds of ballot initiatives in CA.  They can have the force of statutes or constitutional amendments.

Whoever wrote it made a huge mistake.&#34;Citizens of California may initiate legislation as either a state statute or a constitutional amendment. In California, citizens also have the power to repeal legislation via veto referendum.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Second, there’s the matter of how extensively Robux (Roblox’s in-app currency) are used to navigate the creator economy. Roblox creators are paid first by receiving a cut of Robux that comes from the sale, which they can use to purchase other Roblox experiences, in-game assets, cosmetics, etc. That means once a developer enters the Robux economy, their money is all spent inside the Roblox system until they’re able to withdraw it.
...
But to withdraw it, they need to have raked in roughly $1,000 worth of Robux.This part seems pretty indefensible. Like yeah to a  certain extent all online content platforms have a gate like this, but I&#39;ve never heard of one that high. YouTube e will pay you as soon as you make something like $20 iirc. And the fact that they pay you in their gated currency which they then allow you to spend but only within their system seems like am obvious self-serving money grab."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read the article but have not watched the video so I may be missing some context.It really depends on how you define “exploiting”. It doesn’t seem like you _need_ to buy the ads. A kid could make a game on any platform and would encounter similar barriers.Would it be better if the kid played Call of Duty rather than creating something? Even if the chance to profit is low does the kid get something else out of Roblox?To my knowledge kids aren’t dropping out of high school with hopes of being a Roblox millionaire. They may dream about it but I don’t think they act on it. I dreamed about being a pro eSports gamer in high school and I’d argue my time was much worse spent doing that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I want to start by pointing out I use two-factor authentication just about everywhere and Facebook is not an exception.I wish he&#39;d mention what kind of 2FA. The reason you _really_ should use U2F/WebAuthn is because it does origin binding which, unlike entering a TOTP, a code from your hardware token/authenticator app on your phone/SMS/etc is not phishable, i.e. you can&#39;t enter it by accident on accounts.google.com.totallylegit.ru and then have them enter it on real accounts.google.com. This is so because the U2F/WebAuthn security key signs a request, sent by your browser, which embeds the requesting page&#39;s domain, so a signature on attacker.com will not pass victim.com&#39;s verification checks, whereas a code from your authentication app is trivially copied."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s my guess at what happened:How was the account hijacked? Via cookie theft. The author installed malware, maybe some dodgy windows binaries or malicious browser extensions. No amount or type of 2FA on sign-in will protect you against the session cookie being stolen. (Now, additional 2FA on sensitive actions might).Why was the account was banned with such finality, with no chance of appeal? Probably for something outright illegal, like the hijacker uploading CSAM to the account. It&#39;s totally plausible that in an obvious enough case, the policy is e.g. to refer the case to law enforcement and keep the account disabled.Why did the attacker want to get the account permanently disabled? Maybe an account disable doesn&#39;t stop ad campaigns on FB. So the attacker sets up an ad campaign, and then gets the account banned so that the owner can&#39;t reverse it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can this one provide wildcard certificates without having to update DNS entries every three months?That is the one pain point I have with Let&#39;s Encrypt.PS: Yes, you can automate the DNS updates. That is the paintpoint I am talking about. It is one more moving part. One more dependency on a third party. One more thing to set up. One more thing that can break. One more thing that will rot (APIs always change at some point in time).Many people seem to solve the &#34;automate DNS&#34; by putting their DNS credentials on the server which serves their website. This is the worst thing from a security perspective. Now someone who breaks into your application can take over your DNS, point your domain to wherever they like and get any certificate for it they like. This probably enables them to also overtake your email and then escalate further from there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to see a free CA for S/MIME certificates once again.Since more than a year or two, all the free S/MIME certificates that you can get these days have issues:- some of them a valid less than one year which is a huge hassle for S/MIME as opposed to HTTPS because you need to keep all your old certificates around- some of them will not let you use your own private key (I wish i was kidding)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seen this thread going around, but it seems like it skips over the important bit.&gt; So why the rule changes? Because last December the New York Times published an opinion piece by Nick Kristof caller “The Children of Pornhub” that accused the site and its parent company of profiting off revenge porn, child porn and sex trafficking.How do you get from &#39;opinion piece in a newspaper&#39; to &#39;gigantic transnational financial infrastructure company changes its rules&#39;? In my experience, huge companies do not make changes like this purely on the basis of newspaper columns.Was there legal advice? Political pressure? Regulatory pressure? All of those would be much more material than a piece in a newspaper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At least this explains why normal porn sites keep living on perfectly well using MasterCard and Visa. They already have to follow regulatory requirements to demonstrate they are complying with age and consent laws, each video includes a front-matter frame saying where you can get the documentation of their compliance, and many include behind-the-scenes extra content showing all of the performers presenting government-issued IDs and signing consent forms.This brings this conflict out of the realm of adult entertainment and into a broader conflict between incumbent central providers that are held to regulatory standards and apps providing a platform for individual contractors that don&#39;t follow those requirements. It&#39;s in the same field as people arguing AirBNB is only able to exist because it&#39;s allowing people to operate hotels without having to comply with hotel regulations, and Uber allows people to operate taxi services without complying with taxi regulations. OnlyFans was giving individuals a way to produce adult films without having to comply with adult film regulations related to age and consent verification of the performers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aren&#39;t the payment processors not abusing their dominant position, like what happened a decade ago with Wikileaks? At least at that time they had the excuse they were pressured by the US government. What&#39;s motivating them this time? Do we need some sort of liability safe-harbor for payment processors?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey everyone! I have a home server that runs some apps, and I&#39;ve been installing them directly, but they kept breaking on every update. I wanted to Dockerize them, but I needed something that would manage all the containers without me having to ever log into the machine.This also worked very well for work, where we have some simple services and scripts that run constantly on a micro AWS server. It&#39;s made deployments completely automated and works really well, and now people can deploy their own services just by adding a line to a config instead of having to learn a whole complicated system or SSH in and make changes manually.I thought I&#39;d share this with you, in case it was useful to you too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been knee deep in deployment space for post 4 years. It is pretty hard problem to solve to the n-th level. Here&#39;s my 2 cents.Single machine deployments are generally easy, you can do it DIY. The complexity arises the moment you have another machine in the setup, scheduling workloading, networking, setup to name a few, starts becoming complicated.From my perspective, kubernetes was designed for multiple team, working on multiple services and jobs, making operation kind of self serviced. So I can understand the anti-kubernetes sentiment.There is gap in the market between VM oriented simple deployments and kubernetes based setup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My anti-kubernetes setup for small single servers is docker swarm, portainer &amp; traefik. It&#39;s a setup that works well on low powered machines, gives you TLS (letsencrypt) and traefik takes care of the complicated network routing.I created a shell script to easily set this up: https://github.com/badsyntax/docker-box"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s about time. When I learned that applications like YNAB (You Need A Budget) use services like Plaid to connect to my bank account, and that these services literally take my username and password and impersonate me to get my banking data, I was a little sketched out. I use YNAB every day, and having it connected to my bank account is incredibly useful, but if something goes wrong and Plaid loses my money somehow, is there any recourse?Hopefully individuals will be able to use the Open Banking APIs to access their own data directly, but it looks like accreditation will be required, so probably not.Here&#39;s the full text of the report: https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/consult..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a developer living in a country that has fully implemented &#34;Open Banking&#34;, here&#39;s a quick setting of expectations for Canadian developers so they don&#39;t get too excited as I did when this was first being introduced.Open Banking is not, in fact, open in almost any sense of the world. It is standardised and the standards are freely available (&#34;open&#34;), but other than that, you still need to have an official &#34;blessing&#34; to actually access a production API endpoint (even for your own account), you need a legal entity that has some highly specific and entirely meaningless certificates that are hard (and potentially expensive) to get and even after all of that, you&#39;ll still need to negotiate access with each bank individually.What I imagined when I first heard of &#34;Open Banking&#34; was a public OAuth2 endpoint where I can grant my custom script access to just my bank balance and transaction history (possibly with a change webhook) and have it update my finance tracking database.The &#34;open&#34; part is only relevant to the banks, since they don&#39;t have to pay royalties for the standard implementing the APIs. For the rest of us, it might as well be SS7."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This may be driven by TD&#39;s suit against PlaidFrom this source https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8f56092c-ab40...&#34;Users have complained that after connecting their bank accounts, Plaid stores their credentials and uses them to collect 5 years’ of transactional data and continues to track users’ data in future. Users further claim that the data-gathering scheme is not incidental to Plaid’s business model and is, in fact, its “very purpose.”"</p>

They call it &#34;sophisticated&#34; but it probably was just stupid or lazy, which is very common in most corporate hacks. Big companies don&#39;t really care much about security since it costs money and rarely causes much trouble to your stock price and exec compensation.The people who suffer are those whose data is compromised and have no idea it happened."</p>

The member states recognize identities issued by other member states, but there is no central system.In any case, the private key is stored on a plastic ID, which acts as a smart card and can be hooked up to a smartphone/PC for identity verification and document signing online. The key is only released with a PIN, and the databases online only store the corresponding public key.A leak of a public key without the private key is (relative to SSN) harmless.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDASCan we please have this in the US?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went from being a quite a bad procrastinator to making quite strong progress in running and learning the piano. One of the secrets was setting specific times to do these things such that I can&#39;t wriggle out. For example I run on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings rather than the more vague &#34;three times a week&#34; which gives wiggle room on a given day. I also set modest goals of two 5ks and one longer run (up to 10k). For piano, I aim for twenty minutes a night minimum, five nights a week minimum after dinner (week nights but sometimes I have to be flexible and drop a weeknight and do a weekend). I won&#39;t be an Olympic runner or Mozart but I&#39;m heck of a lot fitter and better at the piano after a surprisingly short amount of time.My &#39;secrets&#39; are rather boring; schedule specific times, keep it achievable and don&#39;t overdo it in the early days. Little and often works wonders and you build the ritual / habit that way. You can then scale the frequency and length of time per session accordingly.Strangely, having kids made me much better at this too. When I had loads of free time I wasted a lot more of it. Now my free time is very limited, it&#39;s much more precious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A major technique mentioned by the author is omitted from the article’s headline: co-working. She writes about benefitting greatly from logging on to a muted Zoom room with hundreds of other people to work at a set time. It’s interesting how this is effective for some people; for another anecdote, blogger Alexey Guzey wrote about a similar system [0] with a smaller group.Psychiatrist Dr. David Burns writes at length about more techniques on addressing procrastination (called “do-nothingism”). He has a chapter on the subject in his book “Feeling Good,” and he wrote a similar passage online in an article for his podcast [1]. The methods he writes about that work best for me have been breaking down tasks into sequence of simple steps. This helps greatly for straightforward tasks, though it is less effective for difficult tasks that involve uncertainty and learning. These harder tasks require persistence and preferably time.Separately, a personal technique I use is to really sell myself on the value of completing a task. The phrase, “discipline matters more than getting motivated” is thrown around a lot on the web, and though it has merit, I find motivation crucial to sustaining projects in the long-term (and also figuring out when it’s worthwhile to exit from a method or approach).[0] https://guzey.com/co-working/[1] https://feelinggood.com/2017/09/18/053-ask-david-i-dont-feel..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Keep in mind that Apple&#39;s claimed false positive rate (one in a trillion chance of an account being flagged innocently), and the collision rate determined by Dwyer in the article, are both derived without any adversarial assumptions. Given that NeuralHash collider and similar tools already exist, the false positive rate is expected to be much much higher.Imagine that you play a game of craps against an online casino. The casino throws a virtual six-sided die, secretly generated using Microsoft Excel&#39;s random number generator. Your job is to predict the result. If you manage to predict the result 100 times in a row, you win and the casino will pay you $1000000000000 (one trillion dollars). If you ever fail to predict the result of a throw, the game is over, you lose and you pay the casino $1 (one dollar).In an ordinary, non-adversarial context, the probability that you win the game is much less than one in one trillion, so this game is very safe for the casino. But this number is very misleading: it&#39;s based on naive assumptions that are completely meaningless in an adversarial context. If your adversary has a decent knowledge of mathematics at the high school level, the serial correlation in Excel&#39;s generator comes into play, and the relevant probability is no longer one in one trillion. The relevant number is 1/216 instead! When faced with a class of adversarial math majors, a casino that offers this game will promptly go bankrupt. With Apple&#39;s CSAM detection, you get to be that casino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In order to test things, I decided to search the publicly available ImageNet dataset for collisions between semantically different images. I generated NeuralHashes for all 1.43 million images and searched for organic collisions. By taking advantage of the birthday paradox, and a collision search algorithm that let me search in n(log n) time instead of the naive n^2, I was able to compare the NeuralHashes of over 2 trillion image pairs in just a few hours. &gt; This is a false-positive rate of 2 in 2 trillion image pairs (1,431,168^2). Assuming the NCMEC database has more than 20,000 images, this represents a slightly higher rate than Apple had previously reported. But, assuming there are less than a million images in the dataset, it&#39;s probably in the right ballpark. It&#39;s great to see the ingenuity and attention this whole debacle is receiving from the community. Maybe it will lead to advances in perceptual hashing (and also advances in consumer awareness of tech related privacy issues)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s been a lot of focus on the likelihood of collisions and whether someone could upload eg; an image with a matching hash to your device to &#34;set you up&#34;, etc. But what&#39;s still extremely concerning is that there is still no guarantee that the hash list used can&#39;t be coopted for another purpose (eg; politically insensitive content)."</p>

This should be a blog post, but I guess that&#39;s too 1999 for the author.So why do foxes lead you to treasure? Answer: They pathfind away from player not by euclidian &#34;distance&#34;, but simply by number of navmesh polygons. The game world has uneven navmesh density, with points of interest (locations often housing treasure) having a higher number of polygons, so the foxes tend to pathfind their escape path into them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Toyota was one of the few (only?) companies to keep a large stockpile of chips on hand to continue production in case of a supply interruption. They kept something like two years worth on hand.I guess 18 months of doing the extremely heavy lifting for the whole industry has taken its toll and now they&#39;re in the same boat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you have a taste for irony, my company makes critical components for semiconductor equipment. If we can&#39;t ship, equipment companies can&#39;t ship new equipment. If they can&#39;t ship, semiconductor fabs can&#39;t increase capacity to meet the demand and solve the shortage.We went line down last week due to shortage of a chip for our component.In reality, the shortage is somewhat self-inflicted, like toilet paper a year ago, but for whatever combination of real demand + hoarding, we can&#39;t get chips."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article (and others about this topic) indicate that the chip shortage isn&#39;t just a static. They all claim that chip and other supply chains (all based on South East Asian) are all under new pressure from delta strain spread.In fact, I wonder how much of this really is chip supply vs general supply. Most articles on this open with headlines about chip supply, but then contains quotes from Toyota about &#34;supply&#34; and &#34;parts&#34; in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"7 years ago I had just aborted an internship, my foray into being an employed adult, because I found myself unable to deal with disagreements. Contrary to my naive hope that the confidence boost from being a Professional Software Developer(tm) would solve all my emotional problems I now knew that my limitations would follow me around anywhere I would go. But I had no idea how to change and was too stuck in my own anxiety and arrogance to ask for help.Around that time I Somehow stumbled upon this[1] article on how to make a Buddhist bone trumpet. It took me completely by surprise, the topic, the author, the tone, the context of Buddhism, nothing fit together like I expected. It was the most absurd thing I ever read and I kept laughing, at the same time it felt utterly genuine. My curiosity piqued I read the other less bizarre articles from the author about Buddhism and life in general. It dawned on me that my attempt at completely controlling my life had, in fact, caused me to lose control over it. The process of learning to accept unpredictability and open myself to the world, that started the evening I read that article, was by no means always this fun, but looking back boy was it worth it.[1] https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/kangling-chod"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://blog.tjcx.me/p/consume-less-create-moreThis article inspired me on two things :1) Lots of the things I do in everyday life is just to consume: buying, watching, following, etc. These things either consume my money, or my time. These things make me feel good, but it does not generate real value. In order to get rich, I need to create things. I also start to realize that great people are great because they started to create things at a very early stage of their life (but not consuming things as they advocate, think about celebrities, entrepreneurs etc), so they are able to practice and perfect the value creating skills to the extreme.2) I start to realize that the world is binary in nature : I create to sell, I buy to consume. I either at the buyer side, or at the seller side. And in this current society, there is a huge buyer side trap, the whole idea of consumerism and social media is to trap you inside the buyer side, so you keep buying, you keep consuming. I really need to break free from this trap.This blog post was written before COVID-19, but the idea feels even fresher during this pandemic era"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In fall of 2018, I read a blog post by Dan Luu called &#34;The googlebot monopoloy&#34;.https://danluu.com/googlebot-monopoly/It&#39;s a short blog post that I&#39;ve probably read a thousand times at this point. He wrote about how websites give Google a big advantage when it comes to web crawling and how that big advantage probably makes it harder for other search engines to compete with Google. This was a pretty striking idea to me and there was a lot of talk at the time about antitrust and Big Tech. Dan&#39;s post had been written in 2015, so I was sure that a ton of other people, especially DC policy people, already knew about this and were talking about it. Right?Turns out, basically nobody in DC knew anything about this. A ton of website operators complain about it on their own forums like HN and SEO, it&#39;s not hard to find people griping about the cost of Bing&#39;s crawlers, but those people never saw fit to tell anybody in DC about this and how it impacts the market for general purpose search engines and gives Google such an advantage. So I started writing down everything that I was finding about Google&#39;s web crawling advantage and writing it in a way that policy people could understand these things called web crawlers they had probably never heard much about before.And, long story short, the policy people were very grateful that I had gotten in touch and explained all this, and I got cited in the Big Tech Antitrust report published by Congress last summer and then featured in The New York Times:https://knuckleheads.club/we-crawled-our-way-into-the-big-te...https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/how-google-dom...So, Dan&#39;s blog post has had a pretty big impact on my life so far and it&#39;s not quite done yet. The pandemic has slowed me down this year much more than it did last year, but I&#39;m working on preparing to submit a paper to an economics journal for peer review that lays out the dynamics of web crawling, why Google accrues this advantage and why it matters. I&#39;m very grateful to Dan for writing that post and, as far as career advice goes, I heartily recommend going back every once in a while and rereading everything he has ever written. Who knows what else he&#39;s hiding in there?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would be a serious breach of privacy if true. But reading the tweets I&#39;m not sure what the policy really is:&gt; During a discovery thing 3yr ago, legal forced me to hand-over all my texts. They refused to let me delete anything, even &#34;fully personal,&#34; even when I said &#34;by fully personal I mean nudes.&#34; They said they&#39;re in their &#34;permanent evidence lockerThis doesn&#39;t sound like company policy, and more like they were subpoenaed or otherwise compelled to hand over communications.&gt; Another interesting Apple tidbit: the company tells employees to link their personal iCloud accounts if they need to collab with colleagues when they start. When they leave, they&#39;re asked to hand over their laptops w/o wiping them and give managers access to work systems.I&#39;m not sure how to parse this. Do you need to link your personal accounts with family photos and whatnot? Or can you just create a separate iCloud account just for work, to collaborate with coworkers?I&#39;m a firm believer in separating work and personal accounts. I usually try not to even log into email from my work computer if I don&#39;t need to, and I always use a spare phone for work if a company requires admin access or remote management tools of any kind. That said, reading these tweets I&#39;m not really sure if Apple is asking employees to breach this separation. I&#39;d just create a separate Apple ID for work and use that for the &#34;personal&#34; account that I&#39;m supposed to merge. That&#39;s a separation I&#39;m still comfortable with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago when I hired on at Apple (I&#39;ve since moved on to greener pastures) I had a tough time provisioning my corporate MacBook. Every time I tried entering my work email address I got kicked into an unfamiliar auth flow that ended up not working. After I mentioned how much trouble I was having, someone sitting near me in the office told me I needed to use a personal Apple ID to provision the device.I created a completely new consumer iCloud account and used that. I never did anything remotely &#34;personal&#34; on that machine, and after I left Apple I never used that iCloud account again. In fact I don&#39;t even remember my password for it.I went so far as to carry two iPhones, one personal and the other &#34;corporate,&#34; and I only ever used my &#34;corporate&#34; iPhone with Apple employee apps. I never even connected my personal phone to the campus WiFi; I used wireless data for that phone the entire time I was there.That said, I don&#39;t recall ever being asked to merge my personal and work accounts. It&#39;s just that if you want to do any personal stuff with corp hardware, it&#39;s much more convenient to just use your personal Apple ID when you provision the hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here’s my take as someone who worked there in the last two years.1. You absolutely have the choice to make a separate iCloud account for work, you just can’t make it with an @apple.com email.
2. It’s true that you should not wipe your device when you quit.
3. We were instructed to avoid using iCloud for anything work related. They recommended turning everything iCloud related off on your work computer except for FindMy.
4. None of the claims in the tweet sound familiar to me, but Apple is a big org.My impression is that they need you to have an iCloud account for tracking the location of the device with FindMy, but technical/legal limitations prevent that from happening through your work email."</p>

But I really love that this made it to hacker news because I feel like &#34;hacking&#34; doesn&#39;t exclude non-software hacks and it&#39;s always awesome to see hardware for design and making alongside all the other software news.The idea of open source robotic assemblies or mechanical assemblies is another cool, separate thing. Another cool project I came across was the AR-1, AR-2, AR-3 series of desktop 6-axis robots. The inventor/designer made all the assembly docs open-sourced and sells kits or specs to make your own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat kinematics with a horribly flexible frame that denies any serious usage. That said - it&#39;s designed to a low budget that increases the potential audience, and that is something that can only be welcomed. I&#39;m particularly interested in the software as that will be an enabler for future variations that have mechanical rigidity.Nice website!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This could be greatly simplified (at higher cost) by using linear motors for the cross-slides.It may even be more rigid than what is there now (though nowhere near rigid enough to do anything real)The design is actually not unique at all - you can buy much better versions of it (at higher cost, obviously).Most positioning actuators you can buy are literally built to be attached to each other in a cross-slide configuration, and to have a rotary table attached to it.  They also directly sell pre-built cross-slide actuators.If you just google &#34;cross-slide stepper&#34; or &#34;cross-slide servo&#34;, you can see this
(servo/stepper just gets rid of the manual ones, which also exist).The normal reason the configuration is not used is because it has no meaningful rigidity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Richard Bartle is a luminary in the field of game design. He invented a system for classifying gamers&#39; preferred game actions called the &#34;Bartle taxonomy&#34;, which helps game designers understand player motivations better. Think of it like user personas in software development - Killers love competition, Explorers love discovery, Achievers love mastery, and Socializers play games for social reasons. When designing a game for mass appeal it&#39;s often important to make sure players of all stripes find reasons to enjoy it, and Bartle&#39;s taxonomy is a great framework for analyzing how different types of players will interact with a game.You can take an online version of the Bartle taxonomy questionnaire to get your own results here:http://matthewbarr.co.uk/bartle/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those interested, Bartle is the co-creator of the first MUD (multi-user dungeon, online text style adventure).He made a brilliant explanation why is text the best medium to activate the imagination:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zctp972y_Eg"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t believe how weak these cases have been - are these more of a posturing thing?* These were all approved at the time. This is going to make for a crazy world if folks act on an approval and then they are reversed.* The focus of a lot of these seems to be on harm to other (sometimes very scammy) businesses. The Apple case has this issue as well. Match group can&#39;t do non-cancelable auto-renewing billing in their own app store. Rando app can&#39;t get your email and other details but you can route via apple. Etc. Why not focus on consumer harm more - that was traditional focus. The complaint is Facebook doesn&#39;t make an easy api for others to scrape their platform - uh, hello cambridge analytic?* These social network things seem somewhat fragile. Myspace came and went, Friendster was hot. Now I see a lot more folks on tiktok. Are kids still even active on facebook?* Instagram wasn&#39;t that big when purchased, and many folks (including same people writing the articles now about monopolies) said that facebook wildly overpaid.https://twitter.com/rockspindeln/status/189416024058245121What&#39;s crazy is there is so much straight pure scam crap on the internet the FTC does nothing about. I mean, stuff that is obvious consumer harm. In my case I tried to cancel a subscription 30 days in advance recently (nearly 1K per year). It turns out you have to cancel 90 days in advance but not more than 120 days in advance?? So now I&#39;m on the hook for another 1K. That is just total trash behavior online. And instead of the click to sign up, I had to go through endless hoops. Talked to someone, then they wanted me to submit a case, I did that, then back and forth to &#34;verify&#34; me etc etc.The FTC is crickets on just endless false advertising, misleading internet offers etc (stuff that&#39;s not even close to OK)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After suffering significant failures during this critical transition period, Facebook found that it lacked the business talent and engineering acumen to quickly and successfully integrate its outdated desktop-based technology to the new era of mobile-first communication. Unable to maintain its monopoly or its advertising profits by fairly competing, Facebook’s executives addressed this existential threat by buying up the new mobile innovators, including its rival Instagram in 2012 and mobile messaging app WhatsApp in 2014.Man, I hate FB as much as the next guy, but this argument is weak as hell.FB was still the #1 mobile app in the world when they bought up both of these companies. Hell, neither were even direct competitors any more than Oculus was.FB&#39;s play is clearly a horizontal integration - they want as many different types of products to fall under their single advertising pane of glass as possible. The FTC is going after them for doing the exact opposite thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat.Illegally bought or buried them?1) FTC approved all the mergers. So, it is surprising that they&#39;d say that these were illegally bought.2) Facebook seems to be operating all key acquisitions (Instagram and WhatsApp) as separate products and hasn&#39;t made their usage conditional to having a Facebook account.This is re-writing history and it is just as dangerous when the FTC does it as it is when a political party does it."</p>

When the button has been pushed, the old artwork is deleted and can&#39;t be retrieved again.Setup:* An Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX was used for all logic, machine learning inference, art kiosk GUI etc.* A StyleGAN was used to generate the artworks, trained on ~5k images of abstract art.* A passive infrared sensor (SR602) was integrated with the Jetson to reduce screen burn-in.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Second preimage attacks are trivial because of how the algorithm works. The image goes through a neural network (one to which everyone has access), the output vector is put through a linear transformation, and that vector is binarized, then cryptographically hashed. It&#39;s trivial to perturb any image you might wish so as to be close to the original output vector. This will result in it having the same binarization, hence the same hash. I believe the neural network is a pretty conventional convolutional one, so adversarial perturbations will exist that are invisible to the naked eye.This is useful for two purposes I can think of. One, you can randomize all the vectors on all of your images. Two, you can make problems for others by giving them harmless-looking images that have been cooked to give particular hashes. I&#39;m not sure how bad those problems would be – at some point a police officer does have to look at the image in order to get probable cause. Perhaps it could lead to your Apple account being suspended, however."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neuralhashes are far from my area of expertise, but I&#39;ve been following Apple closely ever since its foundation and have probably watched every public video of Craig since the NeXT take over and here is my take: I&#39;ve never seen him so off balance before as in his latest interview with Joanna Stern. Not even in the infamous “shaking mouse hand close up” of the early days.Whatever you say about Apple, they are an extremely well oiled communication machine. Every C-level phrase has a well thought out message to deliver.This interview was a train wreck. Joanna kept asking: please, in simple terms, to a hesitant and inarticulate Craig. It was so bad that she had to produce infographics to fill the communication void left by Apple.They usually do their best to “take control” of the narrative. They were clearly caught way off guard here. And that&#39;s revealing."</p>

What if one day this deceptive &#34;knowledge box&#34; gets someone lynched? Am sure this has already happened if the lens is broad enough. Nevertheless they cannot be allowed to associate random photos with unrelated content without repercussions. At the very least they should have a channel where the general public can reach them and they take prompt action based on the merits of the case.It&#39;s laughable how feudal, unaccountable, unreachable and unregulated the tech industry is, while they have a deliberately cultivated oversized impact on society."</p>

I am reminded of this quote over and over when I encounter those things that are (TIL) absurdly called &#34;knowledge panels&#34;. They often confidently present completely wrong information about even trivial things (like the weight of a specific camera or lens).It is distressing (but not really surprising) to hear they are having disastrous consequences about more complex and obviously ambiguous queries, queries that no so-called &#34;AI&#34; should ever be answering, without a prominent disclaimer that the information was generated by a fuzzy-logic computer program without the ability to actually comprehend the topic at hand, and that therefore the information may be completely and utterly incorrect. (Such a disclaimer would obviously destory this &#34;feature&#34;, though.)I&#39;ve always charitably assumed that Schmidt was trying to make some point that is less insane than the quote first sounds, like &#34;correct information will eventually triumph over incorrect information if you just give people all the &#39;information&#39; you can&#34;. But Google increasingly offers me information in ways that seem like he and they just, like, literally meant that quote as it reads.(Also, even if that was the point he was trying to make, it&#39;s been thoroughly disproven over the past several years.)[1]: https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/17/google-eric-schmidt-cyb..."</p>

Yes or no. Over and over and over again.On any machine logged into by a local administrator user, if they&#39;re the standard kind of careless user, they&#39;ll just click yes without thinking and they&#39;re owned. If they&#39;re cautious, and on a box where UAC presents as a modal dialog, as per its default config, this essentially locks the user out of the OS until they click &#34;yes&#34;... and they&#39;re owned.On an assessment we did at a local 200-seat business where they ran with admin rights on their local boxes, we got about a 90% escalation rate. The other 10% of people got up from their desks and went to ask the IT guy, which we considered a &#34;pass&#34; in that scenario.Interesting stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The last paragraph hits the nail on the head, it&#39;s impossible to prevent developers from elevating privileges unless one spends much more time and effort than almost any business is willing to on creating a true zero trust internal environment.Developers have little RCEs throughout the entire system, it&#39;s how they do their jobs. If even system with millions of dollars worth of design and security reviews regularly get hacked by people with no internal access to it or its source code, how can you hope to stop someone who already has a foothold and can see into the system, including a bunch of its config files?The real answer is not to stop developers from doing so. That&#39;s a never ending uphill battle. You implement very good logging and RBAC systems instead. Now everybody could hack the system if they wished to, but they would be sued into oblivion if they tried to do it for nefarious reasons.IMO the main purpose of RBAC is not really to stop developers from doing malicious activity, but to stop the stupid ones from breaking the system. The smart ones will be able to get around whatever safeguards you put in, as some of them will undoubtedly be designed by those not so fortunate or experienced. Not every developer has a good understanding of infosec and its many, _many_ ways of circumventing what seems to be an impossible defence. Unless you know all the tricks in the book already, whatever you write is most definitely gonna be swiss cheese."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That last paragraph is hard to argue with:  Maybe this is our version of the &#34;infinite monkeys&#34; thing: given enough software people, enough computers, and enough time, someone at a company will eventually grant universal remote root access to anyone who knows how to read some source code.

At one job, way back in the day, I had a dream that a shared web-hosting installer framework could give you root on whatever server hosted your stuff. Went to work the next day and indeed... it was true and trivially easy to exploit.Sadly, it was a custom wallpaper upload feature that ended up being the actual source of shenanigans. You get 3 guesses on what happened and probably need just one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Neural hash generated here might be a few bits off from one generated on an iOS device. This is expected since different iOS devices generate slightly different hashes anyway. The reason is that neural networks are based on floating-point calculations. The accuracy is highly dependent on the hardware. For smaller networks it won&#39;t make any difference. But NeuralHash has 200+ layers, resulting in significant cumulative errors.This is a little unexpected. I&#39;m not sure whether this has any implication on CSAM detection as whole. Wouldn&#39;t this require Apple to add multiple versions of NeuralHash of the same image (one for each platform/hardware) into the database to counter this issue? If that is case, doesn&#39;t this in turn weak the threshold of the detection as the same image maybe match multiple times in different devices?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now that the model is known, I wonder how hard it is to create &#34;adversarial collisions&#34;: given an image and a target hash, perturb the image in a way that is barely perceptible for a human, so that it matches the target hash."</p>

I&#39;ll pick CSAM Scanning over my Location data being in the hands of Google, sorry.And as for my laptop, macOS doesn&#39;t scan, and the M1 is too impressive and has me spoiled. And I have too many horror stories with both Linux and Windows and can&#39;t stand either of them. (Don&#39;t tell me switch to Linux - I&#39;ve tried over a dozen distributions over the last decade. It&#39;s just not there yet.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those studying MacBook alternatives, I think the most underrated “serious” notebook computer in the world is the Panasonic Letsnote SX/SV.Matte screen that actually works outdoors, removable long-life battery, unassuming vintage design (“let’s not rob that guy, he can’t even afford a new computer”). I haven’t investigated the Linuxability of this thing yet, but it’s super-light and impressive as a mosh terminal (especially with built-in 4G LTE!). Tough magnesium body, super comfy keyboard that’s easy to swap out if you beat it up. Made in Japan!I have a fully loaded MacBook Pro, and couldn’t imagine doing design work on anything else, but I somehow end up getting lots of work done on the Letsnote. It’s at a point where I don’t think I’ll be excited about the long-awaited new 14-inch MacBook Pro, as I doubt it’ll have a matte screen and a durable exterior (and, I much prefer to look like a sad worker stuck with a dorky computer from 2006, than a moneyed tech guy)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Desktop - Ubuntu 20.04. Everything works and my requirements are quite advanced - bunch of games on Steam, pro level audio production studio just to mention a few things.Laptop - Dell Precision 7750, Xeon CPU, 64 GB RAM, bought with Ubuntu pre-installed. Beast of a laptop, superior thermals, wipes the floor with a mac.Phone - Google Pixel. I consider that a lesser evil choice to Apple&#39;s walled garden. It&#39;s rooted, I don&#39;t see any ads, etc.Tablet - Google Pixel Slate. High end tablet with 16 GB RAM running Chrome OS which supports native linux apps for a while now.These were all more or less state of the art devices at the time of buying, I have absolutely no need whatsoever to to even think about Apple or Microsoft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  We are perhaps the only public company that shares financial results internally in the weeks before the quarter is closed. We announce these numbers at a quarterly business review meeting with our top seven hundred or so managers. The financial world sees this as reckless. But the information has never been leaked. When it does one day leak (I imagine it will), we won’t overreact. We’ll just deal with that one case and continue with transparency.

The CEO of Netflix says this in Ch 5 of his book No Rules Rules. The leak is a predictable result and will happen again. He believes the tradeoff in openness is worth it. If this $3 million is the only incident, maybe he is right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Sung Mo Jun, Joon Jun, and Chon allegedly used encrypted messaging applications to discuss their trading in an attempt to evade detection. According to the complaint, Sung Mo Jun, Joon Jun, and Chon made approximately $3 million in total profits from the illegal scheme. The SEC Market Abuse Unit&#39;s Analysis and Detection Center uncovered the trading ring by using data analysis tools to identify the traders&#39; improbably successful trading over time.&#34;I&#39;m curious which messaging app they used. I also wonder if someone tipped off the SEC or they just uncovered this in their own analysis work - it doesn&#39;t seem like making $3m off Netflix stock trades over a couple of years is particularly alarming on the surface, but idk I&#39;m not an expert... maybe the timing of the buy orders and also looking into what other trades they were making (if any) was easy to spot."</p>

It could cause any number of personal and professional problems for innocent people whose names are included in the list.”I’m curious how many journalists are on the list. Now that we are pulling out of Afghanistan, we should reevaluate the other actions we took after 9/11. The patriot act deserves another look and possible edit."</p>

If there is a list that governmental agencies and/or commercial companies are obliged to check you&#39;re not on before providing you with their service, then surely such list must be public or at the very least, one should be able to easily inquire about whether he/she is on it or not.For a related example, Russian government maintains a list of banned Internet resources. The list is not public — at least in theory — but there is an official web site where you can input an URL or a domain name and it would response either with &#34;no, it&#39;s not on the list&#34;, or with &#34;yes, it&#39;s on the list, here&#39;s who ordered it and when&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HIV is incredibly sophisticated. It&#39;s actually kind of amazing how effective it is. I mean obviously the resulting disease is bad, no question. You can still appreciate the sophistication.HIV has resisted efforts to develop a vaccine for 30+ years at this point.I am already beginning to wonder if the 2020s will be the story of the social transformation caused by mRNA vaccines. An effective and relatively cheap HIV vaccine will be huge.Apart from Covid and HIV, mRNA is going to have a huge effect on the flu vaccine too. For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, predictions are made about what flu strains will dominate the coming winter 4-6+ months ahead of time and the vaccine is made from that. Those predictions may not be accurate, which largely explains the variance of efficacy. mRNA has the potential to reduce that down to 1-2 months so you can potentially react to the actual dominant strains.Cancer of course isn&#39;t a single disease. Even something like lung cancer are a collection of different diseases. But some cancers are caused by viruses. A notable example is cervical cancer where it seems like most cases are caused by HPV strains. Australia is on track to essentially eliminate cervical cancer by 2035 [1]. To be clear, this isn&#39;t an mRNA vaccine.But mRNA vaccines may greatly reduce the time required to develop a vaccine and make it possible to eliminate whole classes of diseases.This is all super-exciting.[1]: https://www.vcs.org.au/blog/our-impact/news/australia-can-co...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Video of the lifecycle of HIV.  To me it&#39;s absolutely mind-blowing to think that this entire process developed on its own, in dark, and is mindlessly progressing along so effectively that despite all of our technological capability we can barely contain it.https://vimeo.com/260291607(also how awesome is the music?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The graveyard of HIV vaccines that failed at Phase II is unfortunately large, and this isn&#39;t even there yet.  I won&#39;t be holding my breath on this one.  HIV is tricky."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What shocks me most with this story is that there is a vaccine (Lymerix), and it&#39;s pretty effective (76-92 percent after three injections) but apparently some anti-vax propaganda and a class-action lawsuit essentially removed it from the market. Based on a very rare side effect. Wtf? How can that be? Just tell people the risks of side effects, and if they are ok with that risk then the manufacturer is off the hook.I&#39;d totally take that shot. 59 cases out of 1.4 million is nothing, and even for those it&#39;s unclear how they actually were related to the shot.Sadly, this indicates that the new shot could suffer the same fate. Give it to a million people, some will for sure have some issue, anti-vaxers come with conspiracy theories and convince a few to a class action, and there we go, another few decades without a shot. Gotta be fast this time before it&#39;s too late again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a US new england-er, this is game changer for walking through woods.For those un-informed, on a walk through any woods, you should always wear high socks, and do a full body check for ticks after.Deer ticks can be as small as a few grains of sand, and near undetectable if they latch on unless you have sharp eyes.Obviously they can transmit lymes.I had a close encounter a few years ago, but very luckily giant rings appeared around the bite site, making it a very easy diagnosis.That only happens in 30% of cases though. The rest likely have no idea, and over time the disease will work it&#39;s way into your nervous system, causing permanent damage if not treated quickly enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this is about Lyme disease, but let me add another word of caution while we are discussing ticks.  Two years ago I was bit by the Lone Star tick. Since that time I developed an allergy to all red meat. It was hard to diagnose and a few of the doctors I worked with along the years still don’t believe its true.  If your interested in learning more search for Alpha Gal.  There is an excellent Radio Lab podcast about it."</p>

I spend half my day on meetings either internally or with clients, and every time I have to jump on a client meeting with Microsoft Teams/Google Hangouts/WebEx/GotoMeeting because their company bans Zoom, it&#39;s a recipe for a fruitless meeting. Someone will fumble the sharing controls; screens will take forever to present; at least one person&#39;s microphone will become inaudible, static-y, or suffer from &#34;robot voice slow-down&#34; lag.To say nothing of the clusterf*ck that happens when two company-specific instances of Microsoft Teams try to communicate with each other and I&#39;m left with a bunch of orphaned chatrooms with outside personnel after the meeting concludes."</p>

Yet in 2020 and with the emergence of zoom, it’s suddenly become an expectation that everyone is incessantly and awkwardly staring at each other through screens for the  whole workday.Second, the few times I’ve used Zoom it’s been absolutely garbage, with video and sound dropping or just not there (this was a university paying for Zoom’s services).Yet I use teams everyday, and while I have plenty of complaints about it, at least I can get the sound and (screen-sharing) video that I actually need for my work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article mentions losses at the hohlraum but doesn&#39;t mention losses in the laser. &#34;Ignition&#34; means they controled the implosion well enough to break (almost) even on laser energy, but the laser itself is less than 1% efficient on wall power. Input energy to the entire system is over 400 MJ per shot. Even at max theoretical fusion yield, it wouldn&#39;t come close to breakeven.There&#39;s also a firing rate issue. Even if the system produced net power, significant production would require many shots per second. Currently, the laser flash lamps are expendable and it takes on the order of a day (and lots of money) to prep for each shot.Some of these drawbacks were addressed in the LIFE proposal, which would use fusion neutrons to burn fission fuel in a blanket around the fusion chamber. You could burn spent reactor fuel subcritically (no fission chain reaction), for example. But then it&#39;s a fission machine, and criticality excursions aren&#39;t much of an issue in conventional fission reactors. In the end, there are many drawbacks and little benefit with such a setup -- even if it worked.I love lasers, and NIF is a marvel. But there really is no sensical story about power production in it. Even the machine&#39;s stated purpose -- stockpile maintenence -- is highly dubious. It is really an elaborate welfare machine, given to weapons scientists in exchange for their support of testing bans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Herrmann noted that in previous experiments, neutrons exiting the capsule on one side of the implosion arrived a few picoseconds earlier than did those flying off the opposite wayLet’s all just take a step back here and marvel at this statement. We (science-humans) are capable of building a machine that can detect and quantify picosecond level variances in neutrons traveling in an enclosure.  We can do amazing things.Side note - the lab is just down the road from me, I’m proud of my fellow Livermorons, and continue to hope they keep all those megajoules contained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the info so far...I would advise a frugal dose of 
moderate optimist toned down with a spice of healthy scepticism:&#34;The lab hasn’t yet reproduced this month’s results, and Herrmann cautioned that doing so might not be straightforward. “We don’t know what variability will be in successive shots. It’s a nonlinear process where alpha heating heats up the fusion fuel and creates more fusion, which creates more heat.” Herrmann says the 3.5 MeV alpha particles, which remain in the plasma, produced 20% of the fusion yield, with 14 MeV neutrons accounting for most of the energy.&#34;&#34;The lab is still analyzing the results from the shot. It’s not yet known which or what combination of advances to the targets, laser pulse lengths, or other variables led to the leap in performance. Some of the instruments were saturated by the unexpected yield of the reaction. A few that are used in the target chamber for other, non-ignition experiments will need repair.&#34;&#34;Herrmann acknowledged that the announcement deviates from the standard practice of peer-reviewed publication. But the results, he says, were leaking, “so we wanted to put it out so people could discuss the facts.”  &#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zoom has a popular feature which allows for screen sharing a single application window instead of the entire desktop. I assume this is how its discovering running applications with GUI windows open in a cross-platform manner. Perhaps there is a better API for this? Its not a common use-case that an app would need to know all of the other open windows, but it seems like a perfectly valid use case, and frankly handy for sharing a PPT without fear of an embarrassing email showing up in during a meeting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Why would it do that?We can answer part of that with just a little more reading.  What&#39;s pid 3844872?For me, the series of queries against /proc happen from a process that, just a bit earlier, called exec.  So it&#39;s not really zoom reading &#34;all processes and arguments&#34; but ... `pidof gnome-session`, so I guess zoom is looking for the pid of gnome-session.To what nefarious purpose zoom intends to put this knowledge of gnome-session&#39;s pid, I can&#39;t say - I am not running gnome-session so my trail goes cold; but at least for me, for that particular run, zoom itself doesn&#39;t actually see the contents of all of those files."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It not only examines all processes and arguments - it leverages the microphone to act on ultrasonic cues for &#34;integrations&#34;. Zoom is a privacy dumpster fire.https://devforum.zoom.us/t/ultrasonic-connection/3318"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I enjoy doing pedestrian stuff; really, really well.Most of my work is open-source, as I don&#39;t really do anything particularly innovative or patent-worthy.Most of the value in my work is how I do it.I work carefully, document the living bejeezus out of my work, test like crazy, and spend a lot of time &#34;polishing the fenders.&#34;This is something that anyone can do. It just takes patience, discipline, and care.I&#39;m weird. I enjoy the end results enough to take the time to do the job well.It&#39;s been my experience that the way I work is deeply unpopular. Some people actually seem to get offended, when I discuss how I work.Go figure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A common thing I&#39;ve run into is people working on very, very toxic things for society, like human behavior modification (ad) systems, who get up every morning excited and enthusiastic about it because the technical challenges keep them interested. I generally avoid hiring people like this, who often will state openly they don&#39;t care very much about the application of their work, but &#34;just want to solve hard problems.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But I think the reason that isn&#39;t boring is because you have autonomy and, in this case literally, ownership.Being stuck writing boring SQL reports or struggling with open-ended problems so someone else makes more money isn&#39;t such a great proposition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Huh, I remember when this happened, but I hadn&#39;t realized it happened in some blog commemts.For those who are unaware, the comment pointing the flaw in Nelson&#39;s proof is Terrance Tao, one of the most extraordinary mathematicians in the world. He&#39;s won a good fraction of the field&#39;s medals, including the Fields Medal. A nice, down-to-earth guy, too, by all accounts.I jokingly call this the time he literally saved mathematics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The difference between a crank and someone like Nelson is the ability to admit that their crazy disruptive idea, their challenge to orthodoxy, is after-all wrong. We need people to challenge orthodoxy; its healthy. But we also need people to admit when they are wrong. Nelson has my respect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have no specific comment to make on the (first two chapters of the) book recommended by this blog. However I have become wary of people recommending a textbook because it finally helped them understand something they had tried to wrap their head around for years.I heard a conjecture once that the best textbook you&#39;ll find on any given topic is your third. The point, of course, is that it simply takes about three serious attempts to make it click - but it is a fallacy to give all the credit to the third book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious what the target audience this book is for. The chapter &#34;Our Goal&#34; says that the books is to teach programmers how to engage mathematics, but programmers have wide range of mathematical maturity. The second theorem in the book is as follows:For any integer n &gt;= 0 and any list of n + 1 points (x[1], y[1]), ... , (x[n+1], y[n+1]) in R^2 with x[1] &lt; x[2] &lt; ... &lt; x[n+1], there exists a unique polynomial p(x) of degree at most n such tat p(x[i]) = y[i] for all i.So, it seems the author assumes that a reader will have math maturity of a good senior high-school student, as most of students wouldn&#39;t need to worry about property of existence. The book also covers the proof of such theorem with formal notations and the proof is built up with previous theorems -- a pretty standard way in math books which nonetheless requires math maturity of a good high school senior. The table of contents also shows that the book will cover linear algebra, calculus, and group theory in a whirlwind. Again, such content demands close-to-college-level math maturity. I&#39;m also generous here, as public schools of the US do not really teach that much formal math.So, here is the dilemma: people with this level of maturity should already be good at math or have access to other materials to help them with math. People who do not possess such maturity will not go through the book anyway, or have more beginner-friendly materials to read. Note I&#39;m sure there are exceptions, but I question the percentage of such exception."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I maintain that it isn&#39;t just hard, it is computationally impossible.We should all know that given a belief about the world, and evidence, Bayes&#39; Theorem describes how to update our beliefs.But what if we have a network of interrelated beliefs?  That&#39;s called a Bayesian net, and it turns out that Bayes&#39; Theorem also prescribes a unique answer.  However, unfortunately, it turns out that working out that answer is NP-hard.OK, you say, we can come up with an approximate answer.  Sorry, no, coming up with an approximate answer that gets within probability 0.5 - ε, for 0 &lt; ε, is ALSO NP-hard.  It is literally true that under the right circumstances a single data point logically should be able to flip our entire world view, and which data point does it is computationally intractible.Therefore our brains use a bunch of heuristics, with a bunch of known failure modes.  You can read all the lesswrong you want. You can read Thinking, Fast and Slow and learn why we fail as we do.  But the one thing that we cannot do, no matter how much work or effort we put into it, is have the sheer brainpower required to actually BE rational.The effort of doing better is still worthwhile.  But the goal itself is unachievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are some good bits in here. I love the subtitle especially: &#34;The real challenge isn’t being right but knowing how wrong you might be.&#34; Knowing when not to provide an answer is hard. A big part of my job is communicating statistical findings and giving a good non-answer is much harder than giving a good answer, both technically speaking and socially speaking.One thing I&#39;ll add that drives me nuts is the fetishization of bayesian reasoning I see some times here on HN. There are times that bayesian reasoning is helpful and times that it isn&#39;t. Specifically, when you don&#39;t trust your model, bayes rule can mislead you badly (frequently when it comes to missing/counterfactual data). It&#39;s just a tool. There are others. It makes me crazy when it&#39;s someone&#39;s only hammer, so everything starts to look like a nail. Sometimes, more appropriate tools leave you without an answer.Apparently that&#39;s not something we&#39;re willing to live with."</p>
