								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting way to approach it, my approach might be less technical, when someone comes to mind randomly, I just txt them with:  Hey, you just popped into my mind, I hope all is well with you and yours!

It&#39;s simple, lightweight, and you&#39;d be shocked how often the other person pings back.My completely un-scientific view is that most people think of others once in a while. Perhaps we&#39;re too busy to reach out, or the guilt of getting out of touch makes it hard to push through that resistance. I just push through it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some comments here claim that he is treating people not as friends. IMO these comments are not charitable a interpretation. While it is a plausible interpretation, I have strongly learned from HN to be charitable and optimistic when reading someone else&#39;s point of view. I know with topics like this that perspectives vary more wildly among people, so let me show you why I can be more optimistic in my interpretation.I think it&#39;s perfectly fine to separate emotions and reason like this. The reason: I am on the other side when it comes to managing my friends: I am not separating reason and emotion. Because of that, I am failing hard at staying in touch with people that I would like to stay in touch with (I am noticing it with certain friends of my as well). I am succeeding to stay in touch with a few people, but if I&#39;d have a system like this I might be able to stay in touch with many more people that I&#39;d like to stay in touch with anyway but for some unknown reason have some sort of blockade or friction.Other than that I think the interpretation is not charitable enough, I also have personal experience that it might be wrong. For example, I view the dating markets strictly from a market perspective that is heavily inspired by micro-economics and &#34;common sense&#34;. Initially, such a perspective is detached from emotion, but there are certain points where it is attached (e.g. with supply/demand questions like: &#34;what do I want/need from a partner&#34; or &#34;What can I offer? What do I want to offer? What do I need to offer?&#34;). Moreover, upon meeting people there is empathy, sympathy  and human intuition involved. Sometimes the emotions will be so strong that I have a compulsion towards meeting a person again (e.g. falling in love). Those emotions are not helping! Sometimes I feel the right amount that is also in line with my other needs and in other cases I don&#39;t feel enough about a certain person when I don&#39;t see them (but when I do see them, I am delighted to catch up).Management of personal life != how people are on a moment by moment basis in personal lifeI think by having a system like this, you can put Dunbar&#39;s number to shame."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think so-called ASCII-art is more in the spirit of Markdown.The nice thing about the original Markdown (modulo bugs) is that things are written the way one would write plaintext documents which are supposed to be easily read in a text editor.  So you don’t write bullet lists like this:- Bullet 1 - Bullet 2 - Bullet 3And hope that some post-processing will add linebreaks for you.  You write it like this:- Bullet 1- Bullet 2- Bullet 3Similarily there have been many tools that let you add so-called ASCII-art diagrams to Markdown documents.The spirit behind the kind of thing in the OP, on the other hand, is that one should get nicely formatted HTML from Markdown for the purpose of online consumption.  Which is a very different goal.So if I were to judge the syntax itself (since that is what matters most to the original spirit of Markdown.pl) I would say that it seems pretty decent.  Not as “declarative” (!) as ASCII-art, but most probably much easier to edit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks very single-use and way too verbose. There should be a replacement of SVG that is not XML based and easy to use"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m super excited for this!One thought though, on the syntax. Wouldn’t it be a bit odd if suddenly this line in a README.md:   ```js
   const foo = 1 + 1
   ```

Rendered as:   `2`

? Isn’t that kind of what we’re doing here with the mermaid source tag? That tag is for showing source code, no? Feels like there should be another tag for rendering it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an XPS, top of the line with full warranty/premium support. Horrible experience. They swapped many models to a shitty wifi card that caused bsod. I had to spend over 15+ hrs with support to finally convince them the fix was to swap the card to the original Intel and not doing another system restore or reformat.Then the battery. Oh the battery. The computer would randomly wake up from hibernate and drain the battery till it was dead. This also caused premature drain. Guess what? Dells batteries are rated for less cycles (half compared to apple) and this seemed to coincide with the end of my warranty period (time to buy a new one) but it doesn&#39;t even matter because their premium support only covers battery replacements for the first year!And get this! They only sell refurbished batteries. Just everything about this company is trash.The XPS is a nice line. It is very premium, but only skin deep"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The conflict between the market wanting systems that are (a) as small and light as possible and (b) as fast as possible means that modern systems are designed to have close integration between the platform and the OS to perform appropriate thermal management. If the OS doesn&#39;t indicate that it supports doing this, the hardware will run in a much more constrained mode. Apple can do this without too much trouble since they implement the whole stack, but it&#39;s more complicated in the PC space. Intel have a spec called Dynamic Power and Thermal Framework (DPTF), but the useful part of it is the adaptive thermal policy, and Intel refuse to publicly document it.I reverse engineered a chunk of this (https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/54923.html) and it got merged into Intel&#39;s Thermal Daemon (https://github.com/intel/thermal_daemon) which /should/ improve things, but it&#39;s complicated by this mechanism allowing for vendor-specific controls that are usually implemented by having a background service running under Windows that triggers them.There&#39;s multiple things that can be criticised here:
1) Intel pushing OEMs to adopt a technology that they (a) don&#39;t document and (b) don&#39;t write proper Linux support for
2) Canonical not making it clear that OEM certification only requires that the system work, not that it work as well as it does under Windows
3) Dell not figuring out a decent solution for this, even for systems that they nominally support Linux onDell could build hardware that doesn&#39;t rely on adaptive thermal management, but that hardware would either be bigger or slower than competitors&#39; hardware. Fixing this unilaterally is hard - we need an open spec that&#39;s implemented by both hardware vendors and integrated into mainstream Linux distributions. Given where we are, the easiest way to get there would be for Intel to publicly document DPTF."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a reminder: don&#39;t buy Dell, they have a history of ignoring issues and refusing to fix.The US needs to adopt EU-style consumer laws."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This last summer/fall really put things in perspective for me.  We did a major outdoor renovation at our house, which involved landscapers, plumbers, electricians, and carpenters.Every day these guys would show up at 8am and long sleeves and jeans and hard hats, work super hard, pee in a port-a-potty, and be exhausted by the end of the day.  They worked out in the 100 degree heat as well as the rain as the job got near the end.  Luckily the bosses were pretty cool and provided them with decent food for lunch and plenty of drinks (but I still offered them food and drinks too).I on the other hand was working at my desk in my air conditioned house in comfortable clothes.  A few times a day I&#39;d put on my flip-flops and wander around outside to check on their work, ask a few questions, and then head back in when it got too hot.And a couple of times the plumbing sprung a leak just as they were getting ready to leave, despite their best efforts to get all the risky work done early, and they they had to stay super late.  Once the plumber was here till midnight after arriving at 8am.I used to have thoughts about how it would be nice to have a job with totally spelled out requirements that end at 5pm and then you have the rest of the day off.  But no more.  I&#39;d much rather work at my comfy desk inside and deal with the occasional call at 9pm on a Saturday than deal with what they all went through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A professor of mathematics noticed that his kitchen sink at his home leaked. He called a plumber. The plumber came the next day and sealed a few screws, and everything was working as before.The professor was delighted. However, when the plumber gave him the bill a minute later, he was shocked.&#34;This is one-third of my monthly salary!&#34; he yelled.Well, all the same he paid it and then the plumber said to him, &#34;I understand your position as a professor. Why don&#39;t you come to our company and apply for a plumber position? You will earn three times as much as a professor. But remember, when you apply, tell them that you completed only seven elementary classes. They don&#39;t like educated people.&#34;So it happened. The professor got a job as a plumber and his life significantly improved. He just had to seal a screw or two occasionally, and his salary went up significantly.One day, the board of the plumbing company decided that every plumber had to go to evening classes to complete the eighth grade. So, our professor had to go there too. It just happened that the first class was math. The evening teacher, to check students&#39; knowledge, asked for a formula for the area of a circle. The person asked was the professor. He jumped to the board, and then he realized that he had forgotten the formula. He started to reason it, and he filled the white board with integrals, differentials, and other advanced formulas to conclude the result he forgot. As a result, he got &#34;minus pi times r square.&#34;He didn&#39;t like the minus, so he started all over again. He got the minus again. No matter how many times he tried, he always got a minus. He was frustrated. He gave the class a frightened look and saw all the plumbers whisper: &#34;Switch the limits of the integral!!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment and its top reply are dead on:https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sm54ri/a...No job is going to get you away from unreasonable people with unreasonable expectations, and most trades introduce a bunch of other unpleasant things that you&#39;d have to deal with.It&#39;s all tradeoffs. Someone may legitimately prefer the stresses of a trade to the stresses of working in software, and that&#39;s great for them. But it&#39;s not an objectively easier path: if it were, plumbers would be much less expensive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a multi-week long social engineering scam targeted at Thomas. Thomas has a Discord for a drone transportation startup, and the scammers proceeded to embed themselves in the community and provide valuable labor such as web design and graphics design in order to earn his trust.Thomas&#39;s wallet is public and advertised on Twitter via his ENS domain. He had $100M+ in aETH, a derivative token provided by Aave when you lend out your assets for interest. The aETH is redeemable for the underlying asset.The scammers created a fake NFT project associated with space and drones, and proceeded to give Thomas a free one, but asked that he stake it (or deposit it into a smart contract), to earn yield in the form of Armstrong ETH, a token they made up that had the same acronym as Aave&#39;s (aETH).The catch was that when he went to stake his NFT, they asked for an approval for spending aETH from his wallet. Approvals such as this are normal when interacting with smart contracts, since the contract has to be &#34;delegated&#34; responsibility over the tokens in order to move them. However, what wasn&#39;t normal is that the approval was actually for Aave ETH.If he had only looked at the front end of the scam site, it wasn&#39;t obvious what was going on. However, a quick glance at Etherscan revealed that he had signed off on an unlimited spend approval for Aave ETH.Luckily, he had done so on a fresh wallet and not his main wallet that has $100M in aETH. When the scammers tried to get him to stake a second NFT from his main account, he got suspicious and discovered the truth.This scam was specifically targeted at Thomas, and orchestrated over multiple weeks, for the specific assets in his primary wallet.Couple takeaways:- divide your assets across multiple wallets. New wallets are free. Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket.- use a hardware wallet or an audited battle tested smart contract such as Gnosis Safe for storing significant sums of money.- always verify your transactions- avoid associating your public identity with your main wallet / vault address- be careful, scammers are getting more creative and advanced in technique including standing up professional front end websites to give the appearance of legitimacy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can get behind cryptocurrency and stuff, but the idea that anyone can write a contract that says &#34;I get to do what I want with your money&#34; and then build their own custom, one of a kind UI with no way to limit what the user thinks the button does for you to sign such a transaction, it&#39;s got to be the biggest, most massive security hole I&#39;ve ever seen brushed off. You want me to put the title to my house on it? You want code to be law?This shit isn&#39;t ready for the mainstream, and some of these architectural decisions are indicative of engineers who are in over their heads (but that&#39;s almost all code nowadays, even mine).They build a mechanism that enables me, at the click of a button, to give away control of my fortune, and they designed the system so that anyone can design whatever interface they like to get you to sign any transaction they like. It&#39;s laughable. I&#39;m in disbelief. And this is web3? No thanks, I think I&#39;ll stick with bitcoin or whatever, keep it simple. At least I can tell what a bitcoin transaction does without having to learn a programming language."</p>

He typically had a practice of not using his main wallet for things like this.2. He got wary and actually read the smart contracts.This is a level of technical competence required that&#39;s going to mean most people have to offload this to a trusted intermediary. And then what&#39;s the point of all the decentralization ideology? Because we just re-invented banks."</p>

Sure, but you can also do so in a short-form application that&#39;s 1/20 the length or in a 10-minute back-and-forth conversation.You don&#39;t have to ever view formal documents or financials to do that.That is PG&#39;s broader point, and isn&#39;t really that controversial IMO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blind person here, happy to answer any questions. I&#39;m speaking from the perspective of someone born blind, so whatever ends up working well for me might not work as well for someone just losing their sight, though I tried to take that fact into account.The most immediate suggestions that come to mind are:1. Learn to use a screen reader. You don&#39;t need an expensive one. NVDA on Windows, Voice Over on the Mac and Orca on Linux are the way to go. NVDA is probably the least quirky and easiest to find resources for. I&#39;d recommend against Orca, while it can be used, we all know how tricky Linux on the desktop can get, and throwing a screen reader into the mix doesn&#39;t help.2. Forget about the mouse. Screen reader users use the keyboard exclusively. Try disabling the screen too, many sighted users who practice with a screen reader end up relying on what they can see, which makes things more difficult.3. Accept that inaccessibility is a fact of life, and it has to be worked around. Not all tools are accessible, and some are more accessible than others. If you&#39;re looking for an accessible IDE, Vs Code is great and constantly improving. Emacspeak exists, but I don&#39;t actually know anyone who uses it, and I know quite a few blind people in tech. Some things that you&#39;re now doing through a GUI are best done via the command line, Git is a good example. Programming tools usually aren&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s everything else that causes issues. Slack and Zoom work great, for example, but many smaller collaboration tools don&#39;t.4. Not all areas of programming are equally accessible. I can&#39;t imagine a blind dev working exclusively on the front end, where there&#39;s a lot of CSS involved, and where you have to look at Figma designs and debug issues solely based on screenshots. Backend stuff is much more accessible, same with lower-level systems programming. Dev Ops is very much a mixed bag.I&#39;m happy to answer any further questions either here or via email, my HN username at gmail dot com."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was born blind, so this is just my experience interacting with others who lost their vision later in life. It&#39;s likely your friend will want to focus more on counseling and therapy to adjust to the fact that they will be totally blind in a short time. Instead of figuring out if Voiceover on Mac OSX or NVDA with Windows and WSL is better they should get the help they need to figure out how to do all the daily things they used to. How are they going to be able to cross streets, go out to a restaurant or bar on their own and navigate around, etc. How will they match clothes, cook without being able to see the stove or microwave, etc. All these things are possible although with the lack of info on your friend&#39;s location I have no idea what government or private support there will be for this kind of rehabilitation service.
NVDA with WSL2 and VSCode is what I use for development, Mac OSX and XCode was a garbage fire last time I tried it four years ago. Some of that may have been the fact that I was not nearly as comfortable with Voiceover but Apple made no effort I could see to interact with the accessibility community at that time. My understanding is that iOS development is more accessible with Swift UI but I&#34;m not spending $1000+ for a secondary computer to try it out."</p>

Quite impressive how fast the US-politics can burn billions in $, endanger the technological lead and build a massive opportunity for Europe!I, as a European could not be happier about this, from a economic standpoint.Hope you guys over there are not drifting to a surveillance dystopian."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"US folks who are interested in writing their Senators can find information at https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy...FWIW, I sent the email below (largely cribbed from the EFF).Dear :I am a constituent.  I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act, S.3538.  It does not strike a reasonable balance between fighting crimes and the rights of users to privacy and encryption.The bill empowers every state or territory to create sweeping new Internet regulations, by stripping away the legal protections for websites and apps in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The states will be allowed to pass whatever law they want to hold private companies liable, as long as they somehow relate their new rules to online child abuse.The bill’s sponsors have stated that EARN IT will pressure Internet companies to do widespread scanning of user messages and photos. This scanning is incompatible with strong encryption.  Consequently, the act allows states to pass laws that will punish companies when they deploy end-to-end encryption, or offer other encrypted services. This includes messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage, as well as web hosts like Amazon Web Services.The sponsors have falsely claimed that the act would protect children. But abusive images are already highly illegal under federal law. Any Internet platforms that knows about child sexual abuse material being distributed or received are required to take action on it, and can be severely prosecuted if they do not.EARN IT would lead to penalties for people and companies that use encryption.  The harm done by this will fall on vulnerable people. Once we allow encryption to be compromised in order to scan for one thing, authoritarian regimes will demand the same capabilities to track information shared by activists and journalists. Another example is that people subject to domestic abuse, including children, won’t have secure channels of communication to report and reach out for trusted help.Once again, I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act.Thank you,"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me SO_REUSEPORT was only a solution to be able to immediately reuse a port when a process crashed in some odd way and the OS was not releasing the port immediately.When I read that multiple processes can use the port it finally made sense to me how nginx is able to spawn so many workers. If they are listening to port 80 or 443 with SO_REUSEPORT, each worker would get a new client in a round robin fashion, effectively spreading the workload without depending on the main parent process to pipe the data to them (and back to the client), which is how I thought that it was working.The funny thing about this submission was that when I read the title I somehow thought I was reading it on Stack Overflow and was expecting a noob asking this question and didn&#39;t know what kind of answers I was about to be confronted with and if I should get excited to see a really good one.Then, while in the article, I liked how it started to raise so many issues, fanning out into these special cases which really made it a valid question to ask what it does mean to listen to a port, how complicated it can become.Sadly the article does not go into any detail, like showing snippets of C code from the networking stack and explaining how it is really working, how each requirement (or kluge, for that matter) is being satisfied, but it&#39;s OK, it&#39;s an article which touches the subject in an enticing enough way while having an excuse to not deep-dive into the details by keeping it in the form of a dialog between two students.I liked it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What is strange about Discord is this great discrepancy between the ones that love it and the ones that hate it. If I were to guess on the reason of why that might be it would be that Discord is probably really good for the people that are constantly on it, and don&#39;t really miss any communication going in. These people have probably been there for some time so they don&#39;t feel the problem of not knowing where the past information is, because they were there when that information was communicated and therefore never need to look back at it. These people will (obviously) recommend using Discord, since it works so well for them!The problem arises when you have people that just now-and-then hop into the Discord. These people are not in the &#34;clique&#34; so they don&#39;t feel comfortable talking/discussing too much in the channels, and they also really have no clue where to go for any of the lost information these super users don&#39;t even think about. This is probably why I never really use Discord except for voice, since I just don&#39;t get anything at all from reading an endless chat log. It&#39;s like being someone stepping in to a tight knit friend group with a long history and no way of looking into it.Discord will most likely have to figure out how they can keep it so that it works for these super users, but somehow make the information organized for people that aren&#39;t hard core community members.Edit: Wrote &#34;clique&#34; wrong"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Endless scrolling is a black hole for information. And the hawking radiation that comes out is keyboard diarrhea.If I were trying to subtly encourage pounding out content free crap, I would probably want people to use difficult to search, non paginated scroll feeds as much as possible.Discord might be a black hole, but Discourse has some of the same properties. Facebook is the same way.Anything that funnels people into multi-thousand post individual pages is going to lose information.Old proboards forums, github issues, and wikis don&#39;t have this problem.  Content is in smaller blocks that can be linked to easily, and there is a strong culture of keeping topics focused.  You don&#39;t have multiple unrelated conversations in one place.You can jump to the end or beginning of a thread when quickly skimming to see if it&#39;s relevant.And you can see all threads in a given time period pretty easily with pagination, when you want to understand the larger picture at a point and time.These are all things that are useful both for a sense of community and for technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a strong believer in Zulip with respect to a perfect mix between instant messaging and actually retaining information- functionality for a public export (can also restrict to specific channels), .e.g. https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/- in addition to the above, they are working on a guest mode, so you can read the discussions without logging in -- hopefully that would make it possible to index without setting up a separate archive hosting https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13172- messages/threads have proper meaningful URLs (unlike random obfuscated UUIDs like in Discord)- you can easily open things in new tabs -- unlike Discord, where search pane takes like 10% of the screen, or Slack where once you clicked on search result, you lose the context about the remaining results- you can login with Github (so no need to register for many people, at least for programming-related projects)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there any word about when sci hub is going to start adding new articles again? It&#39;s currently only useful as an archive of old research articles. New papers from the last year are not available. I never understood the rationale for stopping new content, though I believe it had some relation to some court case in India...but I don&#39;t understand why that was a reason to stop adding articles, and why it hasn&#39;t been restarted yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The publishers now encode their papers with individual identifiers, that generationP calls UUIDs on all pdf&#39;s. That means they can trace it back to the institution(and perhaps the actual prof?) They have then sent nastygrams to threaten them with fees or loss of access to the institution - potentially serious punishment.
What is needed is a way to run the papers through an OCR recognition program to create renewed text and to further process to randomly vary a large number of adjacent letter spacings. (this is called &#39;micro kerning&#39; and it allowed a second order of unique document recognition where the document is scanned by the journal to look for these fractional kerning gaps in the letter spacing which can lead back to the institution). I suppose a program flow could be made to OCR + random micro kerning changes - it would take time, but once set up it would be a rapid computer based document flow process. Photos/charts could be sanitised as well, but legends etc on them would also need OCR and micro kerning adjustments. With 25 words of text, each with 6 letters, micro kerning can easily create 10,000 unique ID&#39;s, easily enough to cope with all subscribed institutions - and that is on one chart/photo.
I suspect the subscribing institutions have acted with firm words to their profs and grad students to block this. This can easily be told to us if a few people in assorted institutions let us know if they have been read firm words about this?I am not sure how Sci-hub can get past this, unless they get a good Indian court ruling and can use Indian friends to scan printed copies of journals - if they exist in this online age?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting how sci-hub&#39;s papers on medicine dwarf those in many other fields like comp-sci, math, and physics.  I wonder if that reflects the number of papers in those fields, or if sci-hub just has a non-representative sample.  If the latter, why?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember walking down the main street in my hometown on my way to drink at a bar and seeing saurik and some friends at a bars all with their laptops out and hacking on something.  What caught my eye was a terminal open and a Vim session.  I walked up and we all chatted for a bit.  Back in the day you didn&#39;t run into that very often where we lived so it was pretty cool to see.  That boosted my conviction for my choice of IDE and I started bringing my laptop out to the bars in the evenings as well.  Years later my friend and I built a business and pretty much all the code was written in the evenings at one of those bars.  You can be social and code at the same time it turns out, and coding prevented me from drinking too much while I was out.  No real morale to the story, just an anecdote I wanted to share.  That said, congrats on the bounty saurik!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I grew up in Egypt, my dad is from a town on the Suez Canal called Ismailia, famous for its mangoes. We would wait the whole year for mango season (August/September). As kids, our clothes would all get mango stains. Our parents would make us take our shirts off before we eat them to avoid that.I moved to the US, and I haven&#39;t had a good mango here. When friends visit Egypt, I tell them to get mangoes (in season, around September), especially a variety known as Eweis. They get obsessed. I&#39;ve never figured out why the US just doesn&#39;t have good mangoes, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re hard to grow locally or ship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For growing mango from seed, or really anything from seed, you cannot beat a small plastic container (like what cottage cheese, sour cream, or green yogurt might come in) filled halfway with coconut coir. It&#39;s absolutely the best medium for germinating seed. Fill halfway with coir and water once a week. Coconut coir keeps water evenly distributed and I&#39;ve never had a seed or seedling mold over using it.I personally use 2 lb greek yogurt (or soup, as in from Costco) containers because the extra height also lets me keep the seed in there longer and develop initial root structure. That&#39;s incredibly helpful for transferring to pots, and a little coconut coir in the soul doesn&#39;t hurt."</p>

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00819-6The big question is how quickly and completely can that layer restore itself? If damage accumulates over time and people are catching new variants every 3-4 months it is only a matter of time before mortality from cardiovascular issues in COVID negative formerly infected people goes much higher and much younger. We need studies on the cardiovascular recovery pace after COVID damage in different age groups, and after repeat COVID diagnosis from different variants."</p>

(Disclaimer: Yes, we know Covid-19 isn&#39;t the flu, and it&#39;s more deadly.) My point is: how much does heart-disease risk increase post-Covid compared to say post-Influenza? Is it comparable or is the risk magnitudes larger than with other virus infections? This is an important benchmark, I understand scientific journals don&#39;t cater to laypeople but popular media does.From CDC website: &#34;Studies have shown that flu illness is associated with an increase in heart attacks and stroke.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my mind, state is the real enemy impacting: comprehension, 
brittleness towards making changes, and the surface area exposed to potential bugs. OOP as frequently implemented, while claiming to encapsulate state, ends up creating so much more.In accordance with this view, I think project architecture should be approached with an emphasis around how much state is necessary for it to run. This is why simulations like say someone making a game or simcity with like relatively independent entities that map to something in real life use OOP. If you&#39;re writing a service doing requests, you want as minimal state as possible. Singletons are state. Initialized/non-static objects are state. The smaller amount you have the easier it is to reason about the system.As I write this however, I worry a little that my view is overly simplistic, or maybe applicable only to domains that I have worked in. If anyone wouldn&#39;t mind poking holes in this argument or offering examples I would appreciate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not read the article but I&#39;ve seen other blog posts on the subject.
The issue with &#34;OOP is bad&#34; is that OOP means different things to different people.Abstract Data Types are sort of a subset of OOP and are massively useful, I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to expose the internal implementation of a data structure most of the time. Any sort of plugin system works in an OO matter. It is a useful tool, no question.Even things like Actors like in Erlang (which are much closer to the Alan Kay style OO) are massively useful in a distributed setting where state is naturally distributed.Where you get into trouble is when you go the whole &#34;lets model a taxonomy of the world&#34; style with inheritance hierarchies or go ham on design patterns, layers upon layers of abstraction and other nonsense like that.The saddest thing about the &#34;object–relational impedance mismatch&#34; is that the focus went totally to the wrong side. The relational model is a much nicer way to model relations than a graph of objects (that&#39;s the whole point after all). SQL sucks but that&#39;s a separate issue, Entity Component Systems are a form of relational modeling for example and work really well, or even better Datalog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My issue with OOP is: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.I don&#39;t take issue with the authors, with their insights, or anything related to the content of the book. It&#39;s that the book exists at all: it&#39;s a book filled with solutions to imaginary problems.When using a procedural language the first thing you do is start implementing a solution. When using OOP, you first have to solve the imaginary problems created by OOP, only then can you start down the path of typing out a solution.It&#39;s significantly more difficult to refactor OOP (even with great tools) than it is procedural.If you could spend 20% less brain power, possibly 40% fewer keystrokes to describe the exact same solution, why wouldn&#39;t you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve developed quite a few SNES-related things for fun, mostly using Go and C++, with some 65816 ASM sprinkled in.https://github.com/alttpo/alttpo - A Link To The Past Online. Lets multiple players see and interact with one another in the same game world and synchronize their progress through the game. Exclusive to a customized fork of the bsnes emulator which provides a scripting language and PPU-integrated drawing routines to render remote player sprites. In retrospect, I consider this a dead-end architecture; redesigned in o2 project (see below).https://github.com/alttpo/o2 - Second version of alttpo (see above) but this time targeted at SNES hardware console support (via SD2SNES flash cart USB feature) and does not require a customized emulator nor a scripting language. Trade-off here is a loss of the visual aspect (cannot see remote player sprites) due to tight hardware limitations in the amount of VRAM and limited SNES CPU cycles available. Work is in progress to gain back the remote sprite rendering as an optional add-on via the bsnes-plus WASM module support (see below). This project includes a 65816 machine code emitter library (pure Go) with support for named labels of branch targets. There is also a bare-bones headless SNES emulator library (pure Go) included for unit tests to verify the generated 65816 ASM and ROM patching mechanism.https://github.com/alttpo/bsnes-plus - A fork of bsnes-plus in development that invokes WebAssembly modules when certain general SNES events occur, e.g. `on_nmi`, `on_power`, `on_reset`, `on_frame_present`. WASM code has access to a draw-list API for drawing into the various PPU layers, e.g. extra sprites, text (with PCF font support), basic shapes. WASM code can also receive arbitrary binary messages from external applications, e.g. to update remote player positions or exchange custom sprite graphics."</p>

Mesen-SX has a SPC debugger separate from the main debugger, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s more or less useful than bsnes-plus (I know the Mesen emulators have a far worse Linux UI when running under Mono, and I haven&#39;t tried running the Windows Mesen under Mono or real .NET yet). I don&#39;t know enough to judge if the disassembler is better or worse than bsnes-plus though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I never expected this to be on the front page of HN, it brings back so many memories. I was big into this game when I was a teenager back in 2010, 2011 until 2015, also being very active in the community that made this page in that period. Sadly, even all those years back, the online scene was still what most would consider dead. I have a bit of a thing for &#34;dead&#34; games, I wouldn&#39;t really consider 1-2 full servers at night to be dead, which is what we had. In the following years, however, server population declined even more, to the point where I would really consider it to be dead. I&#39;d love to be proven wrong though, but that was what I percieved.If you really wanted to ride the wave, I&#39;d tell you to get yourself a time machine and go all the way back to 2005, 2006 or 2007. Servers were ablaze with squadrons (~groups of people having their own paint schemes on certain aircraft, playing air-to-ground missions and air-to-air missions against other squadrons...) fighting and calling each other names. It wasn&#39;t pretty, but according to what I was told, passion wasn&#39;t exactly in short supply.Fun fact: the game looks like that because it has no textures. Instead, every polygon is colored individually. Through a recent update did give the terrain textures. Aircraft still don&#39;t have them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting; I was not aware of their existence. They seem to be free as in beer; not as in speech. They seem to make money with shareware provided by the same company.Nothing against closed source though. For example, I enjoy x-plane a lot which while not free (in either sense) of course has a large community providing both free and non free add-ons. This seems more of a game with a focus on combat and less on realism or looks.An actual free, open source flight simulator that deserves mentioning is Flightgear. I&#39;ve played with that a couple of times but always end up reverting to x-plane. But flightgear has some nice features and also a nice community. It just doesn&#39;t look and feel anywhere near as good as x-plane (which is a tall order because it is very good).Anyway, I checked out some footage on Youtube. Visually, it has nothing on even Flightgear; which I&#39;m pretty sure probably has some combat mods. Or even any version of that the last few decades or so, actually. It actually reminded me of some dos games I used to play in the early nineties. E.g. Jetfighter II (released 1990) was pretty awesome back in the day. It looks like that but with higher resolution. But e.g. the ground is a featureless green blob; just like in Jetfighter II, and clouds are white polygons hanging in the sky, etc. And Jetfighter II had a HUD that was about as feature rich as the one in this game. Of course it was way more pixelated than this. But they even managed a cockpit panel :-). I wouldn&#39;t call it photo realistic but it didn&#39;t look half bad for the time. There are probably better/later game that this thing is shooting for. But I just never really got into combat flight simulation.I guess they are trying to recreate some of that experience. Not that it matters; but I guess the gameplay is more important than the looks for this. Actually looks like it could be a lot of fun.BTW. I have nothing against MS Flightsimulator. The latest version looks great. But I just don&#39;t have any windows computers anymore at this point. Combat is not really something either of the other flightsims I mentioned are made for or even good at."</p>

They are usually like 8 hour long shots of birds and squirrels eating nuts someone left on log, the cats love it and will watch diligently. They are monetized channels often enough, and its just funny to  me knowing that every once in a while the cats, who are otherwise alone in the house, are being treated to a commercial for some sports betting service, or for profit college experience. This entire edifice of targeted ads being directed to two cats who suddenly experience a very human moment in this absurd context. Can&#39;t help but feel like they sense it, that they are suddenly interpolated into this thing, subjects to the streams of money and incentived attention. brought down into our inferior world of commodities and money. Have been close to getting the premium YouTube just for their sake, and of course for the sake of the nice people making the videos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is always funny to see how watching TV can be so differently culturally.  With my Spanish in-law family the TV is on almost the whole day in the background, even during big family dinners as background sound. With often news, sports or game shows. With their late dinner times of 9pm they often watch series and movies even later. 
And here in the Netherlands it is with many a sin to have the TV on in the background if there are visitors and should only be on if you watch something together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What is strange about Discord is this great discrepancy between the ones that love it and the ones that hate it. If I were to guess on the reason of why that might be it would be that Discord is probably really good for the people that are constantly on it, and don&#39;t really miss any communication going in. These people have probably been there for some time so they don&#39;t feel the problem of not knowing where the past information is, because they were there when that information was communicated and therefore never need to look back at it. These people will (obviously) recommend using Discord, since it works so well for them!The problem arises when you have people that just now-and-then hop into the Discord. These people are not in the &#34;clique&#34; so they don&#39;t feel comfortable talking/discussing too much in the channels, and they also really have no clue where to go for any of the lost information these super users don&#39;t even think about. This is probably why I never really use Discord except for voice, since I just don&#39;t get anything at all from reading an endless chat log. It&#39;s like being someone stepping in to a tight knit friend group with a long history and no way of looking into it.Discord will most likely have to figure out how they can keep it so that it works for these super users, but somehow make the information organized for people that aren&#39;t hard core community members.Edit: Wrote &#34;clique&#34; wrong"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Endless scrolling is a black hole for information. And the hawking radiation that comes out is keyboard diarrhea.If I were trying to subtly encourage pounding out content free crap, I would probably want people to use difficult to search, non paginated scroll feeds as much as possible.Discord might be a black hole, but Discourse has some of the same properties. Facebook is the same way.Anything that funnels people into multi-thousand post individual pages is going to lose information.Old proboards forums, github issues, and wikis don&#39;t have this problem.  Content is in smaller blocks that can be linked to easily, and there is a strong culture of keeping topics focused.  You don&#39;t have multiple unrelated conversations in one place.You can jump to the end or beginning of a thread when quickly skimming to see if it&#39;s relevant.And you can see all threads in a given time period pretty easily with pagination, when you want to understand the larger picture at a point and time.These are all things that are useful both for a sense of community and for technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a strong believer in Zulip with respect to a perfect mix between instant messaging and actually retaining information- functionality for a public export (can also restrict to specific channels), .e.g. https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/- in addition to the above, they are working on a guest mode, so you can read the discussions without logging in -- hopefully that would make it possible to index without setting up a separate archive hosting https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13172- messages/threads have proper meaningful URLs (unlike random obfuscated UUIDs like in Discord)- you can easily open things in new tabs -- unlike Discord, where search pane takes like 10% of the screen, or Slack where once you clicked on search result, you lose the context about the remaining results- you can login with Github (so no need to register for many people, at least for programming-related projects)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I grew up in Egypt, my dad is from a town on the Suez Canal called Ismailia, famous for its mangoes. We would wait the whole year for mango season (August/September). As kids, our clothes would all get mango stains. Our parents would make us take our shirts off before we eat them to avoid that.I moved to the US, and I haven&#39;t had a good mango here. When friends visit Egypt, I tell them to get mangoes (in season, around September), especially a variety known as Eweis. They get obsessed. I&#39;ve never figured out why the US just doesn&#39;t have good mangoes, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re hard to grow locally or ship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For growing mango from seed, or really anything from seed, you cannot beat a small plastic container (like what cottage cheese, sour cream, or green yogurt might come in) filled halfway with coconut coir. It&#39;s absolutely the best medium for germinating seed. Fill halfway with coir and water once a week. Coconut coir keeps water evenly distributed and I&#39;ve never had a seed or seedling mold over using it.I personally use 2 lb greek yogurt (or soup, as in from Costco) containers because the extra height also lets me keep the seed in there longer and develop initial root structure. That&#39;s incredibly helpful for transferring to pots, and a little coconut coir in the soul doesn&#39;t hurt."</p>

I Google it a couple times a year, still haven&#39;t found it.  Anyone want to get this made, maybe send me one as thanks, and you keep all the profits you reap? :-D.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there any word about when sci hub is going to start adding new articles again? It&#39;s currently only useful as an archive of old research articles. New papers from the last year are not available. I never understood the rationale for stopping new content, though I believe it had some relation to some court case in India...but I don&#39;t understand why that was a reason to stop adding articles, and why it hasn&#39;t been restarted yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The publishers now encode their papers with individual identifiers, that generationP calls UUIDs on all pdf&#39;s. That means they can trace it back to the institution(and perhaps the actual prof?) They have then sent nastygrams to threaten them with fees or loss of access to the institution - potentially serious punishment.
What is needed is a way to run the papers through an OCR recognition program to create renewed text and to further process to randomly vary a large number of adjacent letter spacings. (this is called &#39;micro kerning&#39; and it allowed a second order of unique document recognition where the document is scanned by the journal to look for these fractional kerning gaps in the letter spacing which can lead back to the institution). I suppose a program flow could be made to OCR + random micro kerning changes - it would take time, but once set up it would be a rapid computer based document flow process. Photos/charts could be sanitised as well, but legends etc on them would also need OCR and micro kerning adjustments. With 25 words of text, each with 6 letters, micro kerning can easily create 10,000 unique ID&#39;s, easily enough to cope with all subscribed institutions - and that is on one chart/photo.
I suspect the subscribing institutions have acted with firm words to their profs and grad students to block this. This can easily be told to us if a few people in assorted institutions let us know if they have been read firm words about this?I am not sure how Sci-hub can get past this, unless they get a good Indian court ruling and can use Indian friends to scan printed copies of journals - if they exist in this online age?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting how sci-hub&#39;s papers on medicine dwarf those in many other fields like comp-sci, math, and physics.  I wonder if that reflects the number of papers in those fields, or if sci-hub just has a non-representative sample.  If the latter, why?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on a project that aggregates data for every public transport provider in the country (Slovenia) and presents it as a simple API, along with an application to find rides with as few clicks as possible (without having to check every provider&#39;s website). This has involved tiring meetings with city officials convincing them to give us access to the data and writing scraping bots where they weren&#39;t convinced, so I&#39;ve sunk countless hours into the project.I currently know of only 3 people using it, but I&#39;m one of them and I believe this is something that should exist, so I don&#39;t care that I&#39;ll likely never evem break even on it. I&#39;ve started a nonprofit to fund the project, but it&#39;s been mostly my own money so far. Working on it has been really fun and I learned a ton about how stuff gets done in the intersection of public and private sector - both positive and negative.// For anyone in Slovenia interested in using it, there&#39;s an email in my profile.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Android users are still vulnerable, and these announcements do nothing to reduce that. All a stalker needs to do, is remove the speaker. To detect a rogue AirTag, an Android owner needs to:1) know AirTags exist (many obviously don&#39;t)2) go out of their way to install Apple&#39;s Android AirTag scanner app (only 100k-500k worldwide have done so according to Google Play stats)3) manually open the scanner app and scan, since it doesn&#39;t scan passively in the background; and even then, it won&#39;t help you find the speaker-less AirTag, since it doesn&#39;t tell you proximity &amp; direction.I continue to think Apple should have never released AirTags to the public, and should discontinue it. It&#39;s a very limited income stream, with limited use cases, and significantly increases the average person&#39;s risk of stalking.Practically all positive social media coverage of AirTags involves someone tracking a stolen stolen items (car, bike). Those use cases are dead, since thieves with iPhones will get alerts, and most thieves with Android will know to scan for AirTags. And since most lost items turn into stolen items after a few hours, that removes most use cases involving losing objects in public.That leaves &#34;finding your keys within your home&#34; as the only truly &#34;officially supported&#34; use case. Is that worth all the problems, and brand damage?People will argue that stalkers could always buy trackers, but Apple increased their availability, ease-of-acquisition and ease-of-use by orders of magnitude. AirTags are cheaper than competing GPS trackers, most of which require subscriptions.I remember seeing a chills-down-your-spine Apple Watch Series 7 TV ad, that featured beautiful remote nature landscapes, with the audio of 911 calls made from people&#39;s Apple Watches whose lives were saved by their Watch. Probably one of Apple&#39;s best and most impactful ad in the past decade. Compare that to AirTag&#39;s impact on Apple&#39;s brand. Why did Apple even bother?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great response - very happy to hear Apple&#39;s involvement with various groups to make things better.Some noteworthy bits:&gt; we innovated with the first-ever proactive system to alert you of unwanted trackingIf that&#39;s true, then Apple just raised the privacy bar and now Tile and other small players need to up their game to stay relevant.There is also lesson to learn here: whoever makes a tech/product popular is the one who gets the heat for all its shortcomings/problems. It doesn&#39;t matter how many existing small players were doing a horrible job for years.&gt; As an iPhone user moves, Precision Finding fuses input from the camera, ARKit, accelerometer, and gyroscope to guide them to the AirTagThis is something that&#39;s not appreciated. The UWB chip on the Airtag can only help iPhone know how far away it is from the tag. It&#39;s 3D modelling of the world through camera vision that helps triangulate and guide the user via live on-screen direction.Next time you think why we need tech X, just remember that you can&#39;t foresee what it&#39;ll enable in the future - (and before you comment &#34;all AR stuff to find my keys faster?&#34;, re-read the previous sentence again)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the functionality of the AirTags so I don&#39;t want them nerfed, but I can think of no way to fix their fundamental problem of being such easy to use stalking devices.Chefs knives are great for cooking and are inexpensive and easy to purchase; they can be very dangerous weapons in the wrong hands so we make it against the law to use them in that manner. Maybe that&#39;s the best we can do with AirTags."</p>

Environmentalists are blocking  construction of more wind power, and crisis with Russia makes gas less accessible. France has a relatively good track record on nuclear power. They may pull this off. 2035 is a really long time to wait for new power to the grid though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my mind, state is the real enemy impacting: comprehension, 
brittleness towards making changes, and the surface area exposed to potential bugs. OOP as frequently implemented, while claiming to encapsulate state, ends up creating so much more.In accordance with this view, I think project architecture should be approached with an emphasis around how much state is necessary for it to run. This is why simulations like say someone making a game or simcity with like relatively independent entities that map to something in real life use OOP. If you&#39;re writing a service doing requests, you want as minimal state as possible. Singletons are state. Initialized/non-static objects are state. The smaller amount you have the easier it is to reason about the system.As I write this however, I worry a little that my view is overly simplistic, or maybe applicable only to domains that I have worked in. If anyone wouldn&#39;t mind poking holes in this argument or offering examples I would appreciate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not read the article but I&#39;ve seen other blog posts on the subject.
The issue with &#34;OOP is bad&#34; is that OOP means different things to different people.Abstract Data Types are sort of a subset of OOP and are massively useful, I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to expose the internal implementation of a data structure most of the time. Any sort of plugin system works in an OO matter. It is a useful tool, no question.Even things like Actors like in Erlang (which are much closer to the Alan Kay style OO) are massively useful in a distributed setting where state is naturally distributed.Where you get into trouble is when you go the whole &#34;lets model a taxonomy of the world&#34; style with inheritance hierarchies or go ham on design patterns, layers upon layers of abstraction and other nonsense like that.The saddest thing about the &#34;object–relational impedance mismatch&#34; is that the focus went totally to the wrong side. The relational model is a much nicer way to model relations than a graph of objects (that&#39;s the whole point after all). SQL sucks but that&#39;s a separate issue, Entity Component Systems are a form of relational modeling for example and work really well, or even better Datalog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My issue with OOP is: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.I don&#39;t take issue with the authors, with their insights, or anything related to the content of the book. It&#39;s that the book exists at all: it&#39;s a book filled with solutions to imaginary problems.When using a procedural language the first thing you do is start implementing a solution. When using OOP, you first have to solve the imaginary problems created by OOP, only then can you start down the path of typing out a solution.It&#39;s significantly more difficult to refactor OOP (even with great tools) than it is procedural.If you could spend 20% less brain power, possibly 40% fewer keystrokes to describe the exact same solution, why wouldn&#39;t you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"US folks who are interested in writing their Senators can find information at https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy...FWIW, I sent the email below (largely cribbed from the EFF).Dear :I am a constituent.  I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act, S.3538.  It does not strike a reasonable balance between fighting crimes and the rights of users to privacy and encryption.The bill empowers every state or territory to create sweeping new Internet regulations, by stripping away the legal protections for websites and apps in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The states will be allowed to pass whatever law they want to hold private companies liable, as long as they somehow relate their new rules to online child abuse.The bill’s sponsors have stated that EARN IT will pressure Internet companies to do widespread scanning of user messages and photos. This scanning is incompatible with strong encryption.  Consequently, the act allows states to pass laws that will punish companies when they deploy end-to-end encryption, or offer other encrypted services. This includes messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage, as well as web hosts like Amazon Web Services.The sponsors have falsely claimed that the act would protect children. But abusive images are already highly illegal under federal law. Any Internet platforms that knows about child sexual abuse material being distributed or received are required to take action on it, and can be severely prosecuted if they do not.EARN IT would lead to penalties for people and companies that use encryption.  The harm done by this will fall on vulnerable people. Once we allow encryption to be compromised in order to scan for one thing, authoritarian regimes will demand the same capabilities to track information shared by activists and journalists. Another example is that people subject to domestic abuse, including children, won’t have secure channels of communication to report and reach out for trusted help.Once again, I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act.Thank you,"</p>

Is it comparable or is the risk magnitudes larger than with other virus infections? This is an important benchmark, I understand scientific journals don&#39;t cater to laypeople but popular media does.From CDC website: &#34;Studies have shown that flu illness is associated with an increase in heart attacks and stroke.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What strikes me is not a bunch of people keeping their ego in check -- that helps because it ensures that all points will be heard, but it doesn&#39;t ensure coherent decision-making. What strikes me is that everybody was able to keep track of what were the major points and minor points, so they could talk through the whole range of possible objections and decide that they were all less valid or less important than the points in favor. This is how engineers talk, searching for flaws and weighing the ones they find.I think it&#39;s important for engineering decision-makers to be comfortable with this culture. It&#39;s disheartening when you have a great conversation like the one Feynman describes, the engineers are in agreement, and then the person in charge stands up and says, &#34;Look, if everybody hates this idea, we can&#39;t be lazy and go forward with it just because we don&#39;t have a better one,&#34; or, &#34;I guess we can&#39;t make a decision on this, because there&#39;s too much negativity and people are just going to nit-pick every idea to death!&#34; No, no, talking through every possible objection to an idea is how you can tell that people are starting to zero in on it as the most likely best solution. The closer an idea gets to acceptance, the more thoroughly you vet it. The more it becomes clear that an idea is the best way forward, the more you start to prepare for dealing with the reality of it.This makes practical sense, but not political sense, so it seems weird and unnatural to a lot of outside observers, who expect respect to be communicated by agreement, and emerging consensus around an idea to be expressed by a shared avoidance of mentioning the downsides."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience (and coming just out of a meeting alike) these types of respectful and forward-moving meetings are typically in a case where each attendant has roughly the same level expertise in a given domain and knows the basics of scientific principles. Hence, everybody in the meeting brings in his or her unique view of the topic at hand and knows intrinsically when it makes sense to contribute something to the discussion. Usually things get out of hands, if somebody is talking just for the noise or, and this is worse, a clearly bad idea wins the discussion because politics or the messenger has shouted the loudest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been in such environments and I while I hadn&#39;t considered that the reason they worked so well was that they were great people: they were, in fact, great people.An interesting thing happens when there&#39;s a high level of respect.People stop being so anxious about not &#34;winning&#34;, or &#34;being heard&#34;, people just remove themselves from their ideas and feel comfortable and confident.I left that company because the company around that team was a bit shit, but I wish I could foster an environment of high trust and mutual respect like that again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My 2 cents: The author presumably goes to Princeton - the ivy league is in general a tough place to &#34;start learning&#34; things, especially STEM. Few of the staff would teach you the basics of anything, mostly because you are attending a research college, where teaching is the professors&#39; side gig.I went to an ivy league school, and a large portion of the people in the CS program did competitive programming/knew number theory and discrete math from high school etc. All the problems we got as homework were really intense - I&#39;d consistently do more than 60-70 hours of studying outside of classes to keep up. Mind you, for me CS was/is like crack - I feel like I&#39;d have put in even more time if I didn&#39;t need to sleep or want to hang out with my friends.There are some intro classes, of course, but the quality of those varies a lot.Edit: I don&#39;t mean to discourage people with this post. I was actually one of the few people who didn&#39;t have much of a CS/quanty background in my CS classes. My advisor told me to have a backup major in case I fail the tougher required classes, but I made it through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if some universities should pay more attention to the impact of discouragement on some students.I remember attempting a grad class called &#34;Hard problems in combinatorial optimization&#34;. I was struggling so I asked the professor for advice on getting my footing in the class.His answer was that I may just not have the &#34;mathematical maturity&#34; for the material. I was so discouraged that I dropped out of the program.What I didn&#39;t realize at the time was the particular meaning of that term. His advice was well intended and accurate.But what I heard was that I was hopeless in this topic area because I wasn&#39;t smart enough.So much pain could have been avoided if we just extended the conversation by a few minutes, or he invited me for a discussion over coffee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the class description for MAT 202, &#34;Linear Algebra with Applications&#34;  at Princeton.[1] Here&#39;s a problem set with answers.[2]It&#39;s painful to read. Problem 2: &#34;Find the matrix A describing the following linear transformation from R2 to R&#39;2 : First rotate clockwise by π/6, then scale by a factor of 2, then reflect about the x2 axis.&#34; Anyone who programs video games recognizes that as a stack of transformations. You set up the matrix for the rotate, the scale, and the reflection (which is a scale of -1 on one axis). You multiply the matrices to get the result. This is a pain to do with pencil and paper. GPUs have hardware for it.Books on graphics programming cover this problem. But they usually do it much better, with graphical examples.
The presentation here is done very abstractly, without any motivation.
Most of linear algebra has graphical representations. It takes a useful and relatively easy area of math and makes it harder.This is apparently on purpose.  The class description says:The calculations are relatively simple once you understand what you need to compute, but it can take time to master the abstract concepts well enough to understand what that might be. The challenge in 201 (a calculus class) is usually how to finish a problem as the technical complications mount, whereas in 202 the challenge is often in seeing how to start the problem.Right. In calculus, problems usually involve trying to integrate something, where you get stuck and need to transform the problem in some non-obvious way to make forward progress. It&#39;s puzzle-solving. In linear algebra, the actual operations are mostly matrix adds and multiplies. It&#39;s setting up the problem that&#39;s hard.It&#39;s annoying to see this for a useful area of applied math. If you&#39;re headed for abstract algebra, where intuition breaks down, this approach might be useful. But if you want to use ordinary linear systems to get work done, which is common in engineering, it&#39;s not.[1] https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/placement/MAT20...[2] https://www.math.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/2018-04/M..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m literally playing Factorio right now, with my kid. Got into it over Christmas based on HN talking about it all the time. Good game to multi because I don&#39;t have to pay attention all the time.It really reminds me of software in many ways. You fiddle with tiny little things like balancing a belt, and then move on to building belt balancers. You then move up the abstractions to where you&#39;re not really placing inserters all the time. Maybe you make some blueprints and you&#39;re placing a whole set of nuke power plants in one go, or looking at trains.The kid loves it, but you can (luckily) tell the difference between what he makes and what I make. That engineer keep-stuff-organized thing takes a bit of time to hone, but he&#39;s getting there. He also understands how to find root causes now, based on looking at where there&#39;s a blockage in production and tracking back along the chain.One thing that&#39;s interesting is that the game is a bit, you know, dark. I mean we&#39;ve built hell and the kid doesn&#39;t mind. Literally paved paradise with concrete. The air is black with robots, 100k of them at the moment. There&#39;s furnaces all over the place. We got rid of the steam power generation but there are huge areas of nukes all over. The natives are getting atomic bombs thrown at them constantly, it takes a while to even get to the nearest spawner. Or water that isn&#39;t green.And yet he doesn&#39;t ask about how we destroyed all the cliffs and filled in the lakes, and chopped the trees.&#34;How should we make it bigger, dad?&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with games like Factorio (and more recently Oxygen no Included), is that after I get addicted and get up past 100 hours of gameplay I start to question what the hell I&#39;m doing with my life. Up until that point it&#39;s great fun designing, building, and optimizing, but then a switch in my head flips. I start to become anxious about the fact that I was excited about getting better at skills in a virtual world. Usually around this time I start watching videos of more advanced builds, and then become increasingly depressed about the idea of sinking 1000+ hours into a game, when I could just be building something in the real world, or out riding my bike. This is usually the time I put the game down and never play it again.I think the problem for me is that these games give me the illusion of learning, building, and accomplishing things, which my little engineer brain loves. But once I come out of the haze of addiction, I realize it&#39;s nothing more than an illusion, and I just stomach going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have over 5000 hours in Factorio. I am part of a group where several of us are over 5000 hours. Some of us have Autism. Some of us have ADHD. Some of us have both. The majority of us are in the tech industry.The companies we work at have been made to understand that the factory must grow."</p>

The platform holders are (and always have been) jerking us around.I want to see a LiveView that can deliver both HTML and equivalent native UI markup. This is needed to sell the vision end to end - the world is not just web.I feel like this would enable a more sensible choice:Offline (first)? Use RPC with sync.Online-only?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s incredibly frustrating about the knocks on JavaScript is that it&#39;s not a shortcoming of the language that creates the problems hinted here, but the poorly-considered engineering choices of the popular frameworks.After building my own framework [1] last year, I realized just how disconnected JavaScript developers—yes, the &#34;big boys&#34; are especially off in CS la-la land—were from web development fundamentals. HTTP distilled down to its absolute essence is brilliant, but for some reason gets absolutely ignored in the JS world. When you couple that with websockets for incremental updates (similar to what Chris McCord is doing in Phoenix), it&#39;s insanely powerful. It can be reasonably lightweight, too, if you&#39;re only shipping the JS you need to render the page.That rendering some HTML, CSS, and interactive JS in a browser has been turned into what it has is staggering. Though, not surprising, when you realize a lot of the momentum in JavaScript the last decade or so was perpetuated by venture capital (and the inevitable fast and cheap nature of that world) being pumped into inexperienced teams.[1] https://github.com/cheatcode/joystick"</p>

The data reinforce the impression you get glancing at the headlines or spending a day out anywhere in America observing other men. Dare I say it even reinforces what I know from painful firsthand experience as a man, at the lowest points in my life. I was lucky though, with a supportive family who helped me through the confusing years of early adulthood.You can point to the decline of organized religion and with it traditional gender roles, but then what explains the relative stability in post-Christian Europe? The China Shock combined with America&#39;s threadbare social safety net starts looking more salient. We have inherited a much less trusting, much more alienated society than you are likely to find overseas.Whatever the cause I fully reject the lazy conclusion this is somehow women&#39;s fault. The &#34;Lump of Labor&#34;  fallacy is just that, a fallacy. Economic gains are not zero-sum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My observation is that we are going to have a radical rebalancing of who reproduces and who doesn’t.Lot of men and women who are generally not too motivated to seek out a companion, lose weight, put in the work to make it happen just…won’t pass on genetics.Children are a lot of work and energy.I’m highly introverted and high earning. My wife was the aggressor in my case. She pretty much made it all happen.I think the ball is firmly in the woman’s court now. Women have most of the advantages (education, societal promotion, fit in better with our institutions) yet i see so many women who are generally apathetic about getting into a relationship at all.There is also a massive obesity problem. If people have trouble getting attracted to each other versus the alternatives, makes it really challenging to find the motivation.I wonder what all these effects will have over the next 200 years? If you play out the changing “relationship market conditions,” it seems like men and women with different personalities and dispositions towards seeking out relationships in order to reproduce will have a significant effect on the species.Will people who were genetically predisposed towards being thin, hard working, open minded to approaching members of opposite sex and forming deep attachments resulting in children become more frequent?On a genetic and evolutionary perspective I’m super interested - we know that IQ has been rising, but what else will change?In some societies such as Korea I am told, women are sometimes or more frequently the aggressor. I wonder if this becomes more common."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a big part of the despair is the obvious difference between what children are taught is the american dream vs what the american reality is.We are told america is the best place on earth with all the doors open to you to be rich. That all other forms of government are flawed and we have excellence here everywhere you look.And then you look at reality and see something else. Sure there are pockets of excellence and the dream still lives in fits and starts, but for the general person, they are likely shut out from any real hope of this grand vision.You add in COVID and the lockdowns, and economic turmoil, and then people start realizing that the whole race is kind of pointless. I can be poor busting my butt at a crappy job i hate, or i can be poor moving in with family and being &#39;unproductive&#39; (for some definition of societal unproductivity).Women, on the other hand, haven&#39;t been given the same advertising on the American dream that men have, which obviously is a terrible thing, but in this one sense probably helped them survive and prosper even when life sucks in a modern world.I&#39;m supposing the sell-job of an equivalence of the &#39;american&#39; dream in other countries is not nearly so commercial, and blaring. And so kids are likely not so shocked at the difference between expectations and reality. Throw in that many other countries are flat out better in many social structural ways, and i think that explains why, it&#39;s especially troubling in America."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the day (nearly 30 years ago) people would run a user-mode stack to obtain Internet connectivity via a (dial-up) Unix shell account.  The program was &#34;slirp&#34; which was named after SLIP/CSLIP, but then upgraded to support PPP once that became a thing.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slirp"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usermode WireGuard would be a big deal. I maintain a list[0] of tunneling solutions, and one of the only limitations of systems built on WireGuard is the requirement for admin privileges. Even with the performance hit from running outside the kernel, UDP-based tunnels have a lot of advantages for multiplexing channels. Pretty much your only mainstream options today are QUIC and WireGuard, and only QUIC is intended to run in userspace.I&#39;d have to dig into the details more, but something like this might allow you to implement a simple tunneling system based on WireGuard that runs in the kernel if you have the privileges, otherwise falls back to usermode and is no worse than QUIC in terms of performance. That would be awesome.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the lede is buried here... If I&#39;m reading correctly I can use flyctl to set up an SSH encrypted tunnel over user-space TCP/IP over wireguard encrypted IP packets over UDP over WebSockets over HTTP over TLS encrypted TCP/IP? And not even just for fun, but to solve real problems in production. I can see why you might have mixed feelings about that!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If the page size is too small, rows won’t fit inside the page and if it’s too large there is risk of write failure because hardware generally can only guarantee atomicity for a fixed size blocks which can vary disk to disk (usually ranges from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes).Pretty sure the 8KB page size is not about atomicity. It&#39;s true old storage mostly promised 512B atomicity (AFAIK it depends on operation, but that&#39;s irrelevant here) and we rely on that in some places. But even if it was 4KB, it&#39;s still be just half of 8kB pages. So an 8KB page might still get torn, and we can&#39;t rely on that.The simple truth is that this is a compromise - smaller pages benefit OLTP, larger pages benefit OLAP. And 8kB is somewhere in the middle. That&#39;s all.You can get better performance from e.g. 4KB pages, especially if that aligns with filesystem / SSD pages, etc."</p>

If we set an explicit height instead, the element doesn’t expand, but instead we get overflow&#34;Why? Why would you have different default behaviours if you have one of the dimensions set but not the other? Why would you not have this specified in another property, the overflow property perhaps? Oh look, lets define a new property and call it aspect ratio, and then lets ensure it doesn&#39;t maintain an element&#39;s aspect ratio if you have content that is going to overflow if you specify a width.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I get the impression they don&#39;t like the CEO very much. That was an impressively brutal attack on him, with probably the worst damage inflicted by the CEO&#39;s own statements.Blackwells is obviously not a neutral party here, there&#39;s a reason they created this thing. But on first glance it looks like a pretty solid argument that the management at Peleton is seriously flawed. I don&#39;t really buy the arguments on why Peleton is a good business and comparable to Streaming somehow.I do find the arguments around bad governance structures and oversight weird though, as those should have been known before they invested. Doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re wrong, but obviously this didn&#39;t stop Blackwells from investing in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact is. Not every company can be a $12B company. Peloton might be a super successful $1B company, who slowly tries to creep into new areas for growth.And it sounds like Blackwell understand this, and instead of pushing for Peloton to focus internally on its product and get rid of the extra fat, they want a fast sale to a not-really-smart company. So they can at least get some ROIPeople talk about monthly fees being high or fair, thats not it at all, Pelotons prices for hardware and membership or completely fine. What they did do is* Pouring money into building their own factories (even Apple doesn&#39;t do this at their scale, they pay Foxconn)* Building a full fledged apparel brand* Hiring way too many engineers, FAANG level org size* Having their own warehouses and delivery full time employeesNo other company does this. I&#39;m not sure what the long term plan was, maybe they become a white label manufacturer for other start ups? It failed, badlyYou do not need 14,000, or 11,000, or 3,000 employees to do what Peloton currently does (again, maybe they had grandiose plans in the pipeline). If we want to compare proprietary hardware + Android + online streaming service. When MIRROR was bought out by Lululemon for $500M, they had 200 employeesI have a feeling no one has offered Foley more than $3B for the company, and i&#39;m being generous"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Q: Is there anything about being CEO that you don’t like, that you like to delegate?&gt; A: Finance. Our CFO does 99% of finance. I engage because I want to know how we’re doing. But to say I don’t add value to her operation is an understatement. You can also say the same with technology. Our CTO doesn’t get any help from me. I’ll go sometimes months without talking to our CTO, which as a CEO of a technology company, that’s kind of rare.Wow..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think we (in the EU) will soon realise the bizarre consequences of these regulations. European startups will not be able to use standard SaaS or PaaS tools (like AWS, Azure, Mailchimp, PayPal etc) if they are based in the US (like most of them are). No cloud services, no Office 365 or Google Workspace.It will take forever to build up a similar ecosystem in Europe and I think most successful European entrepreneurs will just end up starting companies in the US instead.There must be some reasonable middle ground before we fragment and destroy the entire Internet. Why not start by making a general exception for temporary storage of less sensitive data like IP-addresses for  efficiently and cost effectively delivering a web service.If there is one thing they could start looking in to it would be handling of personal information by governmental organisations. I work a little bit with a few municipalities, and the number of documents with deeply personal information that are just emailed around over unencrypted email is shocking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this seems to be coming due to US regulations that compel US registered companies to hand over data from subsidiaries in Europe markets if asked by US intelligence and law enforcement agencies.With these various data locality regulations, i wonder if a standard operating approach could be to split tech companies into 3 legal entities, a technology licensing company, a US registered operations company and a Europe registered operations company and hand the shares in all three companies to the current shareholders.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ll add to the positivity: this is the first time I’ve ever found a “we can do better than SQL” compelling. It’s easy to understand what it’s doing with a variety of known quantities. It solves a difficult problem elegantly. It has 100% overlap with the goals I want it to have. It’s designed to be usable with minimal fuss. It does really a good job of portraying itself as magic (it will be awesome to use) without portraying itself as magic (it explains itself in terms of already knowable tools and how it leverages their strength).I do have a couple minor quibbles:- Serializable transactions are expensive, and that deserves to be an explicit caveat. Not everyone knows this, and it’s an important thing to put up front.- Some of the language in this post are in CAP theorem territory but neglect to directly address that. I’d like to see how client usage compares with direct Postgres usage (idiomatic for each insofar as such a beast exists) in a Call Me Maybe. I know that’s a lot to ask in a 1.0 announcement four years in the making, but I hope it’s a priority to get this in front of Aphyr.Edit: oh and I definitely look forward to this being further distinguished from an ORM, because even though I can see the blue and black dress my mind keeps switching it back to gold and white."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so happy for you guys, I&#39;m wishing you great success.
Since the first first version of uvloop I&#39;ve been excited about MagicStack and I couldn&#39;t be more excited about EdgeDB since it has the same magical minds behind.Here&#39;s what I think makes EdgeDB special: it&#39;s a DB that replaces the tediousness of ORMs with a better core that can be cross-language / cross-platform.
I&#39;ve implemented tons of APIs, first REST, then GraphQL all of them on top of ORMs (Django, Peewee, SQLAlchemy, Mongoose and more). When prototyping was great, but scaling them became quite challenging, specially if you want to have a performant outcome when retrieving data.EdgeQL is an incredible useful abstraction that will prove itself in a few years.
Long life EdgeQL. Keep up the good work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These guys are from magic stack, they wrote the definitive async python postgres library, asyncpg. Very high quality library.Been keeping a close eye on Edge, had even considered it as a primary database, and probably will in the future!!As much as I adore the ergonomics improvements I really am more interested in the performance, replication, scalability story, with the likes of cockroach db reaching maturity in 2022.But as a postgres replacement in general, I would highly consider using edge."</p>

Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and even Zoom have demonstrated that web is good enough if they want it.If you try to force me to install a native app, that&#39;s a strong signal that the app is going to do something against my interest. Given how aggressively Zoom has pushed the app, it was very clear to me that this thing is never going to hit my main machine (I think I have a VM somewhere that I used for a job interview that needed the more advanced features)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It must be noted that the satellites were not directly damaged by the geomagnetic storm. The storm warmed the atmosphere which caused it to expand, leading to additional drag that prohibited the satellites from leaving their low &#34;safe mode&#34; orbit.Shortened excerpt:
&#34;These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase.... speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50 percent.... The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe-mode where they would fly edge-on (like a sheet of paper) to minimize drag...Preliminary analysis show the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented the satellites from leaving safe-mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers, and up to 40 of the satellites will reenter or already have reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. The deorbiting satellites pose zero collision risk with other satellites and by design demise upon atmospheric reentry—meaning no orbital debris is created and no satellite parts hit the ground.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SpaceX deploys its satellites into these lower obitsUnintentional pun on &#34;orbits&#34;, perhaps?It&#39;s incredible to me that launching satellites is so easy now that a failure of 40 satellites can be tolerated. On the bright side, I guess this gave SpaceX a chance to talk about their debris-limiting strategy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"40 sats makes up about 2% of the current fleet - so a rounding error in cost and time.The important part of this news is how those 40 sats deorbit and leave no junk either in orbit or on earth."</p>

These customers should contact their local Mazda dealer who can submit a goodwill request to the Mazda Warranty department on their behalf, order the parts, and schedule a free repair when the parts arrive.”

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a partner of a person with a complete spinal cord injury, I appreciate these articles and the science being done by these researchers, it is truly a big and complex and worthwhile problem to solve.For most of us, I do want to suggest being careful when and how you mention research and articles like this to people in wheelchairs. Just be aware there are lots of different reasons why someone might be in a wheelchair and what can and can&#39;t be done for a given illness. It can be really taxing to get suggestions or shares of articles like this from well-meaning friends and family that don&#39;t actually understand the realities of living with an injury or medical issue that puts someone in a wheelchair.Obviously people should know work is being done. And obviously people might be excited to hear about breakthrough research. If you&#39;re inspired by articles like this, consider donating to the institutions funding the research. But, be aware that articles like this come out every year and for the vast majority of spinal cord injury patients it won&#39;t be available to them soon or ever.If you really want to support those in the accessibility needs community, support local building code changes and adaptive sports and outdoors programs. Making buildings, sports, and wilderness accessible will impact more people positively in the near term.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case you didn&#39;t know:American Institute of Mathematics is a research non-profit ran by one of the Fry brothers (of Fry Electronics).At least until recently, it&#39;s been run out of the back of the office space of their headquarters location on Brokaw road in San Jose.Now that the store (and the company) is defunct, I&#39;m happy to see that AIM is still kicking.Can&#39;t vouch for everything that they do, but they have been running pretty solid geometric group theory workshops on the reg. I got to attend one, and have good memories of it.I&#39;m still sad that the store has shut down. They cite COVID as a reason, but they&#39;ve been in liquidation mode long before that (at some point, I couldn&#39;t even get a USB flash drive there!). I hope that AIM will go on as a legacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s never studied real math (only Physics math), I found the book &#34;Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications&#34; extremely interesting, in part because it leads you to understand asymmetric cryptography and error-correcting codes. Also the SAGE exercises are neat.http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/aata-toc.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just a lowly adjunct, but I sense that one barrier to open textbook adoption is the accreditation process. I don&#39;t know exactly the connection, but I get the feeling that the department can check some box if they say that all their lower division calculus courses are taught with Pearson&#39;s book, for instance. Sort of a &#34;no one ever got fired for choosing IBM&#34; type situation.Anyone have any insight to this? I only have a sample size of two... which leads me to believe not all departments worry about this so much.Edit: see these MAA guidelines: https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-de...One suggestion is &#34;there should be established procedures for periodic review of the curriculum... should include careful scrutiny of course syllabi, prerequisites, and textbooks.&#34;As much as I hate to say it, there are legitimate reasons for carefully controlling the curricula in lower division courses. A big one is: transfer credit. People get pissed when it&#39;s difficult to transfer their cheaper CC credits to a larger university.The easiest way to solve these problems is by dictating curricula. But, unfortunately, the Pearson&#39;s of the world feast on the resulting homogenized market.This is similar to my problem with Common Core. Everything in Common Core is perfectly reasonable. But now we have one giant textbook market where Pearson dominates with their products which now bear a &#34;Common Core approved&#34; label on the cover."</p>

If you don&#39;t know about it already, I would highly recommend checking it out (e.g. by searching YouTube for &#34;MIT Sparc Fusion Reactor&#34; for some fairly accessible videos on the theory behind why they should achieve fusion way faster than the current roadmap with ITER and DEMO).In the press conference just ended, they repeated how exactly the JET reactor worked as predicted by theory. In my layman&#39;s understanding, for the exact same reason (seemingly very sound theoretical groundwork), the SPARC reactor should exceed breakeven within the next few years.From Wiki on CFS:* Back in September 2021, they built the strongest high-room-temperature superconducting magnet (20 Tesla) suitable for a fusion reactor* Theory dictates that with stronger magnets, the reactor can be scaled down (with the square/cube, can&#39;t remember exactly), and thus cost and time to develop* Back in November 2021, they raised $1.8 billion from the likes of Bill Gateshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fusion_SystemsBoy, do I think it would be crazy cool if they succeed, even taking twice as long as they&#39;ve planned! :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;If you’re curious why unionization has taken the journalism world by storm the last few years, you don’t have to look to politics or in-group signaling for an explanation, basic economics will get you all the way there.... You reduce quantity of labor supplied and end up with higher equilibrium wages for those who manage to get their foot in the door. Of course, this will only heighten the favoring of those who can get their foot in the $3200/mo Brooklyn rent door while dressing fashionably and using “semiotics” correctly in a sentence, but that’s neither here nor there.&#34;This is a cute theory, and tickles some people&#39;s ideological fancy. But if the author had done more research, they would know where the CWA-NewsGuild is actually doing most of its new organizing (hint: not New York), what sorts of contract articles they bargain around hiring, and what the status quo in non-union newsrooms is.In brief, the Guild has been organizing tons of local newspapers in small cities and rural areas, particularly those bought up by private equity firms who want to cut the newsroom to the bone. They bargain contract articles that curb the nepotistic in-group hiring practices common at non-union papers.Source: I&#39;m a former NewsGuild member, but at a software company, not a newspaper.Take a gander at the NewsGuild president&#39;s twitter account and you&#39;ll see many examples of these campaigns: https://twitter.com/gaufre"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not just journalists, but politicians, priests, etc. The filtered bubble of their society becomes the pole star of their existence, and the rest of the world gets devalued.Used to be, near any event that generates news coverage, there would be a bar where the journalists hung out. Listening to the conversations there would tell you what the story was going to be, as well as how it differed from the facts. The audience that mattered was the rest of the media clique; the actual paying &#34;audience&#34; was the chum that everyone took for granted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is the source for the claim that so many American journalists under 40 live in the area  encircled in the map in the tweet? The source for wages in journalism having gone to hell? The source for unions restricting the supply of labor? If so, why hasn&#39;t all the journalist unions he see forming already restricted the number of journalists and increased their wages?I also think the author&#39;s characterization job status is wrong. Journalists mostly hang out with journalists so whether journalist is a high-status job or not is irrelevant since they are all journalists. Working for Google has high status in some circles but probably not among Google&#39;s own employees. Furthermore, only a tiny fraction of all journalists write for the Washington Post or other recognizable papers. Not a lot of status in writing for marketing agencies or obscure trade press magazines."</p>

I&#39;m mostly floored by how many of the textile words people here don&#39;t recognize, to the point of thinking they&#39;re &#34;fake words.&#34; Have you never shopped for textiles for your house or apartment? I mean, espadrille, sure, that&#39;s a woman&#39;s shoe guys might not ever see the word for. But damask? Jacquard? Chenille? Do you not have curtains or a couch?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having done computer architecture and bit twiddling x86 in the ye olden days, I immediately, independently converged on the patented solution (code / circuit / Verilog, more or less the same thing). It goes to show how broken the USPTO is because it&#39;s obvious to anyone in the field. Patents are supposed to be nonobvious. (35 USC 103)https://patentdefenses.klarquist.com/obviousness-sec-103/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;SWAR&#34; approach `(a &amp; b) + (a ^ b) / 2` looks bizarre but can be understood.Adding two bits produces a sum and a carry:    0 + 0 = 0, carry 0
    1 + 0 = 1, carry 0
    0 + 1 = 1, carry 0
    1 + 1 = 0, carry 1

So the sum is XOR, and the carry is bitwise AND. We can rewrite x + y as (x ^ y) + (x &amp; y)*2Distribute the divide, and you get (x ^ y)/2 + (x &amp; y) which is the mystery expression.(Note this distribution is safe only because (x &amp; y)*2 is even.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It sort of make sense for Nvidia&#39;s shareholders. The initial offering for ARM was only worth $38.5bn, which was already expensive due to SoftBank initial purchase price and not wanting for a loss. But at Nvidia&#39;s peak this deal was worth &#34;$87bn&#34;. For a company that makes less than $2B in revenue and at best ~$300M in Operating Income. Remember this isn&#39;t something you can buy and milk the crap out of other market players. &#34;Not a very British way of doing business&#34; is A Direct Quote from ARM. ( Edit: Because of perceptual licensing agreement, for those unaware of how ARM business model works )It didn&#39;t make sense how ARM was worth $22bn in 2016 on LSE, that has a PE100+ when I cant see how it could double its Net profit in the next 10 years, with a saner valuation of P/E 50. It make even less sense to me when Softbank bought it for $32bn. Didn&#39;t make any sense when Nvidia want it for $38.5bn, and later at $50bn+.Now we are back to square one, how many investors, in the open market are willing to buy ARM&#39;s stock at a valuation of, let say the same $32bn as Softbank initially paid? Roughly P/E 100, assuming they managed to grow ARM business from 2018 at ~$220M operating income to $300M in 2021. I much rather bet on Intel if I had the money.And of course many on HN will think ARM is worthless because the future is going to be the Riscy Silver Bullet.Disclosures: I do not currently hold any stocks or Mutual Funds, Indexes and other financial instrument."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Soooo back on the LSE or?It was such a hot stock in 2014-15. Softbank kinda bought it at the peak. Still, Apple has proven ARM on the desktop is phenomenal, and Ampere has done the same in the datacenter. Both have swiftly made compiler support accelerate dramatically. I would love for my next desktop to be arm-based, and it would be great if it didn’t NEED to be a mac. Broad adoption of ARM would be a huge win for sustainability. I’m bullish on their business, even if their business model isn’t vertically scalable.I think that RISC V also has a bright future, but its still a bit far out before its a viable competitor. Still there have been some things that look really promising such as what is coming out of SiFive:https://www.sifive.com/press/sifive-raises-risc-v-performanc...And Intel just announced a $1B fund for companies building on their Open Foundry RISC-V alliance. https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-1b-fund-risc-vBig things are happening for small instruction sets… watch this space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. Never a good outcome for the industry for Arm to be owned by Nvidia - and regulators have learned by now that undertakings in these circumstances have little value.Sorry for Simon Segars who must have had a tough job essentially implementing Son&#39;s ideas. And those ideas seem to have been pretty poor - Arm China debacle, focus on IoT and selling to Nvidia have all clearly harmed Arm&#39;s prospects.It&#39;s clear by now that selling CPUs is a mature market but that Arm has room to grow and there is still lots of money to be made in hardware if you innovate - eg in accelerated computing. It&#39;s also true both that Arm&#39;s model works and that it has more competition than ever from RISC-V.A lot still to play for in my view and I think that the IPO price will reflect that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The interesting thing this brings up is whether programming hiring is too specific. Why do we hire reactjs programmers with e-commerce experience instead of react programmers, e-commerce programmers, or programmers?To me this guy sounds like he could do anything, just see if he&#39;s easy to work with and see if he likes your domain. He&#39;s certainly said enough about programming over the years that he shouldn&#39;t need a leetcode grilling.Anyway my point was it can get quite narrow what we look for in a coder when in fact some broad experience might be just what is necessary. For instance I&#39;ve coded apps for iPhone and Android despite being ostensibly a back end financial trader. I&#39;d think a lot of coders wouldn&#39;t want to be siloed into the first thing they get a job in."</p>

I had spent years of using Haskell for recreational programming and wrote a book using the subset of Haskell that I personally use (you can get a free copy at https://leanpub.com/u/markwatson by setting the price to free).About six years ago I decided to apply for Haskell jobs at Standard Charter and Facebook on Haskell teams with well known people in the field. Both groups said that I was an interesting candidate and suggested getting another Haskell job for a while, and then reapplying. I did end up consulting remotely for a startup in India writing Haskell but that job was short (about 6 weeks) because I was in the process of getting hired at Capital One to manage a deep learning team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the official response from SE:https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/376060/update-on-th...For the past month Stack Overflow has been hit by weekly DDoS attacks that progressively grew in size and scope. In each incident, the attacker(s) have been changing their methodology and responding to our countermeasures. Initially we were able to detect and mitigate the attacks before any performance degradation could be noticed but the latest attacks ramped up very quickly and the site was brought down before we could react.While we cannot go into specifics on each attack in order to maintain opsec and not tip off the attackers, we can say that each individual attack has been using different IP addresses and targeted different aspects of the site. During an outage, our top priority is always getting the site back up and running. After traffic has been stabilized, we perform a post mortem for the incident where we assess and improve upon the actions we have taken.During the outage last Sunday, we noticed that a large amount of the DDoS traffic originated from Tor exit nodes. The decision to block Tor exit nodes did not come lightly, in fact Teresa, our CTO was on the call when we discussed remediation methods. Due to the persistent nature of the attack and our desire to bring the site back up as fast as possible we made the decision to block all DDoS traffic endpoints, including these Tor exit nodes.We did not target, nor set out to block all traffic from Tor, that’s not something Stack has ever done. However, due to the shared nature of Tor exit nodes, some of them were also routing DDoS attacks to our sites and were blocked. We have tried removing these blocks between attacks but this action has resulted in further site outages as DDoS efforts continue to originate from these exit nodes. Unfortunately blocking the Tor exit nodes also blocks legitimate users from using them. An immediate solution for users who find themselves blocked is to access our site from other IP addresses, via home internet, work internet, or other VPN services.We are continuing to evaluate the situation and will keep our community updated. Thank you for your patience and understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was no intentional blocking of Tor there in the past as far as I understand. But there are some mechanisms that block users from IP addresses that posted spam or abusive content. Those are automated and based on flags and not directed towards Tor specifically, but of course TOR addresses are more likely to have been misused that way so your chances of encountering these blocks is dramatically higher when using Tor. But these blocks only apply to low reputation users, I think once you&#39;re above 100 they don&#39;t matter anymore. And they also don&#39;t block reading the sites.There have been DDoS attacks recently on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, I think it&#39;s quite plausible those have something to do with this. They still seem to be under active attack intermittently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe Stackoverflow finally started to aggressively block everything that might &#34;crawl&#34; their data. I&#39;m super tired of all the paraphrased/translated copies in Google results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So basically, we are a hosting association that wanted to put their servers at home _and_ sleep at night.
This demanded inter-home redundancy of our data. But none of the existing solutions (MinIO, Ceph...) are designed for high inter-node latency.
Hence Garage! Your cheap and proficient object store: designed to run on a toaster, through carrier-pigeon-grade networks, while still supporting a tons of workloads (static websites, backups, Nextcloud... you name it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Y&#39;all might want to get to the point a bit quicker in your pitch. A lot of fluff to wade through before the lede..&#34;Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.Garage implements the Amazon S3 protocol, a de-facto standard that makes it compatible with a large variety of existing software. For instance it can be used as a storage back-end for many self-hosted web applications such as NextCloud, Matrix, Mastodon, Peertube, and many others, replacing the local file system of a server by a distributed storage layer. Garage can also be used to synchronize your files or store your backups with utilities such as Rclone or Restic. Last but not least, Garage can be used to host static websites, such as the one you are currently reading, which is served directly by the Garage cluster we host at Deuxfleurs.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I maintain a list[0] of solutions to this problem. Cloudflare Tunnel is what I currently recommend to most people. IMO it&#39;s the easiest way to expose services publicly on the internet. For example a website or shared Plex server.Main downsides to Cloudflare Tunnel are no e2ee (Cloudflare decrypts all your traffic) and technically anything other than basic HTML websites (ie media streaming) is against their free ToS, though I haven&#39;t heard of that being enforced in practice.If you&#39;re the only one ever using your services then I&#39;d recommend Tailscale instead, which sets up a VPN using WireGuard along with slick auto p2p setup (NAT traversal, relays, etc).[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But what if you could host a web service with no ports exposed? Well, you can! Cloudflare Tunnel makes a persistent outbound connection (a tunnel!) between your server and Cloudflare&#39;s nearest datacenter. All the traffic to your domain flows through this outgoing tunnel and connects to your server through the protection of Cloudflare. This also has the benefit of being seamlessly encrypted, so you don&#39;t have to worry about a thing when it comes to the security of your web service.Well, a port is exposed, it&#39;s just exposed on Cloudflare&#39;s reverse proxies. And I think this is probably a dramatic overstatement of the security that Cloudflare provides..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you have $3-5/month to spare on a VPS, a similar but self hosted solution can be achieved- Tunnel/VPN and reverse proxy- using Wireguard and Caddy.Caddy in particular is extremely easy to configure, with the bonus that HTTPS/Lets Encrypt has never been free&#39;er. Wireguard configuration is also gloriously minimal but admittedly, potentially tricky to get right the first time.It&#39;s just good to consider alternatives to Cloudfare&#39;s network dominance, if you can afford it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The statement of facts is linked to from the press release, and describes generally how the Feds were able to trace the stolen funds (they found a file listing private keys, after gaining access to the suspect&#39;s cloud storage)
https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1470186/downl...&gt; The 2017 transfers notwithstanding, the majority of the stolen funds remained in Wallet 1CGA4s from August 2016 until January 31, 2022. On January 31, 2022, law enforcement gained access to Wallet 1CGA4s by decrypting a file saved to LICHTENSTEIN’s cloud storage account, which had been obtained pursuant to a search warrant. The file contained a list of 2,000 virtual currency addresses, along with corresponding private keys.&gt; ...The connection among the VCE 1 accounts was further confirmed upon reviewing a spreadsheet saved to LICHTENSTEIN’s cloud storage account. The spreadsheet included the log-in information for accounts at various virtual currency exchanges and a notation regarding the status of the accounts&gt; ...Lichtenstein Email 2 was held at a U.S.-based provider that offered email as well as cloud storage services, among other products. In 2021, agents obtained a copy of the contents of the cloud storage account pursuant to a search warrant. Upon reviewing the contents of the account, agents confirmed that the account was used by LICHTENSTEIN. However, a significant portion of the files were encrypted"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This story reminded me of a story written by a Czech biologist who studied animals in Papua-New Guinea and went to a hunt with a group of local tribesmen.The dusk was approaching, they were still in the forest and he proposed that they could sleep under a tree. The hunters were adamant in their refusal: no, this is dangerous, a tree might fall on you in your sleep and kill you. He relented, but silently considered them irrational, given that his assessment of a chance of a tree falling on you overnight was less then 1:5000.Only later did he realize that for a lifelong hunter, 1:5000 are pretty bad odds that translate to a very significant probability of getting killed over a 30-40 year long hunting career."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read them as sloppy caricatures that provide little value to the conversation.Let&#39;s take the security guard: &#34;The only problem is: he now provides literally no value. He’s excluded by fiat the possibility of ever being useful in any way. He could be losslessly replaced by a rock with the words “THERE ARE NO ROBBERS” on it.&#34;That is blatantly not true, the guard provide value since the wanna-be robbers don&#39;t know whether the guard will be of any value, and a rock could not provide any deterrent. Losslessly?The doctor (if there is someone skeptical of doctors it is me, if I were less lazy I would have greatly enjoyed fighting to make some useless US dermatologists lose their license): &#34;Her heuristic is right 99.9% of the time, but she provides literally no value. There is no point to her existence. She could be profitably replaced with a rock saying “IT’S NOTHING, TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND WAIT FOR IT TO GO AWAY”.This is an unhelpful caricature, too, because if we add &#34;and call back if it does not&#34;, it looks like a very reasonable approach.Un-nuanced and quite sloppy presentation of heuristics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The doctor rings true. I had 3 separate doctors on 3 separate occasions diagnose my 21 month old son with an ear infection, instead of the plum-sized malignant brain tumour that it was.From their point of view, pediatric brain tumours are very rare and ear infections are common.Their 99% heuristic almost killed him.That was 2010. He survived and is now a vibrant 13 year old, but only because of one curious intern/fellow at the children&#39;s hospital ER that decided to order a CT to rule out the remote possibility. Her diligence got him admitted and into surgery within a day."</p>

The presentations are very engaging and the solution that this project came up is really something.This is my favorite video by Russel [0], it really is a fascinating project, and he is a great speaker.With that said, I don&#39;t really see it becoming a widely used framework. No matter how creative the solution is, it&#39;s hard to compete against real native, Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, Flutter, React Native, Electron, and more.

I feel that I went from mid to senior when I would enter that same situation and try to understand the why behind the code (even though I probably still thought it was poorly architected) before passing judgement or trying to &#34;fix&#34; it with a refactor."</p>

But what if a lot of &#34;stupid&#34; design decisions are actually Type 2?And the reasons may or may not be good - somewhere on a scale from real budget and/or time constraints, lack of insight, indifference, penny pinching economics, to passive aggressive user hostility.When Apple removed Magsafe no doubt there were perfectly good internal justifications for that decision.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a foreign wife and it really drives home one truth: America is a very nuanced place. We have this idea of almost unlimited free speech. Which sounds great, but in practice, it is not really true. Because ultimately, Americans do not have equal rights. We see this over and over in different aspects of society. The Frederick Douglas example from Boston in the article is a great example of why free speech is good. But the truth is it is the same kind of people who are always preventing free speech in meaningful ways. If your takeaway from the speech is that &#34;all kinds of speech need to be heard&#34;, you might be philosophically correct. But, again, in practice, the people in power do not allow free speech. And this is fundamentally different from most examples of cancel culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The application of censorship itself, not what is being censored, is the main symptom of the declining cultural health. The mentality that there are so universally wrong and right things that the right ones must be forced upon any mind, no matter the context, and the wrong ones must be extinguished no matter the context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One major distinction this glosses over is the difference between making it so you can&#39;t read something (e.g., banning it), and making it so you aren&#39;t required to read something (e.g., removing it from the curriculum). Only the former is censorship."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At the start of the pandemic, I knew I would miss working with people in person, but thought I would be totally great with WFH.Now, I know that I badly need some amount of in-person time with my coworkers on a weekly basis, or I go crazy.It&#39;s a motivational thing for me. I thrive on solving problems for and with other people, and there&#39;s an &#34;out of sight, out of mind&#34; effect for me over zoom. It&#39;s just harder for me to get my brain going.I wish I were better at WFH - maybe with the right type of work I would be. I love everything else about it! My home office setup is awesome, I always hated commuting, I love the flexibility of doing chores during the day or getting some work done at 11pm because I don&#39;t feel like sleeping.But man, I miss people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working from home means I get to see my wife and children for more hours of the day. It also means that I get to choose when I will allow myself to be interrupted, rather than sitting in an open concept office and being _continually_ interrupted.I&#39;ve been working from home for over six years. I never want to return to the office. I will change careers before I return to a software development office."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The pandemic really helped me confirm that I prefer the office.I always sought to establish a clear distinction between my work life and home life and the enforced work from home due to COVID has made the two blur to a point now where I feel like I&#39;ve lost all rhythm. Now living through a pandemic itself has a way of disrupting the rhythm of life but I feel that the collapsing of space into a singular living and work area doesn&#39;t help matters.Another unexpected thing I&#39;ve found that I missed while working from home is a commute. Now I imagine a person&#39;s opinion of their commute is highly conditioned on the mode of transportation but in my case it&#39;s a mostly relaxing public transit ride where I had 20-30 minutes of unstructured time to read, listen to a podcast, or just zone out. It similarly helped create additional space to separate the work life from the home life.This second point on a commute would probably completely change if I had a 90 minute drive in bumper to bumper traffic. If that was my life, there&#39;s a good chance I&#39;d find work from home preferable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My X13 AMD, for example, has a powerful 32-core AMD APU, 32GiB of RAM, and a superfast 1TiB NVMe SSD.The X13 does not have a 32-core APU. The highest spec available is the 4750U with 8C/16T.&gt; By the way, the latest MacBook Pro comes with an Ethernet port. We loved the jokes about iDongle; how about ThinkDongle?The latest MacBook Pro does not come with an Ethernet port. It is however very annoying that Lenovo requires a proprietary dongle to use the built-in Ethernet controller.&gt; The removal of the SD cards slot and Ethernet port has made recent ThinkPads a suboptimal choice for traveling photographers and some IT professionals.The removal of the SD card reader on the X13 AMD Gen 2 is bizarre, but they can and do still offer Ethernet via a dongle.&gt; would you read about the update procedure after you’ve done multiple BIOS updates for the same machine already? Even if you would, would you pay much attention to the Notes section?Yes, but I&#39;m probably weird because I like to know what the vendor fixed and whether the firmware update might remove features that I use (shakes fist at Dell).I own an X13 AMD Gen 2 (20XH), and I think it&#39;s a great laptop with some small caveats.Pro:- 1600p matte display looks amazing- proper support for S3, very low S3 power consumption- super quiet, I never hear the fan and the laptop is never uncomfortably hot (even doing heavy things like compiling buildroot)- amazing performance for a laptop (5850U)Con:- no SD card reader (seriously, why?)- proprietary dongle for Ethernet- Ethernet is only GigE- Came with MediaTek 7961 WiFi, which while supported by mainline Linux, the performance is trash (~30MBit on 802.11ac). Luckily it&#39;s only M.2 so you can replace it with something like the AX201"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A T420 was my daily driver through undergrad, and then collected dust during grad school when I was issued a Macbook. When I returned my Macbook I dusted it off and was surprised by how usable it was (and how usable and well-supported it was running Arch compared to debian in the early 2010s). I finally gave in and upgraded the memory (DDR3!) to 16 GiB recently, and am considering getting a third-party 9-cell battery, as my 9+ year old one has gotten long in the tooth (i3&#39;s battery &#34;widget&#34; reports ~70% fully charged).I dare say it&#39;s my most usable travel laptop outside of my work-issued Yoga, which it still trounces in terms of keyboard ergonomics. It absolutely dunks on the bargin-bin laptops I&#39;ve tried out over the past few years, I think in part because of ergonomics but also because Arch on old (but well-supported) hardware feels snappier than Windows 10 on new (but low-cost) hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me, or did old laptops have better keyboards that the new ones have today?My first laptop was Acer Aspire One (this one [0]). I still have it and I still use it, it&#39;s currently running Debian with Xfce. And the keyboard is still the best I&#39;ve ever used, I genuinely prefer this keyboard over any desktop keyboards that I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve tried many mechanical including Cherry Brown switches. I get that the very low profile keyboards on modern laptops look nice, but I personally don&#39;t use the keyboard for its looks. Not to mention that my cat stepped on the &#34;Enter&#34; key of one of the newer laptops (Acer CB3-431) and she broke the butterfly shaped keycap stabilisation thingy making the button feel very inconsistent. I can&#39;t the replacement for just the bit that broke, I have to buy an entire new keyboard for it (~55€). The cat wasn&#39;t fat and she has walked over pretty much every keyboard that I&#39;ve used, but that was the first one that broke...It is this line of thinking that I personally think is the reason why a good number of people like and still use ThinkPads today.[0] https://www.globalmediapro.com/dp/A25LT9/Acer-Aspire-One-AOA..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Indeed. Valve established DRM to a degree many previously hoped it would get rejected. But they offered a decent service and proved that piracy is a service problem. What they did for Linux as a gaming platform is spectacular. Not many people use it yet, but Windows does look less and less like a dependable long term solution, especially with Microsofts other ambitions in that industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add on this: Valve works with upstream developers on upstream code, so their work benefits the whole FOSS ecosystem. They are funding a lot of kernel, Mesa, Wayland, Wine and KDE developers.(Disclaimer: I&#39;m a Valve contractor.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I am in a &#34;late-game&#34; stage of gaming. I have sort of an overview of what is going on, but a major percentage of games simply look not interesting (anymore) to me.The collection of games I end up playing is somewhere between special and weird, I&#39;d say.And, to get back to the topic, for people in a comparable situation like me, Linux is a great alternative. So if hear or read other people comparing pros and cons of Win vs. Linux (or Apple vs. Linux), and gaming was the major drawback, think carefully if that applies to you as well.Having a pile of shame on Linux is as easy to do as on Windows, just it&#39;s smaller (which is good, right?). But having one at all means that you don&#39;t have a lack of games, but quite the opposite.Of course, when you deeply into AAA and big franchises, and need to play a game when it&#39;s published and everyone talks about it - then probably not."</p>

Next time we do it, we&#39;ll probably link to both. Having several different ways to visualize the same thing is very helpful, and I like that this one moves quickly.A couple of details missing from this visualization are how you pad a message to be a multiple of the block size, and how you chain blocks together to form a longer message. In the pseudocode at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Pseudocode, that&#39;s the &#34;Pre-processing (Padding)&#34; part and the &#34;for each chunk&#34; loop just below it. I get why you&#39;d want to leave those things out, since they&#39;re not really the interesting part, and the screen is already pretty packed as it is.If anyone&#39;s feeling curious about implementing this yourself, take a look at these project notes: https://github.com/oconnor663/applied_crypto_2021_fall/tree/....

For example, why &#34;right rotate 7 XOR right rotate 18 XOR right shift 3&#34; and not &#34;right rotate 2 XOR right rotate 3 XOR right shift 4&#34;?"</p>

Collectively they&#39;ve been labeled &#34;data thugs&#34; [2] and accused of &#34;methodological terrorism&#34; [3], which is why I think Nick&#39;s fundamental goodness is an especially valuable asset. We&#39;d gain a ton of social value from certain reforms to the scientific research apparatus, and, IMO, being kind when delivering pointed critiques helps a difficult pill go down.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a fantastic example of how a) anyone can call bullshit on science if it doesn&#39;t make sense and b) there are more and less correct ways of calling bullshit on established science.You don&#39;t need to hop on a podcast or radio show in order to question the orthodoxy of a scientific claim, and in fact you shouldn&#39;t if you want to be taken seriously.  Nick Brown would have hurt his case had he done that, and instead found a path that actually knocked down a faulty concept in a way that has lasting effects.This is the process working.  This is all okay, and welcome, IMO, though possibly not by everyone involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taking equations from physics out of context to bolster social science claims isn&#39;t unique to psychology, other social sciences like economics have done the same thing with little more justification.  The rationale behind this approach is simple marketing, in that &#39;using more mathy stuff&#39; will sell better to the general public than non-mathy hand-waving claims will.However, the practioners of this approach don&#39;t seem to understand that physical equations are constructed by analysis of empirical experimental and observational data on one hand, and theoretical mathematical development on the other, within limited scopes of applicability.  Copying equations from one area of science to another willy-nilly like the article describes is just ridiculous - would cosmologists studying general relatively just plug in quantum mechanical equations in the hope of getting a &#39;mathy explanation&#39;?Here&#39;s another example from &#39;mathematically sound neoclassical economics&#39;, which does the same with 19th century physical science equations:&gt; &#34;The strategy the economists used was as simple as it was absurd—they substituted economic variables for physical ones. Utility (a measure of economic well-being) took the place of energy; the sum of utility and expenditure replaced potential and kinetic energy. A number of well-known mathematicians and physicists told the economists that there was absolutely no basis for making these substitutions. But the economists ignored such criticisms and proceeded to claim that they had transformed their field of study into a rigorously mathematical scientific discipline.&#34;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-economist-has..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;While the investors listed above can take care of themselves, unfortunately, invitations to invest were also extended to small-time individual angel investors. Thousands of AngelList members were invited to invest personal checks ranging from $2,000 to $20,000+ via the mailing lists of multiple syndicates.&#34;It&#39;s worth noting that any US person investing this way is required to be an accredited investor, which is another way of saying they&#39;ve proven they can afford to lose that $20k (or whatever they&#39;re putting in).The accredited investor rules in USA seem draconian, but if it weren&#39;t for them, we&#39;d be absolutely drowning in fake tech companies taking money from retail investors. (Today those fakes are in crypto, where you can pretend your investment offering is a utility token or maybe a donation to a revolutionary DAO that just happens to issue tradeable crypto-tokens in return, and hide behind pseudonyms to make it harder for SEC to find you eventually.)"</p>

A16Z certainly do lead follow-on rounds, but it isn&#39;t the norm. (It would be interesting to know if they exercised pro-rata or not, but even that isn&#39;t necessarily indicative of anything.)I don&#39;t know if there is or isn&#39;t fraud here, but the only evidence seems to be that Kagan was good at fundraising, raise a lot in a frothy market on little traction, and did not succeed at building the product or a successful business.One of the best things about the tech ecosystem is the lack of stigma around failure. I hope people don&#39;t lose sight of that as round sizes and valuations spike."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here.HVM is the ultimate conclusion to years of optimal evaluation research. I&#39;ve been a great enthusiast of optimal runtimes. Until now, though, my most efficient implementation had barely passed 50 million rewrites per second. It did beat GHC in cases where optimality helped, like λ-encoded arithmetic, but in more real-world scenarios, it was still far behind. Thanks to a recent memory layout breakthrough, though, we managed to reach a peak performance of 2.5 billion rewrites per second, on the same machine. That&#39;s a ridiculous 50x improvement.That is enough for it to enjoy roughly the same performance of GHC in normal programs, and even outperform it when automatic parallelism kicks in, if that counts! Of course, there are still cases where it will perform worse (by 2x at most usually, and some weird quadratic cases that should be fixed [see issues]), but remember it is a 1-month prototype versus the largest lazy functional compiler in the market. I&#39;m confident HVM&#39;s current design is able to scale and become the fastest functional runtime in the world, because I believe the optimal algorithm is inherently superior.I&#39;m looking for partners! Check the notes at the end of the repository&#39;s README if you want to get involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks pretty awesome, and holds much promise for the future.
Optimal beta reduction has always seemed like something of theoretical interest only, but Victor has been working many years on making it more practical, which deserves a lot of respect.&gt; HVM files look like untyped Haskell.Why not make it look exactly like Haskell?
So that every valid Haskell program is automatically a valid Hvm program,
while the reverse need not hold due to hvm being untyped.Instead the syntax looks like a mix of Haskell and Lisp, with parentheses around application, and prefix operators. I prefer the cleaner Haskell syntax.Some of the speedup examples look somewhat artificial:The exponential speedup is on 2^n compositions of the identity function,
which has no practical use. It would be nice to show such a speedup on a nontrivial function.The arithmetical example uses a binary representation, but strangely uses unary implementation of operators, with addition implemented as repeated increment, and multiplication as repeated addition. Why not use binary implementation of operators? Does that not show a good speedup?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool. My daughter has a brain shunt due to complications of spina bifida and so we’re thinking of cerebrospinal fluid on a regular basis. As a layman I guess there’s a particular cerebrospinal fluid pressure you want, and that being too high or too low causes issues? Apparently the shunt just drains into her belly so I also found that interesting. Too high and she’ll have terrible headaches and an “alien” head (sorry, don’t mean offense by that but it’s what I’m trying to avoid for my child) and I don’t know what would happen with too little, maybe someone could tell me. Probably not good I’m assuming.I frequent some FB groups for parents of children with SB and am shocked at how large some people let their kids heads get without consulting with or complaining to a doctor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is curious.  During my research into neutral networks we depended on a neuroscience result that found waves of trophic factor (i.e. the stuff used to build up neurons [i.e. learn]) travel in cascading waves from the core of the brain to the periphery.  By adding a sense of location and a learning term contingent on the factor we saw learning 
(xor) prohibited by Minsky&#39;s result (not really prohibited because we changed the model).The take away was that our models of ANNs benefit from considering more that just neural signaling (i.e. solution contents and fluid dynamics).  Is anyone aware of modern work expanding on that front?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fought the battle to keep my SMTP server IP off blacklists, and lost.You can do everything possible, have a perfectly clean IP, have a good amount of outbound email traffic, only send transactional email, etc. Still, there will be edge cases where email does not go through. AT&amp;T email servers would constantly blacklist me and not respond to requests to remove me, gmail/yahoo/outlook would silently put emails in the spam folder, and companies using email firewall products would blacklist me, with an IT Dept too inept to fix it.The solution was to pay a small fee and proxy all outbound email through a transactional SMTP sender, like Postmark or Mailgun. It&#39;s easy to do, with one line of code in Postfix. You can be selective, and only proxy emails sent to certain troublesome domains. If you try an email provider and it&#39;s not working out, it&#39;s one line of code to change to another provider.This allows me to still manage nearly all aspects of hosting my email server and control my email data, while not dealing with deliverability issues. I use Postmark and I have not dealt with a deliverability issue in two years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m dealing with this right now.Both my personal domain and rsync.net are on a distinct subnet, but that subnet is smaller than a /24 and someone on a different subnet has, apparently, behaved badly.Enter &#34;abusix&#34; ...One of my engineers had an enlightening webchat with one of their engineers where we were shown the &#34;offending&#34; IP and it was explained that they have no ability to distinguish subnets (and no interest in doing so).  So if you&#39;re not wasting an entire /24 (we only need ~10 IPs at this location) you&#39;re in danger of this misclassification.We were also informed that our normal, business communications with paying customers should have unsubscribe notices appended to them.  Which is to say, you&#39;re a paying customer of a service and we send you some kind of alert or critical announcement ... and it should have an unsubscribe link.Unbelievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spam blocklists are run by an unaccountable cowboy cult that somehow has managed to consolidate a ton of power simply for the fact that most people who run email inbox services didn&#39;t want to deal with the problem of spam, so they were more than willing to just hand over anti-spam &#34;enforcement&#34; to anyone who was allegedly doing &#34;what was best for the internet.&#34; There&#39;s no check on these people who run these blacklists, and the system they&#39;ve built is entirely a black box, antithetical to the principles of the open internet. And if you&#39;re not a huge corporation that can afford professional management of your email deliverability, good luck – the individuals and small organizations are just out of luck. It&#39;s a miserable racket and for what?If you want to know why there&#39;s a new thread each week on HN about why it&#39;s impossible to host your own email service, this is why."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember that when I worked at Google about a decade ago, there was this common saying:&#34;If the first version of your shell script is more than five lines long, you should have written it in Python.&#34;I think there&#39;s a lot of truth in that. None of the examples presented in the article look better than had they been written in some existing scripting/programming language. In fact, had they been written in Python or Javascript, it would have been far more obvious what the resulting output would have been, considering that those languages already use {} for objects and [] for lists.For example, take this example:    jo -p name=JP object=$(jo fruit=Orange point=$(jo x=10 y=20) number=17) sunday=false

In Python you would write it like this:    json.dumps({&#34;name&#34;: &#34;JP&#34;, &#34;object&#34;: {&#34;fruit&#34;: &#34;Orange&#34;, &#34;point&#34;: {&#34;x&#34;: 10, &#34;y&#34;: 20}, &#34;number&#34;: 17}, &#34;sunday&#34;: False})

Only a bit more code, but at least it won&#39;t suffer from the Norway problem. Even though Python isn&#39;t the fastest language out there, it&#39;s likely still faster than the shell command above. There is no need to construct a fork bomb just to generate some JSON."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago I wrote zsh helper [1] that uses jo to quickly construct complex JSON requests, mainly for testing and quering services from console.Paired with httpie [2] aliases [3] it produces concise APL-like syntax:  POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=j`a=b c=`e=3` l=`*1 2 3``

Which translates to:  http POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=&#34;$(jo a=b c=&#34;$(jo e=3)&#34; l=&#34;$(jo -a 1 2 3)&#34;)&#34;

Or, in other words, sending POST with the following body:  {&#34;a&#34;:&#34;b&#34;,&#34;c&#34;:{&#34;e&#34;:3},&#34;l&#34;:[1,2,3]}

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it, very concise but retains all the features you need.`jq` can construct JSON &#34;safely&#34; from shell constructs, but is rather more verbose - e.g. with the same examples:        $ jq -n --arg name Jane &#39;{&#34;name&#34;:$name}&#39;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lat/Lon is really the standard. The fact that some software internally represents it as Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a settled issue. If you look up the coordinate of a location - it&#39;s always in Lat/Long. You can&#39;t rewrite all the books and change all the maps to make it nicer for programmersAs the linked post says, Lon/Lat is generally easier to deal with b/c it matches to X/Y (and the North/Up way we look at maps). But you still have annoyances. For instance Lon goes 0-360 but Lat goes -90 to 90. This is also mathematically inconvenientAdd on top of that the X-Y coordinate on images generally have the X flipped and starting at the top left corner. So changing to Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t fix everything.What I personally lean towards now is converting everything on read-in to a South/East coordinate system so it matches the flipped X-Y of images (like GeoTIFFs) and just always working in that system. Image manipulation, drawing to screen, output etc. - those systems/libraries I can&#39;t really modify myself. Everything else I can manipulate in whatever coordinate system I want. So it makes sense to choose the most convenient. Plus only dealing with positive coordinates is a big plus.That all said, I&#39;m a total noob and I have no &#34;geospatial&#34; background (just writing some software to deal with rain data right now) So this isn&#39;t pro advice.  I&#39;d just be curious what others think"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of two days of bug fixing, after our Python mapping tool suddenly returned bogus data, without any change in the code base.Turns out, we did not pin the pyproj library [1] and they introduced a switch from lon-lat to lat-lon order, per default.It was possible to retain the old behavior with `always_xy: bool = False`. I saw hundrets of similar reports, who knows how many users were effected. Conclusions, a) Always pin your dependencies, b) explicit is better than implicit.Besides, I have a personal, subjective preference for lon-lat, but I understood the lat-lng order to be the officially accepted norm.[1]: https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/proj.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Latitude historically comes first when spoken or written because of the rule of ablaut reduplication, which makes it more natural for the &#39;a&#39; sound to come before the &#39;o&#39; sound when using phrases like this.  For instance, &#39;bish, bash, bosh&#39; sound natural/correct, but &#39;bosh, bash, bish&#39; sounds wrong.I get the order wrong when working with geojson with embarrassing frequency...http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/a-hotchpotch-of-redup..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is almost exactly my life, shifted by a decade.The problem is that by 35 you can&#39;t get by on novelty anymore because you&#39;ve seen some version of everything there is to see.The worst thing you can do is pine for the good old days. They aren&#39;t coming back. And they weren&#39;t that good anyway. Your best times are ahead if you can successfully adjust.What worked for me was putting down roots. I resisted it mightily at first because I wanted to stay mentally 25 forever. Now I see that getting married and having a couple of kids was the right thing to do. It forced me to become more flexible, more deliberate, more focused and have more stamina to do hard thingsI&#39;m a loner by nature, so I can&#39;t imagine where I&#39;d be if I hadn&#39;t settled down. I just know it wouldn&#39;t be as good.Once you&#39;ve got those roots down, life will lead you to what you should do next. Maybe being a full time parent, maybe learning to sail, maybe more successful entrepreneurship. Who knows...EDIT: I don&#39;t mean to imply that everyone needs a family. What&#39;s important is to start living for others to some degree. Hedonism has famously bad diminishing returns.Some people choose to do lots of volunteering or switch careers to social work. There&#39;s lots of options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m 58. Everything IS an different iteration of the same thing. Generally, if intelligent adults are involved, there are likely to be some useful new things in the new iteration, small improvements.  On rare occasion, there are massive changes that only become apparent later. (Like when transistors first appeared, they wore out, like tubes, but slower... germanium was replaced by silicon, and lifetimes tended towards infinity, and then integrated circuit appeared)You&#39;re not too old to have a social life... that happens once you&#39;re in a nursing home, and have worn out the good will of the staff. Up until that point, there are always new friendships and relationships to be had.Going out to parties and drinking until morning is a lot harder on you than it was, that&#39;s a normal part of growing up. There are plenty of other things to do that are far more rewarding if you give yourself time to grow into them (and Covid rules don&#39;t prohibit them)If you need a hobby, I suggest machining.  Challenge yourself to make 1000 of some everyday hardware store item, like a 1/4&#34; 10-24 x 2&#34; screw, Flat head.  You&#39;ll learn a lot of interesting history, and grow to appreciate the supply chain, along the way.Note: Outside of the US, maybe some M8 Torx screws instead? You&#39;ll learn about Rotary Broaching, or cold heading, along the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mourning the loss of one’s youth is pretty typical. You lose a step. You didn’t do what you hoped you would do. You wasted your time. So forth and so on.Don’t worry. It gets better. This is all part of the process of life.My recommendation is that you read Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”I’m 52 here. I was a prolific programmer in my 20s. A go-go marketer in my 30s. For the last 10 years, I’ve run a business that I love with two partners who have taken advantage of me at every turn. The last two years neither has worked and yet they get paid.Do I feel lost or depressed? Absolutely not.I love life. I have an amazing family to whom I am utterly devoted. I volunteer for stuff. I do cool things every day. If I feel bored, I make things with my hands or engage in other creative pursuits. I focus on the moment and others more than anything else and all the rest just goes away.How is this possible? I’ve filled my life with reasons to live.In fact, I have so many now that there is no room for worry about what I have and haven’t done. And in doing so, I realize that none of that matters anyway.My mom died at 52 after taking a header down a flight of stairs. My grandfather died at 56 after getting stabbed in the belly by my grandmother (she was psychotic).Our naked existence is laughable. Everything can be lost in an instant.Dive into the why and you can deal with any how."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The output is very polished and fast, I like it a lot.
Unfortunately it&#39;s not technically a single file as it depends on code downloaded from their server, therefore it can&#39;t be deployed locally without Internet connection.From the forum:&#34;In terms of license, you don&#39;t need an internet connection. However, Files app loads it&#39;s own Javascript, CSS and several plugins from CDN (jsdelivr.com), and this requires internet. We already have a request to allow serving all assets locally (as an option), although in your case that might not be practical as this means Files app is essentially no longer a&#34;single file&#34;, but multiple files that you need to be included with each installation (although you could assign a global path perhaps). In any case, for now it&#39;s not possible to load Files app without internet.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, Files app DEVELOPER here. Someone notified me that the app had been posted here. A lot of negative comments, which I don&#39;t have a problem with, but I can perhaps clarify a few things.About Files app not being &#34;single file&#34; because it loads JS/CSS resources from the CDN (internet). That is of course a correct observation, and this is already noted on the website. From an operational perspective, there is only one file to download/move/install, and from a functional perspective for the vast majority, it will be viewed in browser with an active internet connection. Furthermore, it was INTENDED BY DESIGN to load all JS/CSS from CDN, because ultimately it improves the user-experience, and makes it plausible to make an app like this wrapped into a single index.php file.It&#39;s not reasonable to add ALL Javascript/CSS directly into the index.php file. PHP is only 10% of the codebase, and it would bloat the file to insane dimensions and make it difficult to maintain. JS/CSS is loaded from CDN service jsdelivr.com, with multi-level redundancy (Amazon, Cloudfront, Cloudflare), and will load faster and cache more effectively than anything served from within the index.php app on your own server. Furthermore, some plugins are served on-demand, for example when browser needs a &#34;polyfill&#34; or for specific features. For functional reasons, benefiting the vast majority who do not care how/where the JS/CSS is loaded from, JS and CSS files are therefore served from CDN. If this does not suit you, nobody has any problem with that.Does anyone have any examples of any other single-file app with a comprehensive interface like Files app that is entirely self-contained?There will be a future release where you can assign all scripts/css to be loaded from local path, but then of course all these files will need to be installed alongside Files app index.php. We will NOT be adding all JS/CSS directly into the index.php file.About license, as stated on the website, you can use it as a file viewer for free (with the nag). If you want to remove the nag and use it as a file manager, license is required. Those who expect apps like this to be entirely free with updates and support, are living in dream land. It&#39;s hardly worthwhile in the first place. There are loads of other free apps, and if you can&#39;t see any difference, then your choice is easy.I have noted comments about license info being unclear, thanks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a lot of work on microbiome and cancer immunotherapy... the latest study in the field published in the most prestigious journal there is [1] seemed to show that fibre intake was more important than any specific microbe. In fact they found that eating more fibre and taking probiotics resulted in worse outcomes than just eating more fibre alone. This was recapitulated in a mouse model:&gt; Together, these data have important implications. We show that dietary fiber and probiotic use, factors known to affect the gut microbiome, are associated with differential outcomes to ICB. Although causality cannot be addressed from the observational human cohort, where unmeasured confounders may exist, our preclinical models support the hypothesis that dietary fiber and probiotics modulate the microbiome and that antitumor immunity is impaired in mice receiving a low-fiber diet and in those receiving probiotics—with suppression of intratumoral IFN-γ T cell responses in both cases.It would be a bit disappointing if the final conclusion from all this microbiome work was &#39;Eat more vegetables&#39;...[1] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz7015"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just another data point, but my journey through digestive issues and recovery was kicked off by the worst depression and burnout I ever experienced, which started in 2019 and lasted 3 years.My best guess for what happened is that work stress, excessive celebration and coping with the cognitive dissonance of the pre-COVID era and subsequent pandemic, combined with overtraining and the misuse of protein shakes in place of food, left me in a chronically dehydrated state. The body tries to collect moisture from the gut, which opens an opportunity for bacteria to get into the body cavity and blood, which is colloquially called leaky gut. This sets off food sensitivities and eventually an autoimmune condition/response to lectins, gluten, etc, which have proteins similar to linings in the body, joints and thyroid. Then a cascade happens where everything goes out of whack quickly. In my case, I went from being in the best shape of my life, the strongest I had ever been in the gym, to barely able to get out of bed in the morning. In other people, it might present as chronic fatigue, arthritis, etc.I didn&#39;t really believe any of this in 2018, and my meal plan then consisted entirely of everything that I can&#39;t eat today. So I consider what people say politely, but for the most part, they have absolutely no idea what they&#39;re talking about. This experience has made stuff like GMO foods sound absolutely insane to me. Like, why would we ever taint our food supply to make food 5 cents cheaper or &#34;feed the world&#34; when we&#39;ve been operating under artificial scarcity since the end of the second world war? It&#39;s all a crock.Every time you eat inflammatory food, the risk is similar to smoking a cigarette. Probably nothing will happen, but if it sets off your immune system, you may wake up one morning chronically depressed and/or unable to eat something that you rely upon. It got me after I turned 40, YMMV."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"And well deserved, too! I was pretty much done with console gaming after the Wii. That was the most excited I ever was for a console (since I was 13), but after the launch, I never played it nearly as much as my GameCube.I played about 5 games on my Wii U, and didn&#39;t even plan on getting a Switch, but my oh my could I have not been more wrong! I think the portability and the power to run pretty much any modern game (albeit with worse graphics) was a true winning combo.Also, I was just thinking today how it&#39;s crazy that Nintendo has been the dominant portable console maker basically since the Gameboy in 1989. There were some competitors, but nothing ever took the throne, just 33 years of being the King. Really impressive!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nintendo has finally sued too many smart people, and shut down too many fan projects. I can no longer support their bad behaviour so I can&#39;t support the Switch. I know they&#39;ve been bad actors in that space for a long time but I guess I&#39;ve just gotten old enough to see past my nostalgia.Also the quality of the switch is below my expectations. My NES controller still works, but my joycons are dead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Among my children&#39;s friends, I don&#39;t know of _any_ who own a console that isn&#39;t a Switch. The PS5 is basically impossible to procure, and the XBox just doesn&#39;t seem to appeal to the child-age market.So I&#39;m a little surprised that it has taken it this long to outsell the Wii; but then again, more children appear to play on a hand-me-down phone than play on a Switch."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, I thought I would resurrect my HN account for this.I wrote this article a little over a decade ago, when I was still in college, and I knew almost nothing about the world. (I still don&#39;t, but I didn&#39;t then, either) It&#39;s fun to see that it still resonates with people despite the naivety and the slight sense of &#34;I am headed for success&#34; that makes it hard for me to re-read.My initial reflection on the article was that I had fallen off the &#34;do things, tell people&#34; wagon a little bit, having let go of my twitter account and with it much of the easiest path to doing things and telling people. I still work in tech but I haven&#39;t created anything I&#39;m particularly excited about in a good while, so I felt that I was failing my own ideal.Then, of course, I remembered that I hiked all of Ireland&#39;s long-distance trails (https://toughsoles.ie) and have a reasonably successful, if niche, youtube channel (https://youtube.com/toughsoles). Funny that my mindset, especially regarding this article, is so tech-focused that I automatically discount something I&#39;ve been doing for five years.All that said, I&#39;m starting to look for new opportunities in the larger-than-startup space. Shoot me an email at carl@flax.ie and let&#39;s chat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually very good advice from personal experience.The best career results (promotions) I have seen came from people who built a prototype of some sort then evangelized it, even if it wasn’t necessarily a complete product, often just a good prototype.First example: This guy took the Intel Edison and built a pretty cool project and brought it to our maker faire events. He ended up in conversation with the CEO of some company and ended up landing a $500K exec job. Just from building a skateboard hack and trying to tell people about it.Second: I knew a guy who built this neat prototype of a compute service and then did a keynote talk at a Meetup. It didn’t really work as a product but the website was convincing. It was enough to “get bought” by a major tech co and land him a CTO job.Another time I saw a guy leave a FAANG and build a compelling IoT type project in three months. Again, he ended up with a CTO level job after a few months.My take away is if you want an executive job, build something somewhat cool, even as a prototype, and go try to sell it for real. Even if you don’t raise any money or make it work as a business it is often way better than submitting resumes.There is something much more powerful about creating something that generates a lot of engagement and conversation, even if it is only half baked but looks decent and your storytelling is compelling.This isn’t interviewing it’s auditioning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alexa… what is &#34;survivorship bias&#34;?Implicit in this argument is that you need to build the right thing and talk to the right people.I&#39;ve been to industry events where I&#39;ve seen people give &#34;career limiting&#34; presentations on something awful they&#39;ve built. And I&#39;ve seen great people stuck in a corner with the worst kind of industry fraudster.Sure, you&#39;ve got to kiss a lot of frogs to meet your prince. But you also have to remmeber that you might end up kissing a poisonous one in the meantime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Last night I watched a YouTube video that had a song in the background that I hadn&#39;t heard but really liked. I pulled up Shazam but it didn&#39;t recognize the song, so I took to Google. I entered the lyric and added the search terms &#34;lyrics&#34; and &#34;r&amp;b&#34; at the end. Google returned 4 YouTube videos to songs that didn&#39;t contain the lyric, a link to a Boyz II Men song on Genius that didn&#39;t contain the lyric (good job Google, you know an R&amp;B band), a link to peterbe.com to find a song by lyrics, and a bunch of other useless links. I clicked on to page 2, which hilariously presented 3 of the 4 YouTube videos that were on page 1.I was immediately turned off, so I pulled up DuckDuckGo and Bing, entered the same exact query, and both engines returned the song I was looking for in the first result. I laughed out loud.I then thought to myself, &#34;I wonder how many pages I would have had to flip through in Google to find this result.&#34; Eventually, I found it. It was the 68th result on page 7."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just gonna throw this out there as I&#39;m noticing it more and more at this point since switching languages.What the actual F has happened to google search results for programming issues?I used to be able to google a question and get, more or less, a right answer from a forum or stack overflow.Recently, many coding tutorial websites have clearly figured out how to hack googles pageranks and now instead of one &#39;right enough answer&#39;, its 5 clone &#39;tutorial&#39; websites, with all the same crappy answer that isn&#39;t actually what I was asking. Like I can&#39;t use google for coding questions any more. Not like I was able to previously. Also, Stackoverflow with bangs from ddg are broken and it thinks I&#39;m a robot. No answer except to go to SO directly and search."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah I’ve noticed this too. But also the rest of the front page is often either seo spam (like those Pinterest links which catch whatever search term you’ve used) or shopping sites. I’ve found google search to be increasingly hostile to its customers.I guess we’re not the customers. Use duckduckgo or something else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LinkedIn probably has a net benefit for your career by keeping up to date and checking the messages once a week, but I cannot get over the awkwardness of seeing total BS stories and thousands of replies saying &#34;YES! AMEN!&#34;.&#34;I was running late to an interview this morning but stopped to help a man who fell off of his bike and fixed it up for him. Afterwards I bought him a coffee and talked about life. He mentioned how he had to go to work but was touched by meeting me, he said we had a real connection. I go to the interview and guess what! The man was my interviewer! He immediately offered me a job at 1.5m a year plus bonuses and is fast tracking me to become a regional director. Remember to be a nice human #Hashtag #Human #WEAREPEOPLE #ConnectWithMe&#34;It&#39;s just a giant circle jerk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never understood why I always got so depressed reading LinkedIn, until I read The Gervais Principle by Venkatesh Rao. And then I saw that LinkedIn consists almost entirely of clueless people talking to other clueless people, and exclusively in posturetalk (these are Rao’s terms - “clueless” means something specific). And if you haven’t read The Gervais Principle, I highly recommend it, although it may bum you out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that&#39;s been around the longest that always bugged me was:Getting endorsed for skills by people who have no ability to evaluate my competency at those skills.It&#39;s so shallow and badly designed at its job. But like every social network out there, it&#39;s buoyed by its inertia and network effects, and will last far longer than it should given its quality beyond the size of its network of users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems pretty awful to suggest that the government-managed &#39;no-fly&#39; list should be used for anything after watching how poorly it was used and abused as a security measure. But considering the airlines look to the government to solve their financial problems, it&#39;s no surprise they would look to the government to solve their passenger problems as well. I assume begging for government intervention has become an airline CEO reflex, at this point.Bureaucracy, security theater, and airline/airport ineptitude has turned flying into a painful, regrettable process. Add shrinking seat space and airport and airplane booze to the mix and you&#39;ve got a recipe for stress, discomfort, and short tempers.I suspect booze is actually the primary culprit. I&#39;ve flown a few hundred flights in my time and only witnessed two, rather tame, incidents that caused people to be kicked off flights or caused in-air arguments. In one case the culprit was very drunk. The other case the culprit was very hung over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is probably a good idea, but not as an extension of the current no-fly list, which is opaque and lacking accountability.The &#34;disruptive passenger&#34; no-fly list should have clear criteria for why people are put on it and for how long, and a clear process for challenging being incorrectly placed on the list.  Ideally this would be a bit better than having airlines collaborate amongst themselves to create their own no-fly list which can&#39;t be legally challenged because they&#39;re private organizations that can mostly do what they want.  On the other hand, being blacklisted by private companies would in some ways be less creepy/authoritarian than the no-fly lists as they exist now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is with some of the responses in this thread! I understand some cases are not so clear, but if you do something as blatant as punch a flight attendant in the face I think that’s grounds to be put on such a list. There should be a policy so that after a period (or going through some program) you could then be removed from the list though..It actually blew my mind when I heard that you could assault someone on a plane and not be instantly banned"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t really understand why anyone who claims to be a proponent of a free market economy has an issue with a private corporation deciding what type of content they want to broadcast.JR sold his catalog of intellectual property (podcast episodes) of his own free will and was paid very well for it: about $100M from what I can gather. What Spotify chooses to do with it is completely up to them, even if they bought it with the express intention of &#34;burning&#34; it all, i.e. never broadcasting it, that would still not be censorship. That would be nothing but exercising their intellectual property rights, that they paid for, just like buying the rights to a song that you hate to stop that specific recording from ever being played again is within your right, or even negotiating with the artist to never play it again.He signed a &#34;multi-year&#34; exclusive deal (the details are fuzzy, for obvious reasons) which means he sold his trademark and time for money, which is how the market works.Exactly what he sold (NDA, limitations on his speech in his free time etc.) we&#39;ll probably never know, but whoever calls this &#34;censorship&#34; needs a reality check. There exists plenty of proper censorship in the world if you look for it, and this isn&#39;t it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I speak for the majority of people here.Before the Spotify deal, you would just see couple of Joe Rogan clips on YouTube and you have sat through maybe 3-4 entire podcasts. You don&#39;t care much about MMA or you don&#39;t think comedians are that important/hypeworthy as the JRE fandom would claim.After the Spotify deal you just slowly stopped even seeing the clips because for some reason you just don&#39;t care to search for them and YouTube stopped recommending new clips.You would hear about some hot takes about Joe Rogan vs something but you just don&#39;t find it worthwhile to investigate or frankly having an opinion about them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bigger than Spotify.Rogan was a proactive person conducting open research into the world around him. When proactive people investigate things and share their findings, it now only takes a few to dislike the findings, fuss, and have the findings removed.To those that support this, I have 4 questions:1. Is disincentivising sharing knowledge really good for the world?2. Is it reasonable to expect 100% of inquiries be 100% accurate on the very first attempt?3. Is it efficient for society to repeat the same research many times since previous investigations are scrubbed from public record?4. Is it healthy for public discourse to be made less diverse and only concern &#39;safe&#39; topics?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone stuck in this dark pattern here is a trick I&#39;ve used in the past:Adobe won&#39;t let you cancel without paying the remainder of your subscription fee however you can switch to a different plan. As soon as you switch you&#39;ll have the ability to cancel your &#34;new&#34; plan within 14 days. If you cancel after 14 days they&#39;ll charge you the early termination fee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just yesterday, on a local streaming platform that has a series that I want to watch I was offered &#34;7 days free&#34;. Great, I can watch the accumulated episodes and if I still feel like watching the new ones that come weekly I can keep the subscription, right?Nope, the &#34;7 days free&#34; wasn&#39;t a a trail but 7 extra days when you purchase a full year subscription. I was considering to get a monthly subscription to try it out but since they tried to trick me into a yearly one I simply decide to Torrent the crap out of their content. Sorry not sorry.That&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s great about Apple&#39;s iAP and Apple being the handler of transactions. There&#39;s no tricks, it&#39;s standart on every app: If there&#39;s a trail period you get the trail and if not you directly start paying.  Also no tricks in the cancelation process, it&#39;s all in one place so you can review and cancel easily. You can also change plans right from the same screen. If somehow you manage to purchase something you don&#39;t want, get refunded easily.I really hope that if Apple is forced into allowing 3rd party payments, we end up getting a standardised interface like the one we have currently on Apple&#39;s platforms but with an option to choose the alternative payment method(in the same screen but a different card or account kind of thing, like choosing a card in Apple Pay)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you’re on macOS and just want a good and convenient image editor, I warmly recommend Acorn. The Muellers (owners of Flying Meat Software) have put a lot of effort to make it feel like a really solid Mac application. The price is good and from time to time they offer discounts. The whole experience reminds me of using good old Paintshop Pro back in the late 90s (^_^)Other options are Affinity Photo from Serif Ltd and Pixelmator. IMHO Acorn has much better GUI though. (FWIW, Affinity works fine on Windows too.)I realize that some people need the features from Photoshop and then I guess they have to pay the “Adobe tax”. But if you’re not a photo/graphics professional, you can come a long way with the above options.AFAIK there are also lots of good alternatives for Illustrator and InDesign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a recovering perfectionist who has read their fair share of Brene Brown, Steven Pressfield, Seth Godin, Tony Robbins, Anne Lamott, and many more.The best metaphors I&#39;ve read is in Bird by Bird. The author describes two different scenarios.The first is that perfection &amp; progress is much like driving late at night with headlights. You will only be able to see as far as your headlights allow. You might be going through a canyon, on a straight and narrow highway, or going the wrong way. But all you know for certain is what is in front of you.The second is that you have to frame your perfectionism around something. That could be your loved ones, your dreams in life, whatever. If it&#39;s always framed around your past achievements, you&#39;re comparing to the past and not to the future version of what could be. Getting clear on why you&#39;re doing it is very important.I truly believe you can devoid yourself of perfectionism. I&#39;ve gone from being afraid to publish work to the public, to only publishing in the public and shaping my work based on the imperfections being pointed out in my shitty first attempts.Your first attempt will be shitty. Your second attempt will be less shitty. Do this for long enough and you&#39;ll start to get a feel for proficiency and what others see as &#34;perfection&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mental health issues too often remain untreated among high-achievers who are able to maintain a surface appearance of holding it together.  It&#39;s a good trend that nowadays we feel able to talk more openly about struggles like this.I see myself in this article but for me, the word that was the key to find resources to get better was the broader acronym RNT, &#34;Repetitive negative thoughts&#34;.  Perfectionism themes are one common type of thought for me, but I also have several other categories that don&#39;t fit in that frame.  Two resources I found particularly useful:* https://www.amazon.com/Negative-Thoughts-Workbook-Repetitive... &#34;The Negative Thoughts Workbook&#34; A practical self-help book with chapters to work through each common category of negative thought* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672052/ &#34;Constructive and Unconstructive Repetitive Thought&#34; A survey in the clinical literature which I found particularly helpful for identifying the subset of negative thoughts which has been actually helping me.  This helped me ease up on the majority of unhelpful thoughts with greater confidence that I&#39;m still preserving the small subset of my thought pattern which has helped me succeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article. I saw myself a lot in it. I find myself on this orange site multiple times a day largely for some of the reasons outlined.&gt; She dwells in puddles for fear of the oceanwoah. Beautiful line. Great writing can really make the content more impactful. I find myself regularly absorbed in the minutia of a technology used in a project. I tell myself it&#39;s because I find the subject fascinating and knowing it deeply will make the solution (and me) better (which is partly true), but I often have that thought niggling in the back of my mind, &#34;Am I spending too long on this detail because I&#39;m avoiding tackling the bigger problem because I&#39;m worried I might fail?&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this bill is strongly opposed by the Internet Society, ACLU, CDT, and EFF, the critiques I&#39;ve read don&#39;t get much into the real &#34;why&#34; behind this legislation continuing to be pushed so forcefully. The pretext is, of course, &#34;protect the children&#34; and more generally law-and-order with a bonus side-helping of &#34;stop those awful social media giants.&#34; While these justifications are (hopefully) obvious misdirection to most, I&#39;d like to see more mainstream discussion about who this bill benefits and why. The legislation &#39;coincidentally&#39; achieves exactly the agenda proposed by the &#34;surveillance state&#34; (ie CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS, law enforcement lobby, state prosecutors, etc). While it doesn&#39;t specifically prohibit public access to encryption, it seeks to create nearly the same effect by making it legally risky for large social media and platform companies to offer end-to-end encryption as a default to law-abiding citizens. It&#39;s no accident that almost every version of the bill creates this exposure to essentially bottomless legal liability for platforms offering secure communications.Frankly, this scares the crap out of me. These people seem incapable of understanding the existential threat to free society and democracy posed by limiting everyone&#39;s ability to communicate private thoughts. While not explicitly outlawing untappable communications, it&#39;s much easier to identify who is choosing to use end-to-end encryption when it&#39;s not the typical default. This will ultimately put all of us who care about secure communications under default suspicion, whether our interest in private comms is a moral ideal, political principle or simply proper technical architecture and data hygiene. In today&#39;s multi-national environment of nation-state, criminal and privateer (NSO etc) threat actors, insecure communications over Internet infrastructure should only be seen as an ill-advised risky behavior or a technical bug."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 3 Techdirt links in the article are especially helpful for catching up.EARN IT is another skirmish in the 30+ year old Crypto Wars. For those who care about defending privacy and encryption, exhaustion is not an option.Power-hungry governments must be viewed similarly to an APT in this context. They are following their very nature, and they will never stop inventing new approaches.There is no other option except to  stay organized and always ready to engage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those living in California: https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/e-mail-meA copy of my note if you would like a template:```
Dear Senator Feinstein,I am deeply disappointed with your support of the EARN IT act and am expressing my deep concern and disapproval of such a bill.Congruent with the recent report released by Stanford, I am expressing my deep disappointment in your sponsorship of the EARN IT act. I believe it represents a fundamental undermining of citizens right to privacy through strong encryption under the extremely divisive framing of &#34;protecting the children&#34;. As a Father of two children myself, I do not believe that whatever incremental improvement to their safety, if any at all, justifies the undermining of encryption of ordinary citizens. In my opinion, this law actively undermines the fourth amendment in the digital realm and I must state that if you believe this is in my best interest, you have lost both my vote and my trust.
