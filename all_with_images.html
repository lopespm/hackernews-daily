								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For a while now, this site has felt to me like one of the last bastions of high-quality discussion on the internet. Many days, it&#39;s the first thing I open in the morning and/or the last at night, and I sure am thankful that amid the firestorm of superficial engagement maximization platforms, there&#39;s at least one site that consistently leaves me feeling more informed, enlightened, and rational. Happy Holidays, HN!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The greatest gift to my technological knowledge has been HN. The vast treasure trove of tips, tricks, tidbits, guidance, and wonder I have been given is a great thing. Though the World Wide Web has gone cold and misty in many ways, there are still many Santas riding through HN, coming down my chimney, and delivering me shiny wisdom every morning. Cheers to you all!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d just like to take a moment to say how much I appreciate HN and all the work put in by dang and the moderation team. Everyone here really cares about keeping discussions lively and respectful. This is a wonderful community to be a part of!Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would really say that &#34;running your own email&#34; is a set of things that can be done independently:- Getting your own domain and using a provider such as fastmail or proton is a first step that gives you lots of security fom arbitrary. Because you own the doorstep, you can change provider without having to inform all your contacts of the move. You&#39;re also more secure from unilateral moves from your provider.-Hosting your own mail server means that you are responsible for the persistence of your mail. It&#39;s a nice artisanal thing to do, and you may be satisfied to know that no one is reading your mail.-Sending your mail yourself is the real hard part, because you need a stable IP that is accepted as a legitimate mail sender. Moreover, you need to monitor this property in the long term. Every mail server has their own way to choose who is a legitimate mail sender, and it&#39;s an ongoing pain to check that.You&#39;re not forced to go all the way, you can simply pick a domain to secure the frontdoor, or you can host your mail server without sending mail by yourself, etc. You can also self-host, and change your mind later without much impact.I personally would incite everyone to do at least #1 for safety reasons, #2 if you want to fiddle with the system to know how it works, and to avoid #3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing running your own SMTP/IMAP protects you from is faceless lockouts. My partner was locked out of her Hotmail account and no matter how much evidence she provided Microsoft&#39;s shame-faced automated system refused to give her access. No court of appeal, nothing. Turns out she has an important email regarding her Indefinite Leave to Remain in the account containing a UAN she now needs access to in order to apply for a Biometric Residence Card to ensure she can continue to work in the UK. Fuck big email providers, I say. Legislation needs to be passed to make them accountable when locking-out users from their accounts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone should try &#34;artisanal email server&#34; using cloudron or yunohost !
the bigger problem is that &#34;authoritative&#34; email monopolies such as Gmail, 365 and the other big ones arbitrarily define and impose what is a legit email server or not and even with better score than gmail an &#34;artisanal&#34; email server can suffer from being classified into spam by the big tech players just because they can and will do anything to maintain their monopoly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HTML and CSS alone are really powerful. I decided not to use any JS on my personal site, but you can still have:+ collapsible sections with `details` and `summary`[0]+ footnotes, with navigation to/from with anchor tags. You can even apply CSS on the currently selected footnote.[1]+ Semantic web that is compatible with everything and has sensible defaults so you can focus on what you&#39;re actually doing!+ Tiny deploys and page loads. Single KBs (with brotli compression) for long blog posts. Just `scp` and Nginx keeps serving.I can&#39;t think of anything else I want. And when I think of it, I can probably build it on top.[0]: https://maddo.xxx[1]: https://maddo.xxx/thoughts/an-introduction-to-product-strate..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is something I&#39;ve always wanted for virtual textbooks. A single .html file with all the JS, CSS, images as inline data blobs, etc. For most physics, math, CS, etc books, this should be possible. It would make it trivial to download the book for offline use and share it with others. Other than the raster images, the entire content of these types of books would probably fit in a couple MB of text. The use of #anchors or other smart URL manipulation would also make it easy to share internal hyperlinks if you want to tell a friend to look at chapter/section #foo_bar of the book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, TiddlyWiki[1] has been going it for 17(!) years. It&#39;s a very mature, polished, and extensible engine for wikis, blogs, and personal knwledge bases.The entire thing (including the editor!) is a single .html file. By default, even images are embedded.For my ADHD Wiki[2], a resource that talks about ADHD with a copious amounts of relatable memes intertwined with the text, I chose to just use images in the same directory instead of embedding them; so you might need to do some work to download that page (I think File -&gt; Save as.. can give you a readable static version on some browsers).Anyway, somewhat surprising that people are stumbling into how much you can do with just one well-crafted .html file. Look ma, no node.js, no (no)SQL database, no nothing except for one file for one website (and that file isn&#39;t even that large, given what TiddlyWiki allows you to do).TiddlyWiki can be run on node.js, but I don&#39;t see much reason to. If I want to make changes, I use the built-in editor, and then the &#34;Save...&#34; button generates me the .html of the updated version. Save it over the old one, upload over ftp, done. No deployment process to speak of.And, at that, the feature set rivals (and, at times, exceeds) that of, say, Wikipedia.(And for math nerds: it supports LaTeX via a KaTeX plugin. Maybe you can&#39;t copy-paste your entire thesis, but it&#39;s pretty damn close to real-time full-featured LaTeX).[1]https://tiddlywiki.com/[2]https://romankogan.net/adhd"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“How to change your mind” by Michael Pollen.I read a lot of books, and this is one that caused a change in my life. The succinct summary is that psychedelics are misunderstood and there is more and more research showing their potential, especially in the treatment of trauma.I had a difficult childhood. It’s something I still struggle with personal interactions because of this, even after years of therapy. After reading Michael Pollen’s book I thought this might be something that could move the needle on my day-to-day quality of life.I found a shaman and did an 8 hour blindfolded mushroom trip. Similar to what’s outlined in the book. Previously I’ve never done anything more than weed occasionally.It had a profound impact on me. The way I describe it is like jumping off a diving board into a deep dark pool, and the pool is you. Then spending hours there.I don’t know if I’d do it again but I learnt a lot about myself. I won’t proselytize here either, because the research is still early. There’s also risk because you put a lot of trust in someone who’s there with you while you’re high. But I do recommend at least reading the book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Dispossessed, by Ursula K. Le Guin.It identified so many of the &#34;edges&#34; of society and how I think about and interact with the world, on a daily basis.Without a doubt one of the best books I&#39;ve ever read. Maybe even the best.The only other book that came close this year was Robert Sapolsky&#39;s A Primate&#39;s Memoir."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven’t finished this yet (only at the start of chapter 6) but The Scientist and Engineer’s Guide to Digital Signal Processing [0] has been excellent so far. DSP is one of the subjects I’ve wanted to learn for years but could never get my head around, mostly (I think) due to bad instructors and very math-heavy explanations. This book is finally demystifying it for me, with explanations that go for intuition over mathematical purity.The book is even freely available on the author’s site! I wish I’d found this years ago.0: https://dspguide.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Charlatans begone.  2x is a fashion statement and Ive been learning at a much faster rate for quite some time.The real answer to speed learning, is to watch the video at 200x, in a concrete room buried ten meters deep, with your nose pressed pensively to a 50&#34; flatscreen surrounded by a frigid black ocean of PA speakers and amplifiers.  Ive found that in five to seven hours, Ive fully comprehended the video as it &#34;repeats twice&#34;, ad infinitum.now, the volume is critical as it is not to concede 110db at any time.  this promotes learning at 200x the volume of the original video.  At the end of your learning session it is important to remain unclothed, as this promotes the knowledge to absorb into your body fastest whilst the room leaves you in inscrutable darkness, to succor a distant memory of the learning materials interdisciplinary themes and objectives.Once youve climbed from the pit --and washed the learning jelly from yourself--  then you will have attained full and complete knowledge of how to properly tie a tie, or water a houseplant, or whatever you should need to learn.  The pit will remain there for you should you ever dare to utter another question in wonderment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a bit puzzled by the recurring apparition of articles about learning faster on HN.I don’t think I have suffered from the speed at which material covers a subject since I left school. Finding interesting material, properly structured with a good balance of introductory and in depth coverage and giving solid insight into a topic remains challenging — it already was when I was a student to be fair. Good teaching ressources are the exception rather than the norm. Finding the time to properly conceptualise and deeply think about what I’m trying to learn has been challenging. But the speed at which I can consume teaching material is not something I remember being bothered by this past decade. Thinking about it more often than not I wish I could actually go slower rather than faster.I’m curious about how the experience of others commenters differ here as it’s obviously a topic of interest to some in this community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Note: full study PDF is on researchgate)I would take this with a giant grain of salt:1.)  N is in the hundreds of students, all with similar backgrounds - likely a highly specific population.  It may not generalize well.2.)  The videos were pretty short: 3-15 minutes long.3.)  The overall effect size is pretty miniscule - it would make little practical difference.4.)  The video topics were roman history and real estate appraisals.It will be interesting to see if this generalizes (to longer durations, more technical topics, more diverse population, etc.), but given the above I wouldn&#39;t change any personal habits based on this study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I find most amazing about it is that this has been about a decade in the making - Valve started their Linux compatibility initiative back when Microsoft threatened to hurt Steam with Windows 8 and Microsoft Store requirements.How dedicated they are to this effort is impressive - they first failed big with the Steam Machines when support was very half baked, but now they&#39;ll try again with the Deck just as compatibility is coming along much better.I guess Linux gamers can largely thank Microsoft for this one!As a Mac user I&#39;m a bit disappointed they stopped their efforts on that front, since the new processors are quite capable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Starting at Win7 the telemetry and invasive advertising ramped up to the point where I don&#39;t feel I can customize the Desktop to what I want without heavy tweaking.And if that amount of tweaking is necessary why not go Linux instead.So got rid of my Win10 install, went with KDE Neon+Steam. And now I wonder what took me so long.I haven&#39;t tested my entire Steam library yet but my top 10 games run perfectly, some times with some changes to the Proton version but beyond that even workshop mods are available.I am seriously impressed and can&#39;t imagine myself going back at all.If only Adobe would release their software in Linux, then, I could ditch MacOS too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My daily driver is Ubuntu 20.04, and I stopped dual booting with Windows back in December 2019, which up to that point had been the way I did all of my gaming.I haven&#39;t looked back since.Sure, there have been some games that haven&#39;t worked. Some of those just needed some tweaking, and for some I just waited a bit until Proton caught up. For the rest that still don&#39;t work, I am content with just shelving until such time that they work.I have been consistently surprised at what games actually work through Proton. For instance I played Titanfall 2 &amp; Battlefield 1 without any issues this year. On Linux.I probably spend around 200$ each year on video games, and this initiative by Valve will be the sole reason I will continue to do so (and not having to run a Windows instance in my home)."</p>

    Re: Unknown
    NOTICE TYPE:Other
    ACTION TAKEN:Unspecified
    Explanation of complaint
    This is NOT a notice.
    It is a PLACEHOLDER for a notice that is not yet available for viewing. 
    Do not request to view the URLs associated with this placeholder, there are none.

    Lumen has recently received, from Google, notification of a removal request
    originally sent to Google. Once that removal request has been processed by
    Google, it will have its own unique ID number, URL, date and other
    associated information, and a copy of the request will be present within
    Lumen&#39;s database.

    Thank you for your patience.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article, some 20min into the reading:&#34;...The mere existence of a separate union for Black police officers rubs many in Little Rock the wrong way. White officers, some city officials, and many white residents see the Black union as unnecessary, a stubborn refusal to move beyond the city’s ugly racial history. Black officers said that sentiment reveals a misunderstanding of why the union exists: It isn’t to win special rights for Black officers, they said. It’s to demand they be treated equally.&#34;This passage should have been earlier in the report. Before, the report emanated a stench of trying too hard to find racism behind every rock.Instead, the reporter later describes a story of a bureaucractic racket - primarily driven by state powers and labor, to promote corruption &amp; nepotism, which has disproportionately impacted black officers."</p>

The 80s and 90s don&#39;t seem that long ago (to those of us who were around), but it&#39;s easy to forget people back then didn&#39;t have the sophisticated tools we have today. That said, people did have tools, so it&#39;s awesome to be able to get a glimpse into the workflow of folks back then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When writing a DMG emulator I thought about how these tiny sprites are often similar. A sprite will be a series of bytes with an address to the beginning.It got me thinking about a kind of compression algorithm could find byte overlaps and re-pack the sprites, and then adjust the addresses.This got me thinking: are there any compression algorithms that do not require decompression? You pack them once and then just point at slices.Then this got me thinking: is that just what unzipping is doing, just eagerly?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The key to this solution isn’t really the .txt file or the formatting.It’s the ritual. Any productivity system can be made to work once it becomes a habit and therefore your default action.I think .txt files or Org mode are attractive to devs because they feel like something we’d be doing anyway during our day. the same system will work with a paper journal or even a fresh piece of paper every morning if, and only if, it can be integrated into your natural daily workflow as an automatic habit. I personally found that paper is better for me because I get to it before unlocking my computer and being confronted with work and communications and notifications that compete with it. However, I have a lot of peers who couldn’t hang on to a paper journal or TODO list during the day if they tried, so digital formats win.The real key is to make it a habit and learn to stick with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always kept a text file or spreadsheet of things to do, priorities, etc... My biggest problem isn&#39;t keeping a list and getting organized, it&#39;s remembering to look at my list. I tend to space out for days working on a problem and forget to look at my list.I&#39;ve experienced a big productivity boost by using the desktop background of my 43&#34; monitor as a whiteboard (blackboard actually). I have an jpg the size of my monitor that I jot things down on as text on the image. I can store meaningful small images the trigger my memory to do something. I&#39;ve become so used to visually thinking about what I&#39;m doing that I switched my text file todo list to markdown so I could store images in it.It&#39;s surprisingly quick to keep my large jpg open in paint and jot or paste things to it and then reset it as the desktop background. I learned later this is called a &#34;vision board&#34;Still, I&#39;m so bad at spacing out that I need more than looking at my vision board monitor all day, so I use the Windows system scheduler to bring up a daily, weekly and monthly html file that reminds me to do things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used a plain text file for about 5-6 years before finding org-mode in 2009.  Of course, I technically still use a plain text file since that&#39;s what Org uses, just with some extra features that make organizing things specific to productivity easier.That said, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d exclusively use a plain text file or even Org if I had to break my day down into as low as 15 minute chunks like this guy.  I find the text-based approach to work best for longer-term planning/strategizing and just keeping yourself from forgetting stuff over the course of days.  It also works better if you&#39;re already on your computer and using your text editor all day and/or SSH-ing into a box with the file.  If I need to remember to make it to 4 meetings today at very specific times, something that pushes notifications and upcoming meeting warnings might accommodate that better.I&#39;ve had meeting-heavy jobs, and split off the meeting management into Outlook (or similar) with good results.  Useful info that flows out of meetings can still go into your notes to be organized later though.  Then I make my GTD list &#34;task-centric&#34;, meaning that it focuses on getting discrete activities started and completed, with less focus on times/dates.  That requires some level of freedom to manage your own time though, so it&#39;s not for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess taking some risks as I am not really authorized to use social media, but at AWS there is a sauron like focus on not letting internal engineers view customer data.  On my service we don&#39;t even have tools to do it and the security controls are very tight and getting tighter all the time.  It&#39;s a big fucking deal, if not the biggest fucking deal, besides KTLO.Posting to get ahead of some of the comment here on security posture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such concerns specifically led to my decision of only uploading sensitive data to S3 with client side encryption. Since the aws cli tool only supports server side encryption with keys stored on amazon servers (where the non-default managed keys cost like 1 USD per month), I decided to simply symmetrically encrypt the backup of my syncthing data volume with AES256 using gnupg and only then pushing it to the S3 bucket."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okay, opinions up front: I don&#39;t think this is worthy of &#34;declaring a security incident. Having some experience working behind the scenes, just because this policy was changes this way doesn&#39;t mean &#34;All AWS Support personnel had unrequited access to your S3 objects.&#34; To me, this reads as Twitter inflammatory nonsense. Here&#39;s why:* KMS Encrypted objects would not be accessible because the support personnel would need permission policies that grant `kms:decrypot` permissions to encrypted objects. The only way this could wind up happening is if you are granting the AWS Support principal access in the KMS Key Policy.* Objects with a default-deny bucket policy could not have been circumvented with the support team&#39;s escalated privilege. So if you have a policy that looks something like this, that data was not exposed:{  &#34;Action&#34;: &#34;Deny&#34;,

  &#34;NotPrincipal&#34;: [...]

}* Internal Checks. AWS has a lot of protections and checks in place to prevent their support personnel from accessing metadata about S3 objects. They don&#39;t have tools to fetch the actual objects unless your really high up the food-chain. Think like, people with a legal or security related reason to need to review data.Nevertheless, I&#39;ll share some nuggets of wisdom I&#39;ve accrued over the years, in a hopes to save y&#39;all some time:If you have an NDA with AWS, I&#39;d recommend reaching out to your TAM and asking them about what the potential exposure was; and make sure to ask about the internal access control mechanisms.But everyone who&#39;s concerned and DIDN&#39;T set up data access logging already: 1) Consider turning that on to trace potential disclosures in the future. 2) Open up a case with Premium Support under the CloudTrail, state that you have a security incident and you need to retrieve data events for the time of 2021-12-23 to 2021-12-22. If granted to you, save that sucker in S3 and query it for requests coming from `support.amazonaws.com` in Athena.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For five years, I ran a network of Twitter accounts promoting local tech events. They were (uncreatively) called the &#34;Tech Events Network&#34; and included ATXTechEvents, DENTechEvents, NYC_TechEvents, and 50+ others that would broadcast local meetups, even supporting basically unknown tech communities like Albuquerque with ABQTechEvents. All received massive traffic, engagement (RTs &amp; likes specifically), and became an active megaphone for their respective communities.. gaining almost 300k followers.More importantly, the meetups and events they tweeted saw attendance rise and more people know about them in general. It was great for everyone and I had hundreds of thank you tweets, emails, and DMs.But Twitter&#39;s repeated, bizarre, and unexplained API limitations hobbled the system more times than I can count. They&#39;d suddenly suspend one for &#34;API abuse&#34;, I&#39;d get it manually reviewed and they&#39;d release it.. only to have 10 suspended the next day. I even started asking followers to tag @TwitterSupport on our behalf and zero progress.After dozens of suspensions, I finally shut it all down. I haven&#39;t come up with a theory beyond Twitter hates tech communities but that feels off.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the last 6 years Dorsey was CEO, with final say on all corporate priorities. He could have undone this &#34;worst thing&#34; from an earlier time when he &#34;wasn&#39;t running the company&#34; in fairly short order. He didn&#39;t.Did he only come to the realization it was the &#34;worst thing&#34; after leaving the positono where he could&#39;ve fixed it?Dorsey&#39;s passing the buck here, both ways: blaming his predecessor for the error, then saddling his successor with the undone hairball task of fixing it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of months ago some colleagues and I submitted a very basic request practically begging Twitter for access to users’ follower/following graph on the new API. The use case was super-simple and obvious (allow people to import their followers into a new app) and didn’t involve any sort of data mining or spam or anything.It took days? weeks? to get a generic rejection message from a “no reply” email address. Meanwhile — much irony — A16Z can help apps like Clubhouse get super-access since they were also a huge investor in Twitter.All of this pro- and anti-web3 stuff is a sign that all of these inter-connected webs of egos in our industry are jostling for power in an ecosystem that doesn’t need them very much. Meanwhile, there are lots of people in other verticals who completely missed the boat on the web investment play who are beginning to realize this is their opportunity to jump in and scale their capital alongside the people on the ground. A major investor / operator shakeup is about to take place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun fact about SpeedCrunch history, the software descends from an off-hand blog post by Roberto Alsina, a KDE developer, complaining about KCalc usability [1]. Back then developers were often just unthinkingly cloning &#39;skeuomorphic&#39; interfaces like Apple used back then, designing user interfaces that resembled physical objects instead of taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by computers.His blog post elicited several rapid responses from developers taking his PyQt-based mockup and turning it into a &#39;real&#39; application ([2], [3]). One of those was Ariya Hidayat&#39;s &#34;SpeedCrunch&#34;, which has been actively maintained up to the present day. I can&#39;t find Ariya&#39;s original 2004 announcement, I think the original link was http://ariya.pandu.org/blog/archives/2004/10/calculator-feve... but that&#39;s dead now.But it&#39;s really neat to see how this all started from a day or two of hacking on a solution to a simple problem.[1] https://ralsina.me/stories/33.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Have to say as a football fan, it&#39;s a scandal that they&#39;re running the world cup in Qatar. A winter world cup pushes the schedules way off what&#39;s normal and traditional. That is of course not the only concern, there&#39;s also stories about dozens of people dying building these stadiums in the desert heat.There&#39;s also a heck of a lot of stories about how Qatar was able to get the world cup in the first place. It seems that FIFA isn&#39;t exactly free of corruption, which is a shame because they&#39;re supposed to be in charge of the world&#39;s favourite sport. Of course there&#39;s no accountability in any way, who even knows who their national FA rep is? I guess that&#39;s one of the perks of running a sport with that much history, people will still feel compelled to watch.One thing that&#39;s positive is that ordinary people are not ignorant about this situation. You&#39;ll find in every FB post about this there&#39;s a load of voices expressing what I&#39;ve just expressed. So whatever the Qataris think they&#39;re buying with this massive outlay, they&#39;re not getting it.On the sporting side it appears they&#39;re making a decent effort of building a home grown team that isn&#39;t going to totally embarrass them, which is quite the challenge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tendency by FIFA and especially UEFA to prioritize money for its partners and for its officials above principles and sport has turned me away from organized football. I find it repugnant that when BBC and The Guardian (among others) reported back in 2013 on Qatar’s labor conditions in sweltering heat, the deaths, and what is essentially slavery to build stadiums, it was met by the football community and larger news media with a resounding thud. It wasn’t until the last few years that footballers who had nothing to lose started to speak their minds. It’s honestly disgusting to me to the point where I don’t know when I’ll ever want to watch the World Cup or Champion’s League again.I used to get excited by these events because the sport still seemed to be prioritized and people got genuinely excited by seeing talent rise to the level. I came of age hearing just how good Messi would become after his early appearance for Argentina in 2006 I think. His rise has witnessed the transition to players representing teams and entire brands. It hardly feels like sport but lifestyle, prestige, and entertainment, something Qatar is desperately trying to purchase as their oil money starts to dry up.https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-24394971Maybe there was earlier reporting on this but this was the best I could do on my phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In August, Amnesty released a report that documented that at least 15 000 migrant workers had died since Qatar was awarded the World Cup hosting rights in 2010.&#34;If these figures are true, then no matter how &#39;successful&#39; the World Cup 2022 turns out, it will always be tainted by these shameful figures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting. GPT-J is an opensource free alternative to GPT-3 and requires at least 12.1GB memory to run the model (which is reduced from original 48GB ram). But if the model stores some kind of index and does internet searches (or hard drive) instead, then it could scale much further as there is a limit on how much memory you can use in production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A neural net with access to wikipedia is faster than than a neural net that contains Wikipedia? Seems odd to call it AI with a memory though... unless I&#39;m misunderstanding.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t seen yet, news is it was a power loss:&gt; 5:01 AM PST We can confirm a loss of power within a single data center within a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region. This is affecting availability and connectivity to EC2 instances that are part of the affected data center within the affected Availability Zone. We are also experiencing elevated RunInstance API error rates for launches within the affected Availability Zone. Connectivity and power to other data centers within the affected Availability Zone, or other Availability Zones within the US-EAST-1 Region are not affected by this issue, but we would recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) if you are able to do so. We continue to work to address the issue and restore power within the affected data center."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve built out many 42U racks in DC&#39;s in my time and there were a couple of rules that we never skipped:1. Dual power in each server/device - One PSU was powered by one outlet, the other PSU by a different one with a different source meaning that we can lose a single power supply/circuit and nothing happens
2. Dual network (at minimum) - For the same reasons as above since the switches didn&#39;t always have dual power in them.I&#39;ve only had a DC fail once when the engineer was performing work on the power circuitry for the DC and thought he was taking down one, but was in fact the wrong one and took both power circuits down at the same time.However, a power cut (in the traditional sense where the supplier has a failure so nothing comes in over the wire) should have literally zero effect!What am I missing?I&#39;ve never worked anywhere with Amazon&#39;s budget so why are they not handling this? Is it more than just the imcoming supply being down?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time a major cloud provider has an outage, Infra people and execs cry foul and say we need to move to &lt;the other one&gt;. But does anyone really have an objective measure of how clouds stack up reliability-wise? I doubt it, since outages and their effects are nuanced. The other move is that they want to go multi-cloud... But I’ve been involved in enough multi-cloud initiatives to know how much time and effort those soak up, not to mention the overhead costs of maintaining two sets of infra sub-optimally. I would say that for most businesses, these costs far exceed that occasional six-hour-long outage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an immigrant I can tell you that the USA is basically Jurassic Park. The monsters are mostly predatory companies. It can be a lot of fun but it’s very easy to do worse than die - to end up a slave for the rest of your life to one of the predators. Along with bullshit like making options trading available to kids, debt is probably one of the velociraptors.It is a trap sprung at the very start of your adult life when you’re most vulnerable, as a student loan.It’s sprung when you’ve lost your job, are vulnerable and are about to become homeless.It’s sprung when you’re already in debt and vulnerable, by other lenders.Anyone see a pattern here? Debt preys on the vulnerable, turns them into something that delivers returns for decades to the holders, and wraps all that up into tidy looking financial products.The business of debt is the financial equivalent of the US pork industry: Everyone treats it as part of American life, but the details would make most people throw up.Anyone remember microfinance? That was the same play: usury with a fresh coat of paint.I’m seeing posts here making it sound like 36% APR is acceptable. Look up usury folks. This is it. Debt that is intentionally structured so that it can never be repaid and keeps the borrower harnessed to the cart.It’s incredible how folks, particularly in the US, have become this morally uncalibrated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;A central component of LendUp’s marketing and brand identity was the “LendUp Ladder.” LendUp told consumers that by repaying loans on time and taking free courses offered through its website, consumers would move up the “LendUp Ladder” and, in turn, receive lower interest rates on future loans and access to larger loan amounts. As alleged in the complaint, in reality, as tens of thousands of LendUp’s customers climbed the “LendUp Ladder,” they failed to qualify for larger loan amounts and continued to be offered similar or higher interest rates compared to previous loans.While the initial founding direction seems well intentioned, it sounds like they were scamming customers, or unable to actually follow-through on the promise to consumers.  Glad the regulators are actually enforcing some of the rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; LendUp has been subject to multiple enforcement actions by the CFPB. In addition to ordering LendUp in 2016 to stop misrepresenting the benefits of borrowing from the company, the CFPB sued LendUp in 2020 for allegedly violating the Military Lending Act and obtained a judgment against LendUp in that action. In September 2021, the CFPB filed this third action alleging that LendUp:So YC funded a payday lender that targeted active duty military service members?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GUI algorithms like these are not well documented anywhere (except, of course, all over the web and in source code! :-) ...Would be nice to have a site, maybe a wiki, dedicated to this kind of thing.Other interesting problems in this area:* Layout algorithms* Automatic assignment of keys for navigation (for nav w/o 
using a mouse)* Popup menu prediction [1]* Text breaking / paragraph layout [2]* Etc, etc, etc ...1: https://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega...2: https://xxyxyz.org/line-breaking/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In cases when the boxes overlap, there are ways to choose an arrow which will not cross the boxes. But this is prevented by the constraint that the starting and ending points must be on the midpoint of a box edge. If the midpoint of the a given edge is occluded by a box, or occludes a box, then that edge is not considered, even though it is partially visible and has a viable point for the arrow.E.g. if we could start an arrow in the middle of the small protruding &#34;ledge&#34; of the bottom box, we could do this:    ,-------.
   :         :
   :         v
   : +----------------+
   : |                |
  +----------------+  |
  |                |--+
  |                |
  +----------------+

It&#39;s not written in stone that box-and-arrow diagrams must be connected by edge midpoints. That can&#39;t even work well any time you have multiple arrows emanating or terminating on the same edge.Very good first iteration round, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed reading this because it reminded me of a moment of hubris as junior developer. I was working with a complicated data structure I wanted to visualize, so I decided to write some quick code to basically read the data structure and output a graph as rectangles and lines connecting them.I was chastened by the complexity of just drawing the lines between boxes so that they didn&#39;t overlap (as much as possible) and were drawn on facing sides (one of the later problems discussed in the article). I don&#39;t recall how I did it, but I do remember a sudden refresher on matrix multiplication.It drove home how simple things can be more complicated than you might expect.EDIT: also, I appreciated the way the article was written. No cruft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; So I reach out to the manager and ask what is going on. This is a simple task, I said. Why does it take an entire quarter for your team to deliver? He doesn&#39;t have an answer.Your simple task, which you think would only take a few days to implement, is probably one request in a long queue of requests that team is dealing with. That means they won&#39;t be able to start on it for a long time.That team probably set up the onerous Google Docs process to gate requests because they get so many!When they do start working on your request, maybe it will only take a few days -- or maybe you underestimate the level of effort required because you are new to the company and you don&#39;t understand the complexity of the systems you are dealing with.Take this as a learning experience: don&#39;t assume that you are at a startup where people will drop everything to handle a request from you right away. Instead, assume that people are dealing with a lot of other requests, from a lot of other people. Learn how the system works, and learn how to be effective within that system.I know for sure that it&#39;s possible to be highly productive at a large company with a lot of bureaucracy -- but I also know for sure that new employees who try to bypass process and question the priorities of other teams, before they learn the ropes and build credibility and trust with other people, do not succeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Is this how it&#39;s like at all large companies?Not all, but a lot.&gt;What should I do?Short term: Mentally check out.  Embrace the Zen of just doing what&#39;s asked of you. It&#39;s not your job to be a go-getter anymore.  Half because of institutional complexity/inertia, and half because in a tall organization hierarchy the middle managers don&#39;t want anyone below them swimming outside their lane (even if it would be to their unit&#39;s benefit and they can take every ounce of credit).You&#39;ll notice that many people in this thread explaining why you shouldn&#39;t expect this or that from other teams.  And they&#39;re not wrong, but none of them are acknowledging or explaining why those reasons weren&#39;t automatically communicated in your conversation with those teams.  You&#39;re not only not seen as a problem solver anymore, you&#39;re also too low on the totem pole to be owed an explanation.So follow the official processes to adapt their system to your product, and your product to their system.  Keep your management in the loop about the time cost of both options, it&#39;s their problem to fix, not yours. Pour your mental energy into something outside work.Long term: Decide if you like being checked out or want a new job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people have talked about the issues with this post, but I wanted to call out one specific thing:    The first engineer I talk to doesn&#39;t even attempt to answer my question but redirects me to their manager. Ok, that&#39;s odd, I think, but whatever.

This is definitely not odd. The whole point of managers is that they&#39;re there to protect their engineers from getting off track with every random request that comes up. I understand that it may feel bureaucratic, but as an engineer, someone who insists on talking to me directly without going through my manager is always going to mark themselves as someone who doesn&#39;t respect my time and doesn&#39;t understand that they&#39;re not the center of my universe.This feels like a rant of someone who isn&#39;t willing to put themselves in the shoes of the other team and understand the real complexity of deploying and maintaining large infrastructure systems over long periods of time. Any &#34;small option&#34; that the deploy team adds today is most likely going to be an option that they&#39;re still maintaining 5, 10 years down the line. As the saying goes—&#34;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&#34;. In the best case, taking a few days to get the requirements right up front is (hopefully!) going to save months and months of cumulative man-hours down the road for maintaining the system later, or making future changes. In your case, if I understand right, your work got approved within *two days*—hardly an onerous wait time.I&#39;ll admit that the &#34;for compliance reasons, you can&#39;t see our codebase&#34; thing is kind of odd, and it would strike me as a bit of a red flag, but I&#39;ll also admit that, personally, if I was in that manager&#39;s shoes, I wouldn&#39;t want you anywhere near my codebase either. Just purely based on the way that you treat other engineers&#39; time as worthless &amp; fail to consider the possibility that the business has broader priorities that extend outside of your own personal tasks."</p>

They knowingly prompt up tons of fake profiles, to get you engaged. Horrifically this has lead to romance scams being the number one source of fraud in the US. I had one particularly scary experience and after that I don&#39;t use any dating apps.But it&#39;s worked out very well, I did have to move to a new city too, but I&#39;ve been able to meet so many amazing girls in real life. I&#39;m also in a much better place emotionally, if you&#39;re staring at your phone constantly waiting for box to message you, that&#39;s not good for your mind. Your mind. It makes everything 10 times of stressful, for fraction of the benefit.When I actually meet someone, It was always someone who is in their mid-20s to 30s without a job.

In a functioning marketplace, companies would be naturally incentivized to care about customers but that stops working in uncompetitive industries (which currently describes most of the economy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Co-Founder and CEO here. We started Codecademy and launched on HN 10 years ago. I&#39;m so thankful to this community for helping us to get started and to see up the momentum! We&#39;re committed to making sure that the product stays as great as the one you&#39;ve used for years (and gets even better!)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First time I ever programmed was using Codecademy around 2013.I was always an average student in school. Never had the motivation/curiosity to study since I felt it was all pointless.  Never had any programming/computer classes in school.I completed the python course that was available at the time that eventually guides you to build your own version of battleship with 2 players. It was an eye-opening experience for me.I started to view all my math/chemistry/physics problems as “programming problems”, it really made learning fun for me. My grades changed drastically for the better with little extra effort. And more importantly Im now working as a SWE years later.So thank you Codecademy :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned the very basics to become a developer from Codeacademy. Back in 2015 I was a front line support technician at a small hardware startup who did Codeacademy in my free time, which was considerable. My first daughter had just been born and that really gave me motivation to learn and achieve my full potential. My boss was the only software engineer at our company and so was often overloaded with work, so he gave me small tasks to do, starting with learning regular expressions to massage a few thousand lines of data into something useful, and then getting to make PHP edits to Wordpress, and even some Visual C++.I more than doubled my income from that job to my next job, propelling me to the middle class, and have since achieved consistently high pay raises over the last seven years without much difficulty.As someone who dropped out of high school due to family issues and lack of motivation, I hope free resources like Codeacademy always exists on the internet and will be a pathway for those who have the aptitude to learn to code. For my personally it totally transformed my life as I was basically destitute before I got my first job as a web developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, this is incredible. Can’t imagine how much work this took.Seeing this makes me think about how many modern applications could learn a few things from the old Mac OS 8/9 Human Interface Guidelines. [0][0] http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/doc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprisingly I found myself not preferring the OS 9 versions nearly as much as I thought. I have always thought of the OS 9 UI and the late &#39;90s to early 2000s as representing the peak of OS UI design before everything went skeuomorphic, but a lot of the general aesthetic of that time just doesn&#39;t seem to have aged that well.  I still miss the crisp lines and clear affordances of actual buttons and other elements of that time, but there was also a LOT of visual clutter that we no longer need. There&#39;s much to say about modern design fads, but we have also come a long way.The author has certainly done a great job of capturing the zeitgeist of the era (the garish bevels on the Spotify app are spot on!), but I would love to see how the OS 9 UI would hold up in modern times, on a retina screen with more than 256 colours, modern anti-aliased typography and much more screen real estate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"incredible work (really) but this is obviously not a realistic user experience: I can tell what&#39;s clickable on the screen easily and things are generally too consistent and simply make too much senseI mean, neat concept, but really lacking in the user hostility that today&#39;s users demand"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2020 a rash of anti-zoom propaganda that I&#39;m almost certain was driven by Microsoft led to a company-wide prohibition on using anything other than Teams &#34;for security reasons&#34; where i worked.This was, I am almost certain, inspired by Microsoft corporate sales getting their hooks into management.This was largely because of news stories like &#34;end to end encryption doesnt really work as advertised&#34; and &#34;if you leave a room password unprotected bad people will enter&#34;. The level of press coverage was off the scale compared to what Teams got for far worse issues.The vulnerabilities werent nothing but they werent even in the same ballpark as the MS teams vulnerabilities foisted on us for &#34;security reasons&#34; like this howler they tried to cover up https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-may-have-downplayed..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work with several large organisations, all using Teams.In every instance, the previous solution (Slack/Zoom/Discord) was replaced by Teams following higher management making the switch for reasons like &#34;it&#39;s included in Office 365&#34; or a new hire influencing the migration to Microsoft solutions.In every instance, the application was/is not well received by the employees - it&#39;s slow, buggy, crazy complicated and generally doesn&#39;t feel &#34;right&#34;.Microsoft is good at channeling security topics for their PR, but at the end of the day they make software, just like everybody else (and this software is subject to bugs, just like everybody else).It&#39;s really disappointing that the vulnerabilities have not yet been addressed..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One in this temperament: try accidently pasting a very large amount of data in the chatbox in Teams. Then spend the next 40 minutes re-starting Teams to try to remove the data from said box while your laptop tries to fly away and Teams keeps many processors and gigs of memory lit trying to parse your data.Microsoft should (but won&#39;t) reconsider the idea that one chatbox to rule many underlying types of software is a good idea."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s definitely a great time to build websites, but saying they _NEVER_ have been easier to make... I&#39;m not 100% sure about that.Yes, tailwind might make css a lot easier, and github copilot might make coding a lot faster... but is this really easier than in the early 90ies, when you could just type &lt;html&gt; into notepad and make a website that didn&#39;t require any CSS or images or JS or even more than just the most basic html tags?When it comes to reading a blog or article or consuming any other form of textual information on the internet - I find myself increasingly enamored with &#34;Reader View&#34; in Firefox, which basically ditches all the crap, and displays the web-page in a default-style, as if it was just the most basic html - just like that we did write in 90ies.Of course this doesn&#39;t hold true for any webApps that do more than just present textual information (and the occasional image) - but why do project like ViewPure exist? There seems to be at least some demand for getting rid of all the clutter.Is tailwind really easier to work with something like - let&#39;s say - pico.css? Of course if you want to do super-elaborate layouts, then probably yes - but if you embraced a more minimalist approach?Isn&#39;t Hacker News itself a really great example of a website that successfully uses only very basic html with very, very little styling and fancy extra features?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m also developing for 25 years, I also really really like websites and coding, but not for the reasons the OP sums up. For me, it&#39;s not about all kinds of solved or unsolved technical questions.Today is a very good time to build websites, because a good website is the only way to push back to Big Tech and it&#39;s practices. Your website can be build on techniques invented in a time where the dream of the internet was not yet shattered by Big Tech.Of course you can choose to put your website on AWS and svck on the bolls of Jeff a little. But you don&#39;t have to! And that&#39;s what all kinds of young devs just miss.Oh, and RSS is not dead. Not at all (thanks WordPress, for putting a feed on every instance). RSS is the only workable way to make the web social again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Static was a fun diversion, but we&#39;re back to what works.I won&#39;t be moving away from static website. It is perfect solution for a blog/CV type thing.&gt;you might think that minutes-long build processes are normalIf compiling your static site takes minutes there is something fundamentally wrong with your site in my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not trying to defend TP-Link or anything, but I recently bought a pair of mesh router from them and they work very well.BTW, this hidden network probably uses another protocol (for the OneMesh). It is the 802.11s (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11s), that uses its own encryption method based on Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) (yeah, that is the same as WPA3, however it came before it). It shows as hidden network on Wi-Fi Analyzer, but the network is not actually hidden in the same sense of a hidden Wi-Fi network: this simple happens because 802.11s has no concept of SSID.The authentication of new devices happens when you pair a new router using the application available on Android/iOS (it has a web interface too but AFAIK it doesn&#39;t allow adding new mesh routers to the network). So it seems pretty secure for me, at least sans some security bugs that I am sure that the device should have. Doesn&#39;t bother me too much considering that most bugs that I saw on those consumer routers generally comes from the security from things like administration pages and not the Wi-Fi network itself (unless it is something like KRACK that affects all devices implementing the protocol).Yeah, it is still pretty sh*t that they enable this by default, but if the router from the author of blog post is from one of their lines of mesh routers I do think this is kinda of made by purpose, because using multiple routers devices is kinda of the idea of a mesh network."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This type of whackery is (the primary reason) why I try to buy computing devices on which I can flash a clean OS (OpenWrt/DD-WRT for routers)[1]. It sucks because it limits my choices down to a few, but at the same time I feel like I don&#39;t throw out money at abandonware.[1] don&#39;t even get me started on TP-Link releasing routers with the same name but v2/v3/2020/2021 update where it&#39;s hard to even know if I&#39;m buying the one that supports the custom OS flash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious about the &#34;Wi-Fi spam&#34; comment: even though nothing is connected to the network and it&#39;s a hidden SSID, it still has to broadcast beacons every 100ms. The 802.11 standard says beacons must be sent at the lowest rate the AP supports, so your ~350 byte beacon at 1mbps (2.4 GHz) uses around 5% of the frequency. It doesn&#39;t take many SSIDs on the same 2.4 GHz channel to make the throughput fall through the floor. Beacon spam is one of the reasons why 2.4 GHz is practically unusable in dense environments these days.Thankfully for 5 GHz this isn&#39;t as bad since the lowest rate is 6mbps and the signal penetrates less. Some routers have the option to disable 802.11b which raises the minimum 2.4 GHz beacon to 6mbps as well, but unless everyone does this it won&#39;t make much difference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This may be unpopular, but after using Kodi and similar software for many years (and enjoying it!), I just gravitated back to the basics. Want to watch a movie? Navigate to it in my file manager and play it with VLC. Music? Just use Winamp 2 or Audacious. I realized I was messing with odd HDMI passthrough issues, database issues, audio sync, broken plugins, stressing about tagging, etc etc every movie night much more than just enjoying my media. My friend (Plex and Kodi user) had the same issues, we&#39;d usually spend an entire beer at the start of the evening troubleshooting things. The most lasting thing from those days was setting up a proper NAS, first to house my media, then everything else.The main thing I miss is wireless controller support, but KDE Connect on my phone has completely obviated that. It even integrates with streaming sites, youtube, VLC, Audacious, almost everything that exposes a media API. So I can sit on my couch or walk around and control my KDE machine with minimal effort. My PC audio playback even pauses when I get a phone call. If I need more control I can use my phone&#39;s screen as a touchpad mouse. You can&#39;t easily remotely compose playlists with this setup but I usually listen album by album or on global shuffle, and that&#39;s good enough for me.Am I just old school? What are people&#39;s favorite &#34;killer apps&#34; for software like Kodi? Is it just convenience and I&#39;ve have had bad luck?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly can&#39;t keep track anymore. I&#39;ve used plex for a number of years and it&#39;s &#34;fine&#34; but they keep spending time developing things I don&#39;t want and ignoring things the community would like in an effort to &#34;go commercial&#34; and &#34;legitimatize&#34;.I want a media center that can do these things:- access from phone or tablet: remote is nice to have, but on my own network is a must- can chromecast everything- can scrape metadata reliably (I don&#39;t mind fixing a few things here and there)- supports movies, tv shows, random videos- automatic subtitle downloading- supports music formats, podcasts, and audio books and understands they are different things, and can grab them as needed- supports not only mp3s, oggs, etc. for music, but supports stuff their underlying media libraries already support like amiga mod, chiptune formats etc. (a major gripe of mine with plex). right now I need to convert to mp3 for this need, but the media libraries plex uses already supports these formats, it&#39;s just the damn gui and library indexing bits don&#39;t- support for photo libraries- ebooks, pdfs, cbz, cbr, etc. (I need extra apps for this)- emulator support would be a super sweet stretch goal- has smart tv apps would be also great, but chromecast support is fineDoes Kodi, emby, jellyfin, whatever support all this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kodi is the perfect example of how amateurs (in the good sense of the word) can make something long-lasting and provide an alternative that is better than whatever the &#34;industry&#34; wants to shove down our throats."</p>

Is it capital allocation related problems?I feel that the ability to bootstrap projects in all the large EU countries is way harder than the US, or smaller euro ones (like the Netherlands or Estonia).In Spain for example, the cost of something similar of an LLC is way higher than in the US, not to mention that you have to pay almost 400€/month (at minimum) just for owning the company as Social Security fee, even if I&#39;m also working for someone else paying my social security through my salary.It&#39;s a huge burden if you&#39;re in my situation, which is having an average salary, not a lot of savings and you don&#39;t have a family that bails you out.Also, this listing lacks a few more that I listed here: https://iagovar.com/mapas/european-web-hosting-alternatives"</p>

Well-developed capital markets for investmentSo it&#39;s an enormous, wealthy country where there is lots of investment. Obviously there are other factors but these seem blindingly obvious as starting points.I find the UK&#39;s inability to compete with the US web giants depressing. I don&#39;t like the idea of relying on a few American companies for search, cloud infra and so on. I&#39;d love to see us build a British Google for example. I don&#39;t like the guy at all, but I agree with Dominic Cummings that we should focus our efforts on something like this.I&#39;m not arguing for web service nationalism but, for economic and security reasons, way more nation states should be looking to encourage the building of their own web backbone companies. It would also be good for general Internet resiliency to not have so few companies and single points of failure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure if it&#39;s listed or not but one I&#39;m pretty happy with is smallPDF based in Switzerland. 
https://smallpdf.com/I got pissed off when I wanted to rotate a PDF 90 degrees on my dad&#39;s computer and adobe wanted to charge for it, then I found that smallPDF could do that and a whole lot more like edits and signature collections. I ended up subscribing him but the free tier already does several things that adobe would charge you for so I encourage anyone to use this service."</p>

We also host regular meetups (and have hosted summits and a camp) related to the Decentralized Web.  See: https://blog.archive.org/tag/dweb/The Internet Archive also offers archive-it.org, a subscription service, for those who want a higher level of support and more features.We appreciate any support you can offer, financial and otherwise.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In a sense Microsoft forgot its own learnings. Because of exactly things like this they prevent UWP apps from connecting to localhost by default and make it very annoying to circumvent and from my experience, the circumvention is not exactly a stable setup. So they really don&#39;t want you to do that, and somebody thought enough to make it extra difficult. So, they have UWP, all those well thought-out policies, then make an editor ecosystem out of web technology and throw everything out of the window. No surprise from a $T company with more teams than countries on Earth that not everything is coordinated, but they should have a guy with the required knowledge and sensibilities on any major product team. Apps installed from their &#34;store&#34; are relatively safe, but then they put a (extension) store inside their app again, which is unsafe :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Issues like this have been repeated countless times in various IDEs, debugger interfaces and local services using browser as UI. Developers need to stop using network sockets as IPC channels for local services unless browsers significantly increase the restrictions on cross site requests. Similar situation with regular CSRF attacks. And it needs to be opt out not opt in. As long it&#39;s a responsibility of developer to implement proper authentication checks for something they consider a local service vulnerabilities like this will keep appearing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m all for this if the person reviewing my code will know the context, history and all the details and conversations we had as a team. 
But in order for that to work, I&#39;d probably be taking most of this reviewer&#39;s time. And obviously in order for them to get up to speed with our practices, conventions, architecture, code style and whatnot, they&#39;d probably need to start by doing a whole lot of development on our project first. At least several months. They could probably not do anyone elses code review then. So we&#39;d have to pay them... one full time salary to be this coder-and-reviewer type person. I wonder what this service should be called.I think I might be onto something here. &#34;Full time developers as a service&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This entirely misses the point of code review.Say it with me: Code review is a knowledge transfer exercise.Finding bugs, security vulnerabilities, and keeping the code maintainable are merely side effects that we appreciate along the way.The primary purpose of code review is increasing the bus factor of the given piece of code and facilitating organic knowledge transfer. That&#39;s it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having on-demand engineers look at code, without broader context on the project it is in my view the same as something that can be automated either or both via static analysis and custom ci/cd workflow checks. This can probably makes sense on a project with more junior engineers where many basic improvements can be supposedly suggested without needing broader context? I would be keen on hearing the use case"</p>

And welcome Isaac, I loved his Zig+Wayland screencast [1], where he explained very engagingly how Zig is able to embrace and extend a pretty hairy C library and make it more memory safe, without forcing the implementor to rewrite or painfully try to bend it to the strict or idiosyncratic rules of the language, as it may happen with Rust or even Go.I can&#39;t wait for 1.0!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting how the three separate R/G/B images are taken independently a few ~seconds~ milliseconds apart, with a different color filter placed over the image sensor.I assume this is to maximize resolution, since no Bayer interpolation [0] is needed to  demosaic the output of a traditional image sensor that integrates the color filters onto the sensor pixels themselves. As these satellites are not intended to photograph things in motion, the color channel alignment artifacts seen here are a rare, small price to pay for vastly improved resolution and absence of demosaicing artifacts.[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m impressed more by the comments than the article itself. Some people insist they make progress and listen 3x, but nobody showed any practical measurements of own skills.A personal example: I used to listen to a famous linguist, and everything seemed nice and clear, but then I decided to go in details on one particular question (I think accentuantion), and opened his book. It was like if you showed your programming code to a farmer: incomprehensible stream of linguistic terms. My complacency was shattered in 1 minute.There&#39;s some scientific evidence as well:1. Lectures are proved to be a bad way to learn things. https://www.science.org/content/article/lectures-arent-just-...2. A nice experiment showing that if you enjoy a lesson, it usually means you make no progress, meanwhile hard practice actually does make you progress: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251I suppose, those who insist they learn something, do make progress at memorizing trivia, but not at practical skills or any systematic understanding.This kind of knowledge feels firm only until it&#39;s tested by practical task or by serious questioning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get the point you&#39;re making - but honestly I have to raise the counter argument, which I think is equally valid. Take for example, the average lecture video. The information density is so low, that I&#39;d imagine that a 60 minute video could be compressed into 10-12 minutes without any loss of information. It really depends on what you&#39;re listening to/watching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The few podcasts I listen to, I do so in 0.2x speed or even less. Not by slowing the playback speed, obviously, but by pausing and rewinding very often to think about what has been said and even take notes if I find something that resonates with me.Most podcasts though I listen to at infinite speed, meaning I don&#39;t listen to them at all. You can go through them 2-3x speed because there&#39;s really nothing there.It&#39;s like code: if it&#39;s boilerplate you can just skim it but if it&#39;s really doing something you have to read it slowly multiple times. And just like the saying: nothing of value is easily gained.If you find yourself speeding though things - in general, not just podcasts - I would ask myself if they&#39;re worth doing at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My family used to do this all the time when we were kids. We&#39;d go along the ditches on the side of the road and make a family outing of it on weekends. At the beach my brother and I would drag big plastic garbage bags around and collect as much as we could from people who were happy to help some kids out and also happy to be rid of the bottles and cans. You could make some decent coin at it, but that was also in the 80s when 5c a can and 10-20c a bottle was worth something.It gets into your bones. Even today with 25 years software dev experience under my belt, I still feel the twitch whenever I see a discarded bottle or can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not thought about collecting cans in a very long time. Decades ago you could make a decent bit of cash collecting aluminum cans. It was a common past time for poor people and undoubtedly contributed to the very high recycle rate for aluminum since it was a source of income for many people. This was widely known, so people would often go out of their way to make their aluminum trash easily available to be collected. It was kind of low-key charity of sorts.At some point this just kind of dried up. I suspect it coincided with municipalities selling the rights to collect recyclables to waste management companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a story of a man who collected cans and bottles for cash and invested the money he got in the stock market, he died a millionaire.&#34;Curt Degerman, known to many as &#34;Tin Can Curt,&#34; Degerman spent nearly 30 years roaming the streets of Skelleftea in northern Sweden collecting tin cans and bottles for cash. Those who passed him by simply assumed he was another ordinary street bum.But to the surpise of many, when Degerman died in 2008, he left more than $1.4 million to his cousin. In between collecting cans, Degerman spent a lot of time in his local library reading business papers and studying the stock market. &#34;He knew stocks inside and out,&#34; said his cousin.By immersing himself in an education of thrift and smart investing, Degerman used his tin-can earnings to purchase mutual funds. He bought 124 gold bars and also expanded his cash with a savings account. By riding a bicycle and not having a mortgage on his house, his savings were made even easier.But in 2008, Degerman died of a heart attack, leaving his entire estate to a cousin who had visited him regularly during his last days. He died a millionaire.&#34;Sources:https://www.nydailynews.com/news/money/tin-collector-dies-mi...https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WHB-2895https://archive.md/kB5F4"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am not sure how relevant this is, but I recently published a proof a concept library  that converts SVG documents into simulated machines. See the link below.https://www.getlazarus.org/videos/physics/blueprint/The rendering in my library relies upon OpenGL and the NanoVG library. My library is called Tiny Sim. All of these nano tiny and vg names seem to be colliding adding a bit of confusion in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A small nitpick as the resvg author: the repo located here https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg I&#39;m not sure why the author linked some random, outdated fork. If you&#39;re trying to beat SVG, you should have done a better research.But yes, SVG is extremely bloated and under-documented. Especially SVG 2. The core resvg codebase is close to 20 KLOC, while the whole package is like 50 KLOC.On the other hand, resvg is an exception, because it doesn&#39;t rely on any system and/or 3rd party libraries. 95% of the code in the final binary was written by one person (me). Not because it was strictly required, but because it was fun. resvg is basically an epitome of RIIR."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are many other popular vector graphics formats beyond those mentioned here. Lottie has already displaced SVG for animation/motion graphics, and for static content IconVG exists and is backed by Google. There&#39;s also PDF, PostScript, Flash, the glyf format in OpenType, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to think exa was a good ls replacement, but I found out that it&#39;s significantly slower than ls[0]. Heck, it&#39;s even slower than lf[1]. Quite frankly I didn&#39;t know what to think, but I removed the alias ls=exa.0: https://asciinema.org/a/454216 vs https://asciinema.org/a/4542171: https://asciinema.org/a/454213"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Non-positive opinion ahead.Personally I can’t find a use for it. Colors are so vast that I can’t figure out which means what (and they rarely play nice with a custom bg color). And then, all I have to know is whether a file is “-&gt;”, “*”, “/“ or “”. Tree+git view could be useful, if not node_modules, .git and other tree spammers. Of course there is an option to ignore, but then my .bashrc grows again while all I need in a project dir is covered by git status -s (yes I can read these capital letters since svn).It is modern in a sense of presentation, and I see how it may appeal to someone, but not in a sense of ls being old or something. It feels to me like a strange tool that does everything but nothing specifically, as if someone always wanted a nice gui file explorer, but had no courage to admit this “lameness”.Why spend your time squinting at black and white text?*I usually spend time on colored output trying to read blue/lightgreen/etc on #444, and because my b/w tools are separated by colored PS1, which emphasizes important* things like hostname, user, cwd, exitcode and puts a newline so that each command is lined up and ends with an additional \n. File being a green file or a blue dir is not as important as me patching a wrong instance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always find pitches like this a little obnoxious:&gt; You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting at black and white text?Uh, `ls` has colors, if you know how or some benevolent distro-maintainer did.Now there&#39;s a ton of value in sane defaults and cutting out cruft and targeting specific use-cases, so not here to criticize the tool, at all. Just the marketing. Why not talk about what&#39;s actually special and different about it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is news just because it&#39;s an Apple device being used for something that was already trivially possible.GPS trackers designed to be magnet-attached to a car which report their location via cell signal cost ~$20 on Amazon. You then tend to need to pay for either a SIM card or a subscription to the device maker&#39;s service 
-- bringing you up to about the cost of an AirTag. These are much harder to detect, as you might imagine.The Apple device does try to make itself less useful for abusive purposes. Nearby iPhones will notify you if there&#39;s an AirTag following you. Apple released an Android app to scan for them (manually -- it&#39;d probably be nice if they released something that did the same passive scanning as iPhones get, but there&#39;s battery trade-offs there, and obviously most people won&#39;t have that app). AirTags will also beep if they&#39;re separated from their owner.In fact, this is news we&#39;re hearing about because of the steps Apple took to make it harder to use these devices for bad purposes. The tweet author got a warning about the device following them.It&#39;s tricky to make something that lets you find where you dropped your keys while walking the dog that can&#39;t also be used for nefarious purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it’s theoretically possible that this happened, I think this particular story was made up. For a number of reasons: 1) How did the stalker know that that’s her car? She said she was on a night out. Unless she went back to her car all the time, he must have seen her arrive in it. 2) Sticking an AirTag to the inside of the front wheel well isn’t easy. There is dirt and grime there and the surfaces aren’t flat. The stalker would have had to use a very strong adhesive to make the AirTag stick while the car was moving. 3) While it’d be a smart idea to not drive home while a foreign AirTag tracks you, who is alert enough after a night out AND happens to have friends in the vicinity that you can wake up at what must have been a very late hour? 4) Her friend who found and removed the AirTag took no photo. Really?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting thing is that I have seen multiple reports of this ( think this is is the third), but in every case, they have destroyed it, lost it, or thrown it away before hand - not given it to the police.Apple can&#39;t tell who the devices is from signals in the wild, but they can figure out who it is if someone gives them the physical device. (Apple tracks the serial number of the device, and from what I understand, can provide purchaser/activator information based on the serial number)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Background: I&#39;m a qualified accountant, and have taught courses on accounting and finance.My thoughts on OP:I read through the first two parts of the first course on this site:- Part 1 Introduction to Accounting Basics, A Story for Relating to Accounting Basics- Part 2 Income StatementBased on what I read, I could not recommend this. You could get to the end of the &#39;income statement&#39; part, without encountering any definition of &#39;profit&#39;, which is the very thing that the income statement is meant to show.If you want a solid introduction to accounting, I&#39;d recommend Frank Wood&#39;s book &#34;Business Accounting 1&#34;. You don&#39;t need the latest (15th edition). The principles haven&#39;t changed. I used the 10th edition: Business Accounting Volume 1 https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0273681494/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a software engineer who moved into freelance consulting a few years ago (I do back-ends and front-ends for mobile and web, nothing finance specific other than occasional credit card payment integrations). It&#39;s been a roller-coaster in many regards and one of the highlights is having learned a lot about bookkeeping, taxes, financial planning and everything that comes with running a small business in general. (Aspects which I initially despised but now I&#39;ve accepted as necessary and doing them as routine.)During these years I started playing with the idea of training myself in basic/intermediate accounting and/or finance. The motivation is twofold: run my own business better (and maybe stop paying an accountant to do my taxes) and maybe work on software projects in finance (where I suspect there is good money to be made).I&#39;d be interested hearing stories from fellow software engineers who did similar training!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are other online resources to learn accounting. A lot of them are listed on https://hledger.org/accounting.html#accounting-links .https://www.dwmbeancounter.com/ is often mentioned on similar threads. People also like to link to beancount&#39;s manual http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/double-entry .But I agree with mindslight&#39;s comment. They all kinda suck. Reading an actual textbook like the top comment suggested is probably better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am Lithuanian; Lithuania&lt;-&gt;Taiwan&lt;-&gt;PRC conflict is frequently a topic of discussion these days among my peers.My position, shared by a few others, is that this is the next best thing that happened in Lithuania after leaving USSR: the first being joining NATO and EU in 2004.Everyone in the world can (and almost everyone do) endorse PRC. &#34;You won&#39;t get fired for picking IBM/Oracle/PRC&#34;. While very few countries have the guts and the internal political structure that allows opening a Taiwanese representative office. Lithuania shows that it prefers dealing with a country that takes the human rights into account; being the first one &#34;in the party&#34; to do so bring us significant advantages. Both Taiwanese investments and Lithuanian exports to Taiwan are picking up pace.This will hurt us in the short-term, sure. It already does: packages(/containers) from PRC are delayed or cancelled, invoices are not being paid, we are losing business there. In the long term, if we don&#39;t change our mind (not impossible), I think this is for the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Lithuanian hereMoral questions aside (as everyone here seems to focus on it), the people are split into roughly three camps: 
- Anti-vaxers: hate anything government because Vax-Pass, including the China oriented diplomacy
- Libtards: love anything government and worship the leader of the main party. They celebrate this and openly bash China because their Leader said that it is good 
- Non-involved people - worry about the economic consequences to businesses and people&#39;s lives. Most of them would have a hard time finding Taiwan (probably even China) on a blank map.In my opinion:Our Minister of Foreign Affairs went into this without really understanding what it would mean to the CCP and what possible counter-actions they can take. Lithuania was hit more than the politicians expected and we are, essentially, alone in this fight (save for endorsements and pats on the back). I guess that we will be in a pretty rough spot in short-term, while mid/long term can go either way depending on how the western powers and Taiwan will act."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks great, I love the clean GTK for this user interface. Say what you will about GTK and Gnome... for beginners on an operating system such as Ubuntu, having a consistent application concept is very important.Curious how this compares to Lutris[1]. I can see it has support for it as a runner, however as far as I can tell it achieves the same thing by maintaining separate wineprefixes.[1] https://lutris.net/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m confused...Crossover (a commercial product using Wine as its backend and contributes back to the Wine project[1]) uses the term &#34;bottles&#34; for its container-like method to install Windows apps on Linux and macOS. Is this an offshoot or extension of Crossover, or is it a blatant ripoff of their already existing service and name? Codeweavers (the makers of Crossover) have been using the term &#34;bottle&#34; in this paradigm since at least the late 2000s[2].[1] https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover#linux[2] https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/crossover-and-bottles.5..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a replacement for ye-olde PlayOnLinux, which if I ever move to Linux Desktop[0] was going to be something I would write my own tooling to replace[1].It is not clear from looking over the website, but since bottles appear closely related to Flatpak I am wondering if they support being installed to a different path than the default. Flatpak doesn&#39;t allow you to do this in a piecemeal way[2], but it does allow you to set up more than one entire Flatpak environment to different paths[3]. I&#39;m hoping bottles can at least manage that?[0] There are dozens of tools on my list for this, mostly around application and container management.[1] I am a very vocal critic of the way Linux Desktop does things, but Windows is becoming worse at an alarming rate so it will probably be the least-worst option in a few years.[2] A regression from features we had in desktop OSs since the 80s.[3] Not that any GUI frontend for it pays attention to that. sigh"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are three kinds of web developers:- Those who don&#39;t care about performance, as long as it loads within a few seconds on their own beefed up system on the LAN. This article is for them, and we can only hope they will listen.- Those who care about performance, and work for people who care. They are already doing great work (or are about to), producing those rare low-friction, high-speed, content-is-king sites which we all love.- Those who care about performance, but work for people who don&#39;t. Since the developer doesn&#39;t get to decide what to work on, they can either get cracking on feature #357, work on performance on the sly at the risk of losing their job, or quit. Not much of a choice, really, unless you have some other-worldly lax schedule and minimal oversight. And don&#39;t forget, if you are allowed to work on performance the burden is on you to prove how much faster things are with your changes (which can be really hard to show conclusively) and that your N days is worth more than Bob working N days on that sexy ticket #357.Substitute &#34;security&#34;, &#34;UX&#34;, or anything else you want for &#34;performance&#34;, it works the same way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; British soldiers in World War I were equipped with a Brodie helmet, a steel hat designed to protect its wearer from overhead blasts and shrapnel while conducting trench warfare. After its deployment, field hospitals saw an uptick in soldiers with severe head injuries.&gt; Because of the rise in injuries, British command considered going back to the drawing board with the helmet’s design. Fortunately, a statistician pointed out that the dramatic rise in hospital cases was because people were surviving injuries that previously would have killed them—before the introduction of steel the British Army used felt or leather as headwear material.I&#39;ve seen this same story except with warplanes during the War. Story goes that an allied air force tried to improve the percentage of planes that would return from a bombing raid, so they inspected returning planes, found the places where they had holes in them and added extra layers of steel to those areas for the next bomb run; but this had no improvement on the percentage of planes that returned.That is until a &#34;statistician&#34; realized that all of the places on the plane that they found holes in were actually parts of the plane that could get hit and survive and return. They then started adding extra steel to the parts of the planes they found no holes or damage assuming that if those parts were hit the plane would get shot down and not return. After this change they started seeing a dramatic increase in the amount of planes returning from a raid.Does anyone know the true source of these stories?Regardless, it really opened my eyes to how changing your perspective on the cause of the problem can help find the best solution, and to this day I still think of this story when solving a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just developers, and it&#39;s not just about speed, it&#39;s also designers / UX bods who need to heed this. My decently powered work laptop from job 1 has a fairly rubbish screen, which means that a lot of the subtle hover effects, 1 pixel light grey on lighter grey divisions and skinny fonts either aren&#39;t visible or are incredibly difficult to see. A good trick if you&#39;re working on a large, hi res screen is to have a small and crappy second monitor hooked up if you&#39;re doing any UI work so you can see what it will actually look like to a lot of your users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this sounds more like some sort of fingerprinting attempt. It good to see that random access to these kind of resources fails due to new(er) browser controls. However, this does not mean that the fingerprinting actually failed.There is probably some way to determine if the request was denied automatically by the browser or manually by the user (e.g., time to get &#34;response&#34;), which is definitely something which can be used for fingerprinting.Which reminds me of fingerprinting by tiny differences in the audio API provided by browsers [0]. Super interesting, but also a bit depressing. Also works for things like canvases and WebGL.EFF allows you to check how fingerprintable your browser is [1]. Do note that the results may not be very accurate.[0]: https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/[1]: https://coveryourtracks.eff.org"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is concerned that an ad might be able to surreptitiously turn on the camera or microphone, but these are not accessible by default. In this case, it isn&#39;t even getting as far as a permissions prompt because the default Feature Policy doesn&#39;t allow camera or mic access in cross-origin iframes. (Ex, for Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-se...)   Instead, I think the most likely thing happening here is that an advertiser is running a script that is trying to do fingerprinting, and which is blocked by the browser protection.(That it&#39;s an iframe running on https://[random].safeframe.googlesyndication.com tells us it&#39;s an ad served through Google Ad Manager, and the contents of the iframe are supplied by the advertiser.)Disclosure: I work for Google, speaking only for myself"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another subject, posted yesterday: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29599553"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people mocking the author or others for being scared and worried are basically blaming the victim here, and I would like them to stop.The nature of legal practices in the USA is such that the answers to &#34;Are you totally in the clear legally?&#34; and &#34;Will you lose significant amounts of money proving in random courts that you are in the clear legally?&#34; are often both yes.As a result, any researchers who send out thinly veiled legal threats as a &#34;research experiment&#34; are firmly in the wrong ethically, and should be called out by all the people to whom they have issued these veiled threats. Review boards that approved this experiment should be themselves subjected to an audit and potentially dissolved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone help me understand the ethical problem here? If I as an ordinary citizen contacted the webmaster with a similar worded email, the result would have been the same. The fact is that this “experiment” did not create any more or additional stress than is created for normal citizens/businesses simply engaging in normal legal activities. If submitting such a request has the potential to cause such undue stress, shouldn&#39;t society create protections or disallow such requests?Edit: It&#39;s not that hard to see that there are potentially some social problems here e.g. &#34;the message is easily construed as a legal threat&#34; or &#34;the message was mass mailed in a spam-like nature&#34;. However, my comment is in response to the title of the blog post which implies that the webmaster believes there&#39;s an ethical problem that this &#34;experiment&#34; was even run in the first place. For the purpose of this thread, assume the email was worded perfectly and the university was very thoughtful and deliberate in who they contacted. I&#39;m interested in discussing the ethics behind how a perfectly legal and reasonable thing can in one case be ethical and another case be unethical simply by virtue of the context in which the action was carried out."</p>

I can control them from Mac and Linux with hot keys that trigger the appropriate ddc commands."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lunar (https://lunar.fyi) supports up to 3 hotkeys to switch input using DDC.Also the functionality is completely free, the Pro license isn’t needed if you only switch inputs and occasionally adjust brightness or volume.This might be a more comfortable solution if your monitor allows input switching through DDC.https://static.lunar.fyi/img/input-key/1920_input-key.png"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, it is a workers market right now.Professionally there is nothing special about me except that I really enjoy working, but for the last two remote jobs, the offer letter I received was more than what I verbally agreed on with HR. Since I am also 70 years old, I take this as good evidence of how pro-worker the job market is right now.I offer free mentoring (see my web site) and always talk about the importance to having a beginner’s/learner’s mind. I think that what companies want is: prioritizing the company’s interests, being flexible, and being observant looking for opportunities to improve the business. Fairly straightforward strategy.Good luck reaching your financial goals/salary number but also please remember money isn’t everything, and is much less important than our relationships with other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You just need to apply for roles with public companies that offer liquid equity. Very few of us are getting 250k+ on base salary alone. Most of us have the salary bands you’re already in, but have additional equity pay on top. It doesn’t have to be a FAANG either. There are loads of public companies out there hiring engineers at 250k total comp."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Leverage.If your work improves the productivity of 100+ other people, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If your work saves $500k+ in annual costs, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If hiring you cripples key competitors, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If you can enable new revenues streams through knowledge that only you have, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If hiring you does not increase productivity, reduce costs, fend off competition, or bring in more revenue, then you&#39;ll be fighting an uphill battle to justify that salary. But if you do, talk about it. People gossip and those companies who have the biggest multiplier to benefit off your work will be working hard to reach you.In my opinion, remote or not is less important than you think. The key decisions will be based on whether hiring you at that price is a net positive for the company or not.EDIT: And if you&#39;re outside of the US, set up a local LLC so that US-based companies can treat you like an independent contracting business. That&#39;ll make it much easier to hire you across borders. And at that price, you can surely afford the $1000 annually for a tax advisor retainer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has lead a devops team, and still has a devops team reporting to me, I have also struggled with the idea of having a team called devops, since it does go against the devops philosophy of devs owning their software in production.However, in our case (and probably many others), our devops team is responsible for creating and maintaining the tools and processes that allow the dev teams to manage their systems in production. At a larger organization, it doesn’t make since for each individual dev team to have to create and maintain their own deployment and management systems… that would end up with a lot of duplicated effort and a wide variety of systems that would need to be maintained. Devops creates the tools and procedures, and dev teams use them.You might say this is just sysops, but I think the key difference is that the dev teams are the ones who are using the production management tools, not the sysops team. Devops is not the ones who are paged if a system has an issue, the dev team who owns it is paged. Devops is only paged if the tool that the dev team is using to handle the issue has issues itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m frankly astounded at the complexity around modern development due to dev ops and how much worse developer experience is because of it.  I used to develop in a great IDE with debugging, right click re-run failed tests, I could follow the console right there in a nice, clean window integrated with my IDE, click on stack traces, etc.Now I&#39;m running my app via multiple docker images, trying to get a buggy remote debugger protocol to work (no local variables, wtff?) where I have to coordinate the container and the IDE, command line wrangling / using print debugging in the container to chase down stuff, digging around through multiple log files, copying-and-pasting stack traces into my IDE to analyze, which kinda works in some cases since the file paths are different, and on and on.DevOps came and took my nice dev environment away, and I am mad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to basically give up my full time role as a Data Engineer who is supposed to solve &#34;big data&#34; problems (Storage, Streaming, Machine Learning pipelines) etc, and had to solely focus on DevOps because there was no other expert in the team.We (a colleague and I) basically learned Terraform, then Kubernetes, and then Helm in an extremely stressful environment. I wouldn&#39;t recommend that to most people. (Also, I can hear &#34;you don&#39;t need k8s&#34;, but tbh, it makes the difficult things possible, and that&#39;s what we needed).I&#39;ve done Ops in bare-metal environments before, and at least there, even if there were new skills to learn, the environment just wasn&#39;t so hostile for beginners, and the learning curve was simpler.The YAML (or heaven forbid, jsonnet) does *not* help. TBH, I&#39;m convinced if the IaC bits were done in a regular Java/Go/Rust SDK style instead of mixing and matching YAML glued together via labels and tags, I would have had a much easier time.The positive side of that is that now the IaC bits are mature enough that even the Data Scientists in our team write their own Terraform code, and I&#39;ve upskilled myself quite a lot. I&#39;m slowly going back to solving Storage/Data/ML issues, which I enjoy a lot more.Maybe I&#39;m just becoming a cranky Software Dev as I enter my 30s. I do _not_ enjoy reading YAML."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, the special part is truly viewing any job as just that: a job.I no longer assess my worth as a person as a function of job title, salary, or anything else.I take contracting work primarily and expect absolutely nothing more than a paycheck. Work is a transaction and I deliver what I can and am not a jerk.Almost every disposable penny goes toward physical fitness. My spouse happens to be cut from the same cloth, which is a big plus.We don&#39;t live extravagantly unless you count the money for fitness, but we consider that to be an investment and not a frivolous expense.Satisfaction in life for me comes from every angle EXCEPT my job, and that&#39;s my secret."</p>

Become an artist, author, clown, or build some awesome technical system because you want it to exist. GPL it.Don&#39;t ask for anything, especially not happiness, from your &#34;career&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will just add one point regarding health and sedentarism. Going completely remote saved about 2 hours a day from commute. This is big. This is not just 2 hours, but at the end of those 2 hours you won&#39;t be in a mood to do pretty much anything. I ended up working out for 30 mins and going on a long 90 min walk everyday. People tend to think 2 hours of physical activity is a lot and &#39;too much&#39;, but given how sitting oriented our jobs are - I don&#39;t believe this is the case. I don&#39;t even walk to get a lunch, once you wear a fitbit or some such device this becomes so clear how much of a sitting oriented life we have acquired. Also when I was monitoring weight, bp and other such parameters - nothing other than 2 hours made any dent. So 2 hours it is. Just wanted to add this perspective. Hope it helps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m going to put some of the blame on the Denver government/police for this, but not for a lack of enforcement. If your bike is impounded or stolen and recovered it is nearly impossible to retrieve it. You cannot call to see if it was picked up. You cannot look for it online. You have to show up to their sketchy office during business hours, wait in line, and ask the guy to go look through all the bikes and try to find yours. With hundreds of bikes it almost certainly will not be found.The government auctions off some of the bikes and gives or sells the rest of the bikes to charity.Two years ago my bike was locked in a location it should not have been downtown along with many other bikes. When I came back to find my bike missing the police officer said all of the bikes were impounded. I called around, went to the impound place twice.. but my bike was never found.In short, great investigation work by bike index. But their efforts are hindered by the city."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In early high school, we&#39;d ride bikes to the local coffee shop, lean them against the big windows out front and hangout. Somehow, no one noticed when mine was snatched one evening. I was pretty devastated.My grandfather drove me around the town the next day to see if I could spot it. When we were about to give up, I noticed a bike leaning along side a house near the shop. I could see it from the street. It looked exactly like mine. It had the same replacement seat and even a curly bike lock coiled around the handlebars on the same side I left it. But it had been hastily spray pained.We called the police, they arrived and a kid inside noticed the commotion and came out. They had found the bike at the shop and took it. I went to inspect it. I was very surprised when I found the small yard behind the house was packed with around fifty bikes. To the cop, I said something like, &#34;there&#39;s tons of bikes back here!&#34; I then remembered another friend had theirs stolen as well.He didn&#39;t look for himself, and said I couldn&#39;t just take the bike. There was no proof it was mine. So, I said, &#34;what if I can unlock the bike lock?&#34; I could and was allowed to take it, but it had been ruined. My prized shiny bike had been banged up and spray painted.The following week my mother read me a letter that had arrived. The town would not be prosecuting the kid. I was confused. I did nothing wrong and stayed out of trouble myself. Did their actions not warrant any consequences?My mother ended up going to the police department and insisting the town prosecute, which they ended up doing. I&#39;m not sure what happened. Did the consequences dissuade them from stealing a 51st bike? Their family had failed them, would their community? If not for religion, what hope did they have?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked to see if they have been sentenced, but instead found this about the fence of the group:&#34;Adrian Rocha Chairez is charged with 31 felony counts including racketeering. Police say he headed up an organized crime ring responsible for more than a million dollars in damaged property and stolen cars and bikes. He was indicted in Denver, where a judge set bond at $500,000.A Boulder judge knocked it down to $10,000. He walked out even after prosecutors noted he had weapons and ties to Mexico.&#34;[0] https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/12/08/boulder-pr-bonds-murr..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HN represents a wellspring of deeper reading than is generally afforded by the current entertainment cruft portals of the web - reddit, FB, insta, USA today, financial times, etc etc down to the SEO hellholes of recipe sites, youtube product placement; you get the idea.  Let&#39;s appreciate HN for the quality of reading material and its curb on our drift to the rest of the &#39;popular&#39; web.  And I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in always keeping an eye out for the next serious hub of real reading material!That said I don&#39;t read nearly as many books as I did in high school.  Books are wonderful things and can be a portal to a novel frame of mind.  But then again my life is much busier these days and there are more demands on my time which are not responsibly ignored... So I cherish HN as a flourishing intellectual community, in easily digestible chunks.  A bit like the &#34;periodical&#34; era of newspapers a century or two ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way to cure this is to develop a habit that severely limits undirected online browsing and socializing. Part of it is just an education of your own aesthetic sentiments. I read James Clear&#39;s &#34;Atomic Habits&#34; (not that this is a special book, I was just on another kick in which I really needed to improve my productivity and picked up a suggestion to use a physical counter of some kind to make a habit stick.I bought a bunch of marbles, and for every bloc of time that I avoid undirected browsing or social media use, I move a marble from one container to the other. My goal every day is to get through an arbitrary number of marbles (160 right now), after which I can do whatever. If I slip up and open a social media page, HN, or start browsing newspapers, I dump all the marbles out of the container, which generally makes it impossible to meet the day&#39;s goal unless the slipup is very early in the day.This has been nothing short of amazing for my life. One issue that I had is I had a physical twitch that would start developing after a couple minutes doing one thing, like a work project, at which I would feel the urge to check the news or social media. This twinge would show up and I would type into a browser window to relieve the sensation. Instead I more or less replaced that twinge with moving the marble from one container to the other. It&#39;s made it a lot easier to focus. Over time, I stopped caring as much about the news and became more easily satisfied by very briefly reading summaries every few days.I think a lot of web addiction is less driven by thoughts or brain issues and more by physical habits akin to nail-biting or cuticle-picking. Most of the attempts that I&#39;ve made to stop addictive behavior have not worked: they were based on schedules, timers, articulated goals, and other things like that rather than recognizing the physical trigger for the habit, the result of that trigger, and just redirecting the stimulus with another physical action rather than trying to suppress it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Socrates famously hated the written form, not because it was technologically advanced for its time, but because it was &#34;dead&#34;: you can&#39;t have a conversation with a piece of writing, or ask the author to explain something that&#39;s on the page.I disagree (and agree, indirectly, with the OP): deadness is a feature, not a bug. The problem with Internet writing is not just its addictive nature, it&#39;s groupthink. It is too much alive. You have to either follow popular opinion, or oppose it vehemently; tangential or orthogonal thinking is almost impossible.Books, because they are not part of an immediate, global conversation where people share opinions and judgements and signal their virtue to one another, are something very different and allow for a very different experience than any written text found online.Maybe books will slowly fade; but I think it&#39;s unlikely they would ever completely disappear, as they offer something unique not found anywhere else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the study&#39;s FAQ[0]:&gt; Did an Institutional Review Board consider this study?&gt; We submitted an application detailing our research methods to the Princeton University Institutional Review Board, which determined that our study does not constitute human subjects research.From the social experiment[as reported by OP&#39;s link]:&gt; I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within 45 days of this email, as required by Section 1798.130 of the California Civil Code.I&#39;m pretty sure most people would find that to be a thinly veiled threat of a lawsuit. I&#39;d like to know if the review board considered the text of the email that the &#34;researchers&#34;[1] intended to send and the fact that they were likely to send it to individuals instead of solely publicly traded companies.[0] https://archive.md/cSDGT[1] Seems to fall more under experimental psychology to me https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology?wprov=..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is interesting in the study web page (https://privacystudy.cs.princeton.edu/) that they consistently mention contacting &#34;websites&#34; instead of &#34;people.&#34; As if a website is some autonomous thing that can communicate with a researcher.I wouldn&#39;t be sleeping well if I were involved in this study. There is no way an IRB could determine that this is not human subjects research if you&#39;re emailing people and asking them anything.If I want to ask random people about the weather and publish the results in a journal, that qualifies as human subjects research and IRB protocols must be followed.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here! A few updates since this was published two years ago:- The service mentioned (now called https://webapp.io ) eventually made it into YC (S20) and still uses postgres as its pub/sub implementation, doing hundreds of thousands of messages per day. The postgres instance now runs on 32 cores and 128gb of memory and has scaled well.- We bolstered Postgres&#39;s PUBLISH with Redis pub/sub for high traffic code paths, but it&#39;s been nice having ACID guarantees as the default for less popular paths (e.g., webhook handling)- This pattern only ever caused one operational incident, where a transaction held a lock which caused the notification queue to start growing, and eventually (silently) stop sending messages, starting postgres with statement_timeout=(a few days) was enough to solve thisPrevious discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21484215Happy to answer any questions!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had thought about using postgres as a job queue before, but I couldn&#39;t figure out in my head how to make sure two processes didn&#39;t both take the same job. The &#34;FOR UPDATE&#34; and &#34;SKIP LOCKED&#34; were the keys to make this work in the article. Essentially, as far as I can tell, &#34;SELECT FOR UPDATE&#34; locks the rows as they&#39;re selected (locks are apparently visible outside the transaction), and &#34;SKIP LOCKED&#34; skips over rows for the select that other transactions have locked. Cool stuff.The below article goes over some downsides to using postgres for a job queue: namely that the data model isn&#39;t optimized to find and send new jobs to large numbers of subscribers. Actual messaging systems like Kafka/NATS are better at this.https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-lock...Also, there are things that the dedicated messaging systems give you that postgres won&#39;t, such as transparent error handling and retry logic. If your worker grabs a job from postgres and fails (in some kind of transient way such that the task should be retried), you&#39;ll have to implement the retry logic yourself. A streaming platform like Kafka or NATS will notice that you haven&#39;t acknowledged the message and deliver it to someone else.This is something you could pretty easily implement yourself with something like a process that just scans over the &#34;processing&#34; jobs and looks for timeouts, resetting them as it goes. But there are probably a few of these little papercuts that Kafka-like (…Kafkaesque?) systems would handle for you.So, I guess if you already have postgres set up in a reliable way, and there&#39;s no one around whose job it is to set up new production systems like Kafka, and you don&#39;t already have something like Kafka, and you only need basic job queue requirements or you&#39;re okay with implementing whatever you need on top of postgres yourself, and your incoming job rate is fewer than maybe a thousand per second, and you have fewer than maybe tens of consumers… postgres is probably a decent job queue.The above paragraph seems snide but it probably does describe many people&#39;s environments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the key concept here is atomicity. If some API is responsible for creating a job, storing it in the database AND publishing it can never be an atomic operation. Both the database and pub/sub servers are separate network connections from the application server. For example, if you save the record first and then publish, It&#39;s quite possibe that you save the record in the database and then lose the connection to the pub/sub server when publishing. If this happens, you can never know if the pub/sub server received the request and published it. In systems where it&#39;s critical to guarantee that a record was saved and guarantee that it was published as well, the only way to do that is by using a single external connection - in this case to a Postgres DB. We&#39;ve used the same setup on an AWS RDS t2.medium machine to process over 600 records/second."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There seem to be two camps here:- Bose is an evil megacorp who recklessly endangered its customers by selling dangerous and poorly designed products.- Accidents happen and when a device explodes on your head you should accept it as a fact of life and move on.  The chemical burns are nothing and OP is a pussy.I think the reality may be different.  My take on it is that Li batteries possess inherent dangers and it is incumbent upon manufacturers to take reasonable steps to mitigate the dangers while informing their consumers of the risk.  Unfortunately, even when presented with the risks, most folks are unable to comprehend the probabilities and consequences and will nearly always choose convenience, features and value over the avoidance of danger.  It seems we, as a society(not as individuals, as some will surely object) have chosen Li technology and deemed it safe enough to deploy ubiquitously.I hope a review of this incident will shed light on the safety practices followed by Bose and will inform future engineers of unforeseen risks, giving us all safer, convenient devices.Overall I find the discussions in this thread unbecoming of the types of folks I thought frequented HN.  I hope we can all strive to elevate the dialogue and treat each other with a moderate amount of respect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be good to see an autopsy, to find out if it&#39;s actually the battery that went into thermal runaway, or something else that shorted and dumped all of its energy.I have no idea how much heavy metals I&#39;ve been exposed to by inhaling the toxic smoke. I don&#39;t know how much smoke my pregnant wife inhaled. I worry how much chemical residue is on my desk, floor, walls, how much is getting recycled by my HVAC system, how much exposure my pets had.That sort of paranoia doesn&#39;t help. In fact it may cause psychosomatic symptoms (nocebo effect). You&#39;ve probably inhaled far worse if you&#39;ve ever been to a barbeque, gas station, or just took a walk in one of the more crowded areas of the city."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re up for it, I suggest:1) Find a lawyer. I&#39;d guess that personal injury lawyer is the right kind, and that you can easily find one who works on contingency.2) File a complaint with the consumer product safety commission, and any other applicable government agencies. The lawyer may be able to help with this.You deserve compensation for this, and I wish you all the best with extracting it. I hope you recover soon.Also: Take photos and document everything. A massive number of photos, of the damage to your house and your body and anything else you can think of. This will help with the lawyer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, I genuinely do not get the &#34;controversy&#34; over the Veritasium video. AFAIU, the entire point of the video was to show that electricity travels not through wires but via electric fields (&#34;through the air&#34; so to speak).To illustrate this, he sets up an experiment with parameters such that the conclusion can only mean that some electricity has traveled to the bulb before any could arrive through/around the wires.He sets up the parameters so that the bulb would turn on by that little electricity; but that is obviously just a visual sign, and his point is valid no matter how much electricity traveled to bulb under whatever different parameters.It kinda feels like most people are missing the actual point of the video."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first signal is a close RF transmission, billions of people rely on it everyday, a current disturbs the electromagnetic field and and an antenna, sometimes thousands of kilometers away, detects a very small variation in the field (-120dbm @ 50Ω = 0.2μV). This is how our cellphones, wifi, GPS, RFID works. So, even if you disconnect the bulb and the switch you can create  a current in the bulb by turning on and off the switch."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I picked up a Kinesis a few month ago and it&#39;s been a life changer. I&#39;ve struggled with shoulder pain since as far back as I can remember. I&#39;d done PT, dry needling, massage, etc etc. I&#39;d even sprung for a personal ergonomic assessment. I&#39;m a cyclist and and keyboard jockey, so most of my waking life is spent in positions that seemed to make it worse. At times it prevented me from sleeping, doing things I enjoyed, etc.  I wear a 42 jacket, so I&#39;m not crazy wide or anything.I&#39;d never seen anything that suggested that split keyboards were a good solve for the shoulder pain but I&#39;d reached that point of just throwing shit at a wall because it was that, or find a new career and hobbies. Moving my keyboard so my forearms can sit slightly wider than perpendicular to my chest has almost completely resolved the shoulder pain and the impact was almost immediate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to all the comments from Advantage fans here, I also wanted to add that Kinesis has been an awesome company. I tweeted about some mods I made to my Advantage keyboard a long time ago, and they invited me to their office and donated a bunch of keyboards to the nonprofit I work for, to give as prizes to students (even before they launched the gaming-focused brand)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a Kinesis user for 8 years, starting with an Advantage USB, added a classic PS2(with a usb adapter) as a backup and then was a tester for the Advantage 2 which I ended up buying. A company I worked for gave me a choice for keyboards when I joined so I tried a Ergodox EZ with the RGB backlighting.General observations:1. Overall I prefer the Advantage over the Ergodox. The big reason is the contoured design and the fact that the Ergodox tends to walk around unless you have a solid desk pad underneath it. Also, the Ergodox never felt as comfortable as the Advantage. Yes the Advantage is not as easy to travel with but still....
2. I like the new design, but there are a few things that would have made the pro perfect. PBT backlit keycaps like they offer on the Ergodox-EZ and RGB backlighting...and maybe a set of f-keys (on the fence with the last one).One other thing... A mix of o-rings and QMX clips made a huge difference with the feel of the keyboard for me. I have been a cherry brown user from the beginning though and different people have different preferences with that.Kinesis is also really good about providing parts and service. I&#39;ve had them send me replacement switches and have seen them offer up in-expensive replacement boards to repair and keep older models going.I&#39;m going to buy one of these, but given that I already have 4 high quality mechanical keyboards and I have yet to have one die I am starting to feel guilty having all of these laying around. That said there is a side of me that is curious about the Keyboard.io :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are misunderstanding this and claiming it&#39;s not problematic. Ben Torrell (an OBS developer) notes later in the thread that there is indeed GPL code compiled into TikTok&#39;s executables; since source is not available and they have not got another license, it is unlicensed and hence illegal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So people that have ripped off OBS so far and violated GPL include TikTok, StreamLabs (Logitech), and StreamElements. Any other people I missed?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In almost all cases, TikTok&#39;s offering would be considered a derived work because you cannot swap out the OBS part for another and still have it work. So they are likely in full violation unless they agree to open source all their code.Seems like a pretty open and shut case to be honest - that is, if they intend to pursue legal action and the powers that be rule appropriately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In addition to the points raised by BMJ and in the comments below, there is a limit to what independent fact checking can accomplish. For example, are their fact checkers conducting their own scientific experiments validating claims and outcomes of a scientific paper? Are fact checkers reaching out to sources from a news article and verifying quoted information? When “breaking news” or “scoops” are reported presenting totally new information about the world, how can that be verified against other information that - by virtue of something being new - cannot be verified by other preexisting sources?If the fact checking process is limited to verification based on other information that is currently available, and if the fact checking process cannot distinguish between factual information and the opinions people hold as a result of that information, the outcome will be an inevitable echo chamber that reinforces currently dominant views or whatever preexisting biases are present.In short, fact checking is hard and there is a reason why reputable publishing outlets have their own internal fact verification processes before something gets published (including safeguards and retractions, because they make mistakes too), and why news is separated out from opinion-editorial pages... even if it is in style to add opinions (read: “perspective”) to every article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This one is much trickier than it looks. Reposting user nojito&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29596111), but here in a top level comment:&gt; The fact check was correct in this instance though?&gt; https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/11/fact-check-britis...&gt; The conclusions in the original BMJ article make zero sense when actually scrutinized.&gt; https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635Please read both URLs before commenting in depth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Both Facebook (now Meta) and Youtube bungled their fact checking by disabling posts and videos that were counter to some narrative, but not factually incorrect.  That places them in a bad position, and they need to be called out publicly, as no other mechanism so far has pushed them towards more accurate fact checking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Praise, 2 suggestions and a question.Color coding OOM (order-of-magnitude) is smart, but the colors chosen seem quite hard to distinguish. Consider picking different default colors; also consider adding a redundant representation of scale, like an integer representing OOM scale.It is strange that a thoughtful design around OOM would also choose keep so many digits. If the goal is to summarize, then please throw those extra digits away. (e.g. 10.3992s is specifying the time down to the millisecond, but those extra ms are not meaningful at the second time scale.)What is this about the runtime polling tasks? Does that happen in Tokio? Why? I am only familiar with 2 async runtimes (node, vert.x) and I was under the impression that neither of these &#34;poll their threads&#34; in any meaningful way. Threads (or process or fiber or whatever you want to call it in this context) never initiate action on their own. They are ALWAYS waiting for something to happen to them, and that includes timeouts, which would be triggered by passing a thread a clock tick. The runtime&#39;s job is to centrally manage resources that must persist between thread behavior, so at most it is going to be polling external resources, and not it&#39;s own threads.Or maybe I don&#39;t understand what polling means here? I would interpret it as meaning &#34;keep checking a well-known place for changes, and then do something if a change is found&#34;. But since async threads can&#39;t initiate any change on their own, this is nonsensical."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Real wages have been flat since the 1970s (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us...). &#34;Okay, so people&#39;s living standards are about the same since 1970?&#34; Not even close. The problem with inflation is that its calculation is fraught with all kinds of selective weighting, bias, and politics. Take a look at the relative differences between the things which have decreased and increased in cost in real terms (https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/5/29/saupload_i...). Okay, so TVs and cellphones are cheaper, but necessities like college, childcare, and healthcare are up significantly.And when you drill in more, there are other issues. For example, the housing metric appears relatively flat in real terms, right? Except, that doesn&#39;t tell the story for the majority of Americans. Housing costs are WAY up in cities as Americans migrate to where the jobs are, while housing costs are down in all the areas where jobs are disappearing. In practise, housing costs are actually significantly up for most Americans, but because the CPI is calculated across the entire nation, the government can claim inflation is low. This allow them to keep the fed rate low, which keeps stock valuations high. This LOOKS great and generates great headlines, but the reality is that most Americans are significantly worse off since the 1970s.And then we come to the other elephant in the room: why are real wages flat? Given the incredible performance of the American economy since 1970, shouldn&#39;t real wages be significantly UP? This is yet another reminder that wealth is being squeezed from the bottom and funnelled straight up. As a non-American, it&#39;s heartbreaking to see efforts to unify the underclass completely derailed by this ridiculous race war. Poor people in America have FAR more in common with each other than the rich, no matter race. I really hope you all manage to set aside the obvious red herring of race and unite in tackling your staggering wealth inequality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had an all-hands meeting recently where we got to submit anonymous questions.  One of the questions was &#39;with inflation rising at 6%, will the company reconsider their &#39;standard&#39; 2% raise?&#39;  The lady answering looks dead in the camera and goes &#39;Honestly? No&#39; and goes on to talk about how we&#39;re reasonably competitive with the local market.  Hey, credit where credit is due, at least she was a refreshingly straight shooter.  It pretty much let everyone on the call know what they needed to do if they wanted a good raise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who does OK, but lives in reality (not the bay area), I feel a revolution coming.  I hope it&#39;s not a violent one, but who knows at this point.  Hopefully it&#39;s just a politician with big policy changes.People feel completely disenfranchised.  You keep hanging housing over their head but just out of reach like some baby toy, then inflation spikes everything else.  What&#39;s the point of working even?I don&#39;t know the solution, but I don&#39;t have a good feeling about the next 10 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish I could say I stopped buying things off Amazon for ethical reasons, but the truth is, I stopped buying because if you look closely at the reviews, you realize that almost everything for sale there is now a scam or a knock-off. This was a slow creep for awhile, but now the problem has grown exponentially. Amazon is what Canal Street was in the 90s - somewhere to buy fakes, stolen goods, and electronics that might catch fire.Amazon has no interest in fixing this problem, because they know that well over half their &#34;inventory&#34; is now from knockoffs, IP theft and/or bait-and-switch scams. it&#39;s almost impossible to find items there anymore that are not fake, whether it&#39;s re-packaged hard drives or &#34;pyrex&#34; bowls that explode in the microwave.One way to look at this, and the way I think Amazon must look at it, is that it&#39;s not any worse than a third world night market. The attitude of vendors in, e.g. Phnom Penh or Mexico City markets is that the very fact that stupid Americans think they&#39;re going to get &#34;real&#34; goods just proves how much they deserve to be scammed. Amazon is actually helping baffled Americans to finally understand what the third world has always known - unboxing is going to be disappointing. Everything you think is affordable is probably fake, and you can&#39;t trust the packaging. Only the rich get actual brand products. As America degrades, people will start to get more savvy and more cynical about this, but right now it&#39;s still a newish phenomenon and people are shocked, shocked! to find out the kids toys they bought are full of toxic chemicals that we ourselves shipped overseas for burial or &#34;recycling&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand what Amazon thinks it&#39;s doing with its legions of data scientists, analysts, product managers and engineers that they consider so much more important than solving this problem, which will destroy their reputation long-term and create space for a competitor.At this rate, Amazon will be on its way to becoming Yelp -- untrusted, irrelevant, ultimately deserted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally experienced this. I bookmarked a keyboard I was interested in purchasing in a month or so.

Just today in fact, I was looking for an office chair seat cushion and found a very telling reddit comment from 3 years ago[1].I know Amazon has a bulletproof return policy for the most part but I don&#39;t want to be hassled with returning everything. This just results in me just not using Amazon. You may be able to justify it for large purchases because of Amazon&#39;s return policy but for something as mundane as a can opener or seat cushion? Just shop elsewhere.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/a72co8/seat_cushi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a load of nonsense in the comments here today.* Drata is a vendor that helps a company navigate your SOC2 compliance process, by organizing all the controls and helping you gather evidence that you have done so. For instance, they&#39;ll connect with Github and make sure everyone with access to your repos is a company employee. If you don&#39;t use Drata you have to gather this evidence yourself, repeatedly over months, and it&#39;s a pain.* The Drata agent is a pretty innocuous thing. It checks you have done things like turn on disk encryption, have updates enabled, and that the screen locks if you walk away. It does NOT monitor employee&#39;s activities. These kind of security checks are incredibly common and are required for certifications like ISO27001 and SOC2. SOC2 is not really optional for large enough b2b SaaS.* The poster says &#34;Their business model (in my case) seems to be to take money from companies to spy on their employees/contractors, and then they sell the employees/contractors private information to &#34;targeted advertising&#34;.Do you have any evidence for this?? I&#39;ve just been involved in selecting Drata as a vendor for SOC2 compliance planning for our company. If this is true it&#39;s a huge deal and totally against my understanding of their business model. It honestly sounds like bullshit to me! But if you have evidence that they do this, please let us know.* As a freelancer, whether you are required to install security monitoring software is definitely an open question. If you&#39;re delivering work separately and not connected to company systems, then ok. If you&#39;re basically just acting like any other employee, and connected to the company systems, then you will probably have to do this. Because otherwise they would fail SOC2 and managing your legal status as &#34;Freelancer&#34; vs &#34;Employee&#34; (for tax reasons??) is not worth not being certified."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh this all brings back memories, of Sococo in the 2000&#39;s. We faced all these problems and had similar solutions to them all.We even had a rapidly adapting network make-and-break recovery layer. You unplug your laptop from a wired connection, switch to wireless - we recovered in milliseconds. You heard barely a click.The encryption issue is fun - we had a rotate-key message in-band. The receiver loaded new keys and tried them in sequence to ease the turnover time - out-of-order packets etc could make it ambiguous for a short while which key to use. A cache and aging keys out made it work pretty well.Remixing on user stations proved to be problematic (mentioned elsewhere on this thread). You&#39;d think if 6 people at one site were conferencing with a dozen elsewhere, you could elect one at each site to mix-and-forward. But corporate networks made it hard to determine who was &#39;adjacent&#39; - they were often layered and without uPNP (is that what the router protocol is called?) you couldn&#39;t tell if somebody at the next desk was even in your company.We had up to 100 people in a conference, and our enter-the-conference time was on the order of 100ms. Click into an all-hands, and be able to hear everybody before you finger left the mouse button. It was wonderful.Sococo today is a sad shadow of that. They went open-source and lost all our IP instantly. Just another WebRTC client last I knew."</p>

The pace at which the team advances is incredible, as it seems Apple support is minimal...Maybe the core tech users is negligible to Apple, but it shouldn&#39;t be: Winning over the power users generally precedes larger adoption and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Macs continue to gain market share in the years to come with their CPU lead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Do people regularly run into coworkers like me during their career and simply ignore it because they find it too awkward to criticize them? Have I just been incredibly lucky and every boss I have had is too incompetent to notice? Do I have imposter syndrome and I am actually a 10x developer whose laziness makes them a 1x developer?Lazy developers don&#39;t really bother me, if you do a couple hours of high-quality work a week I&#39;d have no complaint. (Many weeks I do as little, some weeks I do a decent amount of real work :) The problem is developers making negative progress, usually messes that need to be cleaned up ... and it&#39;s an awkward situation, no matter your relative authority. I&#39;m in the &#34;we should consider them lines spent, not lines produced&#34; camp.An old disputed quote:&gt; I divide my officers into four classes as follows: The clever, the industrious, the lazy, and the stupid. Each officer always possesses two of these qualities.&gt; Those who are clever and industrious I appoint to the General Staff. Use can under certain circumstances be made of those who are stupid and lazy. The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest leadership posts. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity for difficult decisions. But whoever is stupid and industrious must be got rid of, for he is too dangerous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there&#39;s also something to be said for passive processing.Sometimes I&#39;ll know I need to write some code or some function and I&#39;ll just think about it in the back of my head while doing other things, sometimes for a whole day or two. Then I&#39;ll sit down and write it in like 20-30 minutes. Did I work 20-30 minutes, or have I been working for a day or two? I would say a day or two, and the 20-30 minutes was the time needed to produce the deliverable of that work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have never done what you describe, except perhaps in times of illness when it was understood that working less was a reasonable accommodation (in that particular case, I had leftover brain fog from general anesthesia).I&#39;ve never heard of any colleagues doing it either. I would never snitch if it happened, but I would certainly consider that person untrustworthy or think that they have an undisclosed condition that is between them and HR.As you covered in your post, we don&#39;t write code 8 hours a day. This is normal. Meetings, context switch and times when focus is unachievable are expected and mostly understood by my experienced management. So are times when we are monitoring technology advancement and keeping an eye on the industry and community (e.g. lurking at HN but not overly posting and commenting) and times of social activity between workers (e.g. talking about the weekend).Most of us take mental health breaks between meetings and need to take time to think through issues. Many also need to periodically break focus to think about personal life issues or hobbies. As long as you generally strive to work, this is not a problem either.But walking into a stand-up and then lying about your day? To me, that&#39;s unethical.The real question to me is:Do you do that on purpose or is this something that happens even if you are trying to focus? There are many conditions, from stress and anxiety to diagnosed mental health issues that can prevent you from focusing. Burn-outs and bore-outs also come to mind.In my eyes, the fact that you asked the community about it shows that you have some form of concern towards that behavior. Would you say it is negatively impacting your life?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder why no one ever talks about architectures in the middle between those two - modular monoliths.The point in time where you&#39;re splitting your codebase up in modules (or maybe are a proponent of hexagonal architecture and have designed it that way from the beginning), leading to being able to put functionality behind feature flags. That way, you can still run it either as a single instance monolith, or a set of horizontally scaled instances with a few particular feature flags enabled (e.g. multiple web API instances) and maybe some others as vertically scaled monoliths (e.g. scheduled report instance).I wrote more about that approach on my blog, as one of the first articles, &#34;Moduliths: because we need to scale, but we also cannot afford microservices&#34;: https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/modulith-because-we-need-to...In my eyes, the good part is that you can work with one codebase and do refactoring easily across all of it, have better scalability than just a monolith without all of the ops complexity from the outset, while also not having to worry as much about shared code, or perhaps approach the issue gently, by being able to extract code packages at first.The only serious negatives is that this approach is still more limited than microservices, for example, compilation times in static languages would suffer and depending on how big your project is, there will just be a bit of overhead everywhere, and not every framework supports that approach easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a lot of talk about monoliths vs microservices lately.. I just want to throw into the ring that you can do both at the same time. easily. And noone is going to kill you for it either.maybe we are getting caught up in sematics because its christmas, but &#34;monorepo/monolith/microservices/etc&#34; is -just- the way you organize your code.Developing a montolith for years but now you have written a 15 line golang http api that converts pdfs to stardust and put it into on a dedicted server in your office? welp thats a microservice.Did you write a 150 repo application that can not be deployed seperatly anyway? welp thats a monolith.You can also build a microservice ecosystem without kubernetes on your local network. We have done it for years with virtual machines. Software defined networking just makes things more elegant.So dont stop using microservices because its &#34;hard&#34; or start writing monoliths because its &#34;easy&#34;, because none of that is true in the long run.What is true is that you have a group of people trying to code for a common goal. The way you reach that goal together defines how you organize your code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless you have a strong technical or organizational reason to use microservices, using microservices is just more work to achieve the same results.Organizational reason would be multiple people/teams who don&#39;t want or can&#39;t talk much to each other, so they develop pieces of a larger system as relatively independent projects, with clear API and responsibility boundaries. Frontend/backend style web development is an example of such approach, even though we don&#39;t typically call these parts &#34;microservices&#34;.A technical reason I can see is some component of a system actually having to be written in a different stack, or to be run in a separate location for business reasons (separate physical computer, separate VMs or containers don&#39;t count). Like a firmware running on an IoT system. Or most of the system uses python, but there&#39;s a really good library in java for solving some very specific problem, so let&#39;s use it.If neither of these reasons stands, you don&#39;t have a microservice architecture, you have a distributed monolith. You just replaced some function calls with RPC. RPC call which takes a much a longer time than a local one, and can randomly fail. Most of your microservices are written in a single stack, so you refactor common parts into a library, but then different services are stuck to use different versions of this library. You end up with a much slower and a much more fragile system which is harder to work on for no good reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The years when Rails monoliths were the de facto web stack were some of the best of my career. As I progressed in my career and the popular tech stack shifted to things like microservices, document DBs, serverless functions, Node, importing tiny nom packages for everything, docker containers, React, and GraphQL, the sheer cognitive overhead of getting a simple app up and running gradually took all the fun out of the job for me. The fast, satisfying feedback loop of writing a feature in Rails was replaced with weeks-long coordination efforts between independent microservices, constant discussions about tooling, and doubts over whether or not we had chosen the “right” flavor-of-the-week framework or library for our product. Every time I started a new project or a joined a new company, we had the reinvent the wheel for our bespoke Node/serverless stack and have the same tiring conversations about naming conventions, logging, data consistency, validation, build scripts, etc., all of which Rails gives you by default. I ended up spending more time on tooling setup than actual business logic.I eventually gave up and switched to a semi-technical product management role."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have spent a lot of time with node(express), Java(Spring) and rails. I see a lot of complaints about node, but node with typescript has been a joy to work with. It is lightweight and has a type system. I know where every piece of code is coming from, there is no magic involved. I either wrote the function in that file, I am importing it, or it is a method on a js object. I only have know one language for both front end and back end. A better standard library would be nice.Rails is nice in terms of getting the project set up, not bikeshedding about the tooling, and working with the db. But the actual coding has been painful for me. I really dislike working with a non typed language. I dislike optional parans in function calls and optional braces for hashes. I dislike all the magic of rails. I never know what is going on because there is some functionality that inherits from a rails class or some other part of the code base. I would rather write a bit more code for a bit more clarity. Maybe if python were typed I would like Django? But python has all of that nonsense around virtualenv.Spring has been ok, but not great. Too much bloated abstract factory creator nonsense. Dependency injection never really clicked for me. All of these annotations. I quite liked plain Java but Spring just felt like this monster.All in all node(express) has been the nicest for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prediction: the big move in the next few years is going to be &#34;back to hypermedia&#34;People are realizing that you can accomplish quite a bit more with hypermedia than you could in the past, and that the complexity of javascript stacks isn&#39;t worth it in many cases.Older, mature hypermedia-based technologies like rails, django, and even PHP, will experience a resurgence and a lot of older lessons and techniques in web development (caching, SQL tuning, etc.) will be rediscovered.I have a dog in this fight, w/ htmx, but I think we are increasingly seeing evidence for this move."</p>

Who the hell thought it was a great idea to couple all the commands like WiFi, power energy, etc under the same menu? On Windows 11 I needed to click the WiFi icon, select WiFi menu, select a WiFi to connect to. Whereas on windows 10 I just click on the WiFi symbol and choose the WiFi. I don&#39;t like my computer auto connecting to the Internet so I manually connect whenever I want and use this menu multiple times a day.3. Speaking of great ideas, now all the right click useful stuff is behind a second menu... Pure genius move.I know I can hack my way around these issues but I don&#39;t see the point of installing sketchy software or messing registry hacks to fix this mess. I will use Windows 10 until its end of life."</p>

But there are people, like company executives (and high-ranking politicians) who have non-public information that does not belong to them.

But imo, they made real changes. They restricted a lot of individual trading, and anything they can still trade in, has to be requested 45 days in advance.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I worked for a finance adjacent firm, not even a firm that handled money, my compliance policy was super strict even by industry standards and I was a lowly Sr. SWE. 
The reasoning I was given was to not never even provide a hint of impropriety or using data ahead of our customers. Reputation was everything.The blanket company-wide policy was as follows. Certain departments had rules on top of this.1. Limited to general stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, etc. No derivatives allowed (options, etc.). Even private stock or private options from my prior require required a review from compliance when I started.
2. No selling for a gain within 30 days of the purchase date on ANY security. Selling for a loss was allowed at any time.
3. All brokerage accounts had to be linked to their compliance portal. An automated compliance check pulled your statements weekly and would open a ticket with compliance if anything looked to violate policy. If your brokerage was not supported electronically, you had to submit monthly paper statements.I don&#39;t see why Congress shouldn&#39;t be subject to similar rules, especially those on finance committees."</p>

JS and PHP are getting more ergonomics, you get a load of new low level languages to sharpen your hardware, Java is modern now, C# runs on Unix, the Rust and Go communities are busy with shipping fantastic tools (ripgrep, fdfind, docker, cue, etc), windows has a decent terminal and WSL, my mother is actually using Linux and Apple came up with the M1.

I‘ll go long on them.Reddit is the ONLY place on the Internet where you can simultaneously watch garbage recycled content from TikTok and visit extremely-niche and highly knowledgeable communities in the same session. Heck, I get my HN updates from Reddit now.Facebook/Instagram/TikTok are nothing like this in that the info you get is wholly dependent on your social graph. Twitter has very high quality content, but it’s a firehose that is very difficult to curate and keep up with. Reddit is democratizing in a sense, like riding the NYC subway.An even wilder bet: Reddit can fit nicely into the metaverse (as a news outlet of sorts, on steroids) and even potentially minimize the need for Google Search.Anecdotally, a VERY LARGE percentage of my Google searches end in “site:reddit.com” these days. Reddit posts, especially from smaller subs, tend to be higher quality and don’t have ulterior motives (ad revenue). If Reddit’s Lucene cluster were better, between that and SO, I’d use Google a handful of times a week. Maybe this IPO can help fund that.If the ad revenue from the whale subs allow me to continue learning about interior design, supply chain logistics,  the inner workings of car sales, finance and tax strategies if I become high net worth, and more, I’m here for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Reddit of 2006 where tutorials on generating HTML in Lisp rocket to the top of the homepage is long gone. I can&#39;t imagine investing in an ad company that is fueled by clickbait and outrage the way Reddit is. Plus, some percentage of the userbase will always run aggressive ad blockers and be impossible to effectvely monetize. However, my brain works very differently from other people&#39;s, so I could be wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The larger subreddits have problems, but Reddit has done a remarkable job of collecting people with niche interests into one area.I wouldn&#39;t discount their success and future success (as much as I&#39;d like to).What&#39;s odd is they haven&#39;t stopped growing. It&#39;s just been linear user growth.They could literally do nothing and the site would still grow. It&#39;s closer to Wikipedia than a social network in some respects. And by that standard, we should try to judge it.I look forward to the next forum site as much as the next person. But I don&#39;t know what it would look like. If anyone does, I definitely urge you to build it if you can.Substack has every incentive to build a community. Discord as well. So there&#39;s definitely opportunities, but from where I sit, I don&#39;t have any insight as to what you could do to beat this behemoth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That design is badly missing some registers (D-type flip-flops) -- the whole &#34;let&#39;s read/write multiple bytes and discard the first one because the ESP is not ready yet&#34; seems like a super hacky solution.A pair of something like 74574&#39;s would make this so much easier. When sending to ESP, register latches the last byte written and then ESP can read it at its leisure. When reading from ESP, ESP pre-loads the data into register, and then gameboy reads data from the register. This generates interrupt which ESP uses to load next byte into register.Moreover, there might be a right logical series which will be compatible with both 3.3 and 5V busses. Then one could replace the level converters with register, keeping the overall complexity about the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very cool project, and impressive he got it working!I feel like possibly a better way to deal with the communication though might be to put a dual-port RAM [e.g. 1] in-between the gameboy and the microcontroller, and load in a program to it so the Gameboy is just waiting for certain areas of memory to be updated (with flags that one side sets as &#39;new data&#39; and then the gameboy flips). Basically some kind of circular buffer of commands, and as long as there&#39;s enough space in there and you only fill it from the microcontroller slower than the Gameboy can process them, you wouldn&#39;t need to have careful synchronisation. The microcontroller just has to check that the next slot in the circular buffer has had its status bit flipped to &#39;processed&#39; (or hasn&#39;t been used yet) before putting the next command/data in.1. https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/memory-logic/multi-po..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m pretty experienced in Node and React, and discovering Rails recently has been an absolute joy. I feel like I&#39;ve made the opposite journey from everyone else on HN, because I joined the programming community _after_ the big RoR hype and during the Node/React hype.Trying out rails, I understand how much magic is involved here. Because I&#39;ve had to build all this crap myself - many, many times over. Complicated things become simple, and tasks that usually make me sigh (add a new data point and add it right through Knex, Hapi models, routes, redux actions, redux store, dispatch/selector and template) turns into a SINGLE COMMAND. Sold :)Very excited about this new release!Edit: I wrote a blog about this a while ago btw, but there are many others pieces out there like it: https://nikodunk.com/a-node-js-developer-discovers-rails/ - using it to create https://electrade.app currently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve played around with the new default frontend (no js build step at all!) and it&#39;s been an absolute joy. I was able to write basically babby&#39;s first Rails app and have it look, feel and behave like an SPA, and that&#39;s a wonderful thing for apps that need just a little bit of interactivity. While I&#39;ve mostly moved on to Phoenix for my personal &#34;weekend project&#34; web needs, Rails is still a wonderful framework for getting an app off the ground fast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just today I was helping a junior (php) developer get setup &amp; started with ruby.RVM, gems, bundler. Then onto rails. Upon first attempt to launch rails it choked on yarn requiring to install packages.And then I had to go through node, npm/yarn, webpacker, rails is primarily the backend, webpacker manages the front end. And it all seemed needlessly complicated.I love that rails have doubled down on the low-js direction.  Progressive enhancement, the whole js ecosystem is there if/when you need. But until then KISS."</p>

They even tried to use a spy to talk to JSR (https://www.johnscottrailton.com) and make him say controversial things, which could be later used to malign Citizen Lab. Darknet Diaries covered this incident recently: https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/99/"</p>

NSO used a compression format&#39;s instructions to create logic gates and then from there &#34;a small computer architecture with features such as registers and a full 64-bit adder and comparator which they use to search memory and perform arithmetic operations&#34;, all within a single pass of decompression. Combine this with a buffer overflow and you&#39;ve got your sploit."</p>

  - using systemd? use journalctl
  - using docker/kubernetes? capture automatically the stdout/stderr of your containers and pipe them through logstash or something

Real question: why would an application need to know where its logs go? This is not in the business perimeter, but the ops perimeter. Am I wrong?EDIT:Most responses are about configuring logging level, output format, etc... This can be done with a print-based approach without sending a request to an external service (which would need to trust you and your inputs).Example: Python&#39;s default logging module.Still, thank you for your insightful answers :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I am seeing a lot of comments about how the graphs are not anchored at 0.  The intent with the graphs was not to &#34;lie&#34; or &#34;mislead&#34; but to fit the data in a way that was mostly readable side by side.The goal was to show the high level change, in a glanceable way, not to get in to individual millisecond comparisons.  However, in the future I would pick a different visualization I think :)The benchmarking has also come under fire. My goal was to just to put the same site/assets on three different continents and retrieve them a bunch of times.  No more, no less.  I think the results are still interesting, personally.  Clean room benchmarks are cool, but so are real world tests, imo.Finally, there was no agenda with this post to push HTTP/3 over HTTP/2.  I was actually skeptical that HTTP/3 made any kind of difference based on my experience with 1.1 to 2.  I expected to write a post about &#34;HTTP/3 is not any better than HTTP/2&#34; and was frankly surprised that it was so much faster in my tests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s great about HTTP 1.1 is it’s simplicity. I mean, you can explain it to a complete newby and have that person write a functioning implementation in a few lines of shell script, all in one afternoon.In fact, you can probably figure it out by yourself just by looking at what goes across the wire.And yet, it runs the whole modern world. That’s beautiful. I think simplicity is underrated and it’s something I really value when choosing the tools I use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a little confused about the test methodology.The post clearly explains that the big advantage of HTTP/3 is that it deals much better with IP packet loss. But then the tests are done without inducing (or at least measuring) packet loss?I guess the measured performance improvements here are mostly for the zero round-trip stuff then. But unless you understand how to analyze the security vs performance trade-off (I for one don&#39;t), that probably shouldn&#39;t be enabled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a similar project (by a friend), that recreates the look and feel of the outstanding UK Government design system:https://gdcss.netlify.app/Same idea and Pico (classless, simple, small etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish more front-end stuff was oriented this way.
This is how I want front-end coding to be:
  Rattle off what I need, semantically,
and then by default it will be styled and presented in a sensible way.
  Then later, if our company stylist want our apps to 
look a particular kind of fancy, he can configure some styling
that will apply to all.This is also why I hate Windows WPF so much:
If you just add a label, a field, and two OK/Cancel buttons to a form,
it will look horrendous by default.
  Only if you manually or deliberately set up some styling for it,
will it start to look sensible.I want gui frameworks to look sensible out-of-the-box,
without cluttering everything with piles of boilerplate crap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of a framework I made 6 years ago (http://barecss.com). If this sort of thing comes back into trend I might go back and modernise it (https://github.com/longsien/BareCSS)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s incredibly disturbing to me how little much of the HN crowd seems to understand how these systems like CSAM actually work.  I&#39;m not talking about the tech or programming.This is a fast track tool to putting anyone in jail for the most despised crime a person can commit.  The tool has no oversight, no transparency, no counter, no clear your name, no real usage definitions other than relentless spying on the &#34;protect the children&#34; fallacy.Most people don&#39;t understand how life destroying a false accusation is once the government paperwork is started.  At that point like it or not you are basically considered guilty by all the agents of the governement by default.  Their jobs are to prosecute not eliminate false positives.  Once you have been on their radar your life will never ever be the same.  And since it is CP related you will not even get helpful people willing to touch it with a 10ft pole cause of fear they may be implicated.  CSAM is a dastardly and effective way to establish a totalitarian rule by fear of life in jail, nothing more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This case reminds me a bit of the big stink with the Daraprim price hikes and Martin Shkreli being dumb enough to be the public face of it. That worked out pretty bad for him but also bad for everyone else, because now we had a guy to blame for it, instead of asking the harder questions like &#34;why aren&#39;t drug prices regulated?&#34; Utilities must go to the public utility commission to raise rates so why is the same not done for drugs? The federal government stockpiles oil in case of shortages, why is it not responsible for ensuring that drug production is continued?The maddening thing about the Apple CSAM scanning controversy is that I still have no idea which legislation Apple is complying with, and it&#39;s difficult to find out any reporting on that aspect. US? UK? EU? Clearly there is/are some government organization(s) with teeth long enough that Apple is not willing to go to court again as was the case with the San Bernandino shooter. Point is, whether or not Apple has been dishonest about this whole thing, they are still just a distraction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So far all the comments are predictably negative and imply that Apple will at some time in the future attempt to covertly implement the feature in secret.Another take would be that they took on-board the extensive public criticism, and changed their minds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built multiple systems using vector search, one of them demoed in a search engine for non-commercial content at http://teclis.comRunning vector search (also sometimes referred to as semantic search, or a part of semantic search stack) is a trivial matter with open-source libraries like Faiss https://github.com/facebookresearch/faissIt takes 5 minutes to set up. You can search billion vectors on common hardware. For low-latency (up to couple of hundred milliseconds) use cases, it is highly unlikely that any cloud solution like this would be a better choice than something deployed on premise because of the network overhead.(worth noting is that there are about two dozen vector search libraries, all benchmarked at http://ann-benchmarks.com/ and most of them open-source)A much more interesting (and harder) problem is creating good vectors to begin with. This refers to the process of converting a text or an image to a multidimensional vector, usually done by a machine learning model such as BERT (for text) or ImageNet (for images).Try entering a query like &#39;gpt3&#39; or &#39;2019&#39; into the news search demo linked in the Google&#39;s PR:https://matchit.magellanic-clouds.com/The results are nonsensical. Not because the vector search didn&#39;t do its job well, but because generated vectors were suboptimal to begin with. Having good vectors is 99% of the semantic search problem.A nice demo of what semantic search can do is Google&#39;s Talk to Books https://books.google.com/talktobooks/This area of research s fascinating. For those who want to play with this more, an interesting end-to-end (including both vector generation and search) open-source solution is Haystack https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People say google search is terrible these days, but I find the opposite.I can vaguely describe in a sentence the gist of an article I&#39;ve read, or an image, and the proper result will usually be in the first page.Of course, it doesn&#39;t always work, sometimes there are &#34;hash collisions&#34; so to speak, but I don&#39;t think the old algorithm would have been more successfully either, since if I knew the exact keywords to use, I wouldn&#39;t need to start with a vague description in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting – we are working on an open source vector search engine called Weaviate and did the same for the complete Wikipedia and Wikidata.[1] Docs: https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/current/[2] Github: https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate[3] Wikipedia demo dataset: https://github.com/semi-technologies/semantic-search-through...[4] Wikidata dataset: https://github.com/semi-technologies/biggraph-wikidata-searc...Last week there was also a feature on Techcrunch about vector search and Weaviate: https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/2246180/"</p>
