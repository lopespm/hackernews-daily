								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have used Apache Guacamole to access running GitHub Actions workflows as remote desktops. It worked super well for testing GUI apps on other operating systems that I didn&#39;t want to deal with setting up.It&#39;s also nice if you want to run a GUI application in someone else&#39;s sandbox.https://github.com/jstrieb/ctf-collab/blob/9300c57364f71fe29..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We adopted Guacamole for access to some of our Windows server production environments; the great thing about it is you can put your corporate SSO / authorization model into a web app to control access and not have to disclose credentials to service accounts to developers. You can also tap off a feed from the guacd that represents a complete screen recording and save it for audit trail purposes.The only issue we&#39;ve had is that FreeRDP (that underlies it for connectivity to Window servers) is a bit fussier than the native RDP environment, or at least we&#39;ve had challenges getting equivalent compatibility across old/odd Windows configurations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using it mainly because of the paranoia of just exposing RDP to the internet. Http(s) is very convenient to add more layers of security, in my case via NGINX (both as LXC containers in Proxmox). I&#39;m using a wildcard domain *.myhome.tld pointed to my static IP. Guacamole is hosted at try_guess_me.myhome.tld, with NGINX basic auth same for all subdomains (further protected by fail2ban). So in total 3 tokens are required (subdomain and basic auth username and password) just to get to the Guacamole login page, where additional username/password + 2FA are required. I used to expose RDP directly for years, but after a chat with a colleague before vacations and a purchase of a NUC for a homelab server decided to strengthen the security slightly.RDP is still much better user experience, so once when I needed a longer session I used Guacamole to access my router admin interface and temporarily expose RDP directly via a random port and a very strong password. I&#39;m still not convinced that the latter combination is not enough, but it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry."</p>

Then a punch is not only a punch,
And finally a punch is just a punch&#34; (heard from Bruce Lee)Basically it means that in the beginning we punch like we can.. then a martial arts student learns the proper and different ways to punch.. so a punch is no longer just a punch... Is a lot of instructions..
Then to sheer practice and repetition the right way to punch becomes second nature.. so the right way to punch is the only way so it&#39;s only a punch again.So coding it&#39;s just ifs and loops...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"ADSL, being essentially a form of alternating current, will pass through an air gap. I was enlightened on this by an AT&amp;T tech who pointed out that one of my ADSL lines had several breaks and could not carry DC but the ADSL signal still came through. The other line was dead so I was running essentially on one wire with an earth ground. Here is an interesting discussion:&#34;Phone line with 1 broken wire still gets ADSL2&#34;https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/9yzp5wr3Anyway, my hat is off to the people who designed and implemented ADSL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That fact that this delivers 3.5 MBit/s really makes you wonder how many low speed connections out in the wild are literally broken cables that still have some amount of coupling somewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a terrible description of what the law actually does.  Let&#39;s shine some light on the FUD.  The law, H.R. 3684 (as enrolled), defines an &#34;advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology&#34; as a system which can do /one/ of the following:1. &#34;passively monitor the performance of a driver... to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired... and prevent or limit [car] operation if an impairment is detected.&#34;2. &#34;passively and accurately&#34; detect whether someone&#39;s BAC exceeds the Federal limit, and prevent or limit car operation if it&#39;s detected.3. Both.This will apply only after the DOT finalizes a rule describing what all those things actually mean in terms of manufacture.  The law requires that the Secretary publish this rule within the next three years, unless they think it can&#39;t be done, in which case they can push it out another three years.  That rule must give car manufactures at least another two years to implement the requirement.  It also gives the DOT an out to say that it can&#39;t be done, in which case in 2031, they need to write a report to Congress to say why it can&#39;t be done.In software terms, this is a user story that was just submitted for development.  It&#39;s Congress asking the executive branch to do some work, but not actually forcing them to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the way American law-making is done to be fascinating. As far as I can tell the US is the only country on Earth where politicians are able to &#34;bundle&#34; completely unrelated things into a single piece of legislation. It definitely doesn&#39;t happen here in the UK in any substantial way (laws get amendments added on but they&#39;re always at least somewhat related to the main part), and I&#39;ve never heard of it anywhere else in the world.It&#39;s a truly interesting thing to read about from a negotiation perspective, but it must make the process of actually getting things done in politics really hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple quotes from the article that stood out to me:&#34;More pressing than the privacy concerns, though, are the safety issues. Including an automatic kill switch of this sort in a machine with internet access presents the obvious scenario that a malicious agent could disable your vehicle remotely with no warning.&#34;and also:&#34;...by 2026, vehicles sold in the US will be required to automatically and silently record various metrics of driver performance, and then make a decision, absent any human oversight, whether the owner will be allowed to use their own vehicle. Even worse, the measure goes on to require that the system be &#34;open&#34; to remote access by &#34;authorized&#34; third parties at any time.&#34;What could go wrong..."</p>

&#34;Ok so this just happened. Buckle up.About a month ago my wife broke her pixel phone. It couldn&#39;t be turned on so we couldn&#39;t wipe it.We contact Google and used the device care to get an RMA.Today someone posted nude pictures of my wife and I to her social media accounts. They accessed her Google account and tried to lock us out. They used her PayPal to send someone $5 (a test probably).How could this happen? Well Facebook and Instagram show logins from Texas. The old phone still showed on our find my phone app and it was in Texas. Guess where we sent the phone for RMA? The last ping from the old phone (which was today) was the same as the place we shipped it. The exact location down to the very building. Clearly they fixed the old phone and since it wasn&#39;t wiped, was still logged into her Google account.I called Google and they basically said &#34;woah that&#39;s fucked up we&#39;ll get back to you&#34;. We filed a police report but I don&#39;t expect they will do anything.What are my options here for sueing Google? I know that sounds insane but this breach of trust and privacy is egregious. Hundreds of people have now seen my penis including our friends kids. It&#39;s really fucked up.Any advice on what to do here?&#34;my big question is whether this phone is password enabled.  also this stinks because i know the first comment is &#34;well do a factory reset&#34; but if the phone doesn&#39;t turn on, etc. then i don&#39;t believe that is possible (short of possibly ADP which is out of the reach of 99% of people)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked in these contract cellphone repair/refurbishment facilities many years ago, the big warehouses where telecoms and manufacturers send these warranty phones to be triaged and repaired, and let me tell you, something like this is not surprising at all. Most of the people there did good work, but all it takes is one. Personally I&#39;d never send my phone in to repair, and I&#39;m skittish about buying any refurbished phones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read a history of the NSA recently [0], and what struck me is that every time the NSA&#39;s code-breaking techniques were invalidated, this was due to a US agent leaking secrets to adversaries.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been using Supabase for a while and love it. It’s got that feel of a really well thought out service where things just work how you’d want it to and new features arrive that you actually want and make life easier. It’s one of a handful of companies I saw and immediately wished I could invest in.This announcement doesn’t really matter to me since I really like having a hosted service. But it’s good to know it’s future proof - ie if Supabase go out of business or a project takes off and I want to self host with all the good stuff then I can."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see this kind of thing happening all the time, facilitated by third parties.For example, a few months ago I found this funny video of some trombonists playing Bruchner in unusual situations[1] that had been uploaded on 14th September 2015 and noticed it had an obviously-bogus copyright claim for the music (&#34;Song: Calling You (Live), Artist: FUN, Licensed to YouTube by (on behalf of FUN); Songtrust, Sony ATV Publishing, and 2 music rights societies&#34;), with a link to where this bogus &#34;song&#34; had been uploaded[2].The &#34;song&#34; proved to be a video consisting of the original trombone video&#39;s soundtrack played twice, over an unrelated static image, that had been uploaded on 13th May 2021—six years after the video it was ripping off.There was enough information on the &#34;song&#34; video to find out that it had been supplied to YouTube by a company called TuneCore[3] who according to their website offer to &#34;SELL YOUR MUSIC WORLDWIDE: Get your music on Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, TikTok, Tencent &amp; more&#34;.I contacted TuneCore in July to point out that their service was being abused, but got a semi-automated reply to the effect that unless it was _my_ copyright that was being infringed they weren&#39;t interested.  I replied, and also responded to their automated did-Jira-help-you-today survey, in both cases pointing out that they were (however inadvertently) involved in fraudulent activity but (unsurprisingly) never heard back.I see now that the TuneCore &#39;song&#39; video has been made private, but the original trombone video still carries the false copyright claim.So frustrating.[1] https://youtu.be/rY0m2cLH1m8[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-577Wp8yBQ - now private[3] https://www.tunecore.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe worthy of its own post but there&#39;s another kind of overt scammer on Youtube. It goes like this:They find some technically hip, well known content and create a new channel with a very similar name as the originator. Create an exciting full screen ad for a crypto currency faucet scam, with price charts and crawls. &#34;Live&#34; stream the original content inset into the ad.Here&#39;s one example: https://cryptoplayboys.blogspot.com/2021/11/spacex-scam-live...Even if you report these things, they don&#39;t get removed very quickly. They&#39;re getting tons of views so why would YT care? The original content holder would care about being associated with them and should sue for defamation though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been a professional artist for about twenty years and it is my considered opinion that any &#34;rule&#34; given out to beginners is actually a warning: violate this rule and making something that looks good becomes a lot harder, so you should probably better make sure you&#39;re not violating any other &#34;rules&#34; unknowingly.If you know damn well that you&#39;re violating multiple rules then sure, go for it - break your perspective, fill the drawing with tangents, shade with black, etc, break the fuck out of these rules, and you can end up with something pretty good. You have to know your shit backwards and forwards to really pull this off; go look at how solid Picasso&#39;s pre-Cubist stuff was, for instance.There are good reasons to choose to use black and there are good reasons to avoid using it; this article talks about several. IIRC, one of the reasons painting teachers traditionally like to tell you to avoid it is because most commonly available black pigments can very quickly ruin the saturation of any other color you mix it with, ending up with unpleasantly grey shadows. But if you do more graphic work that treats each color as a largely separate entity then a lot of solid black can make stuff positively glow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"#000 on my screen isn&#39;t going to be pure black either.  There&#39;s ambient light, the black level on the monitor, etc.  Several of the examples of saturated grays in this article are low-contrast UI that&#39;s hard to read.  Please don&#39;t do that.&#34;Words on web pages aren&#39;t black&#34;.  But they should be #000 or close to it.  Let the user&#39;s screen and environment determine the rest.Interfaces are artificial constructs designed to be as readable and understandable as possible.  Looking at the color of shadows and physically dark things is unhelpful for designing readable interfaces with sufficient contrast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a design background and have written a lot of CSS, and I have opinions so just interpret this all as a personal preference if you want.* It&#39;s basic floor/ceiling stuff. Once you go #000000, you can&#39;t go any darker. Are you 100% sure the thing you&#39;re making #000000 is the absolute darkest thing on your site/app you&#39;ll ever need to declare?* Conversely, never use white! Modern macOS sucks at this! A large window of Mail.app in light mode is pretty blinding. What if you want to add a subtle highlight to a button border on a white background? #fafafa was always a go-to white for me because its easy to remember.* Shadows are really never black and your CSS shadows will look better if you don&#39;t default to black. Toggle &#39;tint shadows&#39; on the _excellent_ css shadow palette generator: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/shadow-palette/. Play with background colors, you&#39;ll see.* Your design will never please everyone, especially anything close to a majority on certain tech news aggregators."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an algorithms class (6.006 or 046?) with Silvio Micali, who I learned partway through the semester was one of the first authors about these things.Anyway, he was a great professor. When talking through algorithms, he&#39;d always start with say, an n^4 solution. Then cut it down to n^3, call on people to help out, etc. I remember it being something like this (in an Italian accent that we really enjoyed)&#34;And now we&#39;re at n^2! Pretty good you might think eh? After all, we were at n^4 just a few minutes ago, this is much better? But, the human mind is a wonderful thing! It is so creative and some people thought about it, and they got n log n! Amazing. I know you are thinking, n log n is always as good as it gets in this class. Well I don&#39;t want to go into the details because, it is horrifying! But actually some people, they did even better! And you know as I said, the human mind is amazing! So maybe one day, you will do even better.&#34;Also I sat across the aisle from him when Eliezer Yudkowsky came for a talk and only realized it when he answered a question EY asked the audience.This kind of turned into me reminiscing but my point is, the guy who put these out there and did a lot of work on them is a great undergrad professor and that makes me happy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert, but coming from a logic background, I always think that ZK proofs are fudging the idea of &#34;completeness&#34; (and &#34;soundness,&#34; for that matter). For example, in [1] (Definition 1.1):&gt; We note that the constants 2/3 and 1/3 are arbitrarily chosen for simplicity. We can always amplify the completeness probability to 1 − negl(λ) and the soundness probability to negl(λ) with repetition.But that&#39;s not completeness in the metamathematical sense. That&#39;s a statistical boundary on what it takes to &#34;convince&#34; someone (or &#34;gain knowledge&#34;). But that&#39;s a stochastic redefinition of a pretty hard-line property of proof systems. In other words, you could theoretically have no knowledge and just get astronomically lucky to an arbitrary degree (whatever degree it would take to cross that proof threshold).[1] https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs355/18sp/lec3.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while back I came up with a third ZK Where&#39;s Waldo protocol [1] that avoids the need to watermark the page or search Alice for contraband, and also has the (usually desirable) property that it&#39;s only convincing to Bob.You instead have Bob randomly choose whether Alice must a) pull off the screen, revealing the original page, or b) punch a hole through to Waldo, but not both. Then you can do any number of rounds of this, with Alice putting the page in a random position each time.It&#39;s only convincing to Bob because bystanders (or rather, anyone not part of the random number generation for which challenge to use) can&#39;t rule out the possibility that they conspired to have Bob always pick the challenge that a faker Alice could solve. (Show the original page when the uses the real one, punch a hole when she uses a fake page.)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15323790Edit: That original comment gives the &#34;magic formula&#34; for coming up with such ZKPs as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; NSO Group said in a statement on Thursday that it did not have any indication their tools were used but canceled the relevant accounts and would investigate based on the Reuters inquiry.Why would they cancel accounts without knowledge of wrongdoing?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Arguably, this is the real use case Pegasus was designed for. A government (Uganda) that does not have a large and mature civil service that would support a G7 level technical domestic intelligence agency went to market for the tools of one (NSO), so they can keep tabs on foreign intelligence agents (state department staff) in their country. I am not a fan of NSO at all, but this case sounds like they&#39;re providing sovereignty or statecraft as a service to a government that prefers to buy instead of build their security capability.When the game is defined as a competition for how to break its rules in the most unexpected ways and with the fewest consequences, Uganda appears to have joined in with aplomb. To me it&#39;s the first time an NSO story doesn&#39;t seem like a scandal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I, personally, find very interesting is that a lot of wording from the coalition contract on this and related matters is apparently taken from or at least based on [0] a document [1] released by the CCC for that very purpose.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is all fine and dandy until the new Innenminister is starting his or her work early next year.They will project the concerns of the civil service and somehow carve out enough special regulations that will all but hollow out any such rights.I really want to believe that the majority of the coalition parties believe that they are saying, but that&#39;s not how politics are made or put into practice.E.g., after Zimmermann, there was great hope that Germany would be a lot less conservative in it&#39;s interior policy, but following interior ministries have not really become much less conservative.Here&#39;s to hope, though - Cheers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I LOVE Blender, like, a kind of love that&#39;s embarrassingly too much for a software. No to mention that my work or hobbies don&#39;t often interface with 3D modeling.So I have been thinking about what makes this project so special. I think it&#39;s the fact that the community owns it. So you don&#39;t have to ask for permission to do anything. Mix that with inherently creative people who approach the tool and you get:AI-generated Kanye West rap teaching you how the modifiers work - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Nn5Uilso0"</p>

Unreal&#39;s built-in modeling tools are usually enough for my purposes so I rarely open Blender, but when I do, I am so appreciative that this software exists and is free to use.It&#39;s incredible how far Blender has come. I remember the days when time between significant releases was measured in years, not months. The progress they&#39;ve made in recent years — particularly since Epic Games gave them a $1.2 million Epic MegaGrant — has been impressive, and encouraging to watch.Thank you to all who fund Blender, and thank you especially to the people who make it.

Lego has sued him multiple times but Streisand effect set in and he has gained a large audience.If anybody who understands German langauge is up for some great irony from a charismatic toy professional on this topic, you should have a look.WARNING: You will waste some hours on this..  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9OKWm_x2RI&amp;t=1504s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw a term in the comments: AFOL. I had to look it up: Adult Fan Of Legos.I loved legos as a kid and would spend hours building stuff. Now the kits seem more like models to be assembled and put on display and not touched rather than “a paint brush of blocks” where I can use my imagination. It lost my interest. My attention is now on software where I feel I can build anything. I liken it to my lego experience as a child.I don’t necessarily think there’s a right or wrong thing here. It’s interesting to note how our mind changes as we age and grow older. The ”do anything” mentality get displaced with something else. This would make for an interesting PhD topic. :)I found another quote from a related article that captured this feeling.    “It’s like a blast to the past, straight to our childhoods,” said Deason, 40, who lives in Connellsville, Pa. “It took me by surprise, but it makes sense: Life is so structured. But with Lego, you can do anything.”

    Deason has a few million Lego pieces, which she organizes by type and color. The Star Wars and Architecture sets, she says, are the most popular among adults, who almost always look for the instruction manuals.

    “The younger kids come in and it’s all about their imaginations — playing pretend, building zombie towns,” she said. “But at some point that gets lost. The adults seem to value the final finished project. That’s where they get their satisfaction.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d say someone earned a free AT-AT for the bug report.On the one hand that&#39;s a minor quibbling little problem there, &#34;I have to use tools on this one part when disassembling it&#34;, and then the dearth of such problems during their run is an amazing testament to their engineering process. That they have fans that can catch this issue and explain it so well is another testament to the standards they&#39;ve maintained.Can we call &#34;lego instructions&#34; an example of software design? I think we must. Programs designed to run on meat CPUs of unknown specs."</p>

Once the door is open for censorship, it all works just like lies do, and it&#39;s often associated with lies and or hurt egos, say lack of acceptance and respect, and it tends to spread, until it&#39;s ridiculous.And let&#39;s get real here:  This whole mess is because the government and big media don&#39;t like being near constantly ratioed.They do have the option of improving how they work and what they say, but maybe they feel it is easier to just try and hide the problems.  People went away from broadcast because of this crap, and reproducing it online means people will go somewhere else again.What it won&#39;t do is transform things into being reputable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The majority of YouTube traffic comes from mobile devices (this can be observed in Google Ads for any video campaign), which is losing market share because of Tictoc.Google will do whatever it takes to monetize every inch of their investment. By turning off dislikes, users will be forced to engage with additional content.This is also visible on the other side of the spectrum - Google is pushing heavily integrated campaign products (e.g. Performance Max Campaigns), which include non-performing channels as display and video (in comparison to search), which can&#39;t be turned off.At this point they can, as they are a monopoly, but I hope they will get burned, as they are introducing more and more dark patterns, which result in lower than poor user experience.My take on this - AdBlock relentlessly, support creators directly. Switch platforms eventually - there&#39;s choice out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hacker News has a similar problem with comments:  net_votes = up_votes - down_votes

You need at least two of the above variables to get an idea of both the direction and magnitude of the voting. Hacker News provides only one: net_votes. YouTube used to provide up_votes and down_votes, effectively providing all three. Now YouTube has reduced its information to up_votes, so they&#39;re now down to one variable in the equation, as Hacker News has been all along.The difference between 102+/100- votes and 2+/0- votes is large, but invisible on this site. I think it would be better for HN to go to where YouTube was, giving us an idea of both the net vote and the level of activity. Like up/down or up/total or net/total."</p>

Google how to fix something and their docs are missing, outdated, and often in broken english.The screen itself is big but slow to refresh and in most modes leaves traces of the previous pages. They have a manual button to full refresh the page, but a user shouldn’t have to do that.It’s not a certified android device so you have to jump through a bunch of somewhat insecure hoops to get the play store installed and log in.Privacy: There privacy statement basically says “lol we promise to be private k?” So I want to run this thing through wireshark to see how true that is.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed Sam Newman&#39;s take on this capability [1]&gt; Great to see AWS providing direct data coupling as a service. /s&gt; This service allows you to directly map a GraphQL endpoint to a database table. It’s like putting getters and setters on an object and claiming your encapsulating private variables. The end result is coupling between GraphQL clients and the underlying datasource.&gt; Information hiding is a key concept in independent change. Can I change the provider (of the GraphQL) endpoint independent of the clients? Directly exposing internal data structure makes this very difficult.And [2]:&gt; So a few people have asked why I have this snarky response. What is my problem with this service? Well, to be clear, it’s not an issue with GraphQL, it’s an issue with direct coupling with underlying datasources #thread&gt; The service as advertised makes it simple to map a GraphQL definition against a database. Now, what’s the problem with this? Well, the devil here is in the detail. But fundamentally it comes down to how important information hiding is to you.&gt; ... see the thread for more ...[1] https://twitter.com/samnewman/status/1346541251617828877

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those unfamiliar with ITA Matrix, it was for a long time the go-to flight search tool for the most dedicated flight hackers, points hackers, etc.It was built by ITA Software [1][2] in the early-mid 2000s (the earliest mention I can find of it is in 2004 [3]) to test and showcase the capabilities of their flight search platform. I once heard that ITA and other consumer-facing flight search companies had tested that kind of UI with ordinary users, but found that not enough people understood or liked it enough for them to justify making it a mainstream interface.Hipmunk, a YC-backed flight search site that launched in 2010, was heavily influenced by the ITA Matrix UI, after co-founder Adam Goldstein had found Matrix to be the best way for him to find flights when travelling around the world for college debating competitions. And while Hipmunk did a good job of being more consumer-friendly and popular than Matrix had been, sadly they didn&#39;t gain enough traction to make it as a standalone company, and after being acquired by SAP/Concur, it was shut down last year.It&#39;s an interesting, and perhaps depressing case of a product design concept being far superior to what&#39;s available in the mainstream for a certain class of user, but cannot gain enough mainstream acceptance to be a viable business or even a well-supported service for those who love it. And far more than most other product categories, flight search has huge infrastructure costs, so it&#39;s very difficult to economically sustain niche products (from grim personal experience of being part of a team trying to build a novel flight search product ourselves).In this case it&#39;s just lucky that Google owns the infrastructure and has enough enthusiasm internally to keep it going to some extent.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA_Software[2] https://xconomy.com/boston/2008/12/17/ita-software-the-trave...[3] https://www.fodors.com/community/europe/customs-question-sea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ITA Matrix is still my go-to for booking flights:https://matrix.itasoftware.com/Playing with this version, it&#39;s a little easier to use, but I don&#39;t see any functionality not in the regular version. Still, if it means Google is investing in Matrix, that&#39;s a good thing. I always worry at some point it will be killed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s an interesting look at AWS pricing since the cost of the M1 Mac Mini ($699) and it’s power consumption (avg 26 watts) are known. Based on hardware costs (significant) and power costs (insignificant) you’re looking at a hardware ROI at about 6 months from the $.65 per hour price. AWS has an estimated 60% gross profit margin, so from there it’s probably possible to estimate some other interesting things about their costs, utilization rate and 
depreciation schedule.Edit: Sorry, my napkin math assumed a unstated utilization rate of 40 hours per week, but that’s not a great assumption due to the 24 hour minimum. Still, some proportion of machines will be idle, though 75% idle seems like a bad guess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is profoundly insightful.I have been searching for patterns and insights in this field for 25 years.  What 
 apenwarr concludes is true:    All we need is to build distributed systems that work. That means decentralized bulk activity, hierarchical regulation.


The problem is, everyone wants distributed systems that require everyone else to agree (global consensus), which is literally impossible (see: CAP theory, and what happens when Partition occurs).  There&#39;s another word for &#34;require everyone else to agree&#34;: Tyranny.Fortunately, the entire universe and everything in it works without global consensus, just fine (for various definitions of &#34;fine&#34;).There is also methods for building computational distributed systems that work &#34;fine&#34; in the face of CAP failure:https://holo.hostThis is a serious breakthrough.  And we really, really need this, NOW.Just to whet your appetite, here&#39;s some high-level observations on how these breakthroughs may affect our lives, in the area of Money: https://perry.kundert.ca/range/finance/holochain-consistency..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"* Everyone seems to increasingly be in it for themselvesI was fortunate to have had a career with mild autonomy to help other team members even if it was slightly out of my job description. But this only happens in a shared office environment where you can see when someone is falling behind or overhear a problem. That physical presence also creates a bond with co-workers that&#39;s often more powerful than the corporate mission.But working from home for the past years I feel like I mercenary working among mercenaries. Working with people that have never met and will never meet and for whom work isn&#39;t about the mission or the customer. If I get work done early, I now just call it a day. Why bother with ad-hoc testing, documentation, checking in on that new hire, proposing a conference paper, investigating technical debt, etc. It&#39;s liberating but it&#39;s also depressing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly believe that money itself has been corrupted lately, this then causes all number of bad flow on effects to happen. A massive shift happened when central banks started getting involved in direct purchases of various asset types and we started to see a major distortion happen in monetary policy that which has distorted the functioning of money itself. For example who would care if their business is completely unprofitable if it could get access to freshly printed money every quarter to prop it up. What then happens to all the other businesses who don&#39;t get access to that freshly created money? When we have situations like the BoJ owning more than 60% of the Nikkei 225 we really ought to be asking some serious questions about if we really have free markets? We also should be asking some questions about the properties we desire in money itself. If a central monetary agency can go about unconventional monetary policy such as purchasing equities we can quickly have a situation whereby an unelected group of bureaucrats can damages the ability of money to be used as a means to convey information. Further there&#39;s questions about picking winners and losers that comes up there too. As a whole I think people need to ask what money is again and have some serious conversations about what money and the monetary system should be. It seems that these difficult questions really fell out of favor a while ago and as a result things have been drifting in a direction that many people aren&#39;t comfortable with.If we don&#39;t ask these questions then technological approaches to money, like various cryptocurrencies and other financial technologies are unlikely to actually cause long lasting improvements. We have some serious monetary policy problems in the world right now and while some tech could help (in some cases) these aren&#39;t primarily technological problems."</p>

I find switching applications with keyboard shortcuts and focusing on one thing at a time has improved my productivity. Using two or more monitors made it so easy for me to get distracted. To each their own though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"fools begone.The ideal monitor rotation --the one that secures the most favour on HN-- is a slow 1-2 centimetre per second continuous orbit about the office in 2 dimensions on a tracked rail.  This in turn ensures that one may not only glorify their monitors rotation, but also glorify their practice of standing whilst working instead of sitting.  The movement --which rotates as well amongst its own Z axis-- also promotes good evangelical proselytization of the many woes of desk sitting, for example, that ten million people die per second for not standing at the lectern as a fourteenth century pork belly clearinghouse clerk.At days end then the monitor should be guided into a velvet sack, and stored gently atop a layer of old Haskell parchments that it may succor inspiration at the next stand-up which is conducted standing, as our christ lord intended."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regardless of your opinion on piracy, I think Google (and ISPs) should not moderate search results.Basically, search engines are used to find things publicly available on the internet, policing should be done on the actual hosts of the content.Same goes for ISPs, they are here to provide access to publicly available computers, without interfering with the content or accessibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google already acts upon DMCA requests, delisting sites if requested. They add a small note to the end of their results to inform you if the page should normally have had more search hits.So this raises so many questions. Has _no party_ requested to delist TPB under DMCA?!That sounds incredible if true. But the only explanation I have for Google feeling like they need to go this far, delisting on their own initiative! It&#39;s like a scenario that should never have to happen, and something they should never do either.So what&#39;s going on here?Update: Ugh, editorialization... Apparently court has been involved here and while Google may not be individually targetted and forced YET, so &#34;voluntary&#34;, it&#39;s easy to see how Google see the writing on the wall and choose to comply. No point in fighting this with such a clear cut DMCA violation. But in this case I&#39;m still surprised it took this long!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Search itself is now a threat to the open web. Forget Chrome.Google willingly interferes, in a heavy-handed way, with both search suggestions and search results, with both Google Search and YouTube. Just try to look up any topic on YouTube, and you&#39;ll have to get past the hundreds of mainstream media channels covering the event, before you actually find the original video. They artificially promote &#34;authoritative sources&#34; which are anything but, since they may be second-hand coverage of original videos that get buried in search results.Google&#39;s results are not only manipulated by clever SEO people[0], but by employees[1], in direct contradiction to Sundar Pichai&#39;s sworn testimony. Some of that is very defendable. But there&#39;s zero transparency. Given their search monopoly, and that most people aren&#39;t aware that search results are manipulated, Google Search is the web. Websites that get delisted are presumed to have ceased to exist. Focusing on browsers (Firefox) is good, but no longer enough.That&#39;s why Google Search itself is now a threat to the open web. Switch to other engines. DuckDuckGo, Brave Search are the ones I trust, and there&#39;s tons more.[0]: how many times have you tried looking for a machine&#39;s user manual, mistyped the model number, and somehow &#34;found&#34; a webpage with the manual for a product that didn&#39;t exist? and then modified the model number further and found more results from the same website, with relevant keywords and yet another incorrect model number? My understanding of SEO isn&#39;t good enough to know how they do that. I don&#39;t believe websites can dynamically alter their index to show up for so many typoed search queries.[1]: https://medium.com/@mikewacker/googles-manual-interventions-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason to block the merger is pretty straightforward:1) Nvidia designs expensive chips and sells them by the millions. [1]2) ARM designs cheap chips and sells them by the billions. [2]3) Nvidia&#39;s &#34;normal&#34; product departments are incentivized to prevent ARM from competing with Nvidia&#39;s expensive chips, in various ways. This would hinder ARM&#39;s innovation and growth opportunities vs being independent.I am glad to see this motion to block the merger, for the sake of a competitive market for CPUs, GPUs, etc.[1] https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-hits-new-highs-in-gpu-...[2] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/arm-6-7-billion-chips-per-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the most megalomanic thing I&#39;ve ever heard of. ARM has high chances to be both the next x86 and the most common embedded architecture. While at the same time Nvidia GPUs are already the de facto standard for GPU computing. So Nvidia would have monopolies in 2 verticals. No reasonable and competent antitrust commission could ever allow that - although probably everyone was betting the latter wasn&#39;t the case..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strategically, why wouldn’t the US gov’t want a US company owning ARM? Why is the FTC pilling on to block this? How would I, as a consumer, be harmed by a graphics company owning an instruction set and design specification?Stopping two US companies from merging because it would create a monopoly and negatively impact US consumers is one thing. But this isn&#39;t even remotely the case here? Doesn&#39;t the US government get more tax revenue if Nvidia makes some extra dough charging royalties for that IP? I’m confused."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Facebook (meta)‘s key asset is now WhatsApp.Facebook is practically dead. It’s just a stream of awful content that isn’t from your friends. It’s hyper advertising and desperate attempts to clone other platforms as it slowly dies. It’ll continue for a long time, eventually becoming yahoo like, but young people do not care about it at all.Instagram has similarly been over monetised but in an earlier stage. It has been roundly defeated by TikTok, utterly destroyed by TikTok, in the battle for teens’ attention.Oculus was a great buy but the gap (in terms of years) between instagram’s peak and oculus really coming online is just too wide to “save” the company.In contrast, WhatsApp is still used across the generations. It’s the one platform where grandparents and grandkids are both active users.If I were Zuck then I’d focus on turning WhatsApp into an Asian-style chat platform with integrated services. That I can’t wire money on WhatsApp in the U.K. is I think a very very big strategic error on his part.It seems clear Facebook (meta) can’t build anything truly new, but they can certainly extend platforms - they should focus on WhatsApp. It has longevity, strong network effects, and huge potential. Just don’t use ads and destroy it.Otoh Facebook deserves to die so I hope he continues to think oculus will save them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook aside you really see this across the board on almost any platform, that once the product reaches it&#39;s 1.0 stage, (where it is good, does what the users want it to do, and has realised its vision) it begins a process of gradual decay, as the focus of the product managers (now panicking to find some statistics to improve to show their bosses) shifts from &#34;building functionality&#34; to &#34;increasing engagement/retention/active users per month&#34;.Whatever product it is, whether a social media platform or an online learning platform, it will slowly be zombified into an attention sucking machine, whose goal has now become to keep you interacting with the app as much as possible (using ML and DL of course).I mean, Twitter now sends me daily notifications that a person I follow made a random tweet (wasn&#39;t this the purpose of the news feed?), Udemy now has a notification service and an inbox that fills up with automated messages that are just a &#34;welcome to the course&#34; message. Everywhere I look, the pattern is the same, Product is good &gt; Product adds social features &gt; Product attempts to cluster user activity and make recommendations based on social features.We, as in the IT industry, need to come up with a culture or methodology of &#39;declaring a product complete&#39; whereby all product managers are gracefully allowed to move on and a product is put into a state of stasis, where bugfixes and the occasional relevant feature is built. If a product was not designed to show intelligent recommendations, use gamification or become a notification dashboard then that should be bared from ever appearing in its Backlog.I&#39;m deeply worried about the long-term effects of an industry that is booming by sending sending some of our brightest minds to scale the economy of distractions Or to innovate Ad-tech.I really hope we&#39;ll look back at this age with the same wisdom-fuelled disgust we have when we look back at the early industrial age. Where smog factories were built in the middle of cities and dusty kids were shovelling coal. We lack any sort of foresight wrt. the digital economy we&#39;re building. Maybe one day we&#39;ll find a healthy alternative to make software-products users love.But until then, seldom are the days where I do not look at the internet with such savage despair."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand Instagram language. My GF uses it. It is full of digital influencers, people who make money because they are digital influencers. Young people with sometimes funny but generally pointless and most often ridiculous dancing moves to an equally ridiculous repetitive song. People buying expensive things, doing idiot things talking about uninteresting details of the uninteresting lives of equally uninteresting people...I don&#39;t understand the hypnotic effect it has."</p>

I heard a lot about them myself when I did my FSJ (volunteer work) back in 2004, and it&#39;s only gotten worse since then. Our government is in full CYA mode, and doing everything they can to blame a scapegoat for problems they themselves have willingly created over decades. It&#39;s despicable, and nobody should support it.FSJ is a year-long volunteer program for young people typically organized and funded by NGOs like the Red Cross and similar. I worked with small children, plenty of the other volunteers I met regularly worked in hospitals and nursing homes. They all talked at length about how atrocious the working conditions were and how they were asked to do things they weren&#39;t legally allowed to (e.g. taking blood, handing out medication) because the staff shortages were severe enough that people didn&#39;t have enough time to adhere to very reasonable safety rules anymore. That was 17 years ago.This is a well known, widely publicized[0] and not at all new problem, and the unvaccinated are not to blame for it. Let me repeat, we&#39;re talking about one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a population of 83M people crumbling over a few thousand ICU patients.[0]Some random articles from 2018/19 (German):https://gesundheit-soziales.verdi.de/themen/mehr-personal/++...https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/wenn-aus-notstand-panik-...https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2018-05/pflegenotsta...https://www.rbb-online.de/kontraste/ueber_den_tag_hinaus/bil..."</p>

It doesn&#39;t make sense. Everyone in Germany who wants the vaccine has had it, and if you&#39;ve had Covid, you&#39;re about as protected as the vaccinated. Furthermore, leaky vaccines don&#39;t prevent transmission, can&#39;t eliminate the virus (animal reservoirs) and may even make it more virulent. See Marek&#39;s disease: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15757475/ https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/leaky-vac...This is not a rational, science-based policy. This is about punishing the non-compliant, mostly the under class. As the upper class continues with their events surrounded by masked servants, with endless examples of officials breaking their own rules. Worse, we are normalizing the dehumanization of a group of people who we&#39;re told are diseased and dangerous and it&#39;s all their fault. Germany of all places should be absolutely allergic to such rhetoric."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ex-Ubiquiti employee here. Nick Sharp wasn&#39;t just a senior software engineer. He was the Cloud Lead and ran the whole cloud team. His LinkedIn profile will confirm it. This is why he had access to everything.Nick had his hands in everything from GitHub to Slack and we could never understand why or how. He rose to power in the company by claiming to find a vulnerability that let him access the CEO&#39;s personal system, but nobody I spoke to ever knew what the vulnerability was. I discussed this with another ex-Ubiquiti person in an old thread [1] Now I&#39;m positive he faked the security issue as a power move, just as he faked this attack for extortion purposes.He would also harass people and use his control over Slack and GitHub against the people he didn&#39;t like. Many people left around this time partially because Nick made everything so difficult at the company. What a terribly depressing series of events.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26694945"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the idea that intelligence lies within a spectrum. Someone might be incredibly smart about a narrow topic or field, yet be blind to their own stupidity within another realm.To me, this seems like a classic example. To quote the press release: &#34;During the execution of that search, SHARP made numerous false statements to FBI agents, including, among other things, in substance, that he was not the perpetrator of the Incident and that he had not used Surfshark VPN prior to the discovery of the Incident.  When confronted with records demonstrating that SHARP purchased the Surfshark VPN service in July 2020, approximately six months prior to the Incident, SHARP falsely stated, in part and substance, that someone else must have used his PayPal account to make the purchase.&#34;This man was a senior developer yet this quote sounds like it comes from a nine year-old. Not to mention &#34;hire a lawyer, don&#39;t talk to the police&#34; has always been pretty solid advice.He now faces significant prison time, and the strong potential for a dismal life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mr. Sharp is apparently not so sharp. He carried out the attack from his home network. He connected directly for enough time that his bare IP was logged. The rest of the time, he carried out the attack using a commercially purchased VPN solution that was trivial to trace back to him via the purchase record. He lied to the FBI. (I have yet to understand why people talk to law enforcement instead of staying silent so as to not implicate themselves.) And, for no apparently good reason (meaning, there&#39;s no claim of him shorting the stock), after the raid, he seeded fake news that drove the company&#39;s stock down 20%."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when Edgeium was new and just Chrome but with a lot of Google cruft removed, I actually used Edge instead of Chrome when I was on Windows. It was the same browser with some additional tweaks that I quite liked.Then Microsoft started this aggressive, disruptive push to bring it to iOS Safari&#39;s level as the only browser people should use.I don&#39;t know any good operating systems for normal people anymore. Windows 10 and 11 are hostile, macOS only runs on very expensive hardware and doesn&#39;t run most programs people need (because the business world is still Windows oriented) and Linux has been making progress but still isn&#39;t a good alternative for the common user unless they have an expert to rely upon when something breaks down. ChromeOS doesn&#39;t run on most devices (it can, but the images aren&#39;t available) and I wouldn&#39;t recommend a Google-oriented OS to most people anyway, if they can avoid it; Android is bad enough already.I miss the Windows 7 days. The Win10/11 kernel may have seen loads of improvements, the UI and basic behaviour has only been regressing for many years now. The Windows 11 window snapping is nice but it doesn&#39;t excuse the aggressive spyware that comes with the OS, and neither does it excuse this antitrust lawsuit in waiting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard some people having a decent time with Edge in the past with some features implementations. Not that I would use it myself, but I&#39;m firmly convinced these childish plays only ruin whatever good work was done on it. Who on Earth would continue using a browser that has such hostile behavior and dark patterns all over the place e.g., buy-now-pay-later at browser level?It&#39;s so hard to trust Microsoft anyway, I&#39;m glad 11 is such a tranwreck dead on arrival. Makes it easier to discourage people from using it, ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Microsoft Edge runs on the same technology as Chrome, with the added trust of Microsoft.&#34;They named their user tracking, telemetry, and &#34;Buy Now, Pay Later&#34; add-ons &#34;trust&#34;?  That&#39;s really Orwellian."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a super cool blog post. However I think it alludes to a much larger problem. For many products today, it’s very difficult or impossible for most people to verify the product works.For a network switch, there are free and open source tools like iPerf to test and verify speeds are as advertised. For a faraday box, you have to go through all these steps (and knowledge learned) just to be able to test these. What about for vitamins, or pet food, or any other “durable” products that are supposed to last for X years?In an age of snake oil salesmen, paid for reviewers, and fraudulent products on Amazon, there is a real opportunity for creating systems that enable individuals to verify products do what the sellers claim they do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Snowden&#39;s recommended Faraday cage for phones or other devices of similar size: two drink-shaker cups[1].Drink shakers are cheap and widely available. The average hotel room in any medium/large hotel chain probably includes a shaker as a standard item as part of the minibar. The simple two-cup style (as seen in [1]) is preferred over the fancier &#34;strainer top&#34; style because you can press the two cups together; this should cause the inner cup to slightly cut into and/or deform the outer cup along the circle where they join together. The seal between the cups should work sort of like the  knife-edge seals used in vacuum chambers.A metal box or conductive bag is only a Faraday cage if it is fully closed/sealed. Any imperfection in the seal or hole[2] might allow the radio signal to leak out. Most improvised items (freezer, random metal box, etc) have poor seals. Making a high quality cage that actually block a modern phone can be done without much trouble, but the drink shaker method is the only method I know of that will do the job using widely available (free) or very cheap ($10-ish?) parts.[1] https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HLB1yRyhXZTxK1Rjy0Fgq6yovpXaZ/Win...[2] Holes of sufficient size. How big are the waves you are trying to block?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my former job we had a rather large faraday cage for testing telco equipment. Two things surprised me: 1) It is more fiddly to ensure a room-sized faraday cage doesn&#39;t leak RF than I thought.  It is really easy to make mistakes that compromises experiments. 2) There was a bath-towel sized piece of cloth that came with one of the expensive Rohde &amp; Schwarz instruments that was astonishingly effective at blocking signal.So I mainly used the room because that&#39;s where the magic blanket was - which was easier to use than ensuring the room was set up correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ha, yes, I&#39;ve done that at https://gigablast.com/ .
The biggest problems now are the following:
1) Too hard to spider the web. Gatekeeper companies like Cloudflare (owned in part by Google) and Cloudfront make it really difficult for upstart search engines to download web pages.
2) Hardware costs are too high. It&#39;s much more expensive now to build a large index (50B+ pages) to be competitive.I believe my algorithms are decent, but the biggest problem for Gigablast is now the index size. You do a search on Gigablast and say, well, why didn&#39;t it get this result that Google got. And that&#39;s because the index isn&#39;t big enough because I don&#39;t have the cash for the hardware. btw, I&#39;ve been working on this engine for over 20 years and have coded probably 1-2M lines of code on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The consistent theme every time this comes up is that dealing with the sheer weight of the internet is almost impossible today. SEO spam is hard to fight and the index gets too heavy. However, I wonder if this is a sign that we&#39;re looking at the problem wrong.What if instead of even trying to index the entire web, we moved one step back towards the curated directories of the early web? Give users a search engine and indexer that they control and host. Allow them to &#34;follow&#34; domains (or any partial URLs, like subreddits) that they trust.Make it so that you can configure how many hops it is allowed to take from those trusted sources, similar to LinkedIn&#39;s levels of connections. If I&#39;m hosting on my laptop, I might set it at 1 step removed, but if I&#39;ve got an S3 bucket for my index I might go as far as 3 or 4 steps removed.There are further optimizations that you could do, such as having your instance not index Wikipedia or Stack Overflow or whatever (instead using the built-in search and aggregating results).I&#39;m sure there are technical challenges I&#39;m not thinking of, and this would absolutely be a tool that would best serve power users and programmers rather than average internet users. Such an engine wouldn&#39;t ever replace Google, but I&#39;d think it would go a long way to making a better search engine for a single user&#39;s (or a certain subset of users&#39;) everyday web experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Natural Language Processing is a pox on modern search engines. I suspect that Google et. al. wanted to transform their product into an answer engine that powers voice assistants like Siri and just assumed everyone would naturally like the new way better. I can&#39;t stand how Google is always trying to guess what I want, rather than simply returning non-personalized results solely based on exactly what I typed in the textbox.While that may be good for most people, there is still a lot of power and utility in simple keyword-driven searches. Sadly, it seems like every major search engine has to follow Google&#39;s lead."</p>

There is no such limit within NSS; many structures can exceed this size. This vulnerability demonstrates that errors happen at extremes&#34;- &#34;combined [fuzzer] coverage metrics [...].

I mean it&#39;s the only way you get to see the awesome ascii art when you collect all 50 for the year.Many thanks to Eric and team for what must be a huge effort to run such a fun programme.Oh, the other thing I do: I don&#39;t even start until sometime in January :) far less stress and keeps the whole family much happier ;)"</p>

Breadth not depth.For example, perhaps we start with some data processing from a file. Then answer some basic statistics question about the data.  Then maybe some basic signal processing.  We form an image. We transform the image. We play the image as audio.  We break it into packets of some sort then share it on a “network.” We reassemble it. We build a state machine and pass it the reassembled data in some way. We discover some new output.Etc. etc. culminating with some fun discovery that inside that original data was a secret code or whatever.And instead of an intense challenge, we’ve just had a fun walk through an intro to two dozen subdomains of CS/sweng. You may not have immediately known the answer to each puzzle but you never felt lost."</p>

The name &#34;wave function collapse&#34; can be off putting but it&#39;s pretty straightforward, and an algorithm that can come in handy for many uses both in game development and just general software development.I&#39;m actually procrastinating on HN from working on a GPU parallelised version that can generate millions of positions every frame. In Townscaper you can actually see that the algorithm runs quite slow and lags behind the players input, there&#39;s just a bunch of animation to hide it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reputation is a fragile thing. I&#39;ve got no horse in this, it&#39;s not my industry and I&#39;m just a spectator. But two days ago I thought of Stripe as a top notch company, with top notch leadership. Since I&#39;m well aware that PR is a thing, that reputation also tends to be brittle, but while nobody had said anything bad about Stripe, I thought they were tops. This is not so much about Stripe as about the PR world we&#39;ve created: we know that everything we&#39;re told is polished to make it look as nice as possible, so when the facade cracks, we should adjust heavily.So now I&#39;m going to have to shift my priors, and it may well be unfair to the firm. For one, I don&#39;t know if the allegations are true. I also don&#39;t know whether this is a one-off, or whether this happens all the time and this is the tip of the iceberg. I do know that whatever I hear is going to be deeply invested one way or the other.Specifically about the rescinded offers, the only acceptable reason to do that is when the person has gotten the offer in bad faith, eg they lied about their CV or claimed to have done something they provably hadn&#39;t. Other than that, someone who&#39;s gotten an offer may well have started moving house, taking their kids out of school, gotten their spouse to quit their job, and all sorts of hard-to-reverse decisions. It&#39;s an utterly crappy thing to have happen, and any company that does it should be outed for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stripe&#39;s recruitment pipeline is well known (at least in most ruby dev circles) to be fucked. I&#39;ve experienced this first hand and even gotten lip service from exec leadership (see my HN comment history). Stripe is very good at PR, aren&#39;t they?The thing is, there are lots and lots of companies who don&#39;t have these types of problems; that don&#39;t treat candidates poorly, follow thru with the offers they make (I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m typing that!).Hiring is already a power dynamic slanted for the employer... this shit just seem excessive and like 0 fucks are given.As a job seeker, don&#39;t waste your time interviewing at companies that have these fundamental problems just getting in the door. The odds will never be in your favor, but these types of problems make for a much larger mountain to climb.Knowing these things, and how good Stripe is at PR, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if things on the inside are actually a dysfunctional mess. I hope not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some people are getting side-tracked asking if this is a common problem. I think that&#39;s a distraction: the right number of rescinded offers to engineers and other individual contributors is 0.[0]If the actual number of candidates affected is small, then it would be cheap to make it right for them. You could find a team that can take the engineer (we&#39;re not interchangeable parts, but Stripe is a big company), and/or offer monetary compensation for the opportunity cost.[0] I&#39;ll reserve judgment about higher level management. I don&#39;t know if the norms and circumstances are different. Obviously this also excludes failed background checks, candidates being dishonest, etc, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For years now I&#39;ve ran a programming site (stackabuse.com) and have closely followed the state of Google SERPs when it comes to programming content. A few thoughts/ramblings:- The search results for programming content has been very volatile the last year or so. Google has released a lot of core algorithm updates in the last year, which has caused a lot of high-quality sites to either lose traffic or stagnate.- These low-quality code snippet sites have always been around, but their traffic has exploded this year after the algorithm changes. Just look at traffic estimates for one of the worst offenders - they get an estimated 18M views each month now, which has grown almost 10x in 12 months. Compare that to SO, which has stayed flat or even dropped in the same time-frame- The new algorithm updates seem to actually hurt a lot of high-quality sites as it seemingly favors code snippets, exact-match phrases, and lots of internal linking. Great sites with well-written long-form content, like RealPython.com, don&#39;t get as much attention as they deserve, IMO. We try to publish useful content, but consistently have our traffic slashed by Google&#39;s updates, which end up favoring copy-pasted code from SO, GitHub, and even our own articles.- The programming content &#34;industry&#34; is highly fragmented (outside of SO) and difficult to monetize, which is why so many sites are covered in ads. Because of this, it&#39;s a land grab for traffic and increasing RPMs with more ads, hence these low-quality snippet sites. Admittedly, we monetize with ads but are actively trying to move away from it with paid content. It&#39;s a difficult task as it&#39;s hard to convince programmers to pay for anything, so the barrier to entry is high unless you monetize with ads.- I&#39;ll admit that this is likely a difficult problem because of how programmer&#39;s use Google. My guess is that because we often search for obscure errors/problems/code, their algorithm favors exact-match phrases to better find the solution. They might then give higher priority to pages that seem like they&#39;re dedicated to whatever you searched for (i.e. the low-quality snippet sites) over a GitHub repo that contains that snippet _and_ a bunch of other unrelated code.Just my two cents. Interested to hear your thoughts :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat tangential but I believe Google Search is going downhill, they seem to be losing the content junk spam SEO fight. Recently, I&#39;ve had to append wiki/reddit/hn to queries I search for because everything near the top is shallow copied content marketing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not only SO threads, I particularly hate the ones that mirror GitHub Issues. They don&#39;t even link back to the original thread, for Christ&#39;s sake!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be a volunteer teacher for a 3-hour weekly class in a local prison.One of the things this article misses is that gangs – which are especially active in prison systems – use books to pass ciphered messages.  Highlighting, underlining, dogeared corners, scratched out characters, etc. are used prolifically as encoded messages that would appear to be regular wear to a casual observer.  The &#34;tradecraft&#34; these guys employ is amazing (albeit for a horrible purpose).  We were allowed to have books shipped directly from publishers or known third-party entities (e.g., Amazon) and there was a request form an instructor could fill to add new approved vendors.All that to say, I understand the policy, even though it&#39;s not ideal for those honestly wanting to read.  It&#39;s hard for most people to imagine but a lot of the people in prison are some seriously bad dudes, and there are real cases of warring gangs orchestrating &#34;hits&#34; on other gang members through innocuous looking content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things that happens with used books being donated is that the paper will be used as a medium for getting contraband drugs into the prison.An example of this (letters) https://nypost.com/2021/11/05/wisconsin-inmates-to-get-photo...&gt; Wisconsin prison inmates will begin receiving photocopies of their mail next month as officials attempt to stem the flow of paper laced with drugs into correctional facilities.&gt; The Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) said paper and envelopes can be sprayed or soaked in synthetic cannabinoids such as K2 and then sent into prisons, where they are torn into strips and smoked and sold to inmates.&gt; The Fox Lake prison switched to photocopying prison mail in April after nine “potential overdoses” and two incidents of violent behavior connected to drug use. In the months since, the prison has seen numbers in both categories drop before reaching zero in August, officials said.That&#39;s for a single sheet of paper - consider the difficulty of verifying that a couple hundred pages of a novel haven&#39;t been tampered with.One of the easier ways to do this is to have the book be new and come directly from a distributor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m genuinely terrified of the American Prison system. I had a brief brush with the Law at one point in the past; but reading about what goes on in there and how it completely fucks over people is just incredible.I sincerely believe that if there’s any one thing that will end the American experiment, it will be its Prison system. Generations of poor people being brutalized and radicalized, creating an incredibly violent culture both inside and out… it’s just not sustainable to keep imprisoning millions of people.I don’t know what the solution is. I suspect we will need to invest massively in both keeping people out of prisons and creating conditions in society that make it less likely for people to fall into destitution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Rant time: You&#39;ve heard it before, git is powerful, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? Are you kidding me? To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can&#39;t be split down any further but contains code you don&#39;t want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file by hand? Are you KIDDING me?! Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren&#39;t even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!&gt; If you&#39;re a mere mortal like me and you&#39;re tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it&#39;s a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.I sympathise, deeply. If you&#39;ve never found yourself counting lines - repeatedly, because your last attempt failed - while manually editing a hunk, then I envy you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The results keep getting &#34;refined&#34; so as to suit the popular 80% of queries, while getting much worse for any technical or obscure queries. Forced synonyms and &#34;people also searched for&#34; are typically useless and almost infuriating. Once you get off the first or second page, the results get even worse-- with pages entirely unrelated to the query (e.g. not even containing the searched phrases). They are probably testing/already implemented some sort of multi armed bandit type optimization like on Youtube&#39;s search results where they just show any popular pages (ignoring relevancy) to see if they yield a click.I&#39;ve used DDG for the past ~5 years, and it is typically worse without using a hashbang like !so for technical queries.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It feels like the algorithm (combined with the SEO/marketing industry) has effectively nuked discussions from organic results.Based on the search box suggestions I get, it seems many people work around this by appending reddit to their searches.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems everyone here is confused. Here&#39;s the official FAQ, and it has 0 marketing garbage.https://aws.amazon.com/private5g/faqs/There&#39;s no &#34;telecom as a service&#34;, and there&#39;s no &#34;5g can be split into multiple networks&#34; nonsense.Amazon is just selling 5g access points and hardware (just like you would install wifi), and rents you a private connection for that hardware to AWS, and management of that network from AWS. Basically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Become a telecom as a service!Super cool. For those who are glancing over, this is a big deal. 5G isn&#39;t really like 4G upgraded. It&#39;s more its own thing. I believe this has been available though for a while and many telecoms have partnerships with FAANG beyond Amazon.With 5G you can essentially split a network into multiple partitions and scale them independently on-demand called Network Slicing. (like cloud computing but just the network).This could be extremely useful for security. Maybe even the death of VPNs. This is also useful for scaling network resources to services as they need it.Short-term, things like &#34;Tesla Free Network&#34; could exist for their self-driving cars. Or, Uber offering free fast Internet to their drivers or a truly private device.Long-term, I am concerned about the emergence of private networks with different access. Such as a &#34;Google Network&#34; or a &#34;Netflix Network&#34; that offer different services or privacy levels at different costs.It&#39;s a crazy, scary, but also fun direction we are going.Edit: Final comment. If you think this might be the death of AT&amp;T with independent providers, think again . Amazon &amp; Co. and others like Google are bringing their developer platform, while the telecoms offer their infrastructure. It&#39;s a gross partnership that makes sense. When you send bits over the network -- everyone will be getting paid except you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me put my perspective, coming from a guy who is involved in private Cellular networking (US as well as other countries):1) Private 5G can be deployed either with licensed operator (Cellular provider) or in CBRS band (CBRS band is opened by FCC for the private cellular deployment). It can be used free or paid, different options. (Fees is minimal).2) CBRS still doesnt support 5G. No idea how AWS will provide. But even if it is private 4G, for the end user it doesnt matter.3) Your available bandwidth is limited by the air waves bandwidth you are using, nit by 4G or 5G. Per enterprise, CBRS band is limited to LTE equivalent band (20MHz). Total CBRS band is 200MHz, if I am not wrong). You are not going to get giga speed just because its 5G.4) Not all phones support CBRS band. You will be limited to CBRS band support in handset feature.
5) Each end device will need SIM (SIM card either physical or virtual). Its not like your laptop will be connected with private 4G or 5G. You will need modem as well as SIM card (unless your devices support these features).6) Its really for small geographic reason. Its not that easy to take the equipment with you and start using. (like in car or train etc).7) There is a concept of SAS server, that&#39;s why AWS device needs to be connected to this server in cloud (There are SAS license holders, to them). Once you install the system and that is connected to the SAS server, first you get the frequency band which is open in your area. If some one using that band (another CBRS player), you are out of luck (ask me , who has to call different teams when deploy in lab). PLus, there are scenarios when these licenses can be revoked (if you are using free band). The law enforcement can ask FCC to use the band temporarily. GCC can revoke your lic and stop the system.What AWS did is big, but for enterprises."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this quote from the manual:&lt;&lt;There are a class of &#34;ideal attractors&#34; in engineering, concepts like &#34;everything is an object,&#34; &#34;homoiconicity,&#34; &#34;purely functional,&#34; &#34;pure capability system,&#34; etc. Engineers fall into orbit around these ideas quite easily. Systems that follow these principles often get useful properties out of the deal.However, going too far in any of these directions is also a great way to find a deep reservoir of unsolved problems, which is part of why these are popular directions in academia.In the interest of shipping, we are consciously steering around unsolved problems, even when it means we lose some attractive features.&gt;&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are gettig an increasing amount of interesting Rust operating system for different uses.- Hubris for deep embedded- Redox OS for Desktop/Server (https://www.redox-os.org/)- Tock for embedded (https://www.tockos.org/)- Xous for trusted devices (https://xobs.io/announcing-xous-the-betrusted-operating-syst...)I assume there are more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an embedded real-time control project that is currently written in Rust, but runs with RTIC (https://rtic.rs/), a framework which is conceptually similar (no dynamic allocation of tasks or resources) but also has some differences. RTIC is more of a framework for locks and critical sections in an interrupt based program than a full fledged RTOS. Looking through the docs, here&#39;s the main differences (for my purposes) I see:1. In Hubris, all interrupt handlers dispatch to a software task. In RTIC, you can dispatch to a software task, but you can also run the code directly in the interrupt handler. RTIC is reliant on Cortex-M&#39;s NVIC for preemption, whereas Hubris can preempt in software (assuming it is implemented). This does increase the minimum effective interrupt latency in Hubris, and if not very carefully implemented, the jitter also.2. Hubris compiles each task separately and then pastes the binaries together, presumably with a fancy linker script. RTIC can have everything in one source file and builds everything into one LTO&#39;d blob. I see the Hubris method as mostly a downside (unless you want to integrate binary blobs, for example), but it might have been needed for:3. Hubris supports Cortex-M memory protection regions. This is pretty neat and something that is mostly out of scope for RTIC (being built around primitives that allow shared memory, trying to map into the very limited number of MPU regions would be difficult at best). Of course, it&#39;s Rust, so in theory you wouldn&#39;t need the MPU protections, but if you have to run any sort of untrusted code this is definitely the winner.Hubris does support shared memory via leases, but I&#39;m not sure how it manages to map them into the very limited 8 Cortex-M MPU regions. I&#39;m quite interested to look at the implementation when the source code is released.Edit: I forgot to mention the biggest difference, which is that because tasks have separate stacks in Hubris, you can do blocking waits. RTIC may support async in the future but for now you must manually construct state machines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope everyone considers themselves as working for themselves, regardless of the actual vehicle that attaches themselves to their current income stream (job or their own company or whatever...)Even self-employed, you still have many bosses (customers, etc). In fact _those_ bosses can be harder to fire depending on contracting terms... And you might find it harder to churn out the sales to maintain a steady income stream.Even company-employed, you still should frame things in working-for-yourself. What are you getting out of the relationship? Is the employer holding up its end for you?The traditional, paternalistic concept of employment is outmoded. It says your career growth should be managed by your employer (don&#39;t let it...). It presumes the work you do and your job are always 100% the same (they&#39;re not). It assumes a kind of one-sided evaluation of the employee, where the employer has all the power (very untrue these days)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These stories always feel like they picked a few good anecdotes and interviews, but they wanted to present it as a national trend to make it sound like a bigger deal.Indeed, the statistics they provide aren&#39;t as significant as the headline suggests:&gt; Hundreds of thousands of Americans are striking out on their own...For reference, the United States has around 160 million employed people. 0.1% of them moving to freelancing might be significant, but is it really a new era? That was happening on the regular well before COVID.1 in 1000 people striking out on their own doesn&#39;t really explain the &#34;ongoing  shake-up in the world of work&#34; like they&#39;re trying to suggest."</p>

We are lower middle class white Americans born and raised in the USA and have never traveled outside the country.I have no idea why they thought this about us.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like a good place to say that I strongly recommend Yasha Levine&#39;s Surveillance Valley book (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34220713-surveillance-va...) where he suggests that all of this is working as intended, going all the way back to the military counter-insurgency roots of the arpanet first in places like Vietnam, and then back home in anti-war and leftist movements. The contemporary themes that are relevant are the fact that current privacy movements like Tor, Signal, OTF, BBG are fundamentally military funded and survive on government contracts. It distracts from the needed political discourse into a technology one where &#34;encryption is the great equalizer&#34; and everyone can resist big brother in their own way on the platforms the government has built. Encryption does exist, but it also distracts from other vectors like vulnerabilities (that led to Ulbricht getting caught), what services you would e2e connect to, how you get the clients to connect to those services, what store can push binaries for said clients etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Meta argued that the regulator was “sending a chilling message to start-up entrepreneurs: do not build new companies because you will not be able to sell them.”This overlooks the traditional and perhaps now unpopular reason to start a company: making money by selling something useful. No need to sell the company. By the way, Facebook buys, does not sell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess I don&#39;t get it. This is based on speculative misuse - that FB may in the future deny access to Giphy to competitors.  So if you own a tool that your competitors may use then that&#39;s anti-competitive? Seems like that could apply to a lot of companies. Why not wait for actual misuse and base a case on that?Also what&#39;s so special about Giphy? Seems it could be duplicated fairly easily by any serious competitor.And competition being defined as other social media platforms? Pretty broad definition.Seems FB hatred is making bad law. And that bad law will bite others not just FB."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a UX problem on mobile. I have to click on something to make the GIF appear. What do I click? A link. Expected behavior of a link is to link me elsewhere, not to show a pop-up GIF, so I&#39;m immediately confused when that happens. I also can&#39;t figure out how to make the link actually link. Does it link anywhere? Is it even a link or just Jscript onClick thingy? Do I have to click on the GIF to make it link, because that&#39;s 2 clicks when precisely one is accepted link practice. Clicking to engage and then clicking again to disappear is super aggravating, especially on mobile screen, especially on such a long list. Click, click, click, click, click click, click, click. Ahhhh!This works well if I can hover over the links with a mouse to engage the pop-ups, which then disappear when I hover away. If I have to click on the links, like you do on mobile, then click again to dismiss, neither click actually linking to anything, it fails UX.Also, too much info in too small a space on mobile. Too much being communicated. Too dense. What UX test calls engineeritis. You need drill down pages for these links. If I click one, I expect a page with detailed information, a drill down, not a pop-up summary GIF.Mixed UX metaphors. Not lethal, but not quite there yet. Very cool, though, especially for the rapidity with which you were able to implement it, but it needs a bit more test on the UX side on mobile.A button toggle that displays a responsive, inline GIF as a drop-down, not pop-up, is perhaps the better solution, even if it&#39;s not quite as neat as what your creativity created. That would work as expected without damaging your intent, but that still involves click click click."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a wonderful surprise. DESQview (and anything early Quarterdeck) holds a special place in my heart.My uncle, Gary Pope, co-founded the company. I grew up with DESQview and QEMM as two of our primary pieces of software running on our computers.I moved onto Linux many years later, and used to have a Linux box as my primary machine, but with a DOS computer sitting next to it, DESQview/X loaded up, and would use DESQview/X as a makeshift second monitor by using it as an X11 display server.DESQview/X was based on X11R5, I believe, rather than X11R6, so I was a bit limited in terms of which software worked, but terminals were just fine.Anyway...A while back, I assembled all the DESQview/Quarterdeck material I had sitting around and put it up for others to look at. There&#39;s some stuff in here that you won&#39;t find anywhere else:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/htvf2edf3mrx0be/AABllqVhf0BzOytup...There&#39;s a README with some background, screenshots, marketing material, photos, product reviews, and even a paper that my mom wrote up about DESQ (the precursor to DESQview and DESQview/X), with a little bit of background on its development, back in 1984.Hope it proves interesting! :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember running DesqView (without the X) in the early 90&#39;s, it must have been on a 286 (is that possible?), I only got a 486 around 1994.I remember being impressed by the fact that I could run multiple applications at the same time and switch between them. I think I ran a BBS at the time (a combination of Frontdoor and something else... the memory is thin).I vaguely remember excitingly showing my parents, probably my mother, &#34;Look! I can run multiple applications and switch between them!!!&#34;, and she gave me a confused look of &#34;what the hell is this boy going on about&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with this is updates: there is no trusted publisher of binaries, and even if you pick one person to trust, oftentimes builds are 6 - 8 weeks out of date with Chromium which means you&#39;re susceptible to all the published zero-days.Tried building it myself and it takes 4 hours on my 32-core 5950x, and you still depend on someone actually porting a version bump because their patches need to be regenerated for every new chromium build.I like the idea of it in principle; if someone donates some CI time and we get official CI builds, plus getting more active with picking up new builds it&#39;ll be a real contender.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in a post-Thanksgiving charitable mood, so thank you, Jack. The execution hasn&#39;t been perfect (as has been commented on ad nauseam), but Twitter is the closest to a worldwide-accessible [1] Speaker&#39;s Corner [2] I know of, and that - despite all the completely valid criticism - is a valuable public service: mediating access to information has been the defining tool of control for those in power pretty much since civilization began, and I, for one, will always pick an imperfectly moderated cesspool over the prior status quo where a church or a government told me what&#39;s true and what to think. FWIW, you&#39;ve also championed transparency and decentralization for your platform more than any other SV social media titan [3].[1] If you have access to the Internet, that is.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few reflections on this announcement.1) Remember that CEOs of public companies are essentially unable to say what they think or want. The cost of doing it is being sued for damages, having to spend countless hours with lawyers, etc. Jack might think X, but he&#39;s only allowed to say Y, and he doesn&#39;t want to go beyond that because he doesn&#39;t want to fight that fight.Only people in a close circle really know what&#39;s going on, and it&#39;s most certainly not random people on the Internet (or HN).2) Also, consider that Twitter, and perhaps Facebook (sorry but I don&#39;t give a sh*t that its new name is Meta), are really difficult companies to run, especially if you&#39;d like to do some public good, as opposed to just maximizing returns.There are so many things that can go wrong, so many other things that will set your company on fire without warnings, and that doesn&#39;t give people the time to think strategically on how to tackle certain difficult scenarios.Twitter and Facebook essentially control most of the public discourse these days; never seen such amount of power in the hands of a few companies.3) Despite common opinion, I actually think that Twitter (unlike Facebook) has done more good than harm. Why? Because it has essentially enabled an incredible explosion of &#34;voices&#34; that can be heard (err, read) all over the world.4) Yes, we can think of countless ways to make Twitter better, but remember that Twitter is not run by Jack Dorsey, nor that other companies are run by their CEOs. Companies are run by boards, which means, by large funds with controlling interest in these companies. Even a well-intentioned CEO has to fight against many things his/her board want. And unlike enlightened CEOs, enlightened boards are essentially a very rare creature, almost never seen on planet Earth (IMHO).5) You might think I&#39;m defending Jack, perhaps I am, but it might be because hatred is really easy to dispense, while trying to be balanced in your judgement is really hard, and perhaps the conversation about Twitter should benefit from cooler heads, as opposed to quick slogans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It will be interesting to see how Twitter changes as a result. Twitter with selective following and setting your timeline to &#39;time order&#39; creates a pretty good environment for me. It feels like the equivalent of living in only a few chosen &#39;subreddits&#39; rather than getting the full frontal reddit experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been meaning to write almost exactly this blog post for a while now, glad that someone else did it.Two things that I think are worth calling out:1. In many ways Apple&#39;s anti-competitive behaviour on iOS/iPadOS is a blessing. It&#39;s one of the few things that keep Chromium&#39;s dominance in check. Of course, it&#39;s not great that Apple are stifling innovation like this, but consider the alternative: Chromium dominance on all platforms.2. Why it&#39;s worth caring about this at all? So what if Chromium is the only engine, it would make things easier for developers after all. To this I say, go read some of the discussions in standard bodies(for example about FLoC). Engineers from Apple and Mozilla are largely our bastion against Google&#39;s harmful proposals for the web. Pushback from Apple and Mozilla are only relevant as long as they have market share to speak of. The recent lawsuit against Google(summary[0]) by many US states should be extremely worrying to anyone that cares about the open web and it should make handing over any more control to Google a terrifying prospect.Mozilla maintains a list[1] of their positions on various standard suggestions that is also a useful resource.0: https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/145205393819534131...1: https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a depressing situation, particularly knowing that Firefox is pretty much kept alive at Google&#39;s whim. It makes one seriously wonder whether it is feasible at all to maintain an independent open-source web browser in 2021. People tend to blame Mozilla&#39;s management and I&#39;m sure there have been management failures but I&#39;m not sure what they could do to make Firefox a thriving, independent, sustainable browser. It seems that the market niche of tech-capable people who value privacy and customisation over a simplified UX is not capable of sustaining Firefox on its own. So Mozilla tries to move in Chrome&#39;s direction, removing configuration options and &#34;dumbing down&#34; the UI, which frustrates its existing user base (including me) while apparently also failing to eat into Chrome&#39;s market share.So what to do? Go back to being the quirky, heavily configurable browser we all know and love? That would be great for me, but even assuming Mozilla can afford to do that now (greater configurability leads to greater code complexity and therefore greater maintenance costs), experience seems to suggest it won&#39;t be enough to allow Mozilla grow its market share to a sustainable level.Finally, and this is a bit of a tangent, but I&#39;ve never quite understood why Mozilla got such a hard time from users about telemetry. I understand that telemetry is in general something to be suspicious of, but we&#39;re not talking about handing your data over to Google so they can target you with ads; we&#39;re talking about sharing technical data with a non-profit organisation to help them maintain and improve the browser you rely on. Mozilla are removing a feature you use daily? Okay, did you enable the telemetry that lets them know you use it? Receiving and analysing user data is increasingly important to delivering a good user experience. If open-source projects can&#39;t access the same data as proprietary ones do, we can&#39;t expect them to be able to react to user demands in the same way, and so we can&#39;t expect them to be able to compete in today&#39;s market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think part of this discussion needs to be that Firefox, while open source, doesn&#39;t provide footing for the community to build browser forks the way Chromium does. This sort of open usage, ironically, feels very fitting to the spirit of Firefox, but they&#39;re not even close to Chrom(e|ium).I&#39;ve been building a browser full time the past year+ (synth.app) and FF core wasn&#39;t really even an option. They&#39;ve done very little to make the engine usable outside of Firefox.Now I&#39;m sure there are a variety of savory and unsavory things that led here, but building that stuff out seems like a good way to grow the ecosystem. At least they would&#39;ve had a chance at capturing the Brave/Opera/Edge/etc market and those seats at the committees.This isn&#39;t to say that I&#39;m not worried about these standards merging like this. I&#39;ve spent many hours working out weird chromium only behaviors that websites rely on these days to do things (and egregiously so if they detect an agent remotely resembling chrome)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever I try to use something other than IntelliJ (generally VS Code) I&#39;m always struck by how awful the code completion and auto-imports are. I really hope we can get a lightweight editor with those two functions working properly.However, I don&#39;t see how you can do either of those features well without a lot of indexing of the codebase. And indexing is a major reason why IntelliJ so so clunky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just hope the remote development features will actually work adequately in this.They tried to get that stuff working with existing IDEs multiple times [0][1][2][3], but they are all broken in their unique ways.Whenever I see them announce something new in the remote development space I always jump in right away and try it out, discover it is broken too, and then go back to using VS Code remote dev features.For local dev I still use JB stuff, but it is simply too broken and awkward for remote.[0] https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-remote-in...[1] https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/[2] https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/11/29/introducing-remot...[3] https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who have worked around and at Stripe for the past decade, this is not a surprise. Stripe, and especially the founders, have a quite a poor reputation for screwing over people in and around their orbit.Almost every fintech startup has the story of Patrick reaching out about an acquisition, mining them for information playing along and then ghosting - same thing for candidates. They leadership team, specifically Patrick and Will Gaybrick are extremely smart but have screwed over a ton of people - be very careful about trusting.You don&#39;t hear anything about this online, they&#39;re incredibly effective at squashing hit pieces and have a huge amount of reporters and power brokers under their control. On HN and silicon valley Stripe and Patrick are a PR machine. Patrick has almost direct control over YC and HN, you&#39;ll notice that every single Stripe post automatically has pc as the first comment, regardless of anything else. Everything negative gets buried.With Patrick now living in Woodside, Will on permanent vacation in Malibu and John permanently in Ireland the company is definitely a bit in chaos mode internally. Their entire people team has turned over and they&#39;re having major retention issues - so I&#39;m not super surprised that stuff like this is starting to leak out.I run a $XB fintech, and am afraid to use my name given the backlash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had the opposite experience recently as an EM. Spent a few months trying to find a staff-level engineer. Found a great candidate who worked for a FAANG, worked to get our budget up to his expectations, sold him on the team, and he accepted our offer with a start date 6 weeks in the future so he could have time to wrap up his work. Fine, I&#39;m just happy to have filled the role after an arduous search. A few weeks go by, and he hasn&#39;t responded to my &#34;we&#39;re excited to have you join the team, etc&#34; email or any HR emails about filling out his paperwork. I call and email, the recruiter calls and emails, nothing. We never hear from him again..He&#39;s been active on social media so we know he&#39;s alive, and assume he parlayed our offer into a raise somewhere else. Ok, that happens, but to accept an offer and totally ghost? Jeez. I could have used those intervening weeks to interview more candidates had he just sent me a quick note, now I&#39;ve got to backfill his position while also trying to fill the new ones that just opened... I guess hiring is a shitshow from both sides sometimes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly enough, there has been a community project dedicated to keeping the last Winamp version alive (last version from the original creators), and it really great to use.https://getwacup.com/It includes a skin that allows it to work on modern display resolutions. It&#39;s really interesting to see just how low-res screens were when it was in it&#39;s hey-day, given that they are nearly unusable on a 4k monitor.Edit: I was too young to remember the releases, but replies are indicating that version 5 was in fact, not the most popular :P"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just can’t understand the point of the DMCA takedown here. This software is very dead and abandoned at this point, and the only thing bearing its name is vaporware that appears to be so distant from the original as to effectively not even compete with it.Of course, the copyright holders have every legal right to do so. But doesn’t it seem pointless? This codebase probably has more historical interest than commercial by now. Am I missing something?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question, as someone who actually used Winamp back in ~2004: why would you want to use it now?I have some nostalgia for it, sure, but what exactly does it actually offer you that something like VLC doesn&#39;t? It seems like it plays my music and videos competently enough, and I don&#39;t know anyone who actually uses Shoutcast anymore.This isn&#39;t a passive aggressive dig or anything, I would actually like to know."</p>

(On the other hand, 1080p projectors look great in my opinion.)* Most big brands such as LG, Samsung, etc. have &#34;commercial displays&#34; or &#34;digital signage&#34; that are dumb or at least have fewer problematic features. One kind you&#39;ll see is marketed for putting in hotel or hospital rooms. Another kind is marketed for displaying at e.g. a bar/restaurant, building lobby, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I get a horrible feeling in my stomach when I see these &#34;remote&#34; IDE options. I am very sure that they have their benefits, coding from a thin-client machine and having an &#34;always on&#34; session in the cloud ...But it feels like a slow errosion of our control and ownership of our tools. Where everything is becoming a rent-seeking opportunity and good tools are made available for a monthly rent.Personally I like having my whole build system, IDE, CI/CD on a machine I work at. I get this might not be for everyone, but I think we need to be careful what we give up long-term for these conveniences.Granted, I could just use VI and a terminal and nobody is forcing anyone to use anything ... but like many things, they are not like-choices.I depend on my tools, and the fewer dependencies to paid-montly SaaS features the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks very interesting.This was almost overdue. Since the beginning of Covid, the need for good remote code development raised quite a bit (at least for many people I know, including our team). When compared to VS Code and its remote editing over SSH, IntelliJ was really lacking. I know of a couple of people who went away from PyCharm just because of this.Related reports: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-19752, https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-226455I tried Code With Me but this seems limited to 10 minutes in the free version or so, and also not really intended for remote editing but more for pair programming.&gt; hosted in SpaceWhat does this mean? I have not really explored this so far. Can I host private own Space instances? I can imagine this would be a requirement in many environments.Is Space an alternative to GitHub or other hosting solutions? We would not want to move our code, issues and internal project management over to some other platform. We just want good remote editing support.Will there be a free community version of Fleet?Anyway, I applied for an invitation to Fleet Preview. Maybe I can get a chance soon to try it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile IntelliJ is rotting with months-old bugs that render entire features useless, with no fixes and no ETAs in sight. The only product that I pay money for that constantly, on almost every release, pains me with new bugs, a good portion of which are never fixed. I thought about using other Jetbrains products like DataGrip (and now this Fleet), but I&#39;m not going to invest even more into a company that simply refuses to fix bugs and regressions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the cool thing about this demo was that I remember when it was first submitted many years ago and thought it a cool demo that demonstrated the viability of WebGL which I expected to take off a lot quicker than it has.But I also recently came across madebyevan.com again by accident after researching the backing of different npm projects to assess which ones had good momentum or commercial backing behind them to assess their long-term viability, and noticed a lot of npm projects (~2M weekly) relying on esbuild [1] as a fundamental part of their build system due to its amazing performance [1].All good except that the foundational part of many npm projects feature is mostly being maintained by a single developer [2], a @evanw who was also prolific in responding to esbuild&#39;s issue catering for different peoples issues &amp; feature requests. I didn&#39;t think this level of investment in a popular OSS project was sustainable and hoped they had good sponsorship behind them, but was surprised that @evanw [3] didn&#39;t have sponsorships enabled which I thought strange as most authors of popular npm projects have good sponsorship, but upon further research it&#39;s because Evan Wallace&#39;s day job is as the CTO and cofounder of Figma - a popular company with ~10B valuation.Which is great in that esbuild isn&#39;t at risk of being sporadically abandoned from its lead developer joining a new/demanding startup, on the other hand a foundational project in npm&#39;s ecosystem is being developed in the spare time of a Co-founder &amp; CTO of a ~10B Co - who also creates great demos :)[1] https://github.com/evanw/esbuild[2] https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/graphs/contributors[3] https://github.com/evanw"</p>

If there is no responding honk, they will take the full width of the road (making the very tight turn easier and faster). Tourist drivers have to pick up on this :)In much of Europe oncoming cars flash their lights to warn others about dangers and (especially) speed traps or police checks, so they can slow down in time.Here in Lithuania, flashing your warning lights (the four orange ones on the corners of the car) means thanks, for example if you let someone merge from one of the very short onramps. I&#39;ve never seen this in Germany, where onramps are however much longer.And amongst truck drivers it&#39;s pretty wide-spread to blink right to tell a following car you think it&#39;s safe for them to overtake you and blink left when you think it no longer is. At least on long roads where there are no obvious right turns. I flash them a grateful hand sign when passing their mirror."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, time to throw in the explanation I grew up with. I always thought it was definitive, but turns out its not. Unfortunately I have already passed on this urban legend :P.On foggy roads in north India, it is difficult to see vehicles on the road. So lights were used to indicate the status of big vehicles like trucks. Two lit bulbs on left and right corners (illuminating Horn Please) meant honk to get a pass. And to indicate you can overtake, the driver could light one bulb in the middle (illuminating a OK) to indicate its ok to take over. Eventually this system was scrapped but the tradition to paint &#34;Horn OK please&#34; remained.(my god the theory is falling apart in my own head as I retell it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A reminder that pretty much no lorry driver in india knows English. Vehicles here have inane phrases like this and it’s for the most part almost protocol to paint them when you get a vehicle of that class. The guy who paints Lorry backs with the company name probably asks “you want the horn ok please phrase right” and the drivers probably like yeah whatever.Not like the drivers here expect courtesy from anyone around them. If anything they expect (and return in kind) douchebaggery. It’s like playing gta. Of course you expect every passerby to steal your car and you act accordingly.Similarly auto rickshaws all over Tamil Nadu used to ubiquitously have the phrase “the age for a woman to get married is 21”. Similar bullshit reason (though in this case the govt might have mandated it at some point, memory unclear). Thankfully it’s disappeared nowadays."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(my day job is developer on Proof-of-Stake Algorand block chain, I&#39;m a developer, this may not be polished official PR)
Article&#39;s theory about malicious old blocks doesn&#39;t hold up. Let&#39;s say I start a new node and verify history since the beginning. Somewhere along the line I&#39;m connected to a malicious node which hands me a fictionalized block. It would need to have been signed by not just one but about 30-45 accounts _which had stake at that time_. Proof-of-Stake attacks aren&#39;t about having 51% of the CPU that overwhelms a Proof-of-Work system, but about having 60-70% of the _value_ in the network. So, if Warren Buffet comes along and wants to spam our network, I guess he could, but that would destroy the network and destroy his value that he sunk into the network. _That_ is a guardrail for PoS systems as much as any crypto or consensus-protocol element (and the algorithms are right, original article misunderstands them)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PoW systems rely on the &#34;phone a friend method&#34; as well. When you download a Bitcoin client from a &#34;friend&#34;, you are trusting them to honestly introduce you to the network. If you fall asleep for a period of years, you have to trust your friends to honestly inform you of all of the PoW forks and policy changes that have occurred over that interval. The only difference is that PoS blockchain clients must be bundled with a modestly-recent block hash along with the thousands of lines of code that you have no practical way to audit.The problem eventually reduces to Ken Thompson&#39;s &#34;Trusting Trust&#34; [1] problem. There&#39;s no way to externally validate the honesty of any system (cryptocurrency, or otherwise).[1] https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_Ref..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proof of work has always had an economic flaw that you could theoretically temporarily rent enough mining power to perform double spends of more value than the cost of renting those devices.But this attack has never been performed because the reality of all these cryptocurrencies is that the security depends only relatively weakly on proof of work. Instead it relies on trust between the main stakeholders: miners, big nodes and developers. This is just like any other human organisation. That trust is only reinforced by proof of work, making it easier for new parties to become trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The one thing that I find is not helpful, is the “litmus test” approach.i.e. “You are a bad programmer/engineer/scientist/person, because you did not read this book, or know this technique.” Thing.I see this frequently. As a [mostly] self-taught software developer, I’ve been on the receiving end of a lot of this behavior.In my case, I have a real “Oh yeah? I’ll show you!” streak. I became expert at stuff, simply because some e-bully told me I was bad at it (because they were the only ones fit to judge others).Not everyone has that kind of stubbornness. I suspect that a hell of a lot of truly gifted folks never realized their passions, and that our industry has been robbed of significant talent, as a result.Maybe I’m looking at the past with rose-colored glasses, or I was fortunate to run into the people I did, but I don’t recall encountering a lot of this behavior, when I was getting started. I needed a lot of help and nurturing, when I was younger, until I reached the confidence level required to have an “Oh yeah?” response. I’m grateful that I got it.&#34;A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a joke or worried to death by a frown on the right person&#39;s brow.&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me or do other people struggle to read these kinds of very technical books?It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t comprehend, it&#39;s that my brain finds it boring and hard to focus. I think I have trained my brain so much on rapid skimming of websites for useful info, while throwing away most of the content, that I tend to do the same with books, which really doesn&#39;t work well.Has anyone found alternative ways to consume this information for brains that work like mine?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that changed my career as a software engineer, in terms of seniority &amp; remuneration by time and effort, was by changing my efforts from learning arbitrary tech to learning the domain I worked in. Asking useful domain-related questions gets you noticed in stand ups and helps you write the right code. I work in fintech so the best bang for my buck I’ve had was reading an entry level cert in investment finance.I think the generic bit of this advice is to excel as an engineer is to focus on the business, not the tech."</p>

But it&#39;s a major in modern public discourse, and one for once that I&#39;m quite willing to lay heavily at the feet of the public education system. Easily one of the most valuable classes I took in my entire time K-12 was AP Probability &amp; Stats as a sophomore, but that was an entirely optional class with restricted openings anyway (a single teacher in a school of 1200+) which the vast majority never took even where it was offered. Yet interpreting the deluge of data in the modern world requires some level of being able to reason about things probabilisticly and have a sense of what actually goes into a measure of &#34;significance&#34;, null hypothesis and the danger of result-driven analysis finding links that don&#39;t exist and/or cannot possibly be causitive, how sampling a population works and what the error bars look like at different sizes, random vs biased distributions, the underlying distributions, confounding factors etc. I really wish in general kids got started on some light probability thinking as early as possible, in elementary school even, without any real math (let alone calc and such) yet, but just some initial stuff to start to illustrate the mindset. Lots of very fun games and hands-on exercises with dice and so on use or could be made to use important aspects of probability and its misuse.At any rate, I&#39;m certainly not an expert.

SQLite will expand it to a double, and it can&#39;t store NaNs. And probably more overhead to be able to support storing strings in my REAL column.

Everything else doesn&#39;t really matter.Imagine you&#39;re a legal department. You have to choose between DocuSign, which you know the court will accept, or a competitor. DocuSign costs 10x as much as the competitor. But that&#39;s nothing compared to the cost of litigation, or worse, the cost of losing litigation.

An alert lawyer will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on. If the man who is to receive the treasure is unused to wealth, has an inferiority complex and shapeless feelings of guilt, as most people do, the lawyer can often take as much as half the bundle, and still receive the recipient’s blubbering thanks.”- Kurt Vonnegut, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; legally binding way to put signatures and timestamps on a PDF.IANAL, but the idea that a signature is what makes a contract legally binding is not exactly true. It is a symbol of the acceptance of the contract, but legal acceptance can take many forms - so whether you use a service to signify acceptance, or just sign it using acrobat or Adobe&#39;s site, or even just a verbal agreement... those are all valid acceptance, legally speaking.DocuSign&#39;s use case is not the signing, but the management of those documents and signatures - tracking which documents are sent, which have been read (yes, the doc owner can get notified when you even look at a Docusign document), which have been signed, and being able to store copies of signed docs. It is mostly for the companies sending you contracts, not for you as the signer."</p>

I&#39;m confident in my ability to solve problems, but I&#39;m missing a solid understanding of the fundamentals.I already have a BS in Materials Engineering, and I have mixed feelings about returning to university. Tuition has doubled since I graduated, and I&#39;m perfectly capable of teaching myself. The authors of teachyourselfcs.com have some strong opinions on CS masters degrees, though I would consider it if I found a topic that really called out to me AFTER I had built those fundamentals.I have plenty of savings, but I&#39;m worried that my effort will be wasted if it doesn&#39;t come with an exclusive piece of paper at the end. Will it be an obstacle, or am I worried over nothing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; They thought they needed to build a machine learning model when they really needed to build an entirely new organization, one that possessed the technical and cultural mindset necessary to succeed in this space.I totally agree.  It&#39;s not impossible to imagine their model working: why couldn&#39;t you serve as a market-maker for homes at a large scale, especially with the unique insights Zillow could have based on their datasets.However I think where the hubris lay is in how they thought they could leapfrog all the way to an automated solution before building a competency as a house-flipping company.From what I understand, where they failed was partly in building a rich enough model to properly account for the less easily quantifiable elements which ultimately account for a property&#39;s value.  I.e. the price per square foot might make a property look like a steal, while something like a sewer main nearby, or problematic neighbor could radically change the value proposition to anyone standing at the site.  That&#39;s a non-trivial problem to solve for even the best ML and it&#39;s not clear how you would automate this.If you ask me, instead of focusing on building an automated price discovery system, they should have started by trying to build a quality home-flipping organization, and figuring out how to super-charge manual work using their datasets.  Over time you might find ways to optimize the process and increase the level of automation to scale output relative to head-count."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good riddance. If large-scale house flipping took off, we might actually end up in a scenario where housing was treated as a speculative asset, with empty houses getting flipped between investors looking to make a quick buck, further lowering the supply of actual places to live (because housing units remain empty while being flipped), driving up the cost for families who just want a place to live. Oh wait..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;data is fungible?&#34; i think the author does not understand what fungibility means. if something is fungible, that means that any unit of it is exactly the same as any other unit of it. fungible data would be random data, which wouldn&#39;t help you predict or model anything.i think zillow also did not understand what fungibility means. real estate is not fungible. in fact, it&#39;s anti-fungible- that&#39;s why there are huge diligence processes that exist around most real estate transactions. maybe floors in an office building may be fungible, but residences are definitely not- with all their quirks, customizations and problems.this whole argument that they failed because the ceo of zillow didn&#39;t have big balls is pretty putrid. pair this with the word salad of misused words and twisting of quotes and i&#39;d say this is probably one of the worst pieces i&#39;ve ever seen posted here. i feel worse for having given it any time at all.the simple fact is that the ceo of zillow didn&#39;t know what they were doing, had a team that (supposedly) applied facebook&#39;s infrastructure scaling prediction library to house prices and then attempted to apply a market making mindset to the real estate market at scale. not only is this probably something nobody should try to do, considering we contribute so much in tax dollars to first time homebuying incentives as it&#39;s recognized that the housing market is where j q public can start to build wealth, it&#39;s also probably something that nobody could do (well, at scale, with machines) given that housing is not fungible.sure, financial instruments are fungible, maybe even late model cars, but definitely not houses. doesn&#39;t take a scientist to spot that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One example of quality design which I gleaned from reading Don Norman&#39;s &#34;The Design Of Everyday Things&#34; is the metal plate I&#39;ve frequently seen on doors which are meant to be pushed.The only affordance of such a plate is its push-ability, and the fact that someone actively installed a metal plate (instead of just relying on the door&#39;s natural flatness), as well as its location at the point of maximum leverage (all the way to the right of the door, in the door&#39;s vertical center), is a clear signifier for such push-ability.Not only that, but it does its job without offering any other confusing affordances (such as a vertical handle which is also technically pushable, but which many would interpret as being meant to be pulled).Whenever I need a relatable, succinct example of affordances and signifiers for my engineering comrades, I turn to this one.  Anyone interested in design is doing themselves a dis-service by not reading Don Norman&#39;s classic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BitTorrent is amazing. It just works. Anyone anywhere can create a torrent of their files, dump the magnet link somewhere, and everyone else can reliably retrieve it. It is self-reinforcing; the more people using a torrent, the better the robustness, redundancy and download speeds. You can often get better speeds from downloading something via torrent than from a web server. It&#39;s an open protocol that is relatively easy to implement, it has a diversity of lightweight clients for all OSes and is fairly resistant to censorship. To me it&#39;s pretty much perfect tech that solves a real problem. I hope Bram Cohen got rich off of it somehow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is factually incorrect when it talks about &#34;SEPA payments&#34;, claiming they are a &#34;pull&#34; mechanism. What it probably meant to talk about, is SEPA Direct Debits -- where the counterpart charges your account, as opposed to you paying the counterpart. Given that these direct debit agreements are revokable at any point in time, I doubt the claims of very high fraud rate.A normal SEPA payment, is a &#34;push&#34; affair. These have (for all intents and purposes, though not technically) been a thing ever since the euro was introduced, whereas SEPA Direct Debit is more recent, replacing many of the existing domestic direct debit schemes.Then there&#39;s the Instant Payments bit: these are a thing but they&#39;re not used all that often (yet?). Most banks charge a hefty fee for an instant payment (mine charges €1.25). Some banks don&#39;t offer them at all. Adoption will grow and costs will decrease over time.In most countries, payments within the same bank have been instant (and free) for a very long time. This is one of the reasons why many companies have accounts with multiple banks.I&#39;m sure some &#34;weaker&#34; european countries may have laxer fraud controls, but that&#39;s a temporary problem. ECB reporting is quite strict, and most banks do take fraud detection very seriously. Reputation is important for a bank, and if you&#39;re a truly disreputable bank you&#39;ll soon find yourself without friendly correspondent banks. Then you&#39;ll have a choice: fix your fraud problems, or become a useless island."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Odd not to touch on Open Banking and PSD2 in Europe; as that is basically the future he is talking about.In essence; financial institutions are legislated to add customer friendly UX and fraud prevention on top of standard bank to bank transfers. It&#39;s effectively a set of APIs that orchestrate it all, with things like dynamic linking to the payment and secure authentication rules for anti fraud.The idea is for commercial offerings to build on top of the standard APIs (for example, to offer bank transfers in checkouts). In practice it&#39;s taking a bit to get off the ground - but providers like Tink (sold to Visa for a lot of money) and Truelayer and starting to get traction.Australia and MENA region are heading down the same route.https://www.openbanking.org.uk/Edit; for clarity, SEPA was the early moves to normalise what the European banks were doing from around 2008 onwards - and ended up with PSD1 rationalising it. As others have said this blog mostly only actually focuses on the direct debit element of SEPA not the credit payment side."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When discussing Europe, you can&#39;t leave out the rise of mobile payments that work similar to India&#39;s UPI.For instance, in Sweden, &#34;Swish&#34;[0] has quickly taken over the market for casual payments, with free, instant, irreversible bank transfers between individuals using only the recipients phone number (or a QR code).They are a bunch of these systems, but currently they are all fractured into national systems, although work has started on adding interoperability[1][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swish_(payment)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Mobile_Payment_System..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m 42 and have stopped paying attention to titles and all the traditional organizational paradigms that are losing relevance.I feel like the ability to work from home in my sweats on simple problems as a senior engineer and receive a 75th percentile income relative to my neighbors in one of the best neighborhoods in my new home state is the most societal progress I will ever experience in my lifetime. I&#39;m a lifelong bachelor by choice. Why bother striving for anything career wise when I am on track to retire comfortably to focus on my mostly free hobbies no later than the age of 50? For a house with a 3rd bedroom I don&#39;t need?No, best to appreciate what I have and leave the striving for the next generation of engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The big tech companies (ie. FANG) all have huge demand for principal+ engineers and know how to scope and support them properly.  The size means they have lots of them which reduces the snowflake nature of the role and makes career development, salary support, etc… more standardized.  Since they are large, there can be some variance, but overall they are a good option if you are interested.  I don’t know where in EU you are, but most of FANG has roles in EU and some even do remote as well.Smaller companies tend to want principal engineers in theory, but as you are finding they can often struggle with how to utilize them properly.  Often you see them playing a Chief Architect role or something similar which is more hybrid with PM than pure tech.  So getting PM skills could help set you up for this direction as well.Finally, you have said you did management for a bit before, so you should know if this is an interesting path or not.  This is a very different role, so I would recommend you do this only if you have the passion and desire to do this full time.  Most principal engineers I know have done management for a bit and gained a lot of skills related to it, but ultimately wasn’t what they wanted to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I turned 40 recently and have gone the route of very flexible employment (~16 hrs per week remote) at Sr software engineer salary. This gives me the freedom to do basically anything I want for more than half the day with very low stress. For the past decade nobody at my several places of employment has had reason to know how few hours I work because I’m always the top performer.I’m intending now to build software outside of the day job until I’m bootstrapped into doing that full time. I feel this is a setup which absorbs risk while giving both future opportunity and a high quality of life in the meanwhile.I’m tempted at times to go for some super high paid position which I’m very qualified for, but it always comes back to a preference for near total freedom to live my life."</p>

I&#39;m guessing Zip is hoping most people are closer to the latter than the former.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these discussion about APR and napkin math and installment is missing the point a bit, in my opinion.My problem is not even that Edge collects unnecessary and allows what could be called a most intrusive third party add into its browser per se, I am mostly amazed by how incredibly tacky this looks and feels from Microsoft&#39;s side.Like, imagine buying a Lexus and discovering they are advertisements for a cheap off-brand energy drink plastered on the interior.I find it straight up incredible that Microsoft somewhat achieved to overcome the meme status of its browser after what, fifteen years, and now this? Passing on the the crown of being the lowest common denominator tech joke to someone else, gaining a little bit of market share and even one or two positive reviews in respected outlets...only to risk it all in this weird move of behaving like a shady car salesman for what must a be a double digit million deal at most, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are incredibly reluctant to believe that ailments might actually be partly or mainly psychological. Chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, chronic lyme disease, back pain, are all things that sincere people truly are suffering from...that may be mainly psychological/psychosomatic but lots of people refuse to consider it. Probably due to the general dismissal of mental illnesses and being told for years &#34;it&#39;s all in your head&#34;. I think partly, people with these conditions are sometimes accused (or think they&#39;re being accused) of malingering; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case very often, I think they legitimately feel the symptoms they report, but the root cause may be in the mind/brain rather than the rest of the body.Yes, some back pain is due to repetitive stress injuries or physical structures out of place or whatever. But as this study shows, looks like it has a strong psychological component as well. I suspect we&#39;ll (some day) get better treatments for all the things I mention, if mental illness stigma ends and they can be honestly considered from all possible causes.Edit: to be clear, I&#39;m not saying that all cases of back pain or CFS or whatever are psychosomatic - just that it shouldn&#39;t be dismissed, especially when the treatments are relatively low-risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometime in 1990 I injured my back. I still remember the details. The injury was caused by a strong sneeze while I was bent over picking up a briefcase. In a single second, I couldn&#39;t stand, I couldn&#39;t get up off of my knees. It was really quite bad. I went to a few doctors and got advice, but it was more along the lines of it looks like degenerative disk disease. In a few weeks the pain went away and my back felt completely normal.I am posting this in the hope that some HN reader will find it useful.Since that original &#34;injury&#34; other seemly small stresses on my back, especially when leaning over or twisted to one side can trigger this sharp sudden onset persistent back pain. Even sleeping in the wrong bed while traveling can cause me problems. The strange thing is, it goes away on its own after a few weeks and then I feel fine. If I was a yoga practitioner I would believe that yoga was curing it, if I went to a chiropractor then I would believe that  chiropractic was curing my back, and if I was a meditator then I would believe that meditation was curing my back. Back issues like mine get better on their own after a few weeks, this explains why there is such a wide range of &#34;cures&#34; for back problems in general despite the wide variety of causes, some of which won&#39;t &#34;get better&#34; on their own.Of course I&#39;ve been to doctors, and the radiological diagnosis is degenerative disk disease, but I think this is common for any person with back pain and no obvious physical cause. Everyone thinks they know what is wrong. And I think that some of them are right and some of them are wrong.I don&#39;t believe that it has anything to do with my psychological state. I&#39;ve been through many stressful events in my life and had to work and live under high levels of mental pressure, I&#39;ve been happy, sad, frustrated on and off over the years--most people have. These states are not correlated in the least with the onset of my back pain. On the other hand, recovery could be affected by one&#39;s psychological state, being able to relax the back muscles so that back can heal requires some ability to deal with the mind-body issues and the anxiety causes by pain.I had a trainer that was always stressing functional fitness. This definitely didn&#39;t seem to be useful and was sometime injurious. Throwing medicine balls again a wall and doing every exercise one handed while balancing on one leg weren&#39;t helpful. The issue for me was the twisting that was encouraged by this training philosophy. Simply keeping fit and keeping my weight down were much more helpful.The best advice I got was from a consultation with a neurosurgeon. This physician was trained to do back surgery but uniquely also treated patients with alternative therapies when surgery wasn&#39;t clearly indicated. She encouraged me to take vitamin D, omega-3 supplements, and curcumin to reduce inflammation. This has been helpful to me, reducing the frequency, severity, and duration of my back problems. Consulting with her also reduced my anxiety over pain and this might be mitigating the severity of the episodes.Golf -- the was very bad for me, an hour at the driving range could produce debilitating pain that made walking even with a cane almost impossible. I was just learning--maybe I was doing it wrong.Running and jogging -- these didn&#39;t seem to bother my back at the time I was doing it. I was able to train for and run marathons and even a wild cross country obstacle course race. I&#39;m not a great runner, but I was able to place well in my age group. What I found was that marathon training is time consuming and leads to some muscle imbalances. My lower back (and upper body too) got weaker because my exercise was just running. The tightness in my lower back from hours of running also gave me concern and occasional, brief, but significant discomfort in my lower back. Overall though, I didn&#39;t feel that my back bothered me any more than the typical running overuse injuries, like planter fasciitis, knee pain, or IT band pain afflicting my fellow runners. I was able to finish all of the marathons I started training for (training takes around 7 months if you already do a bit of jogging). I hope this encourages people to remain active if their back pain is like mine (I understand that there are many types). I do wonder if so much running could be hard on the disks, does anyone know?Brazilian Jujitsu -- I had to give it up. I never got hurt, but I felt it was the sort of thing that a senior citizen with back problems should not be doing.Sitting and sleeping -- surprising to me was that thick memory foam mattresses that was supposed to be good for backs (Tempur-Pedic back in the 90s) bothered my back while a very firm mattress on top of a solid platform didn&#39;t. For the sake of my spouse, I found that one of the Casper mattresses works for both of us.Some chairs are great, and some end up causing me back issues. The Zero Gravity Recliner is great, but now they seem very pricey. I got my unmotorized one years ago. When I have a bad episode of pain, sitting in it is one of the only ways I can get relief.I use an adjustable height standing/sitting desk with a Motion Stool by UPLIFT. The adjustable desk helps me be things just right, and I&#39;ve discovered that chairs like the Motion Stool, while requiring some getting use to, allow me to work for hours at my desk without discomfort.It&#39;s really terrible to be in bad back pain, but for me, I&#39;ve found some adjustments to my lifestyle have allowed me to be very happy and to hold off on employing more drastic measures for thirty year so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This treatment is based on the work of Dr John Sarno - who I first heard of here on HN almost 10 years ago. And of all the wonderful things I’ve discovered on HN, Dr Sarno’s work is probably the one that’s had the biggest positive impact on my life.When I first heard about his approach to chronic pain, I was pretty skeptical. But I’d tried everything else to solve my debilitating RSI, and nothing else had worked despite only being in my early 20s, so I was willing to give it a try. 6 months later, I was back working pain-free after being out of action for 2 years.As patmcc mentions, people can be incredibly reluctant to believe that physical pain can have psychological causes. And in many cases, there are underlying physical issues, so this should certainly not be your first approach to treatment. But if you’ve tried everything and nothing works, I encourage you to take a look at Sarno’s work. It made a world of difference for me and for many others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am confused, this seems more like a general math cheatsheet. The only thing that truly has anything to do with theoretical CS are the definitions for the O-notation on the first page (and most CS students don&#39;t need a cheat-sheet for that) and the master theorem. Nothing on P, NP, NP-hardness or completeness, formal languages (Chomsky hierarchy?), finite automata, Turing machines, halting problem, decision problem, reduction proofs, Pumping lemma, Gödels incompleteness theorem, etc. This sheet would have been of very little help in any theoretical computer science exam I ever took. The only cheat sheet I ever needed in theoretical CS was Schönings book &#34;Theoretische Informatik - kurz gefasst&#34; (&#34;A short overview of theoretical CS&#34;, well, it has ~180 pages...), which is pretty standard in German universities. It was completely worn out after my first semester + exam of theoretical CS... here is a TOC: http://www.gbv.de/dms/hebis-mainz/toc/094349797.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s just me, but when a cheatsheet reaches 10 pages and includes multiple areas like this one I&#39;d just split it up into multiple ones. It almost feels like this needs a table of contents.And I think a bit more theoretical CS stuff, maybe a few diagrams, would be more helpful than e.g. the Pythagorean theorem or the powers of 2 which shouldn&#39;t be a problem to just memorize at that level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is only a showcase of TeX, the actual value of this cheat-sheet seems pretty low.I used to know most of this when I was in uni, including how to derive it when I needed it. Back then this kind of cheat-sheet would not have helped me apply my knowledge. The actual knowledge was very clear in my head from solving problems, or I remembered some key idea used during derivation and from there could work out the rest.If you need this kind of cheat-sheet you don&#39;t understand the concepts deep enough.Unfortunately most of this knowledge is now 15 years later either very fuzzy or completely lost from my mind. I guess that happens when it is not being refreshed/applied during the career I chose.This cheat-sheet serves a reminder of how much knowledge I have lost ;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey!We wondered what to do to make building layouts even faster while adding more fun elements to our daily work. After a while, the inspiration came! Why not randomize the components while having fun, like at a slot machine in a casino?The idea generator combines available UI components into finished layouts. You choose the technology, the library, click &#34;Shuffle!&#34; and boom, ready-made layout. Click again, and you have a new layout.Based on our No AI®, and No Blockchain®, and Pure Random® technology. ;)What do you think?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wonderful idea, great implementation!Would love to see you guys partnering with TailwindUI somehow. That&#39;s my default go-to ui widgets library (it&#39;s not open source, so it might be challenging to find a proper partnership model with them).Just bought a lifetime subscription. And as I already do have subscription - my last recommendation is to switch to monthly subscription model as soon as you can. Monthly subscriptions is just so much more profitable pricing model:)Congrats again on shipping great product!Edit: typos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is neat! I’ll add it to my box of no/low-code tools.I do feel like not letting the homepage itself shuffle its layout is a missed opportunity for showcasing the product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Around 6 or 7 years ago, I went to a quantum computing conference and presented about a then newly developed quantum programming language that could run on a real quantum computer, showing a 1/2 decent simulation of dihydrogen energy in terms of bond length.I authored a paper about this quantum programming language but had no way to post it to the arXiv. I&#39;m not a traditional academic, but I had posted on the arXiv before, long ago, at a previous job. Problem was that my arXiv credentials were associated with that job&#39;s long lost email.I gave the presentation in a giant ballroom, and afterward, sat down at my assigned spot at one of these large circular tables. Next to me, during a brief coffee break, an old man I didn&#39;t recognize told me my talk was very interesting, and asked me if my paper was published yet. &#34;Not yet; we haven&#39;t chosen a journal. And posting to the arXiv is delayed, because my account is locked, so a colleague is planning to post on my behalf.&#34;The man responds, &#34;Oh, it should be possible to fix that.&#34; I said that I figured as much and have just procrastinated contacting the admins. &#34;They&#39;re at Cornell right?&#34;He said, &#34;No, I mean, I can fix that. You said your name was Reikon Musha right?&#34;He opens his clunky laptop and continues, &#34;I&#39;m not supposed to do this. But I&#39;m certain that if you gave an invited talk here, you&#39;re definitely not spoofing your name. Maybe you can show me your ID? No, no, just kidding.&#34;He continues clicking around. &#34;Was xyz@example.com your old address? What&#39;s your new one?&#34; I answered yes, and gave him my new address. He typed it in and said, &#34;straight into the database it goes; just go and reset your password now.&#34;I was absolutely puzzled. I said, &#34;Thanks?? Who are you?&#34;He says, as a matter of fact, &#34;I&#39;m Paul, I invented the arXiv.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago (think: 1994) scientists (mainly CS folks) published papers on the web as postscript files.  Actually, they were usually on FTP sites, not the web, as almost nobody used the web at the time.  I developed a huge aversion to postscript (it was clunky and the renderers weren&#39;t great) but the idea that every bit of published science would be freely available on the web seemed completely and totally obvious to me.When I later became an academic, I learned that when you write a paper and submit it, conditions for publication typically include signing away the copyright to the journal, possibly with a license to distribute a few preprints offline.My advisor at the time pointed out that he actually modified the contract (changing the terms to retain copyright), signed it and sent it back (no journal ever complained, and all his papers are available as PDFs online).arxiv is the closest thing to what I dreamt of some decades ago and I&#39;m thrilled that Paul is receiving recognition.  Personally, I think arxiv is a better path forward than scihub, entirely due to its &#34;legitimacy&#34;.  In the future, I will always work to &#34;publish&#34; on arxiv and not put my work in journals (fortunately, I am not in a publish or perish situation).My only complaint is that I don&#39;t particularly like PDF and wish there was an HTML-zip format that could be sent around and the browser did all the rendering work, while the udnerlying data tables are stored in well-defined formats so they can be programatically extracted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Nobel Prize in Physics often goes to &#34;tooling&#34; experimental work.  Think: blue LEDs, CCDs, fiber optics, optical tweezers, things like that.  Not that anybody asks me, but I would advocate a similar tooling award split between Berners-Lee (www), Knuth (TeX), and Ginsparg (arXiv).  I can think of no people who had a more profound change in how physics is actually practiced."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a famous Pieter Bruegel painting from 1562 called &#34;The Triumph of Death&#34; that someone contrasted with a &#34;typical scene in a US department store on Black Friday&#34; here[1].It might take a few seconds to tell apart the painting from the Black Friday store. ;-)        • • •

The original painting[2] has a gem[3] in the corner of it (that&#39;s not visible in[1]): where death is wreaking havoc, and a pair of lovers, oblivious to it, are playing guitar and singing.  In that frame, you&#39;ll see death also playing guitar right behind them, in a neat visual rhyme, implying that their fate is sealed too.[1] https://www.devblog.no/sites/devblog.no/files/styles/800px_w...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triumph_of_Death[3] You have to zoom into the lower right corner to see it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triumph_of_Death#/media/Fi..."</p>

I&#39;ve recently started watching this repo as it&#39;s quite interesting reading about the different variants popping up across the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever you hear news about mutated COVID and how fast it spreads there are a few important things to remember.1. Viruses are constantly mutating, its kind of their thing.2. Most mutations do absolutely nothing or are actually harmful to the virus.3. When a new mutation is noted to be spreading fast its usually because of the nature of super spreader events and not because the new mutation is more or less transmissible.4. Scientist and health officials should absolutely be keeping an eye on these things.[0] Vincent Racaniello - SARS-CoV-2 UK variant: Does it matter 
https://youtu.be/wC8ObD2W4Rk"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really simple: If this new variant does nothing more than previous versions to increase mortality, particularly among the increasingly vaccinated population, obsessing over its spread should be considered pointless and absurd. For one thing, it wouldn&#39;t work without endless other streams or authoritarian security theater measures (that in any case themselves don&#39;t really work most of the time) And for another thing, &#34;stop the spread&#34; is an idiotic notion without heavy qualification. Stop death? Sure, Stop large quantities of hospitalizations? That too, albeit with cost/benefit calculations applied to all measures, but stopping spread itself for its own sake? Absurd paranoia that has no merit the moment the thing spreading stops being a truly widespread threat. We have lived with colds and flus for all our history without obsessing over their spread. COVID among those who are already immunized or vaccinated is comparably dangerous to common flu strains."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They bury the lede in the last fucking paragraph.  The reason this toaster is immensely better than the toaster you have at home is very, very simple: this toaster&#39;s 1949 price would be hundreds of dollars in 2021 terms.You can still buy really, truly excellent toasters made for industrial/commercial use, or for the homes of the very rich, and they&#39;re quite a lot better than the trash people keep in their houses.  And they cost a lot more, too.  Last time I checked, a commercial 2-slice toaster was in the $300-$400 range.This is true for lots of home appliances.  My favorite example is the Kitchenaid mixer.  The modern mixers are very thoroughly &#34;value engineered&#34; to keep the price down.   If you want to buy an original &#34;Kitchenaid,&#34; like they made in the 1930s, you can call up Hobart and buy a miniature mixer.  And it will cost you ~$2,000 in 2021, just as it did in 1935.You can have the good toaster, the good mixer, etc, but it sure looks like people don&#39;t actually want that.  The pattern of product offerings in your average store suggests people want something affordable, and it doesn&#39;t particularly matter whether it is good at its job."</p>

I would love to see that smart appliances would have continued to evolve in this direction. I don&#39;t like the current state of smart appliances, but going back to the absolute basic seems like an over-reaction to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As Java is generally the fastest GC&#39;d language, what&#39;s the current state of Java gamedev?Once upon a time, this indie Java game called Minecraft became the most successful game of all time.But from the few minutes of research I just did, Java cannot be deployed to many commercially important systems  - Nintendo Switch
  - PlayStation
  - iOS

It appears Java is only still viable for Windows and Android, and the 1% Linux desktop market.There used to be the GCJ project which would in theory let you run Java anywhere you had a C/C++ compiler, but Oracle&#39;s litigiousness killed that because the Java[TM] &#34;platform&#34; must run the official Java[TM] bytecode.It appears C# via Monogame lets you deploy to all desktops (Win/Mac/Linux), mobiles (iOS/Android), and consoles (PS/Switch/Xbox). So ironically C# seems to now be the &#34;write once, run anywhere&#34; fulfillment of the original Java promise.[EDIT: grammar.]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shame this doesn&#39;t show the CMS collector, which was present in 8 and 11, but removed before 17. CMS was the go-to option for low-latency collection for a long time, so it would be good to see how it compares to the modern options.It would be particularly interesting from the perspective of someone working in a shop which still has lots of latency-sensitive-ish workloads running on JDK 8 with CMS!"</p>

Ltd. is considering operating single-customer wafer fabs, according to chairman and CEO Morris Chang.&#34;I think that they are going to be larger customers, and now it makes complete sense to dedicate a whole fab to just one customer and hold that – to hold fabs in fact to just one customer.&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120728040723/https://www.eetim...I think the reason that Apple is always first in line at TSMC is that they bought TSMC a Fab."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all — I wrote these notes with my colleagues at PSL while trying to wrap our heads around the madness that is Web3/Crypto. I’m an engineer by background and sort of a skeptic by nature; I think of this piece as a collection of loosely connected, hopefully pragmatic opinions from a builder’s perspective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for the great article! I wished the section on DeFi addressed the biggest elephant in the room, overcollateralization. A DeFi borrower always needs to lock in more assets as collateral than what they are borrowing, thus defeating the whole purpose for taking a loan aside from financial speculation. And there&#39;s no real way to solve it: all mechanisms I&#39;ve heard of either try to replicate some form of background checks on borrowers (not decentralised, and uses the real world), or claim to use real-world assets as NFT collateral (once again, uses the real world). Thus I can&#39;t see a way for DeFi loans to ever be used for mortgages and other loans regular people actually need.Of course DeFi is more than just loans and borrowing, but that&#39;s an aspect that&#39;s constantly promoted by evangelists so I think it&#39;s an important point to mention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Web3 requires retrofitting the web to use blockchain technologies to do what the web can mostly do already.In &#34;Blockchains Are a Bad Idea&#34;, James Mickens gives several arguments against blockchain-based systems like Bitcoin:See his presentation here: https://youtu.be/15RTC22Z2xI1. People have out-of-band trust relationships in real life which reduce the likelihood of malice. Bitcoin-style anonymous identities undermine trust relationships and are not needed for legitimate (not illegal) transactions.2. Real life legal systems encourage good behaviors. If you have a dispute with someone, you can sue them. Bitcoin and related systems lack these protections.3. Existing tools such as public-key cryptography and digital signatures can provide most of the functionality that applications need without the problems that blockchain-based systems have."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a coder I don&#39;t think I can do anything without the internet. Even if one specific site (maybe there are two actually, SO and GH) were down, it would wreck my day and many of yours.My style of coding is very intimately connected to having access to online resources. I regularly search for things like how to concatenate strings or the syntax of a for loop in some language. I also use the internet for higher level things like how memory management works on some system, or how something like an ECS architecture works. I also spend a lot of time looking for the right components to put into my own systems, so if GitHub were down it would bother me.Basically I&#39;d be useless without the internet. The coding tools themselves, all the examples of how to use them, and all the actual knowledge about how everything works is on there.Perhaps the only thing that&#39;s actually my own input is the judgement about what things are important, which sources are reliable, and which people are authorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I&#39;m starting to identify a lot of cases where looking things up in an external resource is a deeper mental disruption than remembering it, even if the lookup is just as fast or even faster.  (Or, it&#39;s possible that the external lookup only seems faster because the several mechanical steps compress my perception of time, like keyboard navigation can seem faster than the mouse, even when it isn&#39;t.)For example, I find that when I&#39;m working with an API enough that I am frequently looking up the same operations, investing twenty minutes in identifying and reviewing the important operations, as if I were preparing for an exam where I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to consult external resources, pays off in fluency and immersion.Another example is that when I am reading a history book, before I start, I review relevant names and contemporary dates.  Then when I find myself thinking, &#34;Wait, at this time, how long ago was X?  Has Y happened yet?&#34; I can answer from memory.  This gives me a richer reading experience than if I needed to remove myself from the context of the book to look up those dates.I know memorization is seen negatively from a pedagogical standpoint, and schoolchildren find it alienating and discouraging, but I think when you have enough experience to understand the value of it, so that the work to achieve it isn&#39;t such a negative experience in itself, judicious application of it has a lot of power to make your work easier and your learning experiences richer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started developing software in the days before the Internet. It was indeed very different. My choices about what to remember and how I remember things have changed significantly since the ubiquitous availability of searchable information. I no longer have tomes of K&amp;R, processor manuals, Inside Macintosh or Java books on my desk. The only technical book which happens to be on my desk at the moment is &#34;Anti-patterns&#34;.I have been &#34;weeding&#34; my paper books, especially technical books over the last couple of years and gotten rid of an entire bookshelf of books. I still have an entire bookshelf with Knuth TAoCP, math books, type theory, graphics, graph theory, control theory, physics and some nostalgic books like my original Motorola 68000 processor guide, Rodney Zaks Z80 book, &#34;Adventure game programming in BASIC&#34;, Commodore 64 Innerspace Compendium, etc.When a puppy chewed up my copy of &#34;Linux in a Nutshell&#34; I was tempted to buy the new edition but decided to try it online for a month with O&#39;Reilly Safari through work and have not bothered to replace the paper copy for more than 2 years.I would categorize the main change in style of memory as a shift from focus on remembering details and facts, which I can look up, to using memory for decision trees, processes and methodologies which either can&#39;t be looked up or are significantly personally customized. I consciously &#34;outsource&#34; the simpler and to me, less valuable, aspects of memory. Some of this is handled automatically by the IDE I use and the rest is done with mostly Google searches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In that same time period, my &#34;plant light&#34; timer, a $15 mechanical item of a design unmodified since the 1970s, has worked flawlessly, requiring attention only when the clocks change or my schedule does. It has not informed Google, Amazon, or anyone else about its job or anything else in my home. It has generated no royalties nor invoked any support or ongoing maintenance costs. It has never needed a software upgrade.&#34;Smart Home&#34; stuff even since the &#34;x10&#34; standards has been a solution looking for a problem to solve. A hobby for the homeowner who wants to ride the high side of the Laffer curve in effort and expense. It could be argued that quiet, flawless functioning of these products would be exactly what the customer doesn&#39;t want in this product space.Compare it to model trains: is that hobby focused around having a lovely little table set up and watching the trains run? Or is the actual focus the torn up mess that&#39;s under construction and &#34;we can&#39;t play with it right now but i can get it assembled to show the kids by Tuesday&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did my whole house in Lutron’s smart switches (close to 50 of them), and I think it’s good? It’s been about 2 years now and I really haven’t had any issues.The switches aren’t Wi-Fi connected, because Wi-Fi would be an awful choice for 50 devices that you only communicate with a few times a day. They use their own wireless frequency and communicate in a really simple/reliable way to the bridge, which is wired to my router and doesn’t need an internet connection to work.There’s no always-running cloud service, the light switches work even when the internet is down (and I can still use the home app too in such an event, just no voice control.)Siri is finicky sometimes, but I’d wager a 97% success rate in saying things like “set the scene Evening Downstairs” and “turn off all the lights except in the bedroom.”My favorite aspect is that the pico switches can be programmed to switch whole rooms of lights on and off, which makes it so much nicer in the basement where I have 18 different lights to turn on and I can just hit one switch on my way downstairs and it’s fully illuminated (no voice command necessary) and I don’t have to visit 18 light switches to turn them off again.Home automation tech must be invisible and fall back gracefully, and must always be interact-able in a “dumb” way, or else it’s just playing games IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think any software engineer with some industry experience will absolutely NOT install a device in his home that receives automatic updates over the internet and is critical for performing some task or using some basic functionality of the house; especially one that has a well known, highly stable and ergonomic traditional mode of interaction - controlling the lights and water, opening the windows and shades etc.We know from experience that a nebulous interface that can change without notice and provides no clear contract is a asking for trouble and will break your house &#34;build&#34;, so to speak, or worse, it will bork at the worst possible moment, when you have &#34;clients&#34; over.In the early years of home electricity, there was a much higher chance of getting electrocuted or burning to a crisp, outlets had no grounding, insulation and conductors were of a bad quality etc. Similarly, the whole field of home automation is in its infancy, in a few decades most major mistakes will be made and early adopters will work out the kinks out of the technology (and find out why it&#39;s a bad idea to have an internet connected microphone listening in your home at all times)."</p>

But all this time, HN has always been my most visited month after month.I can always count on this place to keep me up to date with the latest tech trends and read discussions between reasonable people. Thank you all and especially dang for keeping discussions high quality. Especially as the quality of content on the rest of the internet deteriorates in the pursuit of virility.It&#39;s a testament to you all that place feels the same as it did 10+ years ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was recently in a meeting with a colleague about some recent craziness that just finished. A lot of hard work, not fun, but ended up just fine. Then a few minutes later, I find out her daughter is in the hospital, so she&#39;s been back-and-forth there a lot, and her life is exponentially more crazy than my own. I felt terrible for complaining about my dumb issues. Work&#39;s hard sometimes, but it&#39;s so small in comparison.The upside of the conversation is that I&#39;ve felt extra thankful this year- I have friends/family/coworkers going through sickness, abuse, divorce, coming out of the closet, and more, and it puts my concerns in perspective. My life is far from perfect, but I&#39;m grateful for what I do have.I know very little about any of you personally, but I hope you continue to share your knowledge, wisdom, dumb anecdotes, and opinions both great and terrible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s the automation that worries me. I&#39;m not too concerned about proper companies using CCTV to record, as it&#39;s well managed and gets deleted unseen, unless something happens. I&#39;m not too concerned about the police pulling those CCTV pictures to investigate a crime either.Things like ring doorbells on the other hand should be cracked down - the number of times I see people in the UK posting pictures of public areas on facebook is shocking, but if they&#39;re just sat there, being deleted unless pulled for a proper reason, that&#39;s fine too.What really does concern me is when things like image recognition come into the picture. A corporation can&#39;t montior me by paying someone to sift through CCTV pictures. They can montior me by using automation to process everything though.This is a good thing, how successful it is remains to be seen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made https://github.com/msloth/lgtv.js which can control a webos LGTV on your local network. It was in my js beginnings so pretty sketchy and not at all clean. Once I was able to control it I kind of lost interest in making it more tweakable, cleaner interface etc, but there are others that did.At home I now run a small rpi0 with a telegram bot that, among other things, acts as a LGTV command proxy. So on my phone, I now tell my telegram bot eg &#34;movie&#34; which then puts the tv on the right input, sets volume, dims some hue lights and shows a nice float on the TV with a welcoming message.It&#39;s also useful when I can&#39;t find the physical remote, or to send messages like &#34;dinner in 10&#34; (that shows on the TV screen in a float) to a gaming child with selective hearing enabled :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope the Software Freedom Conservancy lawsuit against Visio results in an open source distribution for TVs like there is OpenWRT for routers after their last lawsuit. Perhaps the OpenLGTV/SamyGO projects and other folks will join forces on a common distro for smart TVs.https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/vizio.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It has been interesting watching the concept of Black Friday (and cyber monday) evolve over the past 20 or so years from being mostly an &#34;American big box retailer dumping excess stock&#34; thing to &#34;oh boy its black Friday, time to go buy stuff!&#34; thing. The entire event has basically been undeservingly co-opted by everyone looking to cash in on hype over an event that basically doesn&#39;t even resemble what made it a thing in the first place.Just like how for singles day in Asia, retailers shamelessly just jack prices up beforehand to make their sale prices look like discounts. These events seem more about whipping the naive mainstream consumer into a consumption frenzy than having real deals to be excited about. While those deals still exist, they are like nuggets of gold that you have to sift through the noise to find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who use Amazon and want cost perspective on particular items, Camelcamelcamel is a superpower (https://camelcamelcamel.com/)I’m sure one day I’ll find out they make money in all sorts of sketchy ways, but in the mean time it’s a great free website, and I’m continually astounded to see how often retailers play around with the prices they post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This have been a joke for a few years here in Brazil, we call the day &#34;Black Fraud&#34;  (sounds a little better in Portuguese)The relevant point is that Black Friday is an &#34;artificial&#34; event here: we do not celebrate Thanksgiving Day so there is no need for a the stores to get rid of unsold inventory. It started just ~10 years ago when marketers began advertising it as a sales day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; All the sensible textbook titles were already taken. Actual joy not guaranteed.Like a lot of people (I imagine) I made it through a CS bachelors program not really ‘getting’ the discrete math combinatorics part. Crypto is an area where those concepts really really matter. It’s great to see this resource available!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Again I complain on the irritating habit of non-descriptive naming of files.book.pdfReally? I&#39;m saving the file for a later review and this name will guarantee I either completely lose the file or will spend more time than necessary to locate it. The other option is to rename the file on saving, which is some work which needs to be performed by each user, instead of being done just once on the source. I think this is just impolite.Here&#39;s a proper name you can copy-paste:Mike_Rosulek_-_The_Joy_Of_Cryptography_(draft_2021-01-03).pdfPS: The short-link-for-verbal-sharing problem is solved via a symbolic link."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Myself going from &#34;web designer&#34; to a &#34;zero-knowledge proof cryptographer&#34; (I&#39;m a coauthor of Dalek Bulletproofs implementation, the cleanest API, documentation and fastest ZKP system ever) I&#39;m sad to see crypto textbooks spending most of the time on symmetric ciphers, going through the same nonsense like ECB and then touching asymmetric only with RSA and annoying GCD stuff when everyone moved onto elliptic curves already.I&#39;d like to see material around modern stuff (Keccak and ECC) with only a cursory discussion of pitfalls of the past standards in contrast with the current stuff. And more time on asymmetric, discrete log and fiat-shamir protocols that are so much fun and require really a 7th grade algebra to grasp.I&#39;ve also made a couple of videos on ECC basics with that approach: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0r9S76wngNPJb_GlhJYdwEDIT: what i mean, is focus first on how to use primitives and what they promise, rather than how they actually work. Once you feel like you can play with these legos, it&#39;s more fun to dig deeper and see why ECDLP is hard and how ciphers are made. But please don&#39;t start from within - it&#39;s an annoying boring mess that distracts from the true beauty: the cool things you can build with these tools."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used fish for a couple of years and really liked it. But I recently learned that I can configure ZSH to have all of the same auto-complete and plugins that I loved from fish. Now I have all of the creature comforts I like, with POSIX complianceI found that while fish has better syntax than bash for most things, the hassles with incompatibility or unexpected behavior brought me much more trouble than BASH&#39;s syntax ever has"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really love fish and the philosophy behind it, especially the &#34;configurability is the root of all evil&#34; attitude. Makes for a well though out software that is a true pleasure to use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like software where you don&#39;t need to spend hours or even days on configuration and it just works out of box. Unfortunately the different syntax is no go for me. I have a bunch of scripts which I can run on my local machine and remote interchangeably. Even if syntax is better I want to learn rather `one syntax` that work everywhere. But that is only one thing that prevents me from trying it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, no shit, Sherlock!!Everybody who has been renting or has been buying a home in the last 10 years knows this...All the cash that&#39;s been &#34;pumped into the economy&#34; has only fueled inequalities. It&#39;s gone in the pockets of those who were already wealthy enough to secure a loan. And yes, they did buy houses, and bitcoins, and stocks. Oh and then that caused the prices to go up, so whoever forgot to invest started doing it, pumping the early birds&#39; wealth up, allowing them to borrow even more. The whole economical landscape is bubbles everywhere.And now the FED can&#39;t really reverse it. If you start raising rates, and stopping QE, you&#39;re not actually getting the money back from the people you gave it to, you&#39;ll just get a lot of businesses to close.We need to erode all that capital concentration, and the only way to do it without hurting the regular guy is through heavy taxation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this is the single biggest malaise in society. “Investing” (speculating) in real estate creates nothing of value to society and instead serves only to artificially drive up the cost of shelter, a basic necessity. It also directs capital away from investing in technology and businesses.Due to the zero-sum nature of real estate, it fundamentally breaks the positive sum theory of capitalism. Adam Smith even called landlord’s right “theft”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think you can diagnose over-engineering after the fact. Unless you were in the room, or have access to written specs from a meticulously documented team, you don&#39;t understand the conditions under which the code was written.Maybe the company was betting at the time on an integrations marketplace, or a lot of partnerships, so a robust integration platform was built. Then the company moved on to another bet after only writing one or two integrations on the new platform. Nobody over-engineered here. Everything was built to spec. But three years down the line the new dev is going to get assigned a bug in one of the integrations and lament how the code was over-engineered. Hindsight is 20/20.Lots of stories from the trenches including many in this thread make this mistake. The same goes for &#39;tech debt&#39;. If you weren&#39;t there, you don&#39;t know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that bugs me is the notion that &#34;Software rewrites are something you should never do&#34;, which is a mantra so often repeated that it has acquired the status of self-evident truth, despite the only evidence being (usually) presented is an example of a web browser from 20 years ago! (Which incidentally spawned Mozilla, so not exactly a complete loss; especially from the POV of society rather than shareholders, but I digress).Having rewritten a bunch of systems (sometimes several times) I can attest that it will not always lead to the death of the company. The trick is of course having modular enough systems that they can be rewritten from scratch in a reasonable amount of time.It can also be a great way to increase the simplicity of the system as typically the old version was designed with a very imperfect understanding of the problem and no operational experience servicing it; further learning were usually crudely patched on top and you often end up in a conceptual hodge-podge where words mean subtly different things depending on the context and translation layers need to be inserted between the contexts etc.Often a (good) rewrite starts by clarifying the conceptual model. I like the saying &#34;clear writing reflects clear thinking&#34;, and in programming there is a lemma &#34;clear thinking produces clear code&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Complexity kills your product - Overengineering is just one instance of complexity - Technical Debt like having state and data all over the place is another one - I quit my last job and I happily blame this article for convincing me to quit: https://itnext.io/the-origin-of-complexity-8ecb39130fc - coordination causes complexity and this killed me - we had everything not once but twice or more in different places - just one example - it&#39;s much more complex but me and my colleagues were grinded between an old codebase that nobody understood anymore and kubernetes, ci, etc.pp on the other side because management sold this without understanding that you need a process and time for digesting and applying the concepts in the team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, I never really had that much love for Emacs until relatively recently.  I&#39;ve always dabbled due to it generally having good support for most languages (including esoteric ones) but recently I got into it a lot more due to the fact that many of the new-ish OSS editors but Emacs has always been there and likely will always be there.A few years back I got into Atom quite a bit since it checked all the boxes: extensible, open source, and it was very nice.  Then VSCode killed it.  And it seems more and more that VSCode is taking over, all the while inserting more proprietary code to the point where half the &#39;big&#39; plugins don&#39;t work on Codium, only the proprietary MS distribution.So I got back into Emacs but really worked on my environment.  Stopped dabbling and started just forcing myself to use it.  And it&#39;s honestly amazing.  It checks off every box available in VSCode and more.  And it&#39;s nice knowing that it&#39;ll always be there.  I&#39;m not against proprietary software per-se, but I definitely don&#39;t have a lot of trust in Microsoft."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For people who ask, &#34;why use text-only editors like vim or Emacs, when I can use a full GUI IDE?&#34;:One of the reasons I haven&#39;t seen mentioned much is: I&#39;m a touch typist, and I hate having to switch between mouse and keyboard! I have to take my attention off the screen. Slows me down. Disturbs my concentration.With Emacs, I can work for hours without ever having to hunt for the mouse, or without even having a mouse plugged in. That&#39;s particularly nice for using my Ubuntu laptop on a lap desk, leaning back in my armchair. The best mouse is no mouse at all.Yes, I know many IDEs have shortcut keys for some commands, but the basic assumption with GUI applications is that you have a mouse. Even if you learn the shortcuts, somehow you always end up having to use the mouse for some common task, e.g., to select a paragraph. That&#39;s why I never got to like a GUI IDE, despite having had to use Eclipse for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see lists like these. I’m a long time Emacs user and recently learned to use neovim. I made the same mistake many new Emacs users make in that I installed a lot of plugins at once and lost control of the editor. Only by installing packages incrementally after you have discovered a real need, can you keep mentally on top of what your editor is capable of."</p>
