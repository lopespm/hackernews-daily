								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This should be a sobering view of how the world really works. Above a certain threshold, every veneer of civilization vanishes no matter what the country (some have a higher threshold than others).At this level, only power matters. And the first rule of power is: Don&#39;t embarrass the powerful unless you can call on a lot of power to defend yourself.Laws can&#39;t protect you; they can be thwarted and bent, and the legal process &#34;guided&#34; to the required outcome.International organizations can&#39;t protect you; they can only register complaints that will be duly ignored by everyone if the champion is important enough.Even countries can&#39;t protect you at this level; they&#39;re beholden to power themselves after a certain point.This is the message to would-be activists anywhere: Stay out of the big boy pool or we&#39;ll make you regret it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To fully appreciate the context:- he’s not a us citizen- none of the “crimes” happened on US soil- he’s a world famous journalist with prior work- was charged with bogus crimes in Europe in an attempt to arrest him. All dropped- the person who stole the files he released is already free and the tax payers paid for their transition"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprisingly few technical people understand the extent to which the CFAA charges he faces are bullshit.It all goes back to a jabber log that they got from Manning. The gist of it is as follows:Manning: &lt;some bytes from a hexdump&gt;Manning: can you guys crack NTLM?Assange: we have rainbow tables. I’ll forward it onto someone on our team.Few days later,Manning: any update on NTLM?Assange: no luck so far.And this is computer conspiracy. No additional access to any machine was had, and there’s no real evidence that any cracking was attempted at all. He merely agreed to take a look and reported no progress on it. It’s been a while since I looked at the details but I seem to recall that the pcap hexdump manning sent wasn’t even the correct bytes to do an attack — it wasn’t even possible.There are so many explanations for why Assange could have said this while plausibly not attempting to crack the hash. Manning put him in a strange position to become complicit and he had to strike a balance between not saying to his source, “lol that’s illegal no way, you’re on your own dude” while simultaneously saying exactly that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This resulted in a large surge of connection activity that overwhelmed the networking devices between the internal network and the main AWS network, resulting in delays for communication between these networks. These delays increased latency and errors for services communicating between these networks, resulting in even more connection attempts and retries. This led to persistent congestion and performance issues on the devices connecting the two networks.I remember my first experience realizing the client retry logic we had implemented was making our lives way worse. Not sure if it&#39;s heartening or disheartening that this was part of the issue here.Our mistake was resetting the exponential backoff delay whenever a client successfully connected and received a response. At the time a percentage but not all responses were degraded and extremely slow, and the request that checked the connection was not. So a client would time out, retry for a while, backing off exponentially, eventually successfully reconnect and then after a subsequent failure start aggressively trying again. System dynamics are hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This congestion immediately impacted the availability of real-time monitoring data for our internal operations teams, which impaired their ability to find the source of congestion and resolve it.Disruption of the standard incident response mechanism seems to be a common element of longer lasting incidents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Customers accessing Amazon S3 and DynamoDB were not impacted by this event.We&#39;ve seen plenty of S3 errors during that period. Kind of undermines credibility of this report."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. I didn’t know this, but I was actually able to observe this state on myself. When going to sleep, my mind is wandering. But at one point it drifts from real world thoughts to completely abstract concepts and wild imagination that sometimes makes no sense. It’s almost like a hallucination. What’s most interesting is that sometimes I am able to notice the transition to this state and consciously observe it. Usually it makes me happy because I know I’m about to fall asleep within the next few seconds (which I often have problem with, writing this comment at 1:26am again..). I am also able to consciously observe the images being generated. It’s very weird, because it feels like one brain looking into someone else’s brain to the extent that is impossible by any technology or in any other way. Sometimes I’m able to consciously wake up from this state, because I have weird “sleep phobias”. Sometimes I am fascinated by the idea generated at that stage. But unless I write them down or really get up, they are typically lost if I fall asleep within next 5 minutes - maybe I’d have a Nobel prize already, if only I kept a pen and paper ready next to my bed. Or apartment full of crappy kitch paintings.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: I distinctly remember being on the edge of sleep writing a song one night in 2019. I was about to fall asleep on the floor with a notebook in my hand, and just at that moment, the music came into my mind. For whatever reason, I was able to stay awake and flesh it out as a recording. After reflecting on it the next day I realised I had written an acoustic fingerstyle piece that moved across keys as if there were multiple voicings in the accompaniment all moving independently in polyphony. Far more harmonically complex than anything I had written before, or since.Three weeks later my partner and I played it for the first time in a pub, and the normally cosy and laugh-filled room fell silent. We had the exact same experience in another open mic night a couple of weeks afterwards, where we took the first-place prize before the competition even finished. It was as if people were moved by it without any effort or coercion, like we cast a spell over people.Now it makes sense! I’ve heard music play in my mind as I’ve fallen asleep before; this news explains this story almost perfectly. Unreal. Live on the edge of sleep and magic can happen. I wonder what health risks there are with prolonged use?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I once got into this hypnagogic state by accident. I was having a nap and my dogs woke me up because it was time for their walk.I felt sleepy while walking the dogs but also had a clarity regarding anything I examined in my mind. It&#39;s as if my regular state of mind was like walking in a forest with limited visibility, and now I could see the territory from a bird&#39;s perspective.This lasted for about 15 mins maybe. I&#39;ve never been able to experience this again. Maybe I should try this technique :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I suspect this is to foreclose against a future option for Google to monetize ‘free’ content in the play store without compensating the developers much as they do people’s videos on Youtube.For those who aren’t aware, in the games industry the distributor has been in the role of adding DRM to games on the pretense that they are “protecting their interests and channels”. As the distributor, Google may feel empowered to make these sort of “protective” changes, and the one that would be most likely (in my estimation) would be wrapping the APK such that it played a pre-roll ad before your free game started.I could be completely off base here but to my way of thinking it would be consistent with Google’s moves in the past."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good?What&#39;s the alternative? Have a crappy, paid-for, add filled, bloated app promote itself as &#34;Cauliflower Cooker Lite - the #1 free cauliflower app. 100% ad-free&#34;.Metadata like file size, whether there are in-app ads or purchases, etc, should be part of the store&#39;s listing - not the title."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, let&#39;s be clear here.  The problem is not that they&#39;ve prohibited people from putting this information in the app title.  The problem comes if they&#39;ve done so without introducing another way for the user to express their preference for ad-free apps.  E.g. it should even work better if, hypothetically, the search function prioritized ad-free apps anyway when the user puts &#34;no ads&#34; in the search box.I can&#39;t tell if this is the case right now because, well, the store is still full of apps with &#34;no ads&#34; in the title.  Those are still coming up first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the scientific meat of the press release where it claims a 25 times neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron strain with a third dose of Pfizer-BionTech:The sera were collected from subjects 3 weeks after receiving the second dose or one month after receiving the third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Each serum was tested simultaneously for its neutralizing antibody titer against the wild-type SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, and the Omicron spike variant. The third dose significantly increased the neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron strain spike by 25-fold. Neutralization against the Omicron variant after three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was comparable to the neutralization against the wild-type strain observed in sera from individuals who received two doses of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine: The geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant measured in the samples was 154 (after three doses), compared to 398 against the Delta variant (after three doses) and 155 against the ancestral strain (after two doses). Data on the persistence of neutralizing titers over time after a booster dose of BNT162b2 against the Omicron variant will be collected.---At the bottom of the press release it mentions that Pfizer is the marketing distribution partner for BionTech in many countries. Does anyone have a list where BionTech distributes directly?&#34;BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I&#39;m reading this correctly, this is &#34;protection against severe disease&#34; and has little to do with transmission. The National Airport Data from Israel seems to suggest &#34;the absolute number of infected individuals in the Vaccinated (boosted) group is likely to be at least as high as in the Unvaccinated&#34; [0]So it seems to me that as long as we all remain obsessed with case numbers and not actual hospitalizations and death, this isn&#39;t going away, at least not anytime soon. I personally find this beyond depressing.[0] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3963606"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there is an expert in immunology here I&#39;d really like to ask a question:Aren&#39;t antibody titers just one measure of immunity?Since ~everyone with just two shots get them a while ago, and people receiving the boosters are receiving them now, wouldn&#39;t we expect must higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in boosted people? I know the number of antibodies fades over time, (whether from vaccine or infection) but this doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have lasting protection after this, right?Wouldn&#39;t it therefore be a mistake/misleading to conclude something specific about a level of protection from this titer data alone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based on my anecdotal experience this seems to very much understate inflation. 
How is housing up only 3.8%? This site says over 17% rent increase nationally over the last year: https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data which seems to be more accurate.  Anyone with a web browser knows that home prices have experienced a monumental increase.Also a trip to the grocery store appears to cost me 50% more now for essentially the same goods. Every trip to the store pre-covid cost me around $100, now its $150. I do buy primarily proteins so that is the source of the increase but to ignore that seems ill advised.Not generally a conspiracy theorist but unless the people that built this report are using some accepted formula that is very different than the real world this report seems to be intentionally underselling inflation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Fed was initially saying the inflation was transitory, but have recently dropped the &#34;transitory&#34; label.Back in July, Siegel pointed out that the M2 money supply is 30% over pre-pandemic levels and predicted that would translate into 20% cumulative inflation over the next 3 years.  Here are my talk notes / video links if you&#39;re interested: https://neapowers.com/investing/jeremy-siegel/In July Siegel said &#34;There is zero need for the Fed to be buying $120 billion in bonds every month given market conditions.&#34;  I don&#39;t know why the Fed is buying mortgage backed securities in the midst of an apparent housing bubble.Larry Summers was voicing inflation concerns back in March: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBnaahSe7JU&amp;ab_channel=Bloom...The main macroeconomists I follow (Siegel, Gundlach, Summers) are all puzzled by the Feds actions recently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is due to fuel prices. The price of fuel affects the price of everything else. It&#39;s a benchmark since everything requires fuel. Manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, etc. It all requires fuel. It doesn&#39;t help that OPEC refuses to increase production in order to make up for their budget shortfalls last year. Also doesn&#39;t help that the US government is sending signals that it is no longer on board with fossil fuels. The shutting down of pipelines, ending of fossil fuel leasing, etc. sends a market signal to producers and traders that the US is hostile towards the industry, leading the producers to cut production and maintain their profits.Best option would be to have a diverse portfolio of energy production: oil, natural gas, solar, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear. Don&#39;t go all in on one, that&#39;s how you arrive at the situation we are currently in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I first encountered quaternions in the concept of abstract algebra. It&#39;s interesting to think of it as part of a spectrum starting with reals and continuing to octonions (and beyond). Interestingly with each extension we lose something:Complex numbers (2-dimensional): No more orderingQuaternions (4-dimensional): No more commutative multiplicationOctonions (8-dimensional): No more associative multiplicationSedenions (16-dimensional): We lose the alternative property, i.e., with octonions its still true that x(xy) = (xx)y but with sedenions it is not.We can continue this process indefinitely, although I know nothing of the characteristics of trigintaduonions or what comes later. I suspect that it might be the loss of the flexible identity next, a(ba) = (ab)a but I don&#39;t know for sure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"W.R Hamilton&#39;s discovery of the Quaternions is semi-famous itself, with the story being that after the critical flash of insight he carved the equation describing quaternion multiplication into a bridge in Ireland with a penknife.A interesting read is this letter [0] written the following day, where he explains his ideas in his own words. It&#39;s a great (and accessible!) look into his thought process.[0] https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/QLette..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One interesting thing about quaternions that’s almost never mentioned anywhere on the internets, there’re two conventions for them.The convention in that article is known as “Hamilton&#39;s quaternions”. There’s another incompatible one usually called “JPL quaternions”, for some American Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Authors of 99% articles about the quaternions, and software libraries implementing quaternions, are assuming exactly one of these conventions, and almost never mention which one that is.More info there: https://fzheng.me/2017/11/12/quaternion_conventions_en/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used the JIT version recently on a new landing page with code completion for class names in my IDE and found it great. The distance between what I&#39;m picturing in my head and what I have to type to see that on the screen felt so much shorter and less fatiguing than the standard CSS approach.With the regular way, to style something that&#39;s probably not going to appear elsewhere, I&#39;m having to: come up with class names, annotate the HTML with them, repeat some of this annotating in a CSS file, jump back and forth between files to tweak the styles, use the web inspector to figure out which CSS class is overriding another then jump to the right CSS file to fix it etc.Tailwind classes are also faster to type and flip between when you&#39;re experimenting (e.g. editing &#34;mt-5&#34; to &#34;pb-3&#34; vs &#34;margin-top: 4.25em&#34; to &#34;padding-bottom: 2.75em&#34;) and you get less distracted because it has sensible defaults and helpful guardrails (you rarely need all the possible attributes and range of parameter values CSS has available).I also rarely had the super irritating and common CSS scenario where you edit a style and it doesn&#39;t change and you have to go investigate to find out why e.g. something is overriding something, your selector is wrong, and even after all that maybe you undo the edit because it doesn&#39;t look good. Plus you no longer have the fear that tweaking a shared class to going to break some completely different page.I feel that beyond some building blocks, trying to create reusable CSS classes with cascading styles has similarities to using excessive abstraction and deep OOP class hierarchies in regular programming languages to avoid a little duplication.I also don&#39;t have a problem with styling stuff appearing in my HTML files either as long as the right HTML tags are used around the data. HTML files are already full of class annotations and divs that are only there for styling yet this doesn&#39;t cause a problem to e.g. browsers, screen readers or crawlers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried Tailwind (and a similar project Windi) on a few projects now and have some findings.Tailwind aggressively speeds up development time of components by allowing me to stay in the same cobtext when styling things. The brevity of class names also dramatically shortens the time spent writing styles. While working on the projects I&#39;d setup with Tailwind, I felt far more productive.However, those were new projects. After completing them and needing to go back and modify or maintain them, the experience has been horrible. The resulting style declarations (as class names) are completely unreadable and unmaintainable. I&#39;ve tried organizing them and splitting class names onto multiple lines, but it has only cluttered things.In my experience, Tailwind (and similar projects) produce styles that are effectively read only. They are superb when writing a new component and styling things from scratch, but maintenance is nonexistent.Because of this, I&#39;ve now switched to using a CSS-in-JS solution to gain the benefits of in-context styling and still have the ability to write CSS declarations in a structured and maintainable way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure I get Tailwind still. Doing everything with utility classes and OOCSS / BEM are things we stopped doing literally decades ago. CSS modules still seem to solve every problem Tailwind solves, and better. CSS modules combine the power of global utility classes with locally styled components/locally scoped classes, and compile to static stylesheets, a requirement for performance. I&#39;m not sure how Tailwind works, but any CSS that&#39;s built at runtime and JS and inserted into the DOM dynamically should be avoided, and is an example of favoring developer experience over end user experience. It&#39;s always surprising to me when the build process isn&#39;t front and center of any CSS framework, since that&#39;s the most important performance aspect. I&#39;m not concerned about Tailwinds verbose CSS use since that&#39;s gzipped away, but the static stylesheet compilation aspect worries me if it&#39;s not front and center of the framework.CSS modules let you use the full power and control of vanilla CSS, without having to worry about styles bleeding across components. Sprinkle in your global utility classes for your design system and you&#39;re good to go. Or sometimes even better, abstract design into components like `&lt;grid&gt;` `&lt;column&gt;` etc and not even worry about the classname implementation.I know I&#39;m missing part of the picture, because of the hype and joy that people report from Tailwind. What part(s) am I missing that move folks from the power, beauty, and simplicity of CSS modules, to all-utility-classes-all-the-time Tailwind?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because of this, sometime in 2022 I will shut down Sitetruth, my fifteen year old ad blocking and site evaluation system. That offers add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, and puts a tag with company background info on each search result. Some search ads are removed, and some are de-emphasized. Some time next year, Google will probably force that add-on out of Chrome, as they tighten their grip over what browsers are allowed to do.I did this as a technology demo, to demonstrate automated site background checking. The concept that you have to have a business address to sell online is almost archaic now, even though it&#39;s the law in the EU and California. So, today often the system often can&#39;t tie a web site to business records.The concept of &#34;legitimate business&#34; is dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A group will never admit they were wrong. A group will never admit, “We made a mistake,” because a group that tries to change its mind falls apart. I’m hard pressed to find examples in history of large groups that said, “We thought A, but the answer’s actually B.”Now that is a useful insight.It&#39;s a big problem for voluntary associations. Companies can sometimes change their culture, but it usually requires replacing the CEO.This has come up a few times in military history. &#34;L&#39;audace, toujours l&#39;audace&#34; was a WWI French slogan. It took a huge number of casualties before high command got it that charging into machine guns does not work. Courage does not help. In WWII, a big change was discovering that battleships are not useful once the enemy has torpedo bombers. The resistance of the battleship admirals was overcome by Congress, not the Navy. Congress ordered that the captains of aircraft carriers must be qualified to fly aircraft. Sidelining the &#34;Gun Club&#34; took major political effort.Now, the US military is struggling with the &#34;Fighter Mafia&#34;, which tends to run the USAF despite the ascendancy of drones and the usefulness of the A-10."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From Bloomberg:&gt; Bondholders of $19.2 billion in Evergrande dollar notes face deep haircuts as the company overhauls its mammoth balance sheet without a government bailout -- a process that promises to be long, contentious and potentially risky for Asia’s largest economy.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/evergrand...It might seem odd that a Chinese company would have taken out dollar loans, but the practice is common around the world. One reason is that the borrower can get lower interest rates because they assume the exchange rate risk themselves. If that bet goes sour, though, the borrower faces higher costs to service the debt.Of course the thing about dollar bonds is that even if the national government were to intervene, those dollars can&#39;t be printed by Beijing.The only way to service a dollar debt is to raise dollars. One path to doing that is to sell dollar-denominated assets. US Stocks and bonds in other words. So the pressures in China can spill over into the US economy through forced asset sales of dollar-denominated assets.This is another angle to the contagion idea. Organizations around the world have taken big short position on the US dollar. As those loans come due, dollar assets are sold. Which drives the dollar higher. Which makes the dollar loans even more unsustainable. And so on.It has been called the global dollar short squeeze:https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/And if you&#39;re really adventurous, there&#39;s something called the &#34;dollar milkshake theory&#34; which predicts the uncontrollable rise of the dollar as (maybe counterintuitively) a wrecking ball for the world economy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qTOWuL7Zco"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use Dracula for pretty much everything. Code editors, terminals, browsers, Slack, and even CSS skins for Tailwind, Wordpress, and more, if I&#39;m installing an application, there&#39;s a pretty good chance there&#39;s already a theme for it.But there&#39;s an interesting side effect of having a theme repository with over 200 applications: app discovery! Whether it&#39;s learning about interesting projects (BetterDiscord, MatterMost, Obsidian) or blasts from the past (I hadn&#39;t thought about BBEdit in a long time! And does anyone remember Brackets?), it&#39;s kind of a cool spot to find and remember things.Good work and thank you to everyone who has worked on these themes, I use them every day for a lot of apps :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a hard time seeing why this is such a popular theme.. maybe it&#39;s just because it is available for so many different editors. On the other hand, would be cool to have an application / database that could convert any theme to another editor.Although that would take a lot of work to figure out the compatibilities, if somebody would do that well enough so that other people can configure input output configs for that, I bet that program could become very popular among developers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dracula is a fine theme, however, I feel like it&#39;s more convenient than it is pretty. I admire Dracula, Nord, and Gruvbox and how committed they are to their own aesthetics - my personal favorite, similar to Gruvbox, is Alduin[0] but sadly it&#39;s for Vim only.I only wish popular themes didn&#39;t feel like they had to use every primary color for the text. I wish we took the popular themes and made them even more opinionated, fewer colors with greater emphasis. At the end of the day most themes nowadays are just different shades of all rainbow text over your choice of a light or dark background. Dark or light... It reminds me of that theory about how early humans, before having words for different colors, only had light and dark to describe things.Does anyone have any recommendations for opinionated color schemes with limited palettes with emphasis on particular colors instead of just dark/light?0. https://github.com/AlessandroYorba/Alduin"</p>

Gatekeeping legal information for profit (even if only used to supplement appropriations) isn&#39;t only a problem at the federal level. In many states you need a commercial subscription to even read court opinions and statutes, let alone search. Localities in most places rely on commercial publishers to archive the text of ordinances, which only those with ridiculously expensive subscriptions can access.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To folks wondering what the issue is about, I&#39;ll give a short summary that I myself needed.Typically a logging library has one job to do: swallow the string as if it&#39;s some black box and spit it elsewhere as per provided configurations. Log4j though, doesn&#39;t treat strings as black boxes. It inspects its contents and checks if it contains any &#34;variables&#34; that need to be resolved before spitting out.Now there&#39;s a bunch of ways to interpolate &#34;variables&#34; into log content. For example something like &#34;Logging from ${java:vm}&#34; will print &#34;Logging from Oracle JVM&#34;. I&#39;m not sure but you get the idea.One way to resolve a variable using a custom Java resolver is by looking it up through a remote class hosted in some LDAP server, say &#34;${jndi:ldap://someremoteclass}&#34; (I&#39;m still not quite sure why LDAP comes into the picture). Turns out, by including &#34;.&#34; in some part of the URL to this remote class, Log4j lets off its guard &amp; simply looks up to that server and dynamically loads the class file.The fix has introduced ways to configure an allowed set of hosts/protocols/etc and forces Log4j to go through this configuration such that these dynamic resolutions don&#39;t land on an random/evil server."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This exploit is quite severe on Minecraft Java Edition. Anyone can send a chat message which exploits everyone on the server and the server itself, because every chat message is logged. It&#39;s been quite a rollercoaster over the past few hours, working out the details of how to protect members of servers, and informing players (many of whom uses modded clients that don&#39;t receive the automatic Mojang patches) of how to protect themselves. Some of the major servers like 2b2t and Mineplex have shut down, and larger servers that haven&#39;t shut down yet are pure chaos right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On one hand I want to be more forgiving of this, because log4j is very old, and likely this feature was introduced well before we all had a collective understanding of how fiddly and difficult security can be, and how attackers will go to extreme effort to compromise our services.But at the same time... c&#39;mon.  A logging framework&#39;s job is to ship strings to stdout or files or something.  String interpolation should not be this complicated, flexible, whatever you want to call it.  The idea that a logging framework (!) could even have an RCE makes me want to scream... the feature set that leads us to that even being possible just weeps &#34;overengineered&#34;."</p>

Chinese regulators also threatened to withhold approval of the first Apple Watch, scheduled for release in 2015, if Apple didn’t comply with the unusual request, according to internal documents.Some members of the team back at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., initially balked at the demand. But the Maps app had become a priority for Apple, so eventually the company complied. The Diaoyu Islands, when viewed in Apple Maps in mainland China, continue to appear on a larger scale than surrounding territories.&#34;Apple has, and will, fold to government pressure faster than a lawn chair.1. https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/08/the-information..."</p>

SimilarWeb publishes their data with a huge delay, so it is not of much use for me. From my experience, it is also less reliable.It is crazy how valuable internet properties get closed down when they are owned by giant companies. According to Alexa, Alexa is still a top-5000 site:https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/alexa.comIt seems insane to just close it down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s sort of wild to think that Amazon purchased Alexa.com in 1999 for ~$250M in stock, and that stock would be worth more than $7B today, if my math is correct.Bought a website ranking company, used the company&#39;s name as the name of a consumer electronics assistant, and then shuttered the company 22 years later to (presumably) be able to use the domain name for more consumer electronics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A very helpful summary from r/rust on the same topic [1]&gt;A few notes for people who haven&#39;t been tracking the Rust-in-kernel situation. Drivers especially have been targeted for a few reasons. First, drivers are isolated, with abstractions that don&#39;t require interaction with the rest of the system. Second, Linux is available on more systems than the Rust compiler has been ported to. Because drivers are inherently system-dependent, it is not an issue to introduce a dependency on rustc on compatible systems. Third, bugs tend to arise more in drivers than other parts of the codebase, so Rust can do the most good starting there.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/rb50yn/comment/hnmshs..."</p>

Here&#39;s the form for filing a complaint about 911 service:https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?tic...States also regulate 911 service. Try your state&#39;s office of emergency services.There&#39;s something called &#34;Kari&#39;s Law&#34; that may apply here. This was passed in 2018 after someone was being attacked in a hotel room and their 9 year old daughter tried to call 911. She couldn&#39;t get through because the phone system required dialing 9 for an outside line. So, now, all business phone systems are required to recognize and pass through 911 to the main phone network. There are criminal penalties. (Microsoft might argue that &#34;Teams&#34; is not a &#34;multi-line telephone system&#34;. That probably wouldn&#39;t go far with a jury. The clear intent of the law is that if you interpose something between a phone handset and the 911 network, it has to pass through 911 calls.)The whole 911 area is heavily regulated, since it requires that so many things interoperate reliably."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is astonishing.&gt; We determined that the issue was being caused by unintended interaction between the Microsoft Teams app and the underlying Android operating system.As someone whose organizational policy signs my Teams client out after a couple hours of inactivity, I would love to know how on earth this is possible. I truly am at a loss, and I am furious at the thought that I have been unable to dial 911 for who knows how long.At least I know the ten digit number for my local emergency services, but the average person probably doesn&#39;t. This is unacceptable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My feeling is that Google is not capable of fixing fundamental problems of Android. Every year they change some colors and rounded edges (it&#39;s starting to get hilarious seeing the design of their apps being revamped over and over again), and add features invented by their designers nobody asked for. But the keyboard lag, the storage footprint (why must an ever so slightly older phone with 16GiB internal memory be discarded because His Majesty Android demands almost all of its space for itself?), those will only get worse every release. I think they simply don&#39;t care. It&#39;s all about futuristic colorful stuff that sells. Android will never be a humble, efficient, reliable platform.As for this issue. All I can think of is the tragedies it may cause. It&#39;s a cliché: software developers are not responsible, except when their PR forces them to take action."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent article, a good insight into the particularities of the hardware. I particularly admire the explanation of why the polygons snap to the pixel, and why that&#39;s not the fault of floating-point mathematics but rather the rasterizer itself. One thing the article approaches, but doesn&#39;t really quite get to the bottom however, and which is the crux of all the ps1&#39;s &#39;flaws&#39; is that its GPU was 2-dimensional fundamentally. That&#39;s why things snap to pixels, that&#39;s why the textures do not have a depth component and are thus not perspective-correct, that&#39;s why there is no z-buffer, because it had no z-coordinate. Essentially, every single PS1 game &#39;faked&#39; 3D by using the GTE (which was separate from the GPU) to project 3D points and polygons into a 2D rasterizer. And it worked quite well! For the time.Another thought - I also wrote a similar renderer under similar constraints a while back, just for funsies, and I&#39;m wondering what would have came if I thought &#34;I should write an article about this&#34;. I generally don&#39;t think to write articles over every side project I do, what&#39;s the impulse for when someone decides to detail their work to the internet?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love these &#34;tiny&#34; 128x128 textures when meanwhile, anyone doing development for the contemporaneous Nintendo 64 gets something like 44x44@16bpp color, or 64x64@8bpp grayscale. The maximum texture size is 4 KB with some major caveats (e.g. it drops to 2 KB if you use indexed color).The N64 is, in a lot of ways, on paper, a more powerful system than the PS1. Better CPU, depth buffer / Z test, perspective-correct texturing, antialiasing, subpixel precision, etc. And yet the PS1 completely dominated the N64 in the marketplace and in terms of longetivity--a big part of that how cheap it is to manufacture CDs. And so people lovingly remember PS1-style graphics, but there isn&#39;t as much of a resurgence of N64-style graphics.Another cute thing to note about PS1 is how it renders dark clouds on-screen. You might be familiar with the &#34;add&#34; blend mode for things like lens flares. Well, the PS1 also had a subtract blend mode, which has some unusual effects... basically, anything partially obscured by a dark cloud gets darker but also more colorful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on the MGS port to PC (from PS1), and I did little restoration trick to remove the &#34;jittering&#34; - I would save into a huge table of float `float gte_results[65536]` - any calculation from the GTE (our emulation) there. For example if after some translation the x was 123.43 - I know that it&#39;ll use only 123, but I would save gte_results[123] = 123.43 - and later when the triangle is drawn (with integer coordiantes, I&#39;ll lookup back as gte_results[123]). So ... it worked kind of :) - https://youtu.be/Fpep7oOGNfU?t=1442"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that hired an ex-Amazon engineer to work on some cloud projects.Whenever his projects went down, he fought tooth and nail against any suggestion to update the status page. When forced to update the status page, he&#39;d follow up with an extremely long &#34;post-mortem&#34; document that was really just a long winded explanation about why the outage was someone else&#39;s fault.He later explained that in his department at Amazon, being at fault for an outage was one of the worst things that could happen to you. He wanted to avoid that mark any way possible.YMMV, of course. Amazon is a big company and I&#39;ve had other friends work there in different departments who said this wasn&#39;t common at all. I will always remember the look of sheer panic he had when we insisted that he update the status page to accurately reflect an outage, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK...So, I&#39;m the tech lead for Cloudflare Workers. In complete honestly, I did not even know we ran some sort of comparison benchmark with Compute@Edge until Fastly complained about it, nor did I know about our ToS clause until Fastly complained about it. I honestly don&#39;t know anything about either beyond what&#39;s publicly visible.But as long as we&#39;re already mud slinging, I&#39;d like to take the opportunity to get a little something off my chest. Fastly has been trumpeting for years that Compute@Edge has 35 microsecond cold starts, or whatever, and repeatedly posting blog posts comparing that against 5 milliseconds for Workers, and implying that they are 150x faster. If you look at the details, it turns out that 35 microsecond time is actually how long they take to start a new request, given that the application is already loaded in memory. A hot start, not a cold start. Whereas Workers&#39; 5ms includes time to load the application from disk (which is the biggest contributor to total time). Our hot start time is also a few microseconds, but that doesn&#39;t seem like an interesting number?We never called this out, it didn&#39;t seem worth arguing over. But excuse me if I&#39;m not impressed by claims of false comparisons...On a serious note, I&#39;ve been saying for decades that benchmarks are almost always meaningless, because different technologies will have different strengths and weaknesses, so you usually can&#39;t tell anything about how your use case will perform unless you actually test that use case.  So, I would encourage everyone to run your own test and don&#39;t just go on other people&#39;s numbers. It&#39;s great that Fastly has opened up C@E for self-service testing so that people can actually try it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was expecting a point-by-point comparison from Fastly. Instead, this comes off incredibly defensive and evasive, basically boiling down to two irrelevant points:* Rust compiled to WASM is faster than Javascript (ok, but I&#39;m not going to switch my entire stack just to use your CDN)* Fastly performance throttles their free accounts (ok, but not Cloudflare&#39;s fault, and I definitely don&#39;t want to get into your pricing game if you&#39;re going to start offering different tiers of serverless workers... part of Cloudflare&#39;s allure is its simplicity in pricing).They do have two good points:* Benchmarks between CDNs should be done from the same client locations (fine, but why did you then use your own set)* Cloudflare should not prohibit benchmarking of their products (fair)But this whole post read like a feeble attempt at misdirection, and made me distrust Fastly as a company. The complaints about their methodology aren&#39;t solved by using your own, even more flawed, methodology that doesn&#39;t even use the same language. You could&#39;ve just emailed them and asked to work together on an apple-to-apples test instead of creating an even more flawed benchmark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mentioned in the article, Cloudflare expressly prohibits benchmarking their services in the tos.I think it&#39;s rather disingenuous for Cloudflare to publish their own benchmarks calling out competitors when they won&#39;t allow anyone to run their own tests and comparisons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Cloudflare, but these Image products are a black mark on their reputation.Every point the author says is 100% correct. I&#39;ll add one more point, which ended up making it a total non-starter: you can&#39;t import lots of images because their rate limits are so pernicious. If you have tens of thousands or millions of images, keeping within their single digit per second rate limit, which appears to be totally non-negotiable, makes it impossible to add images at any scale.They have another product called Cloudflare Images which can work from Workers: but here the pricing is almost absurd and from the data they show on their dashboard, they only cache a tiny percentage of the requests. This means you end up paying a lot more than makes sense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for the feedback. I&#39;m on the CF Images product team.
We will allow the download of the original images, it is actually one of the next features coming up. Also we will introduce webhooks and Images Analytics next."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought Cloudflare was going to win the image hosting/serving/resizing game based on their original blog post, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.I kept getting frustrated with the complexity and changing costs of solutions out there, so about a year ago I launched https://www.simplefileupload.com. It&#39;s a super easy, flat rate cost solution to quickly allow users to upload images and files. It provides a customizable upload widget and serves files via a CDN and firewall to protect against attacks. It doesn&#39;t have query param image resizing yet, but it&#39;s coming!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Django has allowed me to enjoy some side entrepreneurship. I have released three products as a solo part time dev that I would never have been able to do in a reasonable time using Java/Spring (my strongest stack). My first project went nowhere, but the second generated 1k+ a month and sold for 50k, and the third one is following a similar trajectory.My advice - keep it simple- function based views- centralize access to the ORM (avoid fat models, use a service layer)- responsive bootstrap template with crispy forms- minimal js- 12 factor type setup - django-environ or similar- be aware of n+1 select problem (I use django debug toolbar but looking into django-zen-queries)- plop it on heroku, AWS lightsail, Digital Ocean or if containerizing use AWS Fargate- avoid celery unless you are at a scale you need it - use django-cron, django-db-queue or similar- use a managed database and managed email serviceI have had zero scalability problems. People say Django is slow but it handled 10k active users on a small EC2 instance without any issues (static stuff served via cloudfront)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Django is the nicest framework I&#39;ve come across! For some context, my favorite overall programming language is Rust. Despite Rust having several web frameworks, I use Python the server due to Django being so nice.In Python, there are micro frameworks like Flask, and whatever new ones claim to be &#34;Blazingly fast!&#34;, async etc. Once you get over the learning curve, Django seems the nicest to use, due to including features like an auto-updating ORM, email, authentication, admin page etc. None of the Rust frameworks, in contrast, come close to feature parity.Django&#39;s feature base is vast, and I admit I don&#39;t understand much of it. You can choose the feature sets you need. The template language is inflexible, but you can smooth this over using JS instead A/R."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We went all in on FastAPI with my team, but we&#39;re hit the issue that the projects of Tiangolo (FastAPI, SQLModel, Typer) seem to be turning pretty much unmaintained : https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/discussions/3970We&#39;ve already been hit by multiple bugs with fixing PR opened, but left to rot, and missing documentation : the &#39;tutorial&#39; documentation is great, but if you want a reference you have to go read the code.I guess that&#39;s the issue when you pick projects maintained by one person, so for my next projects I might get back to something built on stronger grounds, like Django.How is Django this day with modern Python constructs like typing in general and Pydantic models integration ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK. The reason all this happening is that Bitcoin really did go to the moon. That&#39;s what powers all this speculation. If the price of Bitcoin had been stable for a decade, and it worked reliably, it would be a useful medium of exchange, but nobody would care. This is all about MAKE MONEY FAST.Bitcoin found some early use cases. Drugs first. Then getting money out of China. Money laundering. Tax evasion.  Scams. Bitcoin is the scammers dream - remote, anonymous, irreversible transactions. Much less risk of the mark coming for the scammer with a baseball bat.Then China cracked down on cryptocurrency, shut down all the miners, and arrested a few hundred of them. Financial regulators in the more legit countries started regulating Bitcoin exchanges, so the operators couldn&#39;t just steal the money. Know Your Customer became a thing. In the US, the IRS, FinCen, the FBI, and the SEC all started paying attention to what was happening on blockchains. Cryptocurrency crime was no longer risk-free for the crooks.But by now, sheer momentum kept Bitcoin going up. That&#39;s a powerful force. It&#39;s not forever, though. Check out meme stocks a few years later. Remember, all this stuff is zero-sum. For every winner, there has to be a loser.That&#39;s what provides the engine behind &#34;Web3&#34;, NFTs, DAOs, and whatnot. It&#39;s not the technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I completely agree with the author. I&#39;ve been reading a lot about the EVM, and while there&#39;s some interesting technology involved, it feels unlikely to be able to support any worthwhile applications outside of blockchain finance or moving $ around the world[0] (since the code can really only directly reference the blockchain itself).It&#39;s a bit like playing with a programming language in a sandbox that has (1) has no I/O functions[1], and (2) has enormous costs associated with even the most basic of computations. Ok, it&#39;s not like that; it is exactly that.Sure, you could build a crypto toy and convince some suckers to transfer some of their wealth to you, but calling it an app platform or the next evolution of the web is definitely a stretch. I sincerely wish that wasn&#39;t the case (I&#39;d love to find an exception), but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve come to conclude.[0] Don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s tremendous value in being able to move money around the world without the blessing of governments and central banks![1] Any interaction with entities outside the blockchain require oracles, and at that point, you might as well throw away the other benefits of being on a blockchain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find both the evangelism of and the hostility towards “Web 3” kind of silly. Obviously there’s some amount of interesting stuff and obviously there’s some amount of tech bro assholes getting rich who “shouldn’t”.Just like ~2008-2012, ~1999-2002, ~1994-1996, ~1982-1986, etc.On the technology side: distributed Byzantine consensus is an open problem with some promising prototypes. It would have very cool use cases: remittance is huge, ENS is fucking cool, Brave/BAT is cool, NFTs for e.g. concert tickets or restaurant reservations or whatever would be cool, IPFS is cool.The technology isn’t there yet. POW doesn’t scale. Ouroboros Praus/Genesis needs a clock oracle (see: Spanner), Tendermint/Algorand/PBFT are too slow (global 3-phase. commit, right). Solana/ICON/etc. are expensive cloud databases. L2 rollups/Lightning/sharding are “kick-the-can” exercises. But it took time to go from the Paxos paper to Chubby as well, maybe someone solves it.Yeah, it’s mostly scams today. But it’s always been mostly scams. Microsoft bundling IE was a scam. Pets.com was a scam. Path was a scam. Uber and AirBnB were (are?) illegal as hell. Third-party cookies powering Google and FB is a scam.When the dust settles some amount of this stuff will have been worked out technically, legally, and financially, and the rest will be “lol do you remember when…”.This time some people will be rich who neither had rich parents nor knew Bay Area royalty, but YC wasn’t always part of the machine either. I’m sure Goldman and YC will eventually embrace those people with open arms.I for one look forward to us collectively getting our knickers untwisted about it so we can go back to rewriting every calculator app on earth in Rust (I kid! Don’t hit me! Doofy Haskell is better than no Haskell!).;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t know if others have experienced it, but I run a monitoring server from Hetzner and have daily issues with IPv6 latency and packet loss (edit: Finland DC).I monitor 3 other IPv6 locations, the monitoring server will very randomly throw alerts, and only from Hetzner. Yet, when I opened a ticket, I was told it was the fault of the other providers, despite the mtr traces showing otherwise, and not having issues outside Hetzner.Hopefully more IPv6 users means that I won&#39;t be the only one impacted by those networking issues. I find IPv6 useful for servers that are not public-facing. They are firewalled of course, but it also means I can access them directly from home without hops or VPN (my home having a static IPv6 address)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I assume this is common knowledge, but I personally find Hetzner to be exceptionally good.It&#39;s always been good to me when I was using their European data centers, but that was always a bit of a bummer because of latency. Now that they have a DC in the US, I just can&#39;t think of a single good reason to use other cloud providers for smaller deployments. They&#39;re pretty much the best bang for your buck you can get anywhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I often use exodus to move software onto a Synology NAS (after hosing my installation in the past through haphazard use of alternative package managers) and it has been incredibly helpful.  It&#39;s great to be able to bring over utilities without fighting with docker, building appimages, or the like.Thank you so much for it!It just works most of the time, which is wild given how diverse the environments it operates in can be.  One piece of software I have struggled with however is w3m.   Wrong __data_start/_end pair
   Aborted (core dumped)

I get the above error messages which I understand to be related to libc, but I cannot get around it. Is this something anyone has seen before?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This probably won&#39;t work on binaries that contain references to system files necessary in order to run the binary that aren&#39;t code. You usually can&#39;t detect them other than running the program and watching it die, or running the program with strace and looking for the files it&#39;s trying to stat/open.In the past what I&#39;ve done when I have to copy a binary somewhere, is statically compile it in a Docker container and export the install files, then copy those over. I have about a half dozen tools prepped like that (gdb, curl, strace, busybox, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Could this be used to relocate Android-native libraries to other platforms? Even if the architecture matches, the bionic libc calls is what I found more challenging."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is still the strongest apple advantage: design, engineering and build quality.Recently I wanted to buy a second notebook so I could leave my MBPro at home in trips where I didn&#39;t want to work, but still had a machine that run linux and windows for some quick idea or even some light gaming.Decided for a Samsung Galaxy Book Pro. Expensive machine, but slightly cheaper than a MacBook Air. good i7 11gen processor, excellent battery life, very light but with surprisingly good thermals, 1tb SSD, but unfortunately no option to have it with more than 16GB RAM.Anyway, was very satisfied with it, and it was so light that I was even booting it with linux and doing some programming on it.But, one day I just opened the lid by the sides, heard a crack, and the gorgeous OLED screen had cracked.Of course I didnt abuse it, I just opened it, without excessive force or speed. But the screen is very fragile, the lid is paper thin, but not rigid enough, it seems, to avoid this problem.And of course, Samsung says it was my fault, and I will have to pay the fix.And yes, I know people have plenty of complaints about apple, but I never had encountered such an obvious problem with an Apple product. Have they not stress-tested this stuff?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone have a canonical URL to the previous month&#39;s scan of the LEGO mini-figure? I didn&#39;t see any navigation on the site unless there&#39;s a magic spot I missed or am inadvertently adblocking: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29253441This month&#39;s entry comes off way too much like advertising for my taste, with the flowery language like &#34;magic features&#34; instead of just &#34;features&#34;, or the seemingly-unnecessary sales statistics in lieu of a technical description of the Airpods Pro: &#34;In 2020, Apple sold 110,000,000 AirPod products. Talk about mass manufacturing.&#34;Maybe it&#39;s just an unconscious tic when talking about Apple products. Even I have a hard time not saying &#34;Boom&#34; when showing off something cool :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx7v815bYUw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the AirPods Pro were a regression from the OG AirPods for four reasons:- Idle life took a huge dive from the originals. My OGs haven&#39;t been charged in something like six months, and the case is still at something like 20%. Meanwhile, the case holding the APPs would die in less than a week and the buds inside of them a week after that.My wife&#39;s APPs have been lost for a while because of this.- Noise cancellation performs worse than the original firmware. They have actually been outclassed by other offerings, such as the Sony WF1000XM4.- The buds themselves have a design flaw wherein earwax will accumulate in its inner grille severely enough to significantly compromise bass response. There&#39;s a thread in MacRumors that&#39;s something like 36 pages long acknowledging this. Apple quietly fixed this in version 2 of the APPs (with the MagSafe case).- The mic isn&#39;t as good. The original APs performed extremely well in wind and loud surroundings. I think the downward beam-forming mics were a big part of this. The mic on the APPs perform worse in these scenarios IMO.I&#39;m glad that Apple went back to beam-forming mics.Regardless, I&#39;m thankful for Apple for lighting up the true wireless headphone industry. The APs were a dream come true when they came out; nothing before it compared (and I had $600 custom IEMs that were waterproof and had a control scheme controlled by head nods). The APPs accelerated the creation of noise cancelling true wireless. I&#39;m excited for the next iteration of these products."</p>

We have lifted the suspension of your account, and it is once again active and operational.&#34;Thanks hacker news for voting this up and clearly triggering something within the GooglePlex. Still a big -1 for Google/YouTube that their normal processes are completely broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem is not the content of the video, crypto or not. The problem is not that YT moderates aggressively (it doesn&#39;t do enough IMHO) or even how it moderates.The problem is that there is no serious appeals process, and no third party oversight of moderation decisions. This is true for all the big platforms.How do we fix that, IDK, but probably at the government level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s terrifying that the punishments are so draconian (because one false move and you lose access to the entire Google account, and possibly become persona non-grata and lose the ability to create another one even in a company context), it&#39;s hard to understand what the rules are, the appeals process generally won&#39;t help, and even being a paying customer won&#39;t save you.It seems like best practice for any professional who needs to use Google anything would be to avoid Google to the greatest extent possible except in professional contexts, lest some inadvertent mistake (or something malicious like a hack) cripple your career."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is incredibly hard to improve something that your user base doesn’t think needs improving. That part really stands out to me.When I first moved to Postgres I was fairly reluctant - my impression was that it was some arbitrary flavour of sql, and since I was used to MySQL (the only sql database I’d ever used) it seemed incredibly unnecessary to bother with. I imagine there are tons of people out there like I was who would rather let things be.Since the first few weeks I don’t think I’ve ever chosen to use MySQL again; Postgres totally changed my career for the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, the post feels a bit bitter.&gt; ...let me point out something that I&#39;ve been saying both internally and externally for the last five years...Life is short, don&#39;t get stuck in a job/relationship/situation/etc. you hate for half a decade. IMO the irony is that he&#39;s moving to the Chrome team, which has been an absolute shitshow. Woohoo, now you&#39;re going to work on fantastic ways of screwing up the web, inserting ads where we don&#39;t want them, tracking users against their will, and banning extensions on the Chrome store.

That site is a pain in the absolute fucking ass to use on any mobile device, specifically because of the autoplaying video that takes up half the screen on every page load.  Weirdly, desktop is fine; no autoplaying videos or any such nonsense.  It&#39;s only on mobile that Fandom has seemingly made a deliberate effort to make the user experience as frustrating as possible.  And not once has the video had even a tangential relationship to the article being viewed.The worst part is that uBlock Origin&#39;s element picker doesn&#39;t work on Firefox for Android (or if it does, I haven&#39;t figured out how to use it), so on the one platform where it&#39;s maximally annoying I can&#39;t do anything to block it."</p>

I forgot to mention:With a Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266) MCU that costs around USD 2.00, you can pretty easily make the Vindriktning WiFi connected and get the data to a backend [1].You just need to solder three wires, and there is enough space within the enclosure to fit the D1 mini inside.This would then allow you to get the exact measurements and to better understand if the &#34;green&#34; is more on the lower end or the higher side.[1] https://github.com/Hypfer/esp8266-vindriktning-particle-sens..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Informative article with fair, fact based, conclusions.I&#39;d like to add that:- The VINDRIKTNING is extremely consumer accessible ($11.99, good build, simple traffic light system).- It may be put into spaces that previously had no particulate air quality monitoring.- The spouse-acceptance-factor is extremely high (unlike e.g. a couple of circuit boards wired together off of Aliexpress).There are other consumer friendly offerings, but they aren&#39;t affordable (e.g. Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor 4x cost, Airthings 10x cost). That being said, IKEA could fix their traffic-light system&#39;s cut off points for free and should consider it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would be very careful with this kind of evaluation. There are lots of sensors that perform well vs reference instruments but not in the field.If you want real evaluations, SCAQMD (the folks in charge of air quality for southern california) do evaluations of commercially available, low cost sensors, both against reference instruments and the lab.See http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluationsYou can see what i said is true from the table - lots of sensors that are very well correlated with reference instruments in the lab, but suck horribly in the field.I would think you would be better off submitting the sensor in question to them, and letting them put it through its paces.(They publish within a month of finishing testing, and testing takes ~8 weeks)"</p>

2) Everything is bloating now. Instead of a collection of good tools interacting I have now 3+ ways of opening an Excel-File someone shared in Teams. All of them are broken and Teams is broken, too.I feel as if the excellent wrenches I have been using for 20+ years are growing tumors in the form of a can opener. All to please people who never used a wrench or a can opener before. And production of the original wrenches is cancelled. Over night.Next time I need a wrench it may be made of felt, because fedoras are en vogue and the mad hatter has to sink venture capital into expanding his business.(Funfact: In German you could make up the very valid and understandable, but still strange word “dosenöffnerförmige Tumore” )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there at least 3 things at play here:#1) Software used to live on a disk you buy. That software doesn&#39;t change, until buy a new disk. Then it lived in apps, where you can update or not. Now often, it lives in the mythical cloud where changes can happen all the time.Now, even on the disk front, things were always changing. Often for the better, sometimes for the worse. In the OS world Dos-&gt;Windows-&gt;Windows 95 were big changes, and the OS9-&gt;OSX change also huge! But now the changes are always.#2) The entire software world is built on VC money. VC money is not looking for slow and sustainable growth. Or a happy userbase of 10k people. The VC world doesn&#39;t mind if 99 companies crash and burn trying to harvest the wind while building their sails if one takes off.#3) Out of the VC/startup world, large companies must justify their existence and every team and every programmer on that team must justify theirs. No one ever stuck around by saying &#34;everything is good, we literally don&#39;t need to do anything or acquire another customer, let&#39;s all cut out hours to 2 days a week, keep patching bugs and making security updates, be happy with our current level of subscriptions, and spend a bit of time in R&amp;D to make sure we have other bait in the water too if for some reason our users stop liking this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO the answer is the tech version of bullshit jobs.You know the concept - jobs that exist just to exist and pay for someone&#39;s living, though they produce nothing of actual value, and it takes effort to actually remove so no one does.With software it goes something like this:1) A  product is built, something that solves a real issue. It&#39;s new, rough around the edges and has only the basic critical features.2) Funding is found and a large team is hired to implement what&#39;s needed and fix all the rough edges.3) The team comes up with good, new ideas that actually improve the product experience for everyone, so in the eyes of management and the investors they have merit.4) After the first 10 good ideas are implemented, the next ideas are... not as helpful, but some users still like them and nobody wants to fire anyone who&#39;s been doing really good work so far.5) Fast forward a couple of years, the team is huge and there is really no headroom to improve the product. Everyone tries to come up with bullshit ideas and force their ideas through, just to have something to show come performance review time. The users stay with their tried and true product, and they&#39;re so invested at this point that a few regressions make them bitter - but not enough to leave.6) Rinse and repeat.I&#39;ve been on that team. The engineers there are often mentally older, comfortable, and smart - or at least were smart.  Many of them are sure what they do is important. But they&#39;re wrong. They now hold bullshit jobs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it’s just an anecdote but as a customer I kind of believe this.I just completed a transaction with them that had to be extended beyond the rate lock window. For about 10 days there was a daily back and forth where they asked me to provide some documentation. I would provide the requested documentation and about 12 hours later I would receive a task of uploading the same required documentation.The document was a 50ish page legal document that required someone to look at it. It’s clear nobody was actually spending any effort on it. Even calling my loan officer wasn’t getting me anywhere. It wasn’t until the deadline approached that they called me and wanted to get it all sorted out and they extended my rate lock.The way management handled this looks horrible but if there’s any truth to these employees essentially stealing wages from their employer then they’re lucky they’re just being fired and not being prosecuted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The funny thing is that krebsonsecurity.com are the ones that published the false information in the first place.Good summary of the whole saga by Crosstalk youtube channel which covers mostly Ubiquiti: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paLm0tP5GbI"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me a company of their size and, what I would expect, maturity, this new announcement does not satisfy me or provide me much assurance. Consequently I am still happy I have been recommending people against Ubiquiti since the original announcement from Krebs.* Why was it so easy for a lead engineer to get access to a root AWS user without anyone else being notified? I.e. AWS GuardDuty provides FREE alerting for when an AWS root IAM account is logged in or used, this account should be under lock and key and when used, confirmed and audited by relevant persons or teams.Start edit/* Furthermore on the root account being easily accessed, the root account in the companies I&#39;ve worked at had MFA enabled, and the QR code is locked in a safe only accessible by two people agreeing it needs to be accessed in a break glass situation, where warranted./End edit* Why was he also able to delete critical CloudTrail logs and reduce their retention to 1 day? I.e. These logs should be in a S3 bucket or other environment where such changes cannot be made. Alternatively, they should be shipped to a redundant service that manages this risk to prevent data deletion* Why did Ubiquti not announce they were compromised sooner? The hack started in early December, Ubiquiti noticed the compromise on Dec. 28. Ubiquiti told the market on January 11th. Is that a satisfactory turn around? Giving them some credit for the XMas break I&#39;ll say this partially understandable.All the AWS configuration I&#39;m speaking of above, I would describe as Security 101.Most of these settings can be set and managed from AWS Organisations for free, and backed up with alarming and alerts for Guard Duty trivially. That a company of Ubiquiti&#39;s size and maturity had such basic risks not managed is still a concern.I understand AWS Organisations can be difficult to set up for legacy AWS accounts, but even with that said, setting the alarms and monitoring up that would help manage the risk associated to the questions above is not difficult and should have been in place.That Ubiqitui would only find relief ultimately from the developers poor OpSec rather than Ubiquiti&#39;s own security policies and procedures provides a commending perspective of their internal security posture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Investigators say they were able to tie the downloads to Sharp and his work-issued laptop because his Internet connection briefly failed on several occasions while he was downloading the Ubiquiti data. Those outages were enough to prevent Sharp’s Surfshark VPN connection from functioning properly — thus exposing his Internet address as the source of the downloads.Not the first time I’ve read about a VPN unable to mask someone’s ip when they were on a wonky connection."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WebAssembly is kind of a hack here (although a clever hack that saves a lot of effort) - the essence of what the Mozilla folks have done isn&#39;t WebAssembly, it&#39;s a trusted compiler - by which I mean a compiler that emits trustable code, regardless of how untrusted the source is. It&#39;s a really neat idea that I hope to see more adoption of, because our current security models for software suck.Security based on process isolation is extremely inefficient and coarse-grained - having a trusted compiler could (eventually) massively increase performance by removing processes entirely (no more virtual memory! no more TLB flushes and misses! less task switch overhead!) and eliminating the kernel/user mode separation, with an increase in security.&#34;Could&#34; because it&#39;s not clear to me if the reduction in expressiveness from our languages now to future languages with a theoretical trusted compiler (all jump targets have to be known at compile-time?) will be accepted by the majority of the populace. Look at how hard it is to get people to accept borrow-checkers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sandboxing is achieved via RLBox[0], which is a toolkit for sandboxing third-party libraries. It comprises of a WASM sandbox and an API which existing application can leverage. The research paper[1].[0]: https://plsyssec.github.io/rlbox_sandboxing_api/sphinx/[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00572"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I&#39;m understanding this correctly, Firefox compiles its dependencies as WASM, effectively blocking function calls to things it shouldn&#39;t and illegal memory access, and then translates it back to C so it can compile it normally? Sounds neat!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something very similar happened to me with Amazon. I used a new debit card from an online bank to purchase an expensive item and deliver it to a foreign address (which is admittedly suspicious). The payment bounced, Amazon immediately locked my account and requested to see a card billing statement sent to my home address to reactivate it. Upon login I am presented with a stern request for documentation, a pdf upload field, a tweet-sized text field for comments, and all communication comes from a noreply@amazon.com address. All my kindle/audible/etc media immediately became inaccessible.I went through every possible channel to explain that the card does not send me a billing statement and I cannot possibly produce one, requesting to be called or at least emailed by a human, to no avail. After spending tens of thousands of dollars on Amazon over the course of fifteen years I couldn&#39;t even get a personal call from the case manager, and all my purchased media is gone.To this day I have found no resolution, and the only next step is to contact them through a lawyer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people in this thread talking about losing their store credit and app/content purchases. I&#39;d imagine the worst case scenario could be much worse.  Apple runs fairly popular cloud storage services that are strongly encouraged to you for your photo storage and files.  The photo storage especially has an option to automatically delete your local media because it&#39;s already backed up on Apple&#39;s servers.  Will these all be locked out without warning or recourse for a miscellaneous card whoopsie?Even standard files on iCloud.  Who knows how important the average users&#39; cloud files are to them?  (I don&#39;t use public cloud storage at all anymore because of this exact fear - what if some arbitrary billing/transaction error locks me out of everything without recourse?).To be fair I&#39;ve no idea what the person in question got their account locked for and if there was any shadiness involved but I doubt they&#39;d write about it publicly (or get access restored) if there were, which implies that at any time your account and your data can be taken away for something entirely mundane.It makes me really concerned in fact how Google would handle something similar to this - given that for Chromebook users everything (literally EVERYTHING you would normally do locally on a computer) is in/via your Google account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every company (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc) is guilty of pulling this non-sense on customers. It is too easy for them to wipe out thousands of dollars of value with no meaningful explanation (read the Terms and Services and go away? seriously Apple?) and no accountability.IMO, states should enact laws where you can take the company to court in your local county and no contract can override that right. If the termination is found justified, the company must refund all account assets at fair market value and any remaining balance. If it was not justified, the company must reinstate the account, pay all court and legal fees, and a reasonable amount of mandatory punitive damages.Also, I don&#39;t get why Apple et al pull these stunts anyways. They already have a huge &#34;regulate me&#34; post it on their back."</p>

After many rounds of going back-and-forth with the contract, me trying to better understand certain clauses, them going back to the lawyers, etc. I told them I&#39;d be happy to sign if they removed the caluses that stated pretty much anything I created on or off hours belonged to them.They went back to the lawyers and came back to me saying that this is not the first time this has been brought up, that the contract was standard across the org and was originally written for managerial types and C-suites, and that the company had never even considered taking over an employee&#39;s off-hours work, open source or otherwise.I said good, then it should not be a problem to remove the clause. They said they would have another discussion and would really like it for me to join.

The image of Rambler before: &#34;Igor Sysoev created nginx while working at Rambler&#34; (positive association). The image now: &#34;Igor Sysoev created nginx in his spare time and he just happened to work for Rambler at the time and Rambler tried to take away his project by SWATing their office&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new worldgen is incredible, both above and below the surface. Hats off to everyone at Mojang that worked on this!One of my favorite game memories of all time was the first time I played Minecraft during the alpha days and immediately got lost in the world. For me, going into a 1.18 world and finding a giant mountain chain and then finding a cave on the peak of the mountain that falls all the way into a giant underground ocean at the bottom of the world in a huge cavern complete with underground vegetation… it brought me right back to that sense of exploration and wonder that I remember from the very first time I played Minecraft.Also, I found this datapack (sort of like a mod but doesn’t require patching the game since the game natively supports loading datapack files) called Terralith [1] that extends the 1.18 worldgen with even more cool stuff. Wandering around the new 1.18-style mountains is incredible, and then stumbling across something the resembles Yellowstone National Park added by Terralith is even more incredible. It’s worth a try if you like just wandering around in Minecraft marveling at the scenery.[1] https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terralith-overworl..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man. I really do want to like it, but this update is the first one that gives me the Microsoft-finally-took-over vibes. Traversal and with that exploration just became so much harder. The landscape is now riddled with holes that you either build scraggly bridges over, or lead to massive detours. The sides of bodies of water are much higher and steeper on average, making it impossible to see the landscape you&#39;re passing, and getting up there to take a look is tedious.So you&#39;re basically stuck near spawn unless you want to spend much more time getting around.A lot of surface iron was replaced with copper, which is useless, meaning progress is now slower than ever, and grinding becomes even more of a necessity. Generally, many of the items that now clutter the inventory are mostly useless, and the inventory needs constant attention.Minecraft is a fantastic game that I have spent well over a thousand hours on over the last decade, with many more to come very likely. That being said, with the account transition to Microsoft/Xbox and this update that gives me personally the &#34;Microsoft knows whats best for its users&#34; vibes that I still distinctly remember from WLM and Skype, I am definitely less optimistic about the game&#39;s future than I was a few years ago. I do hope my caution proves to be unwarranted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you like voxel world generation, I strongly advise you to check out Veloren[1], it has a much much deeper worldgen that what Minecraft offers.[1]: https://veloren.net/ the game is still under development but it has been playable for more than a year now."</p>

Five new facilties per state?

This looks very polished and much more approachable compared to Ardour or LMMS, and seems like a good candidate. But one feature I really wish my dream &#34;Blender for audio&#34; had would be the convenient device view that Ableton and Bitwig offer for working quickly with effects. It&#39;s so much faster than the type of effect chains offered by DAWs like FL and makes it fun to mess around and experiment with effects-based synthesis. Looking at the screenshots and videos it looks like Zrythm doesn&#39;t have this feature, although I understand how tedious it would be to implement because you would essentially have to write your own effects or create wrappers around others to expose an interface that can fit in a device view. Probably not high on the list of priorities for a work in progress DAW"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks nice, particularly the piano roll.Do any Free DAWs have Ableton-like VST &#34;hiding&#34;? I can&#39;t leave Ableton because of how insane window management gets on complex projects when 10 different VSTs are all fighting for screen space. Even the screenshots for this app look chaotic from all of the VSTs covering the screen at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not the only approach that&#39;s possible. There&#39;s quite a few lifts in France that pull a similar trick, but with only one cable.They solve the problem by having the bar below the clamp be a flexible section, as the bar approaches the turn, a section a static rails forces the bar to rotate 30-40 deg around the cable, moving the protruding part of the clamp out of the horizontal plane. Then the cable passes around a large diameter wheel, also 30-40 from vertical, to create the turn.Because both the bar and the wheel are both 30-40 degrees from vertical, the wheel meets the top of clamp, rather than the side, but cable can still make a turn in the horizontal plane. They&#39;re a little uncomfortable for the rider, because the bar you holding onto gets jerked left and right, but you make around the bend just fine, and without an elaborate 2 wire system.I think the Chardonnet ski lift at  Val d&#39;Isère is an example of this type of lift, but I can&#39;t find any photos of the corner unfortunately.For chair lifts, the lift at Ski Dubai has turn half way up, and their chairs are permanently clamped to the cable. For going up the chair just goes around the outside of normal wheel. For going down, to passes around an elaborate wheel with cutouts to make space for the chair clamp and bar. The running surface of this wheel is made up of smaller rollers, and there&#39;s a big friction break on hub. So a computer watches for incoming chairs, then slows the big wheel down as needed to align the chair with a cut out. You can catch a glimpse of this here (best video I could find)[2].[2] https://youtu.be/M7ghP4YTk3M?t=204"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s BTW also possible to make a left turn on a single rope if you push something against the t-bars.  In German it&#39;s called &#34;Bachmannkurve&#34; and it uses a giant wheel.  You can see it in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfw4em7e2OQVideo quality is bad, but this is what it looks like on a picture: https://blog.jacomet.ch/wp-content/20170120-schwanden-052.jp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Japan, there were a couple of ski lifts that make almost 90-degree turn, called &#34;bending lift (屈曲リフト)&#34;. Near the turning point they put up a warning sign like &#34;please hold tight or you might be thrown off&#34;. As a kid I always enjoyed the experience though. Sadly all of them have been torn down by about a decade ago, due to its high maintenance cost.cf. http://cable.cocolog-nifty.com/sakudo/2006/02/post_d5e1.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at WhatsApp between 2011 and 2019. This FAQ had very specific instructions for how to opt out of sharing that were only available for a limited amount of time. The FAQ serves as documentation of the product and there&#39;s no need to keep online specific instructions that can no longer be followed.In order to opt out, you needed to have an existing account and take specific actions around the time you agreed to the 2016 new terms of service. Based on the internet archive, this article was removed after April 20, 2018, and before May 5, 2018. When it was most likely obsolete (I don&#39;t recall the specific deadlines for accepting the 2016 TOS)On the plus side, the various terms of services are all available without digging in the internet archive https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service/revisions"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Old habits and mindsets never seem to change despite corporate pronouncements and PR puff pieces written by stenographers. The regulators (and legislators) are either the biggest dupes, or much more likely in on it.Let’s not forget the FTC hookup for Netflix by Obama and the eventual payout when he left office.Or Ajit Pai who came from Verizon to run the FTC and undid the Obama era changes favorable to Netflix and inimical to Verizon.——-I hardly see any of these events as triggers for the mass migration to apps like Signal. The network effects seem impregnable for now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instead of arguing how bad WhatsApp is in terms of privacy, people would be better off by switching to more privacy respecting alternatives such as Telegram or Signal.I know it&#39;s hard to switch if most of your friends are on WhatsApp, but you can talk to them and switch together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s worth noting that dig (and host) bypass the normal DNS resolution mechanism used by most programs on the host. i.e. These tools aren&#39;t using getaddrinfo/gethostbyname.Sometimes, I want to see the results from getaddrinfo, which are impacted by caching on the host itself and/or OS-specific configuration settings that dig and host know nothing about. (scutil --dns on macOS, systemd-resolvedand nscd on Linux, etc.)In that case, I usually use ping. e.g., waiting for a DNS change to propagate to a host, I might use:    while :; do ping -c 1 hostname; sleep 1; done"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dig is great and DNS is hella underrated. It seems like not nearly enough folks know how to wield it. At both $lastco and $thisco people just used a mess of configuration to point to service IPs/URIs. I showed them how to set private zones and records for both A and SRV and suddenly everything is just using sane defaults.Side note: does anyone know why dig&#39;s output is so...eye-bleeding? Why does it show so much info by default? +short should be the default. Why the ;; &#34;comment&#34; prefix?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; By the way: if you’ve ever wondered what IN means, it’s the “query class” and stands for “internet”. It’s basically just a relic from the 80s and 90s when there were other networks competing with the internet like “chaosnet”.Reading things like this makes me feel better about the relics in my code that aren&#39;t really hurting anything but would take work to remove."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This comes up every year so I ask a question:If you could fix copyright, how would you do it?Here is what I would do:1.  All works must be registered in a government registry.If it&#39;s not in there it&#39;s not copyrighted.  If you want to register a work from before the law passes, you have to prove you own it under the current system.  This would solve the orphan works problem -- if no one can prove they own it, it becomes public domain.  Basically, ownership should be recorded like actual property with a proper chain of title.  It would be published on a public ledger.2. You must renew your registration every three years.  The fee for renewal will be X% of the revenue from the work, where X = years since first registration - 5 (edit: With a minimum fee of $100 to discourage hoarding useless IP).  First renewal is at 8 years.  Your registration fee would be recorded on the public ledger.If you want to continue to derive benefit from your work you have to pay for the privilege.  After 105 years it will obviously no longer be worth it, but probably long before that.  This would be reported like income taxes -- you self report your profits but if the government thinks you&#39;re cheating, they can audit you.  If you have multiple works in one product (think Marvel movies) then all revenue goes to the oldest work (that way you can&#39;t avoid the fee by putting new and old characters together).If you don&#39;t renew, the work goes to the public domain.How would you fix copyright?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think they even tried to read the ISA spec documents. If they did, they would have found that the rationale for most of these decisions is solid: Evidence was considered, all the factors were weighted, and decisions were made accordingly.But ultimately, the gist of their argument is this:&gt;Any task will require more Risc V instructions that any contemporary instruction set.Which is easy to verify as utter nonsense. There&#39;s not even a need to look at the research, which shows RISC-V as the clear winner in code density. It is enough to grab any Linux distribution that supports RISC-V and look at the size of the binaries across architectures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RISC V is an opinionated architecture and that is always going to get some people fired up. Any technology that aims for simplicity has to make hard choices and trade offs. It isn’t hard to complain about missing instructions when there are less than 100 of them. Meanwhile nobody will complain about ARM64 missing instructions because it had about 1000 of them.Therein lies the problem. Nobody ever goes out guns blazing complaining about too many instructions despite the fact that complexity has its own downsides.RISC-V has been designed aggressively to have minimal ISA to leave plenty of room to grow, and require minimal number of transistors for a minimal solution.Should this be a showstopper down the road, then there will be plenty of space to add an extensions that fixes this problem. Meanwhile embedded systems paying a premium for transistors are not going to have to pay for these extra instructions as only 47 instructions have to be implemented in a minimal solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this is one tiny corner of the ISA, not something that makes ALL instruction sequences longer - essentially RISCV has no condition codes (they&#39;re a bit of an  architectural nightmare for everyone doing any more than the simplest CPUs, they make every instruction potentially have dependencies or anti-dependencies with every other).It&#39;s a trade off - and the one that&#39;s been made is one that makes it possible to make ALL instructions a little faster at the expense of one particular case that isn&#39;t used much - that&#39;s how you do computer architecture, you look at the whole, not just one particular caseRISCV also specifies a 128-bit variant that is of course FASTER than these examples"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have used Apache Guacamole to access running GitHub Actions workflows as remote desktops. It worked super well for testing GUI apps on other operating systems that I didn&#39;t want to deal with setting up.It&#39;s also nice if you want to run a GUI application in someone else&#39;s sandbox.https://github.com/jstrieb/ctf-collab/blob/9300c57364f71fe29..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We adopted Guacamole for access to some of our Windows server production environments; the great thing about it is you can put your corporate SSO / authorization model into a web app to control access and not have to disclose credentials to service accounts to developers. You can also tap off a feed from the guacd that represents a complete screen recording and save it for audit trail purposes.The only issue we&#39;ve had is that FreeRDP (that underlies it for connectivity to Window servers) is a bit fussier than the native RDP environment, or at least we&#39;ve had challenges getting equivalent compatibility across old/odd Windows configurations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using it mainly because of the paranoia of just exposing RDP to the internet. Http(s) is very convenient to add more layers of security, in my case via NGINX (both as LXC containers in Proxmox). I&#39;m using a wildcard domain *.myhome.tld pointed to my static IP. Guacamole is hosted at try_guess_me.myhome.tld, with NGINX basic auth same for all subdomains (further protected by fail2ban). So in total 3 tokens are required (subdomain and basic auth username and password) just to get to the Guacamole login page, where additional username/password + 2FA are required. I used to expose RDP directly for years, but after a chat with a colleague before vacations and a purchase of a NUC for a homelab server decided to strengthen the security slightly.RDP is still much better user experience, so once when I needed a longer session I used Guacamole to access my router admin interface and temporarily expose RDP directly via a random port and a very strong password. I&#39;m still not convinced that the latter combination is not enough, but it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a terrible description of what the law actually does.  Let&#39;s shine some light on the FUD.  The law, H.R. 3684 (as enrolled), defines an &#34;advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology&#34; as a system which can do /one/ of the following:1. &#34;passively monitor the performance of a driver... to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired... and prevent or limit [car] operation if an impairment is detected.&#34;2. &#34;passively and accurately&#34; detect whether someone&#39;s BAC exceeds the Federal limit, and prevent or limit car operation if it&#39;s detected.3. Both.This will apply only after the DOT finalizes a rule describing what all those things actually mean in terms of manufacture.  The law requires that the Secretary publish this rule within the next three years, unless they think it can&#39;t be done, in which case they can push it out another three years.  That rule must give car manufactures at least another two years to implement the requirement.  It also gives the DOT an out to say that it can&#39;t be done, in which case in 2031, they need to write a report to Congress to say why it can&#39;t be done.In software terms, this is a user story that was just submitted for development.  It&#39;s Congress asking the executive branch to do some work, but not actually forcing them to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the way American law-making is done to be fascinating. As far as I can tell the US is the only country on Earth where politicians are able to &#34;bundle&#34; completely unrelated things into a single piece of legislation. It definitely doesn&#39;t happen here in the UK in any substantial way (laws get amendments added on but they&#39;re always at least somewhat related to the main part), and I&#39;ve never heard of it anywhere else in the world.It&#39;s a truly interesting thing to read about from a negotiation perspective, but it must make the process of actually getting things done in politics really hard."</p>

Including an automatic kill switch of this sort in a machine with internet access presents the obvious scenario that a malicious agent could disable your vehicle remotely with no warning.&#34;and also:&#34;...by 2026, vehicles sold in the US will be required to automatically and silently record various metrics of driver performance, and then make a decision, absent any human oversight, whether the owner will be allowed to use their own vehicle. Even worse, the measure goes on to require that the system be &#34;open&#34; to remote access by &#34;authorized&#34; third parties at any time.&#34;What could go wrong..."</p>

&#34;Ok so this just happened. Buckle up.About a month ago my wife broke her pixel phone. It couldn&#39;t be turned on so we couldn&#39;t wipe it.We contact Google and used the device care to get an RMA.Today someone posted nude pictures of my wife and I to her social media accounts. They accessed her Google account and tried to lock us out. They used her PayPal to send someone $5 (a test probably).How could this happen? Well Facebook and Instagram show logins from Texas. The old phone still showed on our find my phone app and it was in Texas. Guess where we sent the phone for RMA? The last ping from the old phone (which was today) was the same as the place we shipped it. The exact location down to the very building. Clearly they fixed the old phone and since it wasn&#39;t wiped, was still logged into her Google account.I called Google and they basically said &#34;woah that&#39;s fucked up we&#39;ll get back to you&#34;. We filed a police report but I don&#39;t expect they will do anything.What are my options here for sueing Google? I know that sounds insane but this breach of trust and privacy is egregious. Hundreds of people have now seen my penis including our friends kids. It&#39;s really fucked up.Any advice on what to do here?&#34;my big question is whether this phone is password enabled.  also this stinks because i know the first comment is &#34;well do a factory reset&#34; but if the phone doesn&#39;t turn on, etc. then i don&#39;t believe that is possible (short of possibly ADP which is out of the reach of 99% of people)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked in these contract cellphone repair/refurbishment facilities many years ago, the big warehouses where telecoms and manufacturers send these warranty phones to be triaged and repaired, and let me tell you, something like this is not surprising at all. Most of the people there did good work, but all it takes is one. Personally I&#39;d never send my phone in to repair, and I&#39;m skittish about buying any refurbished phones."</p>

It’s one of a handful of companies I saw and immediately wished I could invest in.This announcement doesn’t really matter to me since I really like having a hosted service.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see this kind of thing happening all the time, facilitated by third parties.For example, a few months ago I found this funny video of some trombonists playing Bruchner in unusual situations[1] that had been uploaded on 14th September 2015 and noticed it had an obviously-bogus copyright claim for the music (&#34;Song: Calling You (Live), Artist: FUN, Licensed to YouTube by (on behalf of FUN); Songtrust, Sony ATV Publishing, and 2 music rights societies&#34;), with a link to where this bogus &#34;song&#34; had been uploaded[2].The &#34;song&#34; proved to be a video consisting of the original trombone video&#39;s soundtrack played twice, over an unrelated static image, that had been uploaded on 13th May 2021—six years after the video it was ripping off.There was enough information on the &#34;song&#34; video to find out that it had been supplied to YouTube by a company called TuneCore[3] who according to their website offer to &#34;SELL YOUR MUSIC WORLDWIDE: Get your music on Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, TikTok, Tencent &amp; more&#34;.I contacted TuneCore in July to point out that their service was being abused, but got a semi-automated reply to the effect that unless it was _my_ copyright that was being infringed they weren&#39;t interested.  I replied, and also responded to their automated did-Jira-help-you-today survey, in both cases pointing out that they were (however inadvertently) involved in fraudulent activity but (unsurprisingly) never heard back.I see now that the TuneCore &#39;song&#39; video has been made private, but the original trombone video still carries the false copyright claim.So frustrating.[1] https://youtu.be/rY0m2cLH1m8[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-577Wp8yBQ - now private[3] https://www.tunecore.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe worthy of its own post but there&#39;s another kind of overt scammer on Youtube. It goes like this:They find some technically hip, well known content and create a new channel with a very similar name as the originator. Create an exciting full screen ad for a crypto currency faucet scam, with price charts and crawls. &#34;Live&#34; stream the original content inset into the ad.Here&#39;s one example: https://cryptoplayboys.blogspot.com/2021/11/spacex-scam-live...Even if you report these things, they don&#39;t get removed very quickly. They&#39;re getting tons of views so why would YT care? The original content holder would care about being associated with them and should sue for defamation though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the strategies that changed my sleep quality for the better is to stop taking coffee after 9 AM; after learning that caffeine has a half-life of around 6-7 hours[0], but a quarter-life of around 12 hours. If you have a cup of coffee at noon, a quarter of that caffeine can still be circulating around your brain at midnight.[0] https://youtu.be/k5BMGmf1ai0"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Josef Pieper[0] has written about leisure at length. What we call &#34;rest&#34; today is largely either idleness or recreation and something meant only to &#34;recharge us&#34; so that we can continue to work. But this is ass-backwards and not leisure. Leisure is what we work for and this was reflected, among other things, in the medieval culture of religious feasts. Our modern culture is a work-centric culture, but the middle ages were more of a leisure-centric culture.To better understand what leisure is, Pieper points to the etymological roots of words like &#34;school&#34; (from the Greek word for &#34;leisure&#34;) and points to the distinction between the liberal arts and the servile arts (the former are superior to the latter and what the latter exist to enable). By definition, work is for the sake of something; you don&#39;t work for work&#39;s sake. Our culture either worships work for its own sake (an absurdity and largely a neurotic distraction from our own nihilism) or it terminates with a preoccupation with consumption and indulgence of various appetites. A culture frustrated by a false materialistic/mechanistic anthropology will produce this kind of vulgar ethos.[0] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767958.Leisure"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been a professional artist for about twenty years and it is my considered opinion that any &#34;rule&#34; given out to beginners is actually a warning: violate this rule and making something that looks good becomes a lot harder, so you should probably better make sure you&#39;re not violating any other &#34;rules&#34; unknowingly.If you know damn well that you&#39;re violating multiple rules then sure, go for it - break your perspective, fill the drawing with tangents, shade with black, etc, break the fuck out of these rules, and you can end up with something pretty good. You have to know your shit backwards and forwards to really pull this off; go look at how solid Picasso&#39;s pre-Cubist stuff was, for instance.There are good reasons to choose to use black and there are good reasons to avoid using it; this article talks about several. IIRC, one of the reasons painting teachers traditionally like to tell you to avoid it is because most commonly available black pigments can very quickly ruin the saturation of any other color you mix it with, ending up with unpleasantly grey shadows. But if you do more graphic work that treats each color as a largely separate entity then a lot of solid black can make stuff positively glow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"#000 on my screen isn&#39;t going to be pure black either.  There&#39;s ambient light, the black level on the monitor, etc.  Several of the examples of saturated grays in this article are low-contrast UI that&#39;s hard to read.  Please don&#39;t do that.&#34;Words on web pages aren&#39;t black&#34;.  But they should be #000 or close to it.  Let the user&#39;s screen and environment determine the rest.Interfaces are artificial constructs designed to be as readable and understandable as possible.  Looking at the color of shadows and physically dark things is unhelpful for designing readable interfaces with sufficient contrast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a design background and have written a lot of CSS, and I have opinions so just interpret this all as a personal preference if you want.* It&#39;s basic floor/ceiling stuff. Once you go #000000, you can&#39;t go any darker. Are you 100% sure the thing you&#39;re making #000000 is the absolute darkest thing on your site/app you&#39;ll ever need to declare?* Conversely, never use white! Modern macOS sucks at this! A large window of Mail.app in light mode is pretty blinding. What if you want to add a subtle highlight to a button border on a white background? #fafafa was always a go-to white for me because its easy to remember.* Shadows are really never black and your CSS shadows will look better if you don&#39;t default to black. Toggle &#39;tint shadows&#39; on the _excellent_ css shadow palette generator: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/shadow-palette/. Play with background colors, you&#39;ll see.* Your design will never please everyone, especially anything close to a majority on certain tech news aggregators."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an algorithms class (6.006 or 046?) with Silvio Micali, who I learned partway through the semester was one of the first authors about these things.Anyway, he was a great professor. When talking through algorithms, he&#39;d always start with say, an n^4 solution. Then cut it down to n^3, call on people to help out, etc. I remember it being something like this (in an Italian accent that we really enjoyed)&#34;And now we&#39;re at n^2! Pretty good you might think eh? After all, we were at n^4 just a few minutes ago, this is much better? But, the human mind is a wonderful thing! It is so creative and some people thought about it, and they got n log n! Amazing. I know you are thinking, n log n is always as good as it gets in this class. Well I don&#39;t want to go into the details because, it is horrifying! But actually some people, they did even better! And you know as I said, the human mind is amazing! So maybe one day, you will do even better.&#34;Also I sat across the aisle from him when Eliezer Yudkowsky came for a talk and only realized it when he answered a question EY asked the audience.This kind of turned into me reminiscing but my point is, the guy who put these out there and did a lot of work on them is a great undergrad professor and that makes me happy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert, but coming from a logic background, I always think that ZK proofs are fudging the idea of &#34;completeness&#34; (and &#34;soundness,&#34; for that matter). For example, in [1] (Definition 1.1):&gt; We note that the constants 2/3 and 1/3 are arbitrarily chosen for simplicity. We can always amplify the completeness probability to 1 − negl(λ) and the soundness probability to negl(λ) with repetition.But that&#39;s not completeness in the metamathematical sense. That&#39;s a statistical boundary on what it takes to &#34;convince&#34; someone (or &#34;gain knowledge&#34;). But that&#39;s a stochastic redefinition of a pretty hard-line property of proof systems. In other words, you could theoretically have no knowledge and just get astronomically lucky to an arbitrary degree (whatever degree it would take to cross that proof threshold).[1] https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs355/18sp/lec3.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while back I came up with a third ZK Where&#39;s Waldo protocol [1] that avoids the need to watermark the page or search Alice for contraband, and also has the (usually desirable) property that it&#39;s only convincing to Bob.You instead have Bob randomly choose whether Alice must a) pull off the screen, revealing the original page, or b) punch a hole through to Waldo, but not both. Then you can do any number of rounds of this, with Alice putting the page in a random position each time.It&#39;s only convincing to Bob because bystanders (or rather, anyone not part of the random number generation for which challenge to use) can&#39;t rule out the possibility that they conspired to have Bob always pick the challenge that a faker Alice could solve. (Show the original page when the uses the real one, punch a hole when she uses a fake page.)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15323790Edit: That original comment gives the &#34;magic formula&#34; for coming up with such ZKPs as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Arguably, this is the real use case Pegasus was designed for. A government (Uganda) that does not have a large and mature civil service that would support a G7 level technical domestic intelligence agency went to market for the tools of one (NSO), so they can keep tabs on foreign intelligence agents (state department staff) in their country. I am not a fan of NSO at all, but this case sounds like they&#39;re providing sovereignty or statecraft as a service to a government that prefers to buy instead of build their security capability.When the game is defined as a competition for how to break its rules in the most unexpected ways and with the fewest consequences, Uganda appears to have joined in with aplomb. To me it&#39;s the first time an NSO story doesn&#39;t seem like a scandal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I, personally, find very interesting is that a lot of wording from the coalition contract on this and related matters is apparently taken from or at least based on [0] a document [1] released by the CCC for that very purpose. I haven&#39;t personally carefully verified this to be true, but I have no reason to distrust the linked report.[0] https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=9f60b12e[1] https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2021/ccc-formulierungshilfe-re...(both in German)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is [...] a prohibition of state authorities to keep vulnerabilities a secret.This is another great thing. It is simply unethical to hoard vulnerabilities, as this will eventually backfire[0]&gt; On top that all future security legislation will be subject to an evaluation by a panel of independent experts who have to look into issues with any potential restrictions on freedom.I really hope this will be people from the CCC.[0]: https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/28/nsa_backdoor_wyden/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is all fine and dandy until the new Innenminister is starting his or her work early next year.They will project the concerns of the civil service and somehow carve out enough special regulations that will all but hollow out any such rights.I really want to believe that the majority of the coalition parties believe that they are saying, but that&#39;s not how politics are made or put into practice.E.g., after Zimmermann, there was great hope that Germany would be a lot less conservative in it&#39;s interior policy, but following interior ministries have not really become much less conservative.Here&#39;s to hope, though - Cheers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I LOVE Blender, like, a kind of love that&#39;s embarrassingly too much for a software. No to mention that my work or hobbies don&#39;t often interface with 3D modeling.So I have been thinking about what makes this project so special. I think it&#39;s the fact that the community owns it. So you don&#39;t have to ask for permission to do anything. Mix that with inherently creative people who approach the tool and you get:AI-generated Kanye West rap teaching you how the modifiers work - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Nn5Uilso0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a solo game developer working in Unreal Engine. I typically buy environments and props from the Unreal Marketplace and modify them to meet my needs. Unreal&#39;s built-in modeling tools are usually enough for my purposes so I rarely open Blender, but when I do, I am so appreciative that this software exists and is free to use.It&#39;s incredible how far Blender has come. I remember the days when time between significant releases was measured in years, not months. The progress they&#39;ve made in recent years — particularly since Epic Games gave them a $1.2 million Epic MegaGrant — has been impressive, and encouraging to watch.Thank you to all who fund Blender, and thank you especially to the people who make it. You&#39;re making a difference in the lives of many indie developers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a Frankfurt-based toy store owner who has been very vocal on Youtube about the quality and value problems in recent Lego sets. Lego has sued him multiple times but Streisand effect set in and he has gained a large audience.If anybody who understands German langauge is up for some great irony from a charismatic toy professional on this topic, you should have a look.WARNING: You will waste some hours on this..  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9OKWm_x2RI&amp;t=1504s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw a term in the comments: AFOL. I had to look it up: Adult Fan Of Legos.I loved legos as a kid and would spend hours building stuff. Now the kits seem more like models to be assembled and put on display and not touched rather than “a paint brush of blocks” where I can use my imagination. It lost my interest. My attention is now on software where I feel I can build anything. I liken it to my lego experience as a child.I don’t necessarily think there’s a right or wrong thing here. It’s interesting to note how our mind changes as we age and grow older. The ”do anything” mentality get displaced with something else. This would make for an interesting PhD topic. :)I found another quote from a related article that captured this feeling.    “It’s like a blast to the past, straight to our childhoods,” said Deason, 40, who lives in Connellsville, Pa. “It took me by surprise, but it makes sense: Life is so structured. But with Lego, you can do anything.”

    Deason has a few million Lego pieces, which she organizes by type and color. The Star Wars and Architecture sets, she says, are the most popular among adults, who almost always look for the instruction manuals.

    “The younger kids come in and it’s all about their imaginations — playing pretend, building zombie towns,” she said. “But at some point that gets lost. The adults seem to value the final finished project. That’s where they get their satisfaction.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d say someone earned a free AT-AT for the bug report.On the one hand that&#39;s a minor quibbling little problem there, &#34;I have to use tools on this one part when disassembling it&#34;, and then the dearth of such problems during their run is an amazing testament to their engineering process. That they have fans that can catch this issue and explain it so well is another testament to the standards they&#39;ve maintained.Can we call &#34;lego instructions&#34; an example of software design? I think we must. Programs designed to run on meat CPUs of unknown specs."</p>

Once the door is open for censorship, it all works just like lies do, and it&#39;s often associated with lies and or hurt egos, say lack of acceptance and respect, and it tends to spread, until it&#39;s ridiculous.And let&#39;s get real here:  This whole mess is because the government and big media don&#39;t like being near constantly ratioed.They do have the option of improving how they work and what they say, but maybe they feel it is easier to just try and hide the problems.  People went away from broadcast because of this crap, and reproducing it online means people will go somewhere else again.What it won&#39;t do is transform things into being reputable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The majority of YouTube traffic comes from mobile devices (this can be observed in Google Ads for any video campaign), which is losing market share because of Tictoc.Google will do whatever it takes to monetize every inch of their investment. By turning off dislikes, users will be forced to engage with additional content.This is also visible on the other side of the spectrum - Google is pushing heavily integrated campaign products (e.g. Performance Max Campaigns), which include non-performing channels as display and video (in comparison to search), which can&#39;t be turned off.At this point they can, as they are a monopoly, but I hope they will get burned, as they are introducing more and more dark patterns, which result in lower than poor user experience.My take on this - AdBlock relentlessly, support creators directly. Switch platforms eventually - there&#39;s choice out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hacker News has a similar problem with comments:  net_votes = up_votes - down_votes

You need at least two of the above variables to get an idea of both the direction and magnitude of the voting. Hacker News provides only one: net_votes. YouTube used to provide up_votes and down_votes, effectively providing all three. Now YouTube has reduced its information to up_votes, so they&#39;re now down to one variable in the equation, as Hacker News has been all along.The difference between 102+/100- votes and 2+/0- votes is large, but invisible on this site. I think it would be better for HN to go to where YouTube was, giving us an idea of both the net vote and the level of activity. Like up/down or up/total or net/total."</p>

Google how to fix something and their docs are missing, outdated, and often in broken english.The screen itself is big but slow to refresh and in most modes leaves traces of the previous pages. They have a manual button to full refresh the page, but a user shouldn’t have to do that.It’s not a certified android device so you have to jump through a bunch of somewhat insecure hoops to get the play store installed and log in.Privacy: There privacy statement basically says “lol we promise to be private k?” So I want to run this thing through wireshark to see how true that is. My only skepticism is that it’s a Chinese company, and that might not be fair, but given the information I have on my device it would be good to confirm.All that said, they have a color eInk screen that’s coming out soon that looks wonderful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed Sam Newman&#39;s take on this capability [1]&gt; Great to see AWS providing direct data coupling as a service. /s&gt; This service allows you to directly map a GraphQL endpoint to a database table. It’s like putting getters and setters on an object and claiming your encapsulating private variables. The end result is coupling between GraphQL clients and the underlying datasource.&gt; Information hiding is a key concept in independent change. Can I change the provider (of the GraphQL) endpoint independent of the clients? Directly exposing internal data structure makes this very difficult.And [2]:&gt; So a few people have asked why I have this snarky response. What is my problem with this service? Well, to be clear, it’s not an issue with GraphQL, it’s an issue with direct coupling with underlying datasources #thread&gt; The service as advertised makes it simple to map a GraphQL definition against a database. Now, what’s the problem with this? Well, the devil here is in the detail. But fundamentally it comes down to how important information hiding is to you.&gt; ... see the thread for more ...[1] https://twitter.com/samnewman/status/1346541251617828877

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those unfamiliar with ITA Matrix, it was for a long time the go-to flight search tool for the most dedicated flight hackers, points hackers, etc.It was built by ITA Software [1][2] in the early-mid 2000s (the earliest mention I can find of it is in 2004 [3]) to test and showcase the capabilities of their flight search platform. I once heard that ITA and other consumer-facing flight search companies had tested that kind of UI with ordinary users, but found that not enough people understood or liked it enough for them to justify making it a mainstream interface.Hipmunk, a YC-backed flight search site that launched in 2010, was heavily influenced by the ITA Matrix UI, after co-founder Adam Goldstein had found Matrix to be the best way for him to find flights when travelling around the world for college debating competitions. And while Hipmunk did a good job of being more consumer-friendly and popular than Matrix had been, sadly they didn&#39;t gain enough traction to make it as a standalone company, and after being acquired by SAP/Concur, it was shut down last year.It&#39;s an interesting, and perhaps depressing case of a product design concept being far superior to what&#39;s available in the mainstream for a certain class of user, but cannot gain enough mainstream acceptance to be a viable business or even a well-supported service for those who love it. And far more than most other product categories, flight search has huge infrastructure costs, so it&#39;s very difficult to economically sustain niche products (from grim personal experience of being part of a team trying to build a novel flight search product ourselves).In this case it&#39;s just lucky that Google owns the infrastructure and has enough enthusiasm internally to keep it going to some extent.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA_Software[2] https://xconomy.com/boston/2008/12/17/ita-software-the-trave...[3] https://www.fodors.com/community/europe/customs-question-sea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ITA Matrix is still my go-to for booking flights:https://matrix.itasoftware.com/Playing with this version, it&#39;s a little easier to use, but I don&#39;t see any functionality not in the regular version. Still, if it means Google is investing in Matrix, that&#39;s a good thing. I always worry at some point it will be killed."</p>

Based on hardware costs (significant) and power costs (insignificant) you’re looking at a hardware ROI at about 6 months from the $.65 per hour price. AWS has an estimated 60% gross profit margin, so from there it’s probably possible to estimate some other interesting things about their costs, utilization rate and 
depreciation schedule.Edit: Sorry, my napkin math assumed a unstated utilization rate of 40 hours per week, but that’s not a great assumption due to the 24 hour minimum. Still, some proportion of machines will be idle, though 75% idle seems like a bad guess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is profoundly insightful.I have been searching for patterns and insights in this field for 25 years.  What 
 apenwarr concludes is true:    All we need is to build distributed systems that work. That means decentralized bulk activity, hierarchical regulation.


The problem is, everyone wants distributed systems that require everyone else to agree (global consensus), which is literally impossible (see: CAP theory, and what happens when Partition occurs).  There&#39;s another word for &#34;require everyone else to agree&#34;: Tyranny.Fortunately, the entire universe and everything in it works without global consensus, just fine (for various definitions of &#34;fine&#34;).There is also methods for building computational distributed systems that work &#34;fine&#34; in the face of CAP failure:https://holo.hostThis is a serious breakthrough.  And we really, really need this, NOW.Just to whet your appetite, here&#39;s some high-level observations on how these breakthroughs may affect our lives, in the area of Money: https://perry.kundert.ca/range/finance/holochain-consistency..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly believe that money itself has been corrupted lately, this then causes all number of bad flow on effects to happen. A massive shift happened when central banks started getting involved in direct purchases of various asset types and we started to see a major distortion happen in monetary policy that which has distorted the functioning of money itself. For example who would care if their business is completely unprofitable if it could get access to freshly printed money every quarter to prop it up. What then happens to all the other businesses who don&#39;t get access to that freshly created money? When we have situations like the BoJ owning more than 60% of the Nikkei 225 we really ought to be asking some serious questions about if we really have free markets? We also should be asking some questions about the properties we desire in money itself. If a central monetary agency can go about unconventional monetary policy such as purchasing equities we can quickly have a situation whereby an unelected group of bureaucrats can damages the ability of money to be used as a means to convey information. Further there&#39;s questions about picking winners and losers that comes up there too. As a whole I think people need to ask what money is again and have some serious conversations about what money and the monetary system should be. It seems that these difficult questions really fell out of favor a while ago and as a result things have been drifting in a direction that many people aren&#39;t comfortable with.If we don&#39;t ask these questions then technological approaches to money, like various cryptocurrencies and other financial technologies are unlikely to actually cause long lasting improvements. We have some serious monetary policy problems in the world right now and while some tech could help (in some cases) these aren&#39;t primarily technological problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"* Everyone seems to increasingly be in it for themselvesI was fortunate to have had a career with mild autonomy to help other team members even if it was slightly out of my job description. But this only happens in a shared office environment where you can see when someone is falling behind or overhear a problem. That physical presence also creates a bond with co-workers that&#39;s often more powerful than the corporate mission.But working from home for the past years I feel like I mercenary working among mercenaries. Working with people that have never met and will never meet and for whom work isn&#39;t about the mission or the customer. If I get work done early, I now just call it a day. Why bother with ad-hoc testing, documentation, checking in on that new hire, proposing a conference paper, investigating technical debt, etc. It&#39;s liberating but it&#39;s also depressing."</p>

You use yaw to rotate your monitor away, toward the hallway or window."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer to work with a single large external monitor. If my device is a laptop I keep it in clamshell mode when attached to an external monitor. I find switching applications with keyboard shortcuts and focusing on one thing at a time has improved my productivity. Using two or more monitors made it so easy for me to get distracted. To each their own though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"fools begone.The ideal monitor rotation --the one that secures the most favour on HN-- is a slow 1-2 centimetre per second continuous orbit about the office in 2 dimensions on a tracked rail.  This in turn ensures that one may not only glorify their monitors rotation, but also glorify their practice of standing whilst working instead of sitting.  The movement --which rotates as well amongst its own Z axis-- also promotes good evangelical proselytization of the many woes of desk sitting, for example, that ten million people die per second for not standing at the lectern as a fourteenth century pork belly clearinghouse clerk.At days end then the monitor should be guided into a velvet sack, and stored gently atop a layer of old Haskell parchments that it may succor inspiration at the next stand-up which is conducted standing, as our christ lord intended."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regardless of your opinion on piracy, I think Google (and ISPs) should not moderate search results.Basically, search engines are used to find things publicly available on the internet, policing should be done on the actual hosts of the content.Same goes for ISPs, they are here to provide access to publicly available computers, without interfering with the content or accessibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google already acts upon DMCA requests, delisting sites if requested. They add a small note to the end of their results to inform you if the page should normally have had more search hits.So this raises so many questions. Has _no party_ requested to delist TPB under DMCA?!That sounds incredible if true. But the only explanation I have for Google feeling like they need to go this far, delisting on their own initiative! It&#39;s like a scenario that should never have to happen, and something they should never do either.So what&#39;s going on here?Update: Ugh, editorialization... Apparently court has been involved here and while Google may not be individually targetted and forced YET, so &#34;voluntary&#34;, it&#39;s easy to see how Google see the writing on the wall and choose to comply. No point in fighting this with such a clear cut DMCA violation. But in this case I&#39;m still surprised it took this long!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Search itself is now a threat to the open web. Forget Chrome.Google willingly interferes, in a heavy-handed way, with both search suggestions and search results, with both Google Search and YouTube. Just try to look up any topic on YouTube, and you&#39;ll have to get past the hundreds of mainstream media channels covering the event, before you actually find the original video. They artificially promote &#34;authoritative sources&#34; which are anything but, since they may be second-hand coverage of original videos that get buried in search results.Google&#39;s results are not only manipulated by clever SEO people[0], but by employees[1], in direct contradiction to Sundar Pichai&#39;s sworn testimony. Some of that is very defendable. But there&#39;s zero transparency. Given their search monopoly, and that most people aren&#39;t aware that search results are manipulated, Google Search is the web. Websites that get delisted are presumed to have ceased to exist. Focusing on browsers (Firefox) is good, but no longer enough.That&#39;s why Google Search itself is now a threat to the open web. Switch to other engines. DuckDuckGo, Brave Search are the ones I trust, and there&#39;s tons more.[0]: how many times have you tried looking for a machine&#39;s user manual, mistyped the model number, and somehow &#34;found&#34; a webpage with the manual for a product that didn&#39;t exist? and then modified the model number further and found more results from the same website, with relevant keywords and yet another incorrect model number? My understanding of SEO isn&#39;t good enough to know how they do that. I don&#39;t believe websites can dynamically alter their index to show up for so many typoed search queries.[1]: https://medium.com/@mikewacker/googles-manual-interventions-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason to block the merger is pretty straightforward:1) Nvidia designs expensive chips and sells them by the millions. [1]2) ARM designs cheap chips and sells them by the billions. [2]3) Nvidia&#39;s &#34;normal&#34; product departments are incentivized to prevent ARM from competing with Nvidia&#39;s expensive chips, in various ways. This would hinder ARM&#39;s innovation and growth opportunities vs being independent.I am glad to see this motion to block the merger, for the sake of a competitive market for CPUs, GPUs, etc.[1] https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-hits-new-highs-in-gpu-...[2] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/arm-6-7-billion-chips-per-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the most megalomanic thing I&#39;ve ever heard of. ARM has high chances to be both the next x86 and the most common embedded architecture. While at the same time Nvidia GPUs are already the de facto standard for GPU computing. So Nvidia would have monopolies in 2 verticals. No reasonable and competent antitrust commission could ever allow that - although probably everyone was betting the latter wasn&#39;t the case..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strategically, why wouldn’t the US gov’t want a US company owning ARM? Why is the FTC pilling on to block this? How would I, as a consumer, be harmed by a graphics company owning an instruction set and design specification?Stopping two US companies from merging because it would create a monopoly and negatively impact US consumers is one thing. But this isn&#39;t even remotely the case here? Doesn&#39;t the US government get more tax revenue if Nvidia makes some extra dough charging royalties for that IP? I’m confused."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Facebook (meta)‘s key asset is now WhatsApp.Facebook is practically dead. It’s just a stream of awful content that isn’t from your friends. It’s hyper advertising and desperate attempts to clone other platforms as it slowly dies. It’ll continue for a long time, eventually becoming yahoo like, but young people do not care about it at all.Instagram has similarly been over monetised but in an earlier stage. It has been roundly defeated by TikTok, utterly destroyed by TikTok, in the battle for teens’ attention.Oculus was a great buy but the gap (in terms of years) between instagram’s peak and oculus really coming online is just too wide to “save” the company.In contrast, WhatsApp is still used across the generations. It’s the one platform where grandparents and grandkids are both active users.If I were Zuck then I’d focus on turning WhatsApp into an Asian-style chat platform with integrated services. That I can’t wire money on WhatsApp in the U.K. is I think a very very big strategic error on his part.It seems clear Facebook (meta) can’t build anything truly new, but they can certainly extend platforms - they should focus on WhatsApp. It has longevity, strong network effects, and huge potential. Just don’t use ads and destroy it.Otoh Facebook deserves to die so I hope he continues to think oculus will save them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook aside you really see this across the board on almost any platform, that once the product reaches it&#39;s 1.0 stage, (where it is good, does what the users want it to do, and has realised its vision) it begins a process of gradual decay, as the focus of the product managers (now panicking to find some statistics to improve to show their bosses) shifts from &#34;building functionality&#34; to &#34;increasing engagement/retention/active users per month&#34;.Whatever product it is, whether a social media platform or an online learning platform, it will slowly be zombified into an attention sucking machine, whose goal has now become to keep you interacting with the app as much as possible (using ML and DL of course).I mean, Twitter now sends me daily notifications that a person I follow made a random tweet (wasn&#39;t this the purpose of the news feed?), Udemy now has a notification service and an inbox that fills up with automated messages that are just a &#34;welcome to the course&#34; message. Everywhere I look, the pattern is the same, Product is good &gt; Product adds social features &gt; Product attempts to cluster user activity and make recommendations based on social features.We, as in the IT industry, need to come up with a culture or methodology of &#39;declaring a product complete&#39; whereby all product managers are gracefully allowed to move on and a product is put into a state of stasis, where bugfixes and the occasional relevant feature is built. If a product was not designed to show intelligent recommendations, use gamification or become a notification dashboard then that should be bared from ever appearing in its Backlog.I&#39;m deeply worried about the long-term effects of an industry that is booming by sending sending some of our brightest minds to scale the economy of distractions Or to innovate Ad-tech.I really hope we&#39;ll look back at this age with the same wisdom-fuelled disgust we have when we look back at the early industrial age. Where smog factories were built in the middle of cities and dusty kids were shovelling coal. We lack any sort of foresight wrt. the digital economy we&#39;re building. Maybe one day we&#39;ll find a healthy alternative to make software-products users love.But until then, seldom are the days where I do not look at the internet with such savage despair."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand Instagram language. My GF uses it. It is full of digital influencers, people who make money because they are digital influencers. Young people with sometimes funny but generally pointless and most often ridiculous dancing moves to an equally ridiculous repetitive song. People buying expensive things, doing idiot things talking about uninteresting details of the uninteresting lives of equally uninteresting people...I don&#39;t understand the hypnotic effect it has."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What we&#39;re seeing here is one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a population of &gt; 80M people crumbling over a few thousand ICU patients because of long-standing issues that were never addressed.The staffing problems in hospitals (and nursing homes) have existed much longer than Covid. I heard a lot about them myself when I did my FSJ (volunteer work) back in 2004, and it&#39;s only gotten worse since then. Our government is in full CYA mode, and doing everything they can to blame a scapegoat for problems they themselves have willingly created over decades. It&#39;s despicable, and nobody should support it.FSJ is a year-long volunteer program for young people typically organized and funded by NGOs like the Red Cross and similar. I worked with small children, plenty of the other volunteers I met regularly worked in hospitals and nursing homes. They all talked at length about how atrocious the working conditions were and how they were asked to do things they weren&#39;t legally allowed to (e.g. taking blood, handing out medication) because the staff shortages were severe enough that people didn&#39;t have enough time to adhere to very reasonable safety rules anymore. That was 17 years ago.This is a well known, widely publicized[0] and not at all new problem, and the unvaccinated are not to blame for it. Let me repeat, we&#39;re talking about one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a population of 83M people crumbling over a few thousand ICU patients.[0]Some random articles from 2018/19 (German):https://gesundheit-soziales.verdi.de/themen/mehr-personal/++...https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/wenn-aus-notstand-panik-...https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2018-05/pflegenotsta...https://www.rbb-online.de/kontraste/ueber_den_tag_hinaus/bil..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a double vaccinated German, I am very disappointed and angry about this move.Our politicians have failed to prepare the country for the Winter (who could have known...). We lack a basic strategy how to cope with Covid.And now they try to fix this by dividing the country in two. This will have no effect whatsoever on the infections, it will just continue to drive a divide that is already existing and will make anti-vaxxers even more convinced that this is a big conspiracy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If we were a serious society, then the conversation would be about:immune vs non-immunehigh risk vs low riskinfectious vs non-infectiousBut no, it&#39;s jabbed vs unjabbed. It doesn&#39;t make sense. Everyone in Germany who wants the vaccine has had it, and if you&#39;ve had Covid, you&#39;re about as protected as the vaccinated. Furthermore, leaky vaccines don&#39;t prevent transmission, can&#39;t eliminate the virus (animal reservoirs) and may even make it more virulent. See Marek&#39;s disease: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15757475/ https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/leaky-vac...This is not a rational, science-based policy. This is about punishing the non-compliant, mostly the under class. As the upper class continues with their events surrounded by masked servants, with endless examples of officials breaking their own rules. Worse, we are normalizing the dehumanization of a group of people who we&#39;re told are diseased and dangerous and it&#39;s all their fault. Germany of all places should be absolutely allergic to such rhetoric."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ex-Ubiquiti employee here. Nick Sharp wasn&#39;t just a senior software engineer. He was the Cloud Lead and ran the whole cloud team. His LinkedIn profile will confirm it. This is why he had access to everything.Nick had his hands in everything from GitHub to Slack and we could never understand why or how. He rose to power in the company by claiming to find a vulnerability that let him access the CEO&#39;s personal system, but nobody I spoke to ever knew what the vulnerability was. I discussed this with another ex-Ubiquiti person in an old thread [1] Now I&#39;m positive he faked the security issue as a power move, just as he faked this attack for extortion purposes.He would also harass people and use his control over Slack and GitHub against the people he didn&#39;t like. Many people left around this time partially because Nick made everything so difficult at the company. What a terribly depressing series of events.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26694945"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the idea that intelligence lies within a spectrum. Someone might be incredibly smart about a narrow topic or field, yet be blind to their own stupidity within another realm.To me, this seems like a classic example. To quote the press release: &#34;During the execution of that search, SHARP made numerous false statements to FBI agents, including, among other things, in substance, that he was not the perpetrator of the Incident and that he had not used Surfshark VPN prior to the discovery of the Incident.  When confronted with records demonstrating that SHARP purchased the Surfshark VPN service in July 2020, approximately six months prior to the Incident, SHARP falsely stated, in part and substance, that someone else must have used his PayPal account to make the purchase.&#34;This man was a senior developer yet this quote sounds like it comes from a nine year-old. Not to mention &#34;hire a lawyer, don&#39;t talk to the police&#34; has always been pretty solid advice.He now faces significant prison time, and the strong potential for a dismal life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mr. Sharp is apparently not so sharp. He carried out the attack from his home network. He connected directly for enough time that his bare IP was logged. The rest of the time, he carried out the attack using a commercially purchased VPN solution that was trivial to trace back to him via the purchase record. He lied to the FBI. (I have yet to understand why people talk to law enforcement instead of staying silent so as to not implicate themselves.) And, for no apparently good reason (meaning, there&#39;s no claim of him shorting the stock), after the raid, he seeded fake news that drove the company&#39;s stock down 20%."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when Edgeium was new and just Chrome but with a lot of Google cruft removed, I actually used Edge instead of Chrome when I was on Windows. It was the same browser with some additional tweaks that I quite liked.Then Microsoft started this aggressive, disruptive push to bring it to iOS Safari&#39;s level as the only browser people should use.I don&#39;t know any good operating systems for normal people anymore. Windows 10 and 11 are hostile, macOS only runs on very expensive hardware and doesn&#39;t run most programs people need (because the business world is still Windows oriented) and Linux has been making progress but still isn&#39;t a good alternative for the common user unless they have an expert to rely upon when something breaks down. ChromeOS doesn&#39;t run on most devices (it can, but the images aren&#39;t available) and I wouldn&#39;t recommend a Google-oriented OS to most people anyway, if they can avoid it; Android is bad enough already.I miss the Windows 7 days. The Win10/11 kernel may have seen loads of improvements, the UI and basic behaviour has only been regressing for many years now. The Windows 11 window snapping is nice but it doesn&#39;t excuse the aggressive spyware that comes with the OS, and neither does it excuse this antitrust lawsuit in waiting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard some people having a decent time with Edge in the past with some features implementations. Not that I would use it myself, but I&#39;m firmly convinced these childish plays only ruin whatever good work was done on it. Who on Earth would continue using a browser that has such hostile behavior and dark patterns all over the place e.g., buy-now-pay-later at browser level?It&#39;s so hard to trust Microsoft anyway, I&#39;m glad 11 is such a tranwreck dead on arrival. Makes it easier to discourage people from using it, ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Microsoft Edge runs on the same technology as Chrome, with the added trust of Microsoft.&#34;They named their user tracking, telemetry, and &#34;Buy Now, Pay Later&#34; add-ons &#34;trust&#34;?  That&#39;s really Orwellian."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a super cool blog post. However I think it alludes to a much larger problem. For many products today, it’s very difficult or impossible for most people to verify the product works.For a network switch, there are free and open source tools like iPerf to test and verify speeds are as advertised. For a faraday box, you have to go through all these steps (and knowledge learned) just to be able to test these. What about for vitamins, or pet food, or any other “durable” products that are supposed to last for X years?In an age of snake oil salesmen, paid for reviewers, and fraudulent products on Amazon, there is a real opportunity for creating systems that enable individuals to verify products do what the sellers claim they do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Snowden&#39;s recommended Faraday cage for phones or other devices of similar size: two drink-shaker cups[1].Drink shakers are cheap and widely available. The average hotel room in any medium/large hotel chain probably includes a shaker as a standard item as part of the minibar. The simple two-cup style (as seen in [1]) is preferred over the fancier &#34;strainer top&#34; style because you can press the two cups together; this should cause the inner cup to slightly cut into and/or deform the outer cup along the circle where they join together. The seal between the cups should work sort of like the  knife-edge seals used in vacuum chambers.A metal box or conductive bag is only a Faraday cage if it is fully closed/sealed. Any imperfection in the seal or hole[2] might allow the radio signal to leak out. Most improvised items (freezer, random metal box, etc) have poor seals. Making a high quality cage that actually block a modern phone can be done without much trouble, but the drink shaker method is the only method I know of that will do the job using widely available (free) or very cheap ($10-ish?) parts.[1] https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HLB1yRyhXZTxK1Rjy0Fgq6yovpXaZ/Win...[2] Holes of sufficient size. How big are the waves you are trying to block?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my former job we had a rather large faraday cage for testing telco equipment. Two things surprised me: 1) It is more fiddly to ensure a room-sized faraday cage doesn&#39;t leak RF than I thought.  It is really easy to make mistakes that compromises experiments. 2) There was a bath-towel sized piece of cloth that came with one of the expensive Rohde &amp; Schwarz instruments that was astonishingly effective at blocking signal.So I mainly used the room because that&#39;s where the magic blanket was - which was easier to use than ensuring the room was set up correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ha, yes, I&#39;ve done that at https://gigablast.com/ .
The biggest problems now are the following:
1) Too hard to spider the web. Gatekeeper companies like Cloudflare (owned in part by Google) and Cloudfront make it really difficult for upstart search engines to download web pages.
2) Hardware costs are too high. It&#39;s much more expensive now to build a large index (50B+ pages) to be competitive.I believe my algorithms are decent, but the biggest problem for Gigablast is now the index size. You do a search on Gigablast and say, well, why didn&#39;t it get this result that Google got. And that&#39;s because the index isn&#39;t big enough because I don&#39;t have the cash for the hardware. btw, I&#39;ve been working on this engine for over 20 years and have coded probably 1-2M lines of code on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The consistent theme every time this comes up is that dealing with the sheer weight of the internet is almost impossible today. SEO spam is hard to fight and the index gets too heavy. However, I wonder if this is a sign that we&#39;re looking at the problem wrong.What if instead of even trying to index the entire web, we moved one step back towards the curated directories of the early web? Give users a search engine and indexer that they control and host. Allow them to &#34;follow&#34; domains (or any partial URLs, like subreddits) that they trust.Make it so that you can configure how many hops it is allowed to take from those trusted sources, similar to LinkedIn&#39;s levels of connections. If I&#39;m hosting on my laptop, I might set it at 1 step removed, but if I&#39;ve got an S3 bucket for my index I might go as far as 3 or 4 steps removed.There are further optimizations that you could do, such as having your instance not index Wikipedia or Stack Overflow or whatever (instead using the built-in search and aggregating results).I&#39;m sure there are technical challenges I&#39;m not thinking of, and this would absolutely be a tool that would best serve power users and programmers rather than average internet users. Such an engine wouldn&#39;t ever replace Google, but I&#39;d think it would go a long way to making a better search engine for a single user&#39;s (or a certain subset of users&#39;) everyday web experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Natural Language Processing is a pox on modern search engines. I suspect that Google et. al. wanted to transform their product into an answer engine that powers voice assistants like Siri and just assumed everyone would naturally like the new way better. I can&#39;t stand how Google is always trying to guess what I want, rather than simply returning non-personalized results solely based on exactly what I typed in the textbox.While that may be good for most people, there is still a lot of power and utility in simple keyword-driven searches. Sadly, it seems like every major search engine has to follow Google&#39;s lead."</p>

There is no such limit within NSS; many structures can exceed this size. This vulnerability demonstrates that errors happen at extremes&#34;- &#34;combined [fuzzer] coverage metrics [...]. This data proved misleading, as the vulnerable code is fuzzed extensively but by fuzzers that could not possibly generate a relevant input.&#34;The conclusion is, of course, to fix those problems if your code base also has them, but also &#34;even extremely well-maintained C/C++ can have fatal, trivial mistakes&#34;."</p>

I have a rule I follow now which makes it a lot more enjoyable: if I can&#39;t make headway on a problem after trying for a day or so, I&#39;ll use the subreddit to find a hint, and then usually that&#39;s enough to help me to the answer. Very occasionally I just completely cheat (often the pure math based questions).I don&#39;t like missing out on the stars.... I mean it&#39;s the only way you get to see the awesome ascii art when you collect all 50 for the year.Many thanks to Eric and team for what must be a huge effort to run such a fun programme.Oh, the other thing I do: I don&#39;t even start until sometime in January :) far less stress and keeps the whole family much happier ;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect that AoC gets very difficult and is for an audience that isn’t me.But I love the format and what I’d enjoy is a similar project where the difficulty doesn’t really increase, but each day is a different problem domain. Breadth not depth.For example, perhaps we start with some data processing from a file. Then answer some basic statistics question about the data.  Then maybe some basic signal processing.  We form an image. We transform the image. We play the image as audio.  We break it into packets of some sort then share it on a “network.” We reassemble it. We build a state machine and pass it the reassembled data in some way. We discover some new output.Etc. etc. culminating with some fun discovery that inside that original data was a secret code or whatever.And instead of an intense challenge, we’ve just had a fun walk through an intro to two dozen subdomains of CS/sweng. You may not have immediately known the answer to each puzzle but you never felt lost."</p>

Oskar Stalberg also made a great demo of how it works[0], but it might not make sense just from that. Martin Donald made a really nice youtube video on how it works[1]. The name &#34;wave function collapse&#34; can be off putting but it&#39;s pretty straightforward, and an algorithm that can come in handy for many uses both in game development and just general software development.I&#39;m actually procrastinating on HN from working on a GPU parallelised version that can generate millions of positions every frame. In Townscaper you can actually see that the algorithm runs quite slow and lags behind the players input, there&#39;s just a bunch of animation to hide it. I&#39;m hoping to eventually get a version that can run in log2(mapsize) time.[0]http://oskarstalberg.com/game/wave/wave.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reputation is a fragile thing. I&#39;ve got no horse in this, it&#39;s not my industry and I&#39;m just a spectator. But two days ago I thought of Stripe as a top notch company, with top notch leadership. Since I&#39;m well aware that PR is a thing, that reputation also tends to be brittle, but while nobody had said anything bad about Stripe, I thought they were tops. This is not so much about Stripe as about the PR world we&#39;ve created: we know that everything we&#39;re told is polished to make it look as nice as possible, so when the facade cracks, we should adjust heavily.So now I&#39;m going to have to shift my priors, and it may well be unfair to the firm. For one, I don&#39;t know if the allegations are true. I also don&#39;t know whether this is a one-off, or whether this happens all the time and this is the tip of the iceberg. I do know that whatever I hear is going to be deeply invested one way or the other.Specifically about the rescinded offers, the only acceptable reason to do that is when the person has gotten the offer in bad faith, eg they lied about their CV or claimed to have done something they provably hadn&#39;t. Other than that, someone who&#39;s gotten an offer may well have started moving house, taking their kids out of school, gotten their spouse to quit their job, and all sorts of hard-to-reverse decisions. It&#39;s an utterly crappy thing to have happen, and any company that does it should be outed for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stripe&#39;s recruitment pipeline is well known (at least in most ruby dev circles) to be fucked. I&#39;ve experienced this first hand and even gotten lip service from exec leadership (see my HN comment history). Stripe is very good at PR, aren&#39;t they?The thing is, there are lots and lots of companies who don&#39;t have these types of problems; that don&#39;t treat candidates poorly, follow thru with the offers they make (I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m typing that!).Hiring is already a power dynamic slanted for the employer... this shit just seem excessive and like 0 fucks are given.As a job seeker, don&#39;t waste your time interviewing at companies that have these fundamental problems just getting in the door. The odds will never be in your favor, but these types of problems make for a much larger mountain to climb.Knowing these things, and how good Stripe is at PR, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if things on the inside are actually a dysfunctional mess. I hope not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some people are getting side-tracked asking if this is a common problem. I think that&#39;s a distraction: the right number of rescinded offers to engineers and other individual contributors is 0.[0]If the actual number of candidates affected is small, then it would be cheap to make it right for them. You could find a team that can take the engineer (we&#39;re not interchangeable parts, but Stripe is a big company), and/or offer monetary compensation for the opportunity cost.[0] I&#39;ll reserve judgment about higher level management. I don&#39;t know if the norms and circumstances are different. Obviously this also excludes failed background checks, candidates being dishonest, etc, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For years now I&#39;ve ran a programming site (stackabuse.com) and have closely followed the state of Google SERPs when it comes to programming content. A few thoughts/ramblings:- The search results for programming content has been very volatile the last year or so. Google has released a lot of core algorithm updates in the last year, which has caused a lot of high-quality sites to either lose traffic or stagnate.- These low-quality code snippet sites have always been around, but their traffic has exploded this year after the algorithm changes. Just look at traffic estimates for one of the worst offenders - they get an estimated 18M views each month now, which has grown almost 10x in 12 months. Compare that to SO, which has stayed flat or even dropped in the same time-frame- The new algorithm updates seem to actually hurt a lot of high-quality sites as it seemingly favors code snippets, exact-match phrases, and lots of internal linking. Great sites with well-written long-form content, like RealPython.com, don&#39;t get as much attention as they deserve, IMO. We try to publish useful content, but consistently have our traffic slashed by Google&#39;s updates, which end up favoring copy-pasted code from SO, GitHub, and even our own articles.- The programming content &#34;industry&#34; is highly fragmented (outside of SO) and difficult to monetize, which is why so many sites are covered in ads. Because of this, it&#39;s a land grab for traffic and increasing RPMs with more ads, hence these low-quality snippet sites. Admittedly, we monetize with ads but are actively trying to move away from it with paid content. It&#39;s a difficult task as it&#39;s hard to convince programmers to pay for anything, so the barrier to entry is high unless you monetize with ads.- I&#39;ll admit that this is likely a difficult problem because of how programmer&#39;s use Google. My guess is that because we often search for obscure errors/problems/code, their algorithm favors exact-match phrases to better find the solution. They might then give higher priority to pages that seem like they&#39;re dedicated to whatever you searched for (i.e. the low-quality snippet sites) over a GitHub repo that contains that snippet _and_ a bunch of other unrelated code.Just my two cents. Interested to hear your thoughts :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat tangential but I believe Google Search is going downhill, they seem to be losing the content junk spam SEO fight. Recently, I&#39;ve had to append wiki/reddit/hn to queries I search for because everything near the top is shallow copied content marketing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes he ends up with a cute toy that flings a marble but sounds like a rifle.
But in the video he explains the engineering process to start with the desired goal and then optimized and derive the parameters he needed to achieve that result. It was a good example of engineering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d like to suggest linking directly to the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdXOS-B0Bus) instead of the hackaday page, which doesn’t even pretend to add anything and is largely incoherent besides."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most striking aspect is that he was explicitly optimizing for project difficulty. I smiled when he said, in effect, &#39;let&#39;s mathematically calculate How Hard Can it Be&#39;. Sure kid...But that&#39;s what he did. Fantastic job determining the criticial criteria and engineering to it.3 weeks total project time.Kid&#39;s got a future..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be a volunteer teacher for a 3-hour weekly class in a local prison.One of the things this article misses is that gangs – which are especially active in prison systems – use books to pass ciphered messages.  Highlighting, underlining, dogeared corners, scratched out characters, etc. are used prolifically as encoded messages that would appear to be regular wear to a casual observer.  The &#34;tradecraft&#34; these guys employ is amazing (albeit for a horrible purpose).  We were allowed to have books shipped directly from publishers or known third-party entities (e.g., Amazon) and there was a request form an instructor could fill to add new approved vendors.All that to say, I understand the policy, even though it&#39;s not ideal for those honestly wanting to read.  It&#39;s hard for most people to imagine but a lot of the people in prison are some seriously bad dudes, and there are real cases of warring gangs orchestrating &#34;hits&#34; on other gang members through innocuous looking content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things that happens with used books being donated is that the paper will be used as a medium for getting contraband drugs into the prison.An example of this (letters) https://nypost.com/2021/11/05/wisconsin-inmates-to-get-photo...&gt; Wisconsin prison inmates will begin receiving photocopies of their mail next month as officials attempt to stem the flow of paper laced with drugs into correctional facilities.&gt; The Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) said paper and envelopes can be sprayed or soaked in synthetic cannabinoids such as K2 and then sent into prisons, where they are torn into strips and smoked and sold to inmates.&gt; The Fox Lake prison switched to photocopying prison mail in April after nine “potential overdoses” and two incidents of violent behavior connected to drug use. In the months since, the prison has seen numbers in both categories drop before reaching zero in August, officials said.That&#39;s for a single sheet of paper - consider the difficulty of verifying that a couple hundred pages of a novel haven&#39;t been tampered with.One of the easier ways to do this is to have the book be new and come directly from a distributor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m genuinely terrified of the American Prison system. I had a brief brush with the Law at one point in the past; but reading about what goes on in there and how it completely fucks over people is just incredible.I sincerely believe that if there’s any one thing that will end the American experiment, it will be its Prison system. Generations of poor people being brutalized and radicalized, creating an incredibly violent culture both inside and out… it’s just not sustainable to keep imprisoning millions of people.I don’t know what the solution is. I suspect we will need to invest massively in both keeping people out of prisons and creating conditions in society that make it less likely for people to fall into destitution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A very satisfied user. As a (neo)vim user, I did suffer from magit envy but at the end, Lazygit takes care of all my needs. I prefer the UX (Just a personal preference).Kudos to the dev for the wonderful toolPS: There is also lazydocker by same person

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Rant time: You&#39;ve heard it before, git is powerful, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? Are you kidding me? To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can&#39;t be split down any further but contains code you don&#39;t want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file by hand? Are you KIDDING me?! Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren&#39;t even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!&gt; If you&#39;re a mere mortal like me and you&#39;re tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it&#39;s a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.I sympathise, deeply. If you&#39;ve never found yourself counting lines - repeatedly, because your last attempt failed - while manually editing a hunk, then I envy you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there is one thing that terrifies me it&#39;s using Git, or any source control, from the command line. No matter how long I&#39;ve been in this industry, I just can&#39;t get cozy with doing a lot of heavy lifting in any shell environment. Give me the GUI all day every day."</p>
