								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great letter. Wanna bet it was completely ignored? Glad to see it here. Maybe it won&#39;t be ignored.Librarians rock. There&#39;s even a show about them[0], Starring Number One.I can&#39;t access the gMail account I set up, because I made a mistake, when setting the password, and did not save the one I used.It will not allow me to access the account I set up.After a while, I just gave up. I am satisfied that someone can&#39;t use my gMail address to impersonate me (because even I can&#39;t get it). I have plenty of other eMail accounts.[0] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3663490/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About a decade ago, a broken iPhone caused me to experience how bad Google&#39;s MFA reset process was — there were multiple _years_ where the “hard landing” form triggered a flow which sent an email to an internal mailbox which didn&#39;t exist! — and while I was able to use printed backup codes after I returned home the experience left me concerned enough that I went to one of their identity group&#39;s public meetings here in DC.One of the things which I was struck by was how unseriously they appeared to view their role in modern life. People were generally very casual about the need and were especially uninterested in anything which required them to work with outside parties.My suggestion was that they consider a protocol where trusted civic authorities could be allowed to confirm someone&#39;s identity, which sounds like it would be useful for this case: let the person initiate a mediated reset flow where someone like a librarian, police officer, etc. could authenticate in their official capacity and check a box saying that they&#39;ve confirmed the photo ID for the person standing in front of them. Most of the benefits from MFA are preventing things like phishing attacks which are also stymied by limiting it to people in your geographic area, although you might want to disable this for high-risk people enrolled in Google&#39;s Advanced Protection Program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the solution is for libraries or local authorities to setup their own email providers. An email address “for life” with your library card, with the necessary support and in-person reset verification that their patrons need. I’m not suggesting this would be an easy or inexpensive undertaking, but maybe that’s just the next step in service evolution for a public information service like a library group."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Trivial inconveniences&#34; are a big hurdle when trying to build a habit, but are a great tool for breaking bad ones. Anything you can do to break the dopamine loop helps, however small it may be. I&#39;ve had success with:- setting long passwords to social media that aren&#39;t autofilled (saved in bitwarden) and logging out after each session- nerfing addicting parts of webapps (plugins which block the facebook news feed but allow messaging/groups helped a TON)- forbidding dedicated social media apps and only using &#34;worse&#34; internet sites- router DNS blockers, even if I can get around them, the act of having to bypass it raises my awareness I&#39;m doing something subpar for myself"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aaron Swartz wrote a blog post about the news[1] and just how terrible it is for the brain. Reading his post had a major impact on me—since then I have always thought differently about the time I spend online.It’s interesting how people, including myself, try to justify various addictions. How am I supposed to stay informed about important topics without the news? How do I know how to help people in need without knowing what’s going on? There are much, much better ways than reading CNN/NYTimes every day. Also, there really is nothing new about the human condition today compared to a hundred years ago.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well this is... eerie. I just released Stictionary[1] on Friday.It is an offline, ad free, dictionary that remembers words you look up. It gives a word of the day and provides (admittedly underfeatured atm) flashcards to review your word lists. It includes optional syncing to keep your word lists across devices. I&#39;ve been holding off posting about it while i complete the website[2].Love to see someone else had such a similar idea. Great confirmation of the unmet need in the space. Really awesome execution as well. Congrats on the launch!On a personal note, i built Stictionary after tracking all the words i looked up manually for years. Now i have an app that does it for me (and was a blast to build).1: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stictionary/id1613214660?platf...2: https://www.stictionary.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, iOS already has built-in support for dictionary and thesaurus. In any native text input field, select a word and choose Define or Look Up. The choice of dictionary is customizable; I usually choose New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English (not to be confused with the venerable Oxford English Dictionary). They are high quality dictionaries. They are basically the same except that the pronunciation for the latter is in IPA which I&#39;m more used to.When I need to look up a word, I create a new note from control center, type in the word, double tap to bring up the contextual menu and then the dictionary.It pretty much checks all the boxes. For distraction-free reading, turn off &#34;Content from Apple&#34; in the Siri settings to avoid those obnoxious Siri knowledge panels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey Hacker News!I&#39;m thrilled to read all the comments with ideas and improvements. I will try to answer and keep up with the thread.Kudos to all the similar initiatives trying to solve the problems I outline in the article. It&#39;s wonderful to see a zeitgeist about dictionaries.Who wants to jump the article and try the version I built, feel free to download the iPhone [1] or Android [2] version or run it by itself with the open source repo [3]1: https://apps.apple.com/app/wordnote-dictionary/id15965376332: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zehfernand...3: https://github.com/zehfernandes/wordnoteCheers!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After a discussion with a lawyer friend (not australia, canada, so tangentially related), the &#34;presumption of innocence&#34; that would not obligate this person to have or produce a key for whatever gibberish someone sends to their devices, is what&#39;s known in legal circles as a &#34;principle of fundamental justice,&#34; and it is not a right that is either absolute or inaliable the way that american rights are set up.One doesn&#39;t need to agree with the persons cause to recognize this is another extreme overstepping of authority on the part of that government to mandate that the people who communicate with the person subject to this order may also not protect their own commuications from interception, and that the person subject to the order must somehow produce a key for whatever data gets sent to him.Given the cynical application of laws and their moderating charter exceptions in places like Australia and Canada over the last few years, I could forsee a new republican movement emerging in commonwealth countries, as it&#39;s pretty clear CAN/AUS/NZ have dispensed with notions of fundamental justice, and have a &#34;so sue me,&#34; approach to legislation and governance, as this stuff is just too stupid to be reasoned with. The language means nothing, the principles mean nothing. It&#39;s no longer about tech, it&#39;s about what our options are when the state has demonstrated official contempt for the people it ostensibly serves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note these are bail conditions (so presumably an alternative to a much more constrained existence in prison) for a charge that indicates potential for inflicting severe economic damage after organization via communication devices.When compared to bail conditions for other charged crimes which may also be strict and context-related (eg. trackers or keeping distance from a victim of violence) it sounds tough (and right to be strictly monitored under rights laws) but not necessarily unreasonable.Is it wrong/excessive/draconian? Possibly. But I don&#39;t think a knee-jerk assumption that it is any of those things is appropriate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not unexpected from the state that banned encryption, gives the police the right to modifiy, add and remove files from your devices.And can also force its citizens to implement backdoors and basically be spies even in foreign countries and companies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a (thankfully mild) inherited retina disorder. If you read the part about lasers and eye damage it’s basically that, but the “lasers” are faulty genes rather than anything external causing the eye damage. And I can verify that at first my brain did an incredibly good job at error-correcting over it, but in the last couple years it’s finally been able to “peek through”. One day I was hiking and suddenly had black spots in my vision. Then after that I woke up one morning and noticed large black halos in my vision that went away after a couple seconds of being awake. A couple weeks later and I started getting flashing visual artifacts in the edge of my vision.Which is/was terrifying because I didn’t know this was a multi-decade process I was just becoming aware of and instead assumed that if I just noticed this much visual degradation in a couple weeks then surely I’ll be completely blind in a couple more?  Thankfully that’s not how it works, the damage has been increasing at a slow steady constant, it’s just that the processes in place to correct for said damage do a _really_ good job at hiding it, until they don’t, so the rate of degradation seems much worse than it actually is.That said, please if you notice any new visual artifacts get them checked up on _immediately_, while my case is a slow genetic issue sometimes it’s a detached retina, which can happen for any number of reasons and can usually be reversed quite easily with surgery if caught early.  I was “lucky” mine was genetic rather than physical trauma, since I didn’t go see someone until things got noticeably worse."</p>

We&#39;re all-in on functional programming, and we&#39;re looking for more help.You must have demonstrable experience building things in idiomatic Haskell, and you should have a solid understanding of how web applications typically work. You should be able to communicate clearly in English, but you do not need to speak excellent English (our team speaks Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Dutch, German, Italian, French, and more). You&#39;ll have flexible working hours and you can work from anywhere, though this is a full-time position and the expectation is that of work based on a traditional 40 hour week, with 25 days of paid annual holiday in addition to your country&#39;s national holidays.We favour asynchronous communication, and try to hire &#34;managers of one&#34;. We don&#39;t do daily stand-ups. We don&#39;t count your hours. We don&#39;t work weekends. We support each other in working and learning, and we have a dedicated fortnightly &#34;Research Day&#34; where every programmer is free to not do chores for the product, and instead investigate/learn/play with whatever technology they choose. Want to learn more about type-level programming? Property-based testing? Expert systems?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The image near the top of the readme implies that compressing the whole file means not having random access, which is indeed true, but it also implies that there&#39;s nothing between whole file compression and row/column level compression, and that is not true.  You could compress pages, kinda like ZFS compresses blocks, and still maintain random access, and get pretty close to whole-file compression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh, interesting. I scrape GitHub&#39;s APIs to generate user and repositories statistics data, then compress it with ZStandard to allow the databases to fit within GitHub&#39;s file size restrictions.[1] So, this is very relevant to me.It&#39;s pleasantly surprising how much data you can fit within a ZStandard-compressed SQLite database. The two technologies fit very well together.[1]: https://github.com/andrewmcwattersandco/github-statistics"</p>

How much other hardware can claim that?The Asahi developers have also stated that Apple tends to keep hardware peripheral interfaces stable across generations (they speculate that this is to keep things easy for their own OS dev teams), and that this has so far proven to be true for M2 (and several iPhone generations before that), and thus once support is available , it should stay relevant for some time.Given this, it seems like MacBooks could easily end up becoming the laptop of choice for Linux developers in the years to come."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Call me crazy but I think long term (10 years +) the Intel strategy of fabricating chips domestically is the correct choice. There&#39;s a ton of geopolitical pressure in this direction. The US simply doesn&#39;t want to be dependent on Taiwan for chips, for obvious reasons.Intel knows this and is trying to become the TSMC of the west. And frankly they&#39;re the only ones that can pull it off. I&#39;d be surprised if 10 years from now the majority of their revenue comes from selling processors rather than fabricating them for AMD, NVIDIA, etc. Why compete when there&#39;s plenty of steak for everyone?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had invested in AMD when Lisa Su took over as CEO. I had been keeping tabs on the company for some time. Unfortunately I needed money to cover my basic living expenses and had to sell all my shares about a year later. Even at the time, it was painful because I had spent a lot of time researching AMD and I was very optimistic about Lisa Su based on her background and her tenacity.I could have made maybe 20x on my investment... Still, I don&#39;t feel regret. You can only regret things if you had a choice and I know that there&#39;s no way I could have avoided selling those shares."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I&#39;m very much in camp AMD.  But, market cap has proven over and over again to be kind of bogus. E.g. do we really think Tesla is actually worth more than the rest of the top 10 or so automakers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, Bing had a bunch of tools for developers: base64/HTML/URL codec, ASCII table, QR code generator, color picker, formatters, even the ability to run code in the browser on the servers of an online judge (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11450385)One day they all just disappeared. I actually wasn&#39;t the only one who noticed (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-bing/what-h...)I think I know why: the Bing blog implies that most of it was the passion project of a couple of summer interns in 2015. Probably it simply broke at some point, and no one was around to even notice.https://blogs.bing.com/search/2015/09/02/bing-rocks-two-new-...https://blogs.bing.com/search/2015/10/08/bing-adds-more-tool...Here&#39;s a larger list of Bing&#39;s search features in various domains from 2018.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is almost certainly an accident. I remember when the Search SRE team got paged because some simple math formula wasn&#39;t giving am answer box. Something like 42+7 giving 49. Turns out that this was getting classified as &#34;porn seeking&#34; and giving an empty results page if Safe Search was on. This probably would have never been noticed if there wasn&#39;t a end-to-end prober test because this particular formula was an example in the Google Home instruction pamphlet.Search is very a complex system and quite possibly there is a poor SRE looking into this right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great job!I can sort of relate. I worked on an infrastructure system, almost entirely alone, for ten years, before it was finally taken over by a capable team, and I was able to step away, and it took on a life of its own. It is now a worldwide standard, used daily, by thousands.I say “sort of,” because it was never something I planned to make money on. It filled a need. Also, and it’s a long story, I had to weather a fairly hefty level of abuse during that time. The demographics of the target user base were … challenging.It’s all good, now.One thing all that time brought me, was a really high-Quality product. Lots of time to squash bugs, and iterate the UX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice project. I can relate in that I have my own personal hobby project that I have been working on for years and I would like to get many more users trying it out.Mine is a new kind of data management system that can manage unstructured, structured, and semi-structured data. Think of it as a file system, database, and NoSql system all rolled into one. It is currently in open beta at https://didgets.com/You say you have &#39;finished it&#39;. Software is never finished, but if you have checked off all the feature items from your design, then close enough for now. With my project, the TODO list is still extremely long. It can do many things already, but I seem to put two more items on the list every time I cross one off.It seems that every solo, multi-year project goes through the phases you describe (burn out, depression, questioning your sanity, etc.) and mine is no exception. It still feels very self-fulfilling every time I get a major piece working or I blow away the alternative in a speed test."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OP, I&#39;ve been working on a very similar thing for some years now, too.  I could write a book about this at this point, but I will avoid gushing here.Please let me share some pain.Many developers/companies make this thing and none of them really know how to (or can) share.  I&#39;m happy to share my list.The end result, as I see it, is a fragmented mess of either partially completed or fully completed and walled (and/or poorly modularized) software.Take for example VS Code&#39;s tree view.  Can a developer with a need for an explorer view just use VS Code&#39;s tree module?  Not hardly.  Go reinvent.Contrast that with CodeMirror.  If you look, you will see CodeMirror everywhere.  This software truly  empowers devs and it has resulted in pure awesomeness.There&#39;s no shame in not open sourcing what you&#39;ve created, I&#39;m assuming you haven&#39;t.  And I can&#39;t say anything about how you have modularized your components.But it pains me that the next dev who gets an idea like yours will either give up or spend 6 years struggling to create the same thing (except the CodeMirror part).Worse, Microsoft can afford to struggle and or throw people/money at this.  They can pay people to work full time.  They can give away their editor(and more) for free.  That&#39;s a win from user&#39;s POV.Are you aware that VS Code runs on GitHub and does the majority of this kind of thing?  I think they could completely shut down all sandboxes or similar kinds of software from a financial perspective.I said I wouldn&#39;t write a book.Anyways, I strongly appreciate what you have done.  It looks great.I wish we lived in a world where we could work on the same team building this kind of thing.My best wishes to you on getting paid to do it full time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been thinking it&#39;s time to start moving away from that damn site.- If I actually want to start conversations, I get a lot more comments on HN or Reddit- When I was a job searcher, the idea of just being able to apply from my profile was really cool. Except every job just re-directed you to some form that wanted you to upload a resume anyway.- Of the handful of potential clients who have found me there, none have ended up signing a contract. Better odds just talking on random slack channels.- It&#39;s getting more and more cringe. Call me a prude but it&#39;s really tacky when people post photos of stuff like their wife and their baby asleep on the couch. Do you really want to post your families intimate moments to get likes on a &#34;professional&#34; social network?- If I&#39;m honest with myself I realise that I just replaced my addiction to one blue site (FB) with another.Anyway add me on LinkedIn!! https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewisandrewcampbell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit of tangent, but it reminds me of a funny story:I discovered one day that I am getting recommended &#34;Long distance truck driver&#34; jobs through email and some of the re-targeted ads. First, I ignored them, but in a week or two, it became apparent that it was not just a coincidence.  After some research, I realized that I had listed &#34;Device Driver&#34; programming as a skill on my LinkedIn and personal website. I suspect it must have been crawled, and the word &#34;Driver&#34; was matched to send me those recommendations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It appears that LinkedIn is automatically importing job postings from other places on LinkedIn and other sites such as angel.co if the company name of the job posting matches your company name on LinkedIn.The irony when LinkedIn get so upset about people scraping their website."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have a car and absolutely hate the car-centric culture of American cities (I live in SF).That being said, this article is completely wrong and draws the wrong conclusions. People were anti-car early on because most people didn&#39;t have cars. Later, people stopped being anti-car because most people had cars. The article would have you believe that at no point in time did the majority of people want car-centric city streets and that it was forced on them by a small minority of people interested in selling cars. That simply isn&#39;t the case. Vocal opposition to cars faded away as more people owned them.It&#39;s important to understand the status quo correctly if we ever want to change things. The sad reality is that most people want cars, even in dense cities. As I look out my apartment window on a Sunday morning, with pleasant weather and a walkable green neighborhood, I still count far more cars going by than people on foot or bicycle. Hopefully that would change if we made it easier and safer for people to walk, but it&#39;s not productive to pretend most people secretly hate cars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch, so US towns and cities didn&#39;t always be hostile towards walking.  My assumption that it&#39;s always been this way, was wrong.But in a way that&#39;s worse because it means they used to have this privilege and it has been taken away, and cars-first has become the norm.But the roads would have been used for something, at a guess, was it trams and horse carriages, and that these didn&#39;t pose much of a problem?  I&#39;ve been to towns with trams in the middle of roads and it&#39;s normal for people to just walk around it or near the tracks without problem.  But I am a stupid tourist so I kept my distance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember in Sixth Grade (in Maryland), our teacher telling us that there was still a law on the state books, that said (I can’t remember what he said, precisely, but this is the gist):If a car is going in one direction on a road, and there is a horse (I don’t think he specified whether or not it was harnessed, but I’ll bet it needed to be in harness) coming the opposite direction, the car needed to pull over, and yield to the horse.If the horse refused to pass the car, then it was incumbent upon the car owner to (in escalating order):1) Turn off the engine.2) Cover the car in a blanket.3) Dismantle the car, piece by piece, until the horse passes.I could see a cranky old farmer having fun with that law."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article perfectly exemplifies the arguments in discussions. Lets just concentrate on the waste discussion. The article says heavy metals in solar panels are a problem (I kind of agree, although the way it is described makes it out like we are talking about huge amounts, in reality the lead in solar panels is largely from soldering so very small amounts. Orders of magnitude more are being used for other applications (like car batteries)). They then say that recycling is currently still a problem (sort of true, although there are companies who say they can 100% recycling solar panels already). Similarly for wind they say we still don&#39;t know how to recycle the carbon blades, again sort of correct (but there are many other applications of carbon fibre which produce much more waste).Then when it comes to nuclear waste however, the argument is we can ignore pretty much all long lasting waste, because of some development in the future will make recycling of spend fuel rods feasible. So essentially he is comparing the current state of solar panel recycling to some future potential nuclear waste recycling. That&#39;s a dishonest comparison. Moreover ignoring the amount of waste from dismantling the nuclear power plant (which needs to go into nuclear storage because it is radioactive due to irradiation), while talking about the carbon fibre from wind turbines is also disingenuous.We see the same argumentive structure when talking about the economics; the current state of renewables is compared to some potential future state of nuclear. While in reality renewables are on an exponential cost reduction trajectory and all the nuclear potential is completely unproven."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is this idea that nuclear is not being deployed because people have a wrong perception of risks.However, the main reason is the economy. The costs of solar, wind and batteries are dropping exponentially but the costs of nuclear are not improving. We can blame regulation and the hypothetically wrong public perception about safety, but the reality is that costs cannot go down easily because of the innovation dynamics:1. It takes several years to build a nuclear reactor. Hence, innovations take a decade to reach the market. Learning curve has to be slow.2. A nuclear reactor cannot be shipped, it has to be build on site. This makes manufacturing automation, economies of scale and competition hard. In other words: you cannot have factories in China, or elsewhere, shipping cheap nuclear reactors all over the planet.A change in regulation might lower the costs, but it&#39;s not going to improve much the innovation dynamics.In conclusion, all this talking is mostly irrelevant: nuclear reactors are simply not going to be built because they are not competitive. And things are getting worse by the day because the alternatives have a better innovation cycle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We saw another downside of nuclear power in Ukraine: When Russian troops attacked towards Enerhodar and there was shelling in the area the safety of the  reactor could not be guaranteed. In the end, containment can be guaranteed w.r.t to internal accidents but no facility can ever be safe from outside issues like war, natural disaster or politics.Solar has less single points of failure and if it fails not much happens, like in the case of the stolen solar power plant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokmak_Solar_Energy)."</p>

Roskomnadzor&#39;s capabilities for blocking TOR are quite sufficient to cripple TOR&#39;s capabilities to the point of making it unusable as a VPN service, unless you set up your own private TOR ramp, which in this case is essentially the same as personal VPN, but much more slow.The algorithm is quite simple:1. Attempt to connect to TOR2. If it connects, blacklist the IP, goto 1.3. TOR is unavailable(If an anonymous TOR user can obtain bridge address, shared by any means, email, Signal, messenger pigeons or whatever, RKN operative can obtain it as well)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been really fascinating to watch. A patch just landed in Pion DTLS[0] yesterday to make the fingerprinting harder. I don&#39;t remember all the commits, but the Tor devs are absolutely amazing to work with and submit patches that are pretty much perfect :)If you haven&#39;t had a chance to investigate WebRTC I really think it is worth it. WebRTC gives up P2P Data/Media everywhere and it is really hard to block (because so many companies depend on it). To me it really feels like the best path forward to circumventing control. It also is a great career move. You can help people build conferencing tools during the day, and Censorship Circumvention at night.[0] https://github.com/pion/dtls/commit/de299f573c3e44fece16f09c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can help by running a Snowflake proxy (which merely functions as a gateway to the Tor Network, so you don&#39;t need to worry as no traffic exits from your IP) if you&#39;re in a country that doesn&#39;t censor Tor. You can either run the standalone Snowflake proxy:https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/snowflake/stand...Or by installing the browser addon: https://snowflake.torproject.org"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember during my undergraduate physics years at the University of Otago, we had a visiting guest speaker - I think it was Dale Bridenbaugh around 1976 when he had resigned as a manager in GE&#39;s nuclear division worried that their plants were not safe [0].  He had just also toured Australia as a guest speaker toward the anti-uranium effort [1].At the time, Robert Muldoon was Prime Minister of New Zealand and was pursuing &#34;think big&#34; projects for NZ including a planned nuclear power station.  As one of the &#34;GE Three&#34; [2], Bridenbaugh blew the whistle that the quoted price tag of the
power plant did not include necessary safety precautions which he eloquently explained would cost at least an order of magnitude more (greater than the GDP of NZ).  Of course the whole idea made no sense in a country blessed with hydro and geothermal resources.  In the end the project was abandoned for total cost of ownership budget reasons rather than nuclear issues.I wonder what has changed since then?[0] https://www.times.org/nuclear-power-back/2018/3/8/the-long-t...[1] https://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82alternatives.html[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Three"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The SMR’s 12 modules, each producing 50 megawatts&#34;So each module is a little smaller than the reactor of the 1960&#39;s era submarine I served on and is based on the same pressurized water technology. I was a &#34;nuke&#34; so had to go in the reactor compartment several times. As far as I can remember, the reactor was about 10 feet in diameter. We went in the shipyard for refueling after the lifetime of the rods, which was 15 years. I could never understand why we didn&#39;t build these for civilian use (cost I figured) but now we will. Cool.https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2022/22-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is an overall good development, and I wish the company luck. Its really not the solution.While scale is what killed nuclear, the people who initially decided on scale, did so for good reason. You lose a huge amount if you scale down, specially with PWRs.These small PWRs try to get some of that efficiency back with factory production, but at best it just evens out. The advantage is the added flexibility. So I don&#39;t think that putting traditional PWR in a tube is really any kind of series solution to transform our energy system.However there are good things coming out of this. For example, NuScale went threw a process managing multiple reactors from the same control room. That is the same thing that essentially all GenIV reactors want to do as well. Having managed to get that concept threw the regulator will make it massively easier for anybody that follows.Its a damn shame that we don&#39;t have GenIV reactors since the 80s. We had the technology and every reason to use it. We could be living in a nuclear age right now, and I consider it the largest failure of humanity that we failed to do so. People in 100 years will look back and think we were insane that we did not use the technology we discovered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Its important to be reminded regularly that there are perfectly legal ways for people with lots of money to endlessly bully people that annoy them. These people/companies have lawyers on retainer that they&#39;re already paying so its essentially free for them to file bogus suits and motions to cause havoc in your life. What are you going to do? Sue them back? Thats the world they live in, and its a world that as a small time person or corporation you can not win in (long term).Look at Gawker and Peter Thiel--no matter how you feel personally about what they did, what they published about him was absolutely legal. As a background task his lawyers destroyed that company by keeping them tied up in court cases and funding any one with an axe to grind against them until they were gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I opened up the article mildly curious about which internet personality was about to make the outlandish claim to the biggest victim crown for internet clicks.I&#39;m heartbroken it was Steven Danziger, they guy that took on big oil, gave them a black eye, and went to (house) jail for it.Even though his case is one I&#39;ve followed for years, it even escaped my own memory.Also, someone mentioned Snowden and Arrange.  for comparison. Although they can be thought as same, remember these two, unlike Danziger, took on the govt, the intelligence apparatus, and its guns.  They should have known full well that when you play high stakes poker you are risking a ton.Danziger OTOH, was taking on a private corporation. His case is big, but no too different in scope than say Erin Brokovich&#39;s case against PG&amp;E &amp; Hinkley(2), or Jan Schlittchmanns case vs WR Grace and Beatrice Foods(1). The plaintiff counsels won in both cases, without consequences to their life or careers.Arrange and Snowden were morally righteous however they probably knew the size of the sacrifice they were about to make and made the decision to proceed anyway. I doubt Danziger had any idea that what he was getting into would cost him his career.(1)   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Cryovac,_Inc.(2) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_groundwater_contamin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth noting that there is another side to the story. As Wikipedia notes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Donziger), significant evidence of Donziger&#39;s fraud ended up being captured by a friendly documentary crew that had been following him around.The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague found that the evidence placed before the Court was &#34;the most thorough documentary, video, and testimonial proof of fraud ever put before an arbitral tribunal&#34;, and that [Donziger] did engage in blackmail and bribery of Ecuadorian judges.The situation is complex, and I certainly don&#39;t have any insight into the true rights and wrongs of the case. And there&#39;s certainly evidence that points towards Donziger&#39;s innocence too. But Esquire&#39;s take is, I think, entirely unbalanced, and discounts out of hand the idea that any of the many, many court cases Donziger has lost (in multiple legal systems and in front of multiple judges) may have been at all correct."</p>

The loss of power is affecting part of a single data center within the affected Availability Zone. Power has been restored to the affected facility and at this stage the majority of the affected EC2 instances have recovered. We expect to recover the vast majority of EC2 instances within the next hour.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The dog has a lot of false positives from the cameras being triggered by car headlights or small animals.My real dog has the same feature, so you’re at least doing a good job mimicking nature, heh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I bought a house I picked up a dog dish and put it by my walkout basement sliding door.  Also the pond next to my house has old tennis balls show up in it now and then so I put them next to the dish.According to the local cops break ins in my area are mostly just kids going into open garage / garage side doors / back doors that are left open and stuff to steal is out and obvious and so on.I figure just the sense of hassle / unknown of &#34;who knows how this dog is&#34; might be enough of a deterrent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add credence to this post, I once heard an interview with an incarcerated burglar who claimed that dogs where the one deterrent that scared him off. He said that an alarm as only as good as the response times of the police and he&#39;s usually in and out of there in five minutes anyway. But who wants to risk it with a dog? Better to just move on to the next house.A few more tips:- Best place to hide valuables is in the kitchen pantry. Master bedroom is the most common place, but who is gonna think to go through your snack food.- A lot of burglaries happen in the winter in the late afternoon or early evening when it is starting to get dark out, but before the homeowners get home from work.- Your house is only as strong as the weakest link. Fancy locks can be bypassed by breaking a window. Design your security system to handle low level burglars (who probably don&#39;t know how to pick a lock), not foreign spies. For most people, this also holds true for online security."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Camera software is an area that is frustratingly closed off, and where manufacturers regularly differentiate new/more expensive cameras with firmware differences: subject detection, auto focus, drive modes (pre-capture, higher frame rates, etc), file format support (HEIC, compressed raw, colorspaces), ui features (how custom modes work, menu systems, etc).Competition in this space driven by a provider that doesn&#39;t have a motive to convince users to buy the next new camera (ie: open source software) would be very useful to users.Sony and Panasonic cameras (and perhaps other manufacturers) are running Linux (and release some of the third party source code they include in their products, but the amount of reverse engineering that has been done on those camera&#39;s software.Canon uses a custom RTOS (DryOS), and lots of work has been done to extend the existing Canon firmware to enhance its capabilities (Magic Lantern[1] and CHDK[2]), but as far as I know fully open software for these devices doesn&#39;t exist.Camera capabilities these days are highly software dependent, and the functionality of dedicated cameras is held back by subpar software development practices and a lack of pressure to make things better.1: https://magiclantern.fm/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem isn&#39;t the capability of remote attestation.  The problem is who&#39;s using it, i.e. who&#39;s defining what &#34;security&#34; means.  As noted above, for a company, &#34;security&#34; often means intentionally inhibiting my freedom, not actually securing anything I care about.We would benefit from a better public discussion of what &#34;security&#34; encompasses.  Else, we risk conflating &#34;what MS wants me to do with my computer&#34; with &#34;preventing hackers from stealing my credit card number&#34;.Imagine a world where you could submit personal information to a company, with the technological assurance that this information would not leave that company... and you could verify this with remote attestation of the software running on that company&#39;s servers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any way we can make Remote Attestation providers liable for any losses incurred while using their services? Can we make it so that banks, record companies, and individuals can sue Microsoft or Google if their system doesn&#39;t deliver on the promise? If we still see cheating in on-line gaming even though all machines are attested, can we we get our money back?I feel like part of the problem is that Remote Attestation providers get to have their cake and eat it too: they make a theme park, set up boundaries, and charge admission under the premise that it&#39;s safer to play in their walled garden than in a public park.But if a bad actor slips through their gate and picks a few pockets or kidnaps a couple children, the operators get to say &#34;not our problem, our services have no warranty -- read the EULA&#34;.I feel like in the real world, if a park operator explicitly bills itself as &#34;a safe place to play&#34; it&#39;s their problem if someone goes on a crime spree on their property -- there is some duty to deliver on the advertised safety promise.But somehow, in the software world people can control admission, control what you do and somehow have no liability if things still go off the rails. It&#39;s just a sucker&#39;s game.Of course, I&#39;d rather not see remote attestation happen, but maybe part of the reason it keeps creeping back is exactly because there is zero legal downside to making security promises that can&#39;t be kept, but incredible market advantages if they can sucker enough people to believe in the scheme."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion:Hardware-based attestation of the running software is an important security feature, especially in a world where data leaks and identity theft are rampant. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a healthcare provider, and I&#39;m about to send sensitive medical data to a third party vendor. Wouldn&#39;t you prefer that this data only be able to be decrypted by a computer that can prove to the world it booted a clean OS image with all the latest security patches installed?If the vendor wants to install some self-built OS that they trust on their computer and not update it for 5 years, that&#39;s their business, but I may not want to trust their computer to have access to my personal data.Remote attestation gives more control to the owners of data to dictate how that data is processed on third-party machines (or even their own machines that may have been compromised). This is useful for more than just DRM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made this site.Copying a comment I made on HN a few weeks ago:The ADS-B signals that many aircraft broadcast include not just the aircraft&#39;s GPS positions, but also a measure of GPS accuracy (strictly speaking, ADS-B doesn&#39;t talk about GPS specifically and can handle any sort of navigation technology; I&#39;m sure there are some planes out there reporting positions based on inertial navigation systems, with correspondingly low accuracy, or GLONASS-derived positions, or whatever, but my understanding is that right now something on the order of 99% of aircraft with ADS-B are using good old GPS so I&#39;ll just keep using the term GPS in this description). If you go to https://globe.adsbexchange.com and click on just about any aircraft, you&#39;ll see an info sidebar on the left of the screen. Scroll down until you see the ACCURACY section, and you&#39;ll see values labeled NACp, SIL, NACv, NICbaro, and Rc. Those are all self-reported measures of the accuracy of the data being sent by the aircraft[1]. NACp is &#34;Navigation Accuracy Category for position&#34;, and is a good measure of whether the aircraft&#39;s GPS is working well. (A somewhat obscure feature of ADS-B Exchange lets you see a map of all aircraft that are currently reporting poor navigation accuracy for their GPS: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?badgps)To make the maps, I process a day&#39;s worth of data from ADS-B Exchange to find all the aircraft reporting poor navigation accuracy and then I color map hexes (using H3 hexes) according to the proportion of aircraft passing through that hex that reported bad GPS accuracy. Specifically, I&#39;m counting an aircraft as experiencing &#34;interference&#34; if it at some point reported good navigation accuracy and then reported low accuracy. Doing this helps filter out aircraft that just have an ongoing issue with their GPS equipment, or don&#39;t even have GPS.When I do that, areas where there is systematic interference—almost always jamming by military systems—become obvious. There are a few conflict zones (Syria, Cyprus, Israel) that have been experiencing jamming for years, and the U.S. often has smaller scale military testing, especially in the West and Southwest. You can also see the jammers that are apparently setup around Moscow to prevent drones from flying near Oligarch dachas[2].I started making these maps in February before Russia invaded Ukraine because I thought it might provide an early warning of an invasion. I didn&#39;t see that, and in fact this technique doesn&#39;t do a very good job of mapping GPS jamming around the actual war zones because civil aviation stopped over Ukraine, so there are zero or few aircraft with ADS-B reporting their GPS accuracy[3]. Without that data, I can&#39;t make a map.Sometimes I do see changes, like when Russia suddenly started jamming around Kaliningrad in March 2022, causing interference in many Baltic states and leading to Finland to cancel some flights[4]. Then a few days later, they just stopped.I don&#39;t think too many people have realized yet what an amazing source of GPS interference data is available using ADS-B! It&#39;s like having thousands of sensors roaming the planet, broadcasting GPS accuracy data every few seconds. I sometimes wonder if I would disrupt someone&#39;s nascent business model if I started publishing my maps regularly.1. https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1493789598077440000

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick update on some of the infrastructure behind the map: One day of being on the front page of HN has used up half of the Mapbox free quota of map loads. To sustain this level of traffic would cost me something like $2000/month just for Mapbox. Since this is a non-profit project that I do in my spare time, something is going to have to give."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating. Really cool to see a map of GPS signals on Earth and the site looks really good, too. Love the colors and interface! Awesome :)Can anyone narrate any of the jammed signals? Like for instance what would be jamming in the ocean between Tripoli and Benghazi? Or what would be jamming around San Antonio, TX?"</p>

These dimensions are:1. the number of Wikipedia editions of each individual; [i.e. number of languages in which this person has a Wikipedia article]2. the length, i.e total number of words found in all available biographies. […]3. the average number of biography views (hits) for each individual between 2015 and 2018 in all available language editions […]4. the number of non-missing items retrieved from Wikipedia or Wikidata for birth date, gender and domain of influence. The intuition here is that the more notable the individual, the more documented his/her biographies will be; [!]5. the total number of external links (sources, references, etc.) from Wikidata.We then determine the quantile values from each dimension and add them all to define our notability measureThey also have a table of what this metric throws up as the most &#34;notable&#34; from each time period: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4/tables/3 and how the &#34;domain&#34; varies over time: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4/figures/2 (note Nobility and Religious in 500–1000, to Sports and Culture post 1950)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Tabler and have used it for a few projects with great success.The title of the OP is not really accurate though. It&#39;s not so much a framework but a bunch of customization on top of Bootstrap and some pre-built templates for stuff _like_ dashboards, galleries, forms, etc. The site is more like a kitchen sink demo and documentation site for stuff you can pick apart and use in your own application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Tabler. I&#39;ve used it for a few Rails projects and since Rails 7 it&#39;s even easier to integrate thanks to Import Maps. I can get a project off the ground even faster with this UI kit. I&#39;m already used to the Bootstrap classes and tags so this is just the final component for maximum productivity.I get some people don&#39;t dig the design but I think it look serious, and in general that&#39;s what dashboard are for, serious business. They need to be readable and simple to understand and use. Tabler gives that vibe.Edit: As an afterthought, I would really appreciate if anyone knows any similar projects. It&#39;d nice to compare and have more options. So far I havent found anything so compelling in this space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"it looks like tabler uses jekyll underneath for docs and demo (which i personally like and am comfortable with). the demo is really nice, ahd while i&#39;m not big on js any more, the js driving tabler looks fairly straightforward and appropriate to my eyes.the underlying html and css, however, give me pause about how easy it would be to integrate into a larger project. &lt;div&gt; soup is how i&#39;d describe the demo html, and its css uses custom properties (css variables) in a way that, on first glance, seems to make it more verbose without adding power, flexibility, or maintainability (or accessibility, but that seems a really big challenge for data-heavy frontends like this).i&#39;d probably try this out if i needed a dashboard on a project, but perhaps would want to test drive it on a small/test project to see where the gotchas are first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You would really hope there would be some far reaching repercussions for senior leadership at Google on this one. There are lots of projects that Google has tried and failed on, and sure, that happens. But this one is probably the clearest, obvious failure of execution. There is an absolutely crystal clear playbook of a Tech company forcing its way into the Gaming business. So how Google has managed to enter, completely fuck up, screw around partners, screw around customers and then leave all within the span of 3 years is just fantastic.And it&#39;s not just that, because Google&#39;s reputation for giving up on anything remotely difficult, no one bought into it in the first place. I would wager there are entire market segments that Google can just never enter now since they have done such a good job at branding themselves unreliable. It reminds me of a Petrostate where a country has huge wealth because of what they&#39;re sitting on, but that same wealth destroys their ability to develop anything meaningfully different."</p>

Stadia removes all fraction and means I don&#39;t need to install/update or have gaming hardware.The service is great. Despite it not being popular. It would be an absolute disaster for me if the service were to close."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really appreciate when people use technical facts to criticize something, like with this. It is a well written take-down of the implementation of the Windows Registry as of both today and 2010.I suspect if the concept of the registry was created today it would look more like a database (e.g. Sqlite), although organizing it like a virtual FileSystem does have a certain appeal, and unfortunately I don&#39;t know of a database engine that supports such a layout. The Registry&#39;s Key-Value pairs are 1:1 with a database table&#39;s column-values pairs, it is just the multiple tiers of organizing &#34;folders&#34; above that that are a difficult implementation detail.The UNIX way is undeniably more flexible since it isn&#39;t a virtual filesystem, it is just a filesystem. The problem is that everyone invented their own configuration format to store configuration data in /etc and there&#39;s no format agnostic API to access that information (you can open it, but can you understand it?).Both UNIX and Windows suffer from the same orphan issue wherein information can be written, the application removed, and it is unsafe to ever remove it since you may not know the author and or all consumers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t feel like this article is good enough to be worth resharing 12 years later.It missed some of the key reasons why the Registry is bad and other criticisms (&#34;We have to write exactly the bytes Windows expects.&#34; yeah of course you do. It&#39;s only meant to be changed using APIs.) are not very well thought out.The criticism that the Registry is a janky filesystem in a single file is dismissed because you can do the same thing with ext3. That&#39;s not a good reason to dismiss it. Just because you can do a similar thing doesn&#39;t mean it is a good thing to do for the Registry. The Registry being a single file is a cause of a ton of problems, and is IMHO the root of all the other problems. If this were a better technical article it would go into that instead of hand waving it away. (E.g. it being a single file leads to the all or nothing nature of it. It necessitates the bad filesystem implementation instead of using the actual underlying filesystem, etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A point being overlooked by article and commenters: the records in the registry probably use in the order of 10-100 bytes each, while every actual file takes up at least around 1024 (EDIT: maybe more like 4096?) bytes. Putting tiny &#39;files&#39; into a special format is a no-brainer on the older computers that existed when the Registry was first created. I am assuming this was one of the motivations to create the Registry in the first place, to save space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just took a look at the quickstart guide. The way the code snippets are implemented is gorgeous. They are syntax highlighted, are formatted/indented exactly as they would be in the terminal, line breaks are indented correctly but css is used to make them easily copy/pastable without including any line numbers/indentation characters. Such a delight. Such focus on details. Makes me really confident in the rest of the project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulation on the 2.0 release. EdgeDB looks awesome. However, I will not advocate using it for any of my clients unless there&#39;s a clear path to derisking its adoption. Like all new software products/services there&#39;s a significant risk of it becoming abandonware. I&#39;d obviously want EdgeDB to succeed but how can one de-risk adopting it?
Would it be possible to somehow &#34;transpile&#34;  both queries and modeling scripts to readable SQL? That way, worste case scenario one may fall back on Postgresql without loosing most of previous work.
Let me be clear. I really like EdgeDB  and obviously want the best for and you guys but I do not think I&#39;m alone in thinking that we need a clear, easy and verifiable way to fallback to Posgresql if/when needed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to build local first software backed by EdgeDB. Similar to these tools:- https://replicache.dev- https://github.com/tantaman/conflict-free-sqlite- https://aphrodite.shI wonder if EdgeDB provides any utilities to make this already perhaps? Or community has to build some kind of CRDT software that builds on top of EdgeDB that will do local syncing? Maybe that&#39;s planned to be tackled for 3.0?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before my comment gets dismissed, I will disclaim I am a professional structural biologist that works in this field every day.These threads are always the same: lots of comments about protein folding, how amazing DeepMind is, how AlphaFold is a success story, how it has flipped an entire field on it&#39;s head, etc. The language from Google is so deceptive about what they&#39;ve actually done, I think it&#39;s actually intentionally disingenuous.At the end of the day, AlphaFold is amazing homology modeling. I love it, I think it&#39;s an awesome application of machine learning, and I use it frequently. But it&#39;s doing the same thing we&#39;ve been doing for 2 decades: pattern matching sequences of proteins with unknown structure to sequences of proteins with known structure, and about 2x as well as we used to be able to.That&#39;s extremely useful, but it&#39;s not knowledge of protein folding. It can&#39;t predict a fold de novo, it can&#39;t predict folds that haven&#39;t been seen (EDIT: this is maybe not strictly true, depending on how you slice it), it fails in a number of edge cases (remember, in biology, edge cases are everything) and again, I can&#39;t stress this enough, we have no new information on how proteins fold. We know all the information (most of at least) for a proteins final fold is in the sequence. But we don&#39;t know much about the in-between.I like AlphaFold, it&#39;s convenient and I use it (although for anything serious or anything interacting with anything else, I still need a real structure), but I feel as though it has been intentionally and deceptively oversold. There are 3-4 other deep learning projects I think have had a much greater impact on my field.EDIT: 
See below: 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32265662 for information on predicting new folds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a 5th grader question about how proteins are used/represented graphically that I&#39;ve never been able to find a satisfying answer for.Basically, you see these 3D representations of specific proteins as a crumple of ribbons-- literally like someone ran multi-colored ribbons though scissors to make curls and dumped it on the floor (like a grade school craft project).So... I understand that proteins are huge organic molecules composed of thousands of atoms, right? Their special capabilities arise from their structure/shape. So basically the molecule contorts itself to a low energy state which could be very complex but which enables it to &#34;bind?&#34; to other molecules expressly because of this special shape and do the special things that proteins do-- that form the basis of living things. Hence the efforts, like Alphafold, to compute what these shapes are for any given protein molecule.But what does one &#34;do&#34; with such 3D shapes?They seem intractably complex. Are people just browsing these shapes and seeing patterns in them? What do the &#34;ribbons&#34; signify? Are they just some specific arrangement of C,H,O? Why are some ribbons different colors? Why are there also thread-like things instead of all ribbons?Also, is that what proteins would really look like if you could see at sub-optical wavelength resolutions? Are they really like that? I recall from school the equipartition theorem-- 1/2 KT of kinetic energy for each degree of freedom. These things obviously have many degrees of freedom. So wouldn&#39;t they be &#34;thrashing around&#34; like rag doll in a blender at room temperature? It seems strange to me that something like that could be so central to life, but it is.Just trying to get myself a cartoonish mental model of how these shapes are used! Anyone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lawrence Lessig (Harvard law professor famous for fighting for sane copyright law) does a great presentation on the root cause of Americas problems. He also ran for president in 2016.It can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tEThe short version is that to win primaries you need money. Money mainly comes from corporations and rich people. Taking money from corporations and rich people creates a relationship where you have some loyalty to them or they can punish you if you don&#39;t act how they want. Thus the primary corrupting force in America is pro-corruption campaign finance laws.The test for democracy is whether elected politicians pass legislation that the public at large wishes to be passed. Our very own Princeton did a study to answer this question.The key finding: “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a miniscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.”[1]In a very real, non hyperbolic sense we are in a plutocracy where money rules. We are not a democracy due chiefly to our campaign finance laws.Here is a campaign that aims to work on this:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hear me out...  few people want to run for federal office already.  The pay isn&#39;t great and it&#39;s hard work.If the US was a company, there&#39;d be no question that we&#39;d need to pay our leadership much better to attract top talent.  We pay senators $170k a year to manage our country with a $20 trillion economy.So what we end up with is activists who crave power and elites from rich families for whom $170k a year is a rounding error.  Those families then use the power from being in office to enrich their families even more.One solution could be to double or triple pay for US representatives along with banning stock trading and things like &#34;speaking fees.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been collecting and sharing (@QuiverCongress on Twitter) data on stock trading by U.S. congressmen for the past couple years.While there is currently legislation that requires congressmen to disclose their financial dealings, enforcement around it is incredibly weak.Congressmen are supposed to disclose stock transactions within 45 days of when they are made, but in practice there are dozens of violations of this rule which result in hardly a slap on the wrist. I&#39;ve seen a couple cases of politicians conveniently waiting till after election cycles to disclose controversial trades.While I&#39;m generally pessimistic about the odds of congress voting to regulate itself, I&#39;m still hopeful that something comes from this push. There&#39;s certainly a lot of room for improvement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please, please, please,  avoid status cuisines. It&#39;s going to be hard to do, because they make good PR. But you will be helping your users a lot more of you hold them off with a ten foot pole. What do I mean by a status cuisine? They are meals that are intended to show that the cook is a worthy person, rather than that the meal is practical, healthy, and good to eat. Here are some examples:The endurance cuisine: designed to show that the cook has time to spare, the endurance cuisine requires that no ingredient is pre-processed in any way. Grind your own grain, bake your own breadcrumbs, chop your own veg. Using grapes? You should have peeled them!The hair-shirt cuisine: you have to endure some discomfort if it&#39;s good for you, right? This cuisine specialises in sour tastes and unpleasant mouthfeel -  often using grains that our stone-age ancestors sensibly gave up for nicer ones.The gold plated cuisine: this one&#39;s obvious. Pricier ingredients must be better - or at least show how much the cook can spendThe obscurantist/connoisseur&#39;s cuisine: it can&#39;t be good if it&#39;s easy to find. The cook can only be good if they know exactly how many &#39;extras&#39; you need in your virgin olive oil, and what classification of wine you should put in your coq&#39;au&#39;vin.(Okay this is a bit tongue in cheek - but only a bit.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done a few quizzes on the app now, and I don&#39;t get it. The questions feel very contrived, like someone had a quota to fill so just put whatever looked plausible together. They are also _very_ culturally specific.Questions about eggs barely made sense to me being from the UK, with incorrect pack sizes, animal welfare terms, and completely missed our great standards body that makes it easy to know which eggs have met a reasonable quality bar. It&#39;s not that the info is globally applicable, it&#39;s that it&#39;s an awkward combination of wrong and useless depending on where you live. Starting another quiz about kitchen equipment it seems this is a pattern throughout.Cooking is deeply embedded into culture, tradition, region, climate, regulatory environment, retail infrastructure, and more. I don&#39;t think these quizzes will be able to overcome this without being fully localised per country.The recipes? Maybe they&#39;re better. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m still 7 levels away from being able to know how to make scrambled eggs.Edit: when I opened the app the first time it asked me how experienced I am and I answered the 3rd out of 4 options, I know my way around a kitchen. The app just asked me to match pictures of eggs to how they have been cooked: fried, scrambled, etc. I&#39;m not sure I can survive this level of patronisation, it&#39;s honestly a bit insulting.Edit: &#34;what sort of pan should you cook eggs in&#34;... &#34;no not a wok, people don&#39;t have those at home&#34;. Ouch. At best that&#39;s incredibly sheltered for a food writer, and at worst it&#39;s practically racist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish you good luck but I don&#39;t get it either.The thing that makes Duolingo great is that right away you learn words in a new language.  It hooks you.  Within 1 lesson you know several words or a phrase with a few variations.This is more just random trivia about food that no one cares about.  I started with the cheeseburger recipe (apparently an advanced lesson or something).  Right away it&#39;s asking me a bunch of questions about ground meat but teaching me nothing.  Where&#39;s the hook?  I want to see a recipe and learn to make it, not feel like I&#39;m taking a test about a bunch of stuff I was never taught with no obvious path to simply making the thing I want to make.  In the 5 minutes I spent on it I feel like I was just getting grilled (metaphorically).  The first 5 minutes of Duolingo I actually learned something.Anyhow, suggestion would be to start right away with the thing people actually want...  How to cook the food and make the recipe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think that MS here is being used as a convenient scapegoat. This worry was never expressed at the time in significant terms. The FAT and SMB patents were much more of a worry than anything related to the desktop interface - only outright clones were being pursued.At the time, KDE, GNOME and Ubuntu developers alike, were simply drunk on popularity. Linux usage was in ascendancy, money was being thrown around, and the FOSS world was starting to attract young designers who saw it as a cheap way to build professional credibility. And then the iPhone happened and the whole UX world just went apeshit. The core teams really thought they had a shot at redesigning how people interact with computers, &#34;like Apple did with phones&#34;. Interaction targets moved from keyboard+mouse to touch screens, because &#34;convergence&#34; and the fact that the mobile sector was suddenly awash with cash.It&#39;s sad that people try to justify their missteps in this way. Microsoft was (and is) a terrible company and a constant threat to the FOSS ecosystem, but defining some of the biggest design choices of the Linux desktop only in antagonistic or reflective terms does a real disservice to those projects and the people who worked in them.If experience is the name we give our errors, refusing to accept errors were made means stating you&#39;ve learnt nothing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was the lead designer of Unity. Unity was not a response to patent concerns, but rather the manifestation of a convoluted OEM strategy involving exclusive distribution of distinct design features, and a write-once-run-anywhere dream of running Ubuntu on any device from netbooks to big screens to automobiles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is news to me.  I remember that the Linux desktop seemed to be on the ascendancy back in 2006.  GNOME 2 and KDE 3 were very nice desktops; while they weren’t Mac OS X Tiger (which still holds up as an amazing desktop), they were solid contenders to Windows XP.  But then came GNOME 3 and KDE 4, which were major fumbles that set back the Linux desktop for years.If it’s true that GNOME’s radical direction beginning with version 3 is the result of threats from Microsoft to change its desktop to avoid influences from Windows, then that definitely changes my assessment of the era, and my distaste for Microsoft’s anti-competitive behavior only deepens (this is the same Microsoft that complained about Apple’s look-and-feel lawsuits)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really nicely written; kudos to the author for compiling a great deal of information in a readable format.If I can be forgiven one nitpick: Poetry does not use a PEP 518-style[1] build configuration by default, which means that its use of `pyproject.toml` is slightly out of pace with the rest of the Python packaging ecosystem. That isn&#39;t to say that it isn&#39;t excellent, because it is! But you the standards have come a long way, and you can now use `pyproject.toml` with any build backend as long as you use the standard metadata.By way of example, here&#39;s a project that&#39;s completely PEP 517 and PEP 518 compatible without needing a setup.py or setup.cfg[2]. Everything goes through pyproject.toml.[1]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/[2]: https://github.com/trailofbits/pip-audit/blob/main/pyproject..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a great article.We start with learning that we absolutely need this Poetry thing because… it&#39;s what everyone else uses. It&#39;s refreshing to see author who can skip usual badly argued justifications and just plain admin that he does not know shit and is just following rest of the herd.
Then we continue by &#34;solving&#34;  depependencies by usual way of ignoring them and just freezing whatever happens to be present.Then there is inevitable firing up of virtualenv, because that&#39;s just what you have to do when dealing  with messed up dependencies.Next one is new to me. Apparently, one does not just set up git hooks nowadays but use separate tool with declarative config. Because if you ever happen upon something not covered by the Tool, that would mean you are no longer part of the herd.Then we push our stuff straight to pypi, because of course our stuff can&#39;t possibly have any dependencies outside of python herd ecosystem. It&#39;s not like we knew our dependencies anyway.Then comes the fun part, pulling in tox, because when you have special tool to handle dependencies, what you just need is another tool with different environment and dependency model.Code quality section I will just skip over, seeing what pass for code quality these days makes me too sad.
What follows is setup of several proprietary projects that modern opensource seemingly can&#39;t exist without.
What is more interresting is &#34;tyding up&#34; by moving code from git root to subdir. Now, this is of course perfectly sensible thing to, but I wonder why is it called &#39;src&#39;? Maybe some herd memeber saw compiled language somewhere and picked it up without understanding difference between compiled binary and source code?Now don&#39;t take this as if I have problem with the article content in itself. No, as a primer to modern python packaging it&#39;s great. It&#39;s not authors fault that his work is so comprehensive it lays out bare all the idiosyncrasies, herd mentality, cargocultism and general laziness of python ecosystem these days. Or is it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish people would just forget about pre-commit, this thing is especially useless in a setting where a CI/CD pipeline exists. It&#39;s not that hard to write a simple Makefile or shellscript to run linters on push.Pre-commit is one of the most annoying tools that have come into existence in recent years that everyone seems to be cargo-culting. It doesn&#39;t play well with editors since in order to find the actual binary path, you&#39;d have to open up a sqlite database to fish out the virtualenv pre-commit created. Pre-commit also increases maintenance burden, since its configuration is completely separate from your usual requirements-dev.txt/pyproject.toml/setup.cfg etc. If you have dev dependencies in one of these files because making your editors to find the pre-commit created binaries are hard, now you have to keep both versions in sync.I really don&#39;t see the point of any pre-commit hooks unless you are the one guy that doesn&#39;t use a modern CI/CD platform."</p>

Medium has something similar they called Snowflake - https://github.com/Medium/snowflake ... but note the disclaimer...&gt; Heads up: Medium isn’t using this tool anymore, but you’re welcome to!The problem with things like this is the typical engineering mindset, when shown a graphical or numerical analysis of their performance will zoom into analyse every detail and in the end it&#39;s just backed by the managers impressions and judgement.For similar reasons I have a strong opinion that engineers shouldn&#39;t be paid performance related bonuses, because no matter what happens, it&#39;s just going to upset them - the best case - maximum bonus - just equates to a &#34;meh&#34;. Better to pay a good base salary upfront ...Anyway use tools like this with caution IMO."</p>

Most things can be guided by merely understanding the principals of it.This very old doc (from Sun Microsystems engineers IIRC) remains excellent https://web.archive.org/web/20090420152505/http://mark.kampe...It speaks to the spirit, the principals, behind progression... and that makes it extremely applicable to lots of fields, personal paths, and environments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tolkien on Tom in Letter 144:I might put it this way. The story is cast in terms of a good side, and a bad side, beauty against ruthless ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. but if you have, as it were taken &#39;a vow of poverty&#39;, renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the question of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless. It is a natural pacifist view, which always arises in the mind when there is a war.The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien 144: To Naomi Mitchison. April 1954"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, Tom Bombadil is the introduction of natural magic. He is nature, indicating to the reader that there is a source of magic beyond the elves, Wizards, and Sauron.There are many magical creatures in Middle-Earth without a described source, which to me makes the whole story feel more magic. The Ents probably being the chief example.Another important role of Tom’s is his introduction of magic and power outside of the “good vs evil” struggle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Possibly the least liked character in The Lord of the Rings. A childish figure so disliked by fans of the book that few object to his absence from all adaptations of the story.I&#39;ve been a fan of Tolkien for decades, and this doesn&#39;t match up with my experience at all...Tolkien fans seem to generally love Tom, and many were deeply disappointed that he wasn&#39;t in the movies (even though his exclusion makes perfect sense). Did I just run in different Tolkien circles than the author?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel some of the OP points. I was working on a profiling agent lately, and one of the issues was running it on multiple platforms (just the four big ones linux/mac-x86/arm) on FFI (because it&#39;ll be run directly from python/ruby/etc...) and preferably having the thing just work without having to install or configure any dependencies.Like OP I hit two walls: libunwind, and linking. For libunwind, I ended up downloading/compiling manually; and for linking there is auditwheel[1]. Although it is a Python tool, I did actually end up using it for Ruby (by creating a &#34;fake python package&#34;, and then copying the linked dependencies).It was at that time that I learned about linking for dynamic libraries, patchelf and there is really no single/established tool to do this. I thought there should be something but most people seem to install the dependencies with any certain software. I also found, the hard way, that you still have to deal with gcc/c when working with Rust. It does isolate you from many stuff, but for many things there is no work around.There is a performance hit to this strategy, however, since shared dynamic libraries will be used by all the running programs that need them; whereas my solution will run its own instance. It made me wonder if wasm will come up with something similar without affecting portability.Finally, the project is open source and you can browse the code here: https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope-rs[1]: https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is compiling once and running on 6 platforms really that compelling? One of Rust’s super powers is that it’s really easy to write code once that can be compiled N times for N platforms without making any changes.I’m all about writing code once. But compiling a few times doesn’t seem like that big of a deal to me?The article says it runs on “six operating systems” but I can’t find them listed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nobody hates Facebook users more than Facebook, I guess. :-/I&#39;ve tried to type out several pithy comments, but the bottom line (to me) is that Facebook just doesn&#39;t respect its users or care about their needs.Can you imagine if brick-and-mortar businesses tried to do this? You go out for a Big Mac, but it&#39;s not on the menu anymore because Taco Bell had a few really good quarters, so McDonald&#39;s decided to pivot to tacos. Maybe you can still order the Big Mac if you know to ask for it, but most people won&#39;t, and they&#39;ll leave disappointed instead of getting what they wanted.Edit: To clarify, this example is contrived and the details are not the point. The point is that Facebook offered something to their users, spent years and billions of dollars making sure that as many people as possible got it from Facebook, and then decided to just yank the rug out from under all those people to chase the fairy tale of endless growth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s crazy to think the social media era may finally be ending. There’s really no viable platform anymore where you can just go passively keep up with what friends and acquaintances are doing. Everything is about feeding you content you didn’t ask for but may be targeted enough to catch your attention.And for what? To show you some ads here and there? To collect data that can be used to… sell more ads and products?Instagram was once my favorite app. There was a golden age before stories came a long where people just posted random pictures of what they were up to or what they were seeing. Things weren’t too memefied or political, unlike Facebook. Then photos got more and more glamorized and more about flexing and showing how much cooler and more awesome your life was. People started following themes and niches for their profile content rather than just posting random unorganized series of photos. Businesses and brands started getting built on the platform.Building an Instagram clone the way it used to be is fairly trivial these days. I could probably throw one together in a few months, but growing its popularity is practically impossible these days with such entrenched incumbents and no niches left to start a user base with.…unless perhaps… we build a social network on the blockchain"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it sounds dumb but its hard to say we haven&#39;t moved closer to what only ~10 years ago we considered a &#34;playful exaggeration&#34; on the worst of humans and social media.In WallE, everyone is floating around in chairs having their content spoon-fed to them with a generous amount of ads mixed in.  If you&#39;ve ever scrolled or seen someone scroll, its kinda close.  Just mindlessly moving their thumb up and down, taking in content that will be forgotten within minutes.  Ask a tik tok user to tell you even 10% of the videos they saw within the last hour.  I&#39;d be surprised if they could.I hope its not too &#34;old man yelling at cloud&#34; because I do my 15 minutes of mindless instagram scrolling but I have a timer that locks the app and I usually only need 15 minutes, more just feels bleh.  Some of my family/friends &#34;brag&#34; about having 7+ hrs of &#34;tik tok time&#34; on their iphone stats.  Just crazy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this.I have been a fan of SQLite for years, and it makes me genuinely happy to see other people have the same enthusiasm for the software.A couple of years ago, during a job search, I came across a couple of companies that I thought were a good match. I went through the interview process with all of them and, due to similarities in the interview process, we ended up talking about the same thing: databases. Oh the horror in the interviewers’ eyes whenever I mentioned SQLite. Experienced software engineers from The New York Times, for example, went as far as to mock my engineering choices in 3 out of 5 interviews, despite the success of the products my team built on top of SQLite.The experience made me feel awful and I stopped talking about SQLite for a couple of years. Instead, whenever someone asked a question about databases, I would answer with the PostgreSQL equivalent, knowing that the basic features are all the same.That is why, whenever I see projects like Litestream [1][2] used by excellent products like Tailscale [3], it brings me joy.A friend of SQLite is a friend of mine :-)[1] https://litestream.io[2] https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/[3] https://tailscale.com/blog/database-for-2022/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For people who enjoy this article I recommend reading the two-parter “How does SQLite work?” [1] [2] by Julia Evans. It too is an exploration into the inner workings but diving deeper into code. 
And for those interested in more details on b-trees, there’s “The Ubiquitous B-Tree” by Douglas Cramer which I enjoyed a lot.[1] https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/27/how-does-sqlite-work-part-1-...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dream of a SQLite-like embeddable database engine based on Datomic’s data model and queryable with Datalog. Written in something like C, Rust, or Zig. I’m toying around with the idea of hacking something up, but it’ll likely stay in the dream realm until I have Heaps of Free Time on My Hands (tm).Looking into SQLite’s innards is a great source of inspiration. Thanks for this post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run marketing email databases. This is cute, but it doesn&#39;t actually do anything in most systems - either the employees all already get the marketing emails or there is a system-wide rule to suppress against the email domain.If you actually want to (potentially) break something, try submitting some obscure characters or malformed html into some fields. Blank spaces in emails can particularly be a nuisance.And if you want some real fun, some systems only enforce validation rules via client-side javascript. If you block them, you might be able to submit some real chaotic entries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to get spam from a Chinese exporter who conveniently included their actual address in the emails. One day I happened to be visiting their city and went to their office and asked them to unsubscribe me in person. The lady was very confused and first thought I wanted to buy something. I showed her the spam on my phone and she agreed but didn&#39;t bother actually removing me. Just seemed to think I was a bit stupid for travelling so far (I was also a foreigner) to complain about a spam. It was interesting to see what those companies look like in real life though - an office filled with piles of widgets and cartons of deliveries everywhere. These Chinese exporter spammers do tend to be legitimate businesses and they can actually provide good cheap access to manufacturers but they harvest emails from everywhere if there&#39;s any hint you might work in a related industry."</p>

We absolutely need to fund more semiconductor manufacturing. Losing that ability to China/Taiwan was just a terrible strategic mistake.The US hasn’t lost this battle (over semiconductors) just yet. While current manufacturing is indeed dominated by East Asian countries, the vast majority of research still happens in US universities. This legislation allocates more funding for that research, fantastic.Theres some political gamesmanship over some silly stock options of congresspeople… my response is, who gives a single shit. The country needs this bill."</p>

Every major power block heavily subsidizes strategic industries, now and forever. It&#39;s in no way new or remarkable, nor does it violate some principle. Most of the above concepts are pure fiction.Semiconductors are not a &#34;free market&#34; in any ordinary sense. It costs tens of billions to enter the market and you&#39;ll buy an ASML machine, speaking of dependencies.It&#39;s pretty obvious that this is in response to geopolitical instability. Being geo locked and this not really being a free market at all justify the &#34;unusual&#34; decision.As is stands, food, energy, and yes...also semiconductors are foundational to a modern digital society. And they&#39;re interconnected, without semiconductors you won&#39;t have food either.If you want to know what happens when semiconductors dry up, watch modern Russia. Arguably it&#39;s hard to do because of all the propaganda, but pretty much every domestic industry is falling apart, and therefore society falls apart.Bottom line, don&#39;t be naive. Sure it sucks to give rich companies even more money but if that&#39;s what it takes, so be it. Also, rich is just one side of the coin, the other is that they spear-headed the information revolution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author notes:
&#34;Finally, we need to talk federation. Does it make moving fast and breaking things more difficult? Yes, yes it does, and that can be a good thing.&#34;The other, super-underrated feature of federated systems is that antagonistic parties are willing to use them together. For example, the US military, Russian government, major international banks, Google, Facebook, etc ALL use email and happily exchange messages over SMTP. There&#39;s no centralized service you could get all these parties to agree to use (not even Signal).The result of this is that everyone has an email address, and that makes it the universal standard for business-to-business communication. I can loop in any number of parties on a single thread from all over the world and it just works.My startup Shortwave is trying to build a messaging future that is email. We&#39;re trying to evolve and upgrade email to have the look and feel and features of a product like Signal, but with all the universal, federated goodness of the global SMTP network. It&#39;s a long project -- federated systems evolve slowly! -- but it&#39;s the bright open future I think we need. I go into some detail here: https://www.shortwave.com/blog/future-of-messaging/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context, for non-Nethack players:Nethack is one of the original &#34;roguelikes,&#34; back when that meant a text-console game based on `rogue`. It&#39;s an RPG where your character kills monsters, picks up loot, and descends into the dungeon. If you die, that&#39;s it -- you can&#39;t just load a save; you have to start all over. It&#39;s legendarily unforgiving.In Nethack, most (all?) roles start with a pet, e.g. a puppy or a kitten. In the early game, your pet is often stronger than you; it follows you, fights monsters, etc. It&#39;s useful in many ways beyond fighting: it won&#39;t walk over a cursed item, it can &#34;fetch&#34; items from stores without angering the proprietor, and so on. Your pet gains experience and levels up (puppy -&gt; dog -&gt; large dog), and after a certain point you&#39;re prompted to give your pet a name.The message &#34;You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passes&#34; is displayed when your pet dies while out of sight. It&#39;s pretty difficult to keep your pet alive all through the endgame, so much like any real-life pet owner, there will come a time where you have to say goodbye, one way or the other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hidden gems like this were one of the great things about Everything2. For those who aren&#39;t familiar with it, E2 is structured vaguely like an encyclopedia, only instead of being a shared Wiki any user can write a whole separate article. Sometimes this was helpful for learning -- having three different explanations of what a tensor[1] is, for example. Sometimes it gave a mix of informational and personal content, such as the page on Mother&#39;s Day[2], which has one article on the history of the holiday and two about the authors&#39; attempts to cope with it despite losing or never having had a good relationship with their mothers. (Plus a summary of a Futurama episode by that name, because E2 was like that.)It also had an accidentally-fun feature in its hyperlinking system. Hyperlinks were intended to be used to be used for words that had their own articles, but you could link to any article, and when you hovered your mouse over the link the name of the target article would pop up. This could be used to make the closest thing I&#39;ve seen to an English equivalent of Japanese furigana puns. I&#39;m having trouble finding a good example right now, sadly.[1] https://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=tensor[2] https://everything2.com/title/Mother%2527s+day"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My own death, of course, which I learnt will come when I least expect it, when everything is going right for once - that when no threats are apparent and I feel I can relax a little, it will be then that I choke over a tin of spinach, or mistake a blue e for a blue o, or a pink h for a pink h.Just recently my wife developed a sudden and very aggressive infection. She&#39;s healthy and it totally came out of left field. Then it spread to me. It was definitely humbling. I don&#39;t believe in living in fear, but it&#39;s funny how everything can change in an instant.I have to commend the title though:&gt; You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passesComing to understand the ephemeral nature of emotions is what finally allowed me deal with them. They&#39;re still real, but they always pass, no matter how strong they seem in the moment."</p>

Like many, I was not particularly unhappy, so I had not been motivated to go through the effort for search process before.When I got an offer, my employer quickly matched it (suggesting that I really was worth that much to them) but burning a bridge with the contact you got me the new job was not worth  simply reaching parity in my current one, so they lost me.

I can see how being &#34;literate&#34; was tougher then than now.There were different handwriting styles, depending on the writing speed (inversely proportional to the quality and thus expense). For example the Codex Sinaiticus is gorgeous: https://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/manuscript.aspx?book=26&amp;c... (That&#39;s a Greek example, not Latin---sorry, I&#39;m not much of a Latinist anymore.) I guess if you don&#39;t have mechanical type, you are very motivated to speed up writing. The books I looked at were pretty hasty.Almost everything I saw was a treatise on medicine and biology. They were all &#34;commentaries on Aristotle&#34;. I guess that&#39;s what you had to do to publish in those days.Besides the paleography, I had to trace the origin &amp; date of the paper used, which was possible from watermarks. We had two huge reference volumes giving known watermarks so you could narrow things down a lot---but often you didn&#39;t get an exact match. There was a whole symbology there too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the way I&#39;m reading the post is Tesla swapped out a battery pack for a 60 with a 90 and enabled the 90. Tesla, years later, discovers that even though the hardware for a 90 was installed it should have been software limited to be a 60. (I&#39;m assuming that Tesla only made the owner pay the cost of the 60 battery swap even though they replaced it with a 90). They go and &#34;fix the glitch&#34; and set it back to the 60. Since the new owner bought it thinking it was a 90, because it was enabled to be a 90, presumably paid for it assuming this was the case and is now upset because they don&#39;t have what they thought they bought.Sounds like all around bad decisions. The previous owner shouldn&#39;t have sold it as a 90 or at least disclosed that, &#34;It&#39;s a 60 but Tesla swapped out the batter with a 90 and left it configured as a 90&#34;. Tesla, being notified, should have just enabled the 90 and made the customer happy. How exactly are people supposed to abuse this? Tesla put the 90 in there and they&#39;re the only ones who are going to be doing that. Presumably this cost them a fortune to do it in the first place. Why not get some good will out of it? &#34;Hey sorry about your battery. We only had a 90 so we threw that in there. Enjoy. Tell everyone you know about how awesome Tesla was about fixing the problem and remember that next time you go to buy your next car&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll spare the moral judgements against Tesla for this:The real moral of the story here is that if your business plan and practices is creating occasional weird issues and huge cognitive dissonance in your customers, it&#39;s the wrong business plan.  Also... the number of people this applies to is likely so low that Tesla really screwed up by not erring on the side of the customer.  (They didn&#39;t buy from Tesla, but they&#39;re still a customer buying servicing from them.)  If the bad publicity alone causes even a tiny fraction of the population to choose another manufacturer, the&#39;ve lost their $4,500 and then some.Harmony is a really underrated concept.  When things are harmonious, you don&#39;t have problems like this, and you can still make money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I feel like this is more mundane on Tesla&#39;s part than many are making it out to be.
A mistake was made years ago. An employee recently discovered and &#34;fixed&#34; it. 
Terrible communication and customer service, but nefarious? Nah.&#34;At this point I feel like terrible communication and service is an intentional business strategy for some companies who found that by making support so baroque as to be inaccessible or just eliminating it entirely that they can slash costs accordingly. I do consider it to be nefarious in such cases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a good article. At a technical level it&#39;s confused about a whole bunch of things:* SMM has been part of x86 for decades. The Secured Core requirements around SMM actually reduce its power.* The claimed requirement to remove the third party UEFI CA certificate from 2022 Secured Core PCs is entirely unrelated to Pluton (it&#39;s required regardless of whether Pluton is enabled or not, and even whether the CPU has Pluton or not)* Most of the description of Pluton is actually a description of a TPM. You don&#39;t need DICE for remote attestation. TPMs are already a hardware keystore.* System firmware is already being updated via Windows Update. The discussion about Pluton and Windows Update is around Pluton getting firmware updates that way (the existing story around firmware updates for TPMs is largely not good)* Existing TPM-based remote attestation already includes the secure boot stateThe short version: everything that the article is worried about being enabled by Pluton is already possible, and has been for years.But there&#39;s a meaningful point here. Remote attestation can certainly be used to restrict access to resources in ways that are incompatible with general purpose computing, or which reduce user choice. Remote attestation can also be used to give end users confidence that their machine is in a good state without constraining what they do with it. As a technology, remote attestation can be used in both good and bad ways. We do need to keep track of whether anyone is threatening to use it in bad ways and react appropriately.(But tbh remote attestation as an attack on general purpose computing isn&#39;t the really scary thing about widespread remote attestation. Remote attestation ties back to the TPM&#39;s endorsement key, an immutable cryptographic key certified by the TPM vendor at manufacturing time. The straightforward implementation of allowing arbitrary remote sites to trigger remote attestation would tie all of these accesses back to a single piece of hardware, and would be a privacy nightmare.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m completely missing how his example of a Word document that can only be opened by approved users on approved hardware within the corporation is supposed to be a bad thing.Honestly, that sounds pretty fantastic. I&#39;ve been using 3rd party tools/extensions to do this sort of thing in corporate and government environments for years, but having the attestation go all the way down to the hardware level is a big value-add, especially with so much ransomware/spyware/extortion/espionage going on these days.Can someone please explain to me how the author might see this level of security as a bad thing?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I fear the most with this is &#34;proof that secure boot has never been disabled&#34;. This is just a way to brick your device from accessing services.What if you government&#39;s tax service requires such proof? Or bank? I cannot count how many machines I booted on Linux to rescue a hard drive, or image it, or wipe it, or just to install linux on them. All those devices, boom, paperweight for regular personal use.I hate it so much that Microsoft is alone in this. It&#39;s not because it&#39;s M$, it&#39;s because they&#39;re alone on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have background here and can take a pretty good guess at what happened. You used a Brex card, which Google sees as a “privacy card.” These are often used by scammers trying to circumvent Google blocking their credit card account numbers.The solution here is to never use a hidden or “privacy” card number with Google, although of course Google will never tell you that or confirm or deny this. I only know this due to working with clients in this area.You can try removing that card and adding a regular hard card number and asking for a reinstatement again, but it may be too late for this account.Hopefully this helps folks reading this to not make the same mistake (although it’s incredibly frustrating that stuff like this has to be learned by trial and error or knowledge from those of us who have dealt with this previously.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had nearly this exact experience, marketing a small SaaS.A sudden ads suspension arrived, with no explanation beyond &#34;suspicious payments&#34;. This from the same billing account used with GSuite, Domains, GCP; and from a business that was having no trouble running ads on FB, Twitter, and Reddit. &#34;How silly, but I&#39;m sure we can get it fixed&#34;.. I thought.Like OP I&#39;m also a Xoogler, so after two rounds of unsuccessful appeals through the front door (including updating my payment account to a hard card, providing articles of incorporation, and so on, to no avail), I figured it was time to call in my first ever favor. Surely one of my old-timer engineer buddies could thunk a ticket somewhere and maybe we&#39;d help them fix a bug in some automated system in the process.But the Google of 2022 is far different than the earlier days. It seems individual employees, even well-placed engineers, have incredibly and increasingly limited agency to fix things outside their immediate purview; a wiki about internal escalations for ads suspension stated they were no longer accepted, vaguely for reasons of &#34;compliance&#34;.On the bright side, the whole episode made me rethink and ultimately diversify our technology dependency on Google. I was naive not to do so more seriously and earlier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It feels like every month or so there is another story like this about Google&#39;s customer support. For me it is one of the reasons I will *never* build on Google Cloud.Combine this with their propensity to randomly shut down services and also jack up the prices of things by some wild amount overnight with no warning or justification. (Google Maps API and Kubernetes control plane.)I would never consider risking all of my work on Google&#39;s reputation which is a shame because I&#39;m sure the services themselves work relatively well. It feels like everyone outside of google is widely aware of these issues but everyone inside is completely blind to them.Side Note: has anyone ever &#34;won&#34; an appeal with Google or does the system deny 100% of appeals?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems extremely clever.I know Mullvad already allows you to e.g. send cash in an envelope for total privacy, but that&#39;s kind of a pain, it&#39;ll take a long time to arrive, if the envelope is lost there&#39;s nothing you can do, etc.But by physically printing covered-up codes on cards, this actually uses Amazon to create the privacy/anonymity, which kind of feels ironic given how Amazon generally tries to hoover up all the data. You can get your code with fast Prime delivery, a tracking number, pay for it with your credit card, get a free replacement if it&#39;s lost in the mail...I love this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kind of surprised this hasn&#39;t been mentioned yet, but it&#39;s pretty commonplace to buy gift cards with cryptocurrencies. So there&#39;s yet another layer of anonymity if you buy an Amazon gift card from a stranger/service then use it for a physical Mullvad activation code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I generally believe it to be possible, I am very curious about how Mullvad is storing its payment records to avoid time-based correlations.For gift cards it&#39;s more async, but given that payment processors keep records that can be correlated, if Mullvad isn&#39;t careful about timestamping, how it records crediting to accounts, or the like, it would be extremely easy to de-anonymize account relations IMO."</p>

Volume is now lower than it was way back in 2020.The crypto down rounds are going to be hilarious.Note to investors: if you’re investing in crypto projects, carefully consider the ponzinomics and the vesting schedule. You want your unlocks to happen in the middle of the bullrun when exit liquidity is ample.And also remember that whatever you might think of as “normal”
volume will crash 90%. And when you think it has stabilized, it will crash 90% more.The number of investors who bought the top is hilarious. But then, this is also a field where risk management is treated like a sin."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Helium isn&#39;t your typical crypto company.  Their vision is actually very lofty - build a distributed low data wireless network completely independent of phone providers and cable companies.And pay the people who own nodes a percentage of the $ earned thru the traffic flow of their node.The payment just uses crypto because the ecosystem is a nice fit.  Everybody knows what miners are and that they make money.The problem is that you need the entire network in place before people can build on it.  So they have been subsidizing the miners.  And it&#39;s a race of how much money can you raise and payout vs how much is a network like that is worth.And right now everybody has cellular and cable and fiber and no one really needs another system.  Most of the use cases (LOTS of sensor data) aren&#39;t really worth that much money.Personally, I think the government should subsidize something like this to allow it to get off the ground.  Earthquake data, climate data, traffic data, etc.  Essentially public use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked into getting a Helium hotspot, but when I looked at my ISP‘s terms of service, the Helium use case is explicitly forbidden (I use Frontier Internet in Florida.)If you’re not familiar with it, what a Helium hotspot does is allow compatible IOT devices to share your Internet connection.I suspect that allowing random third parties to use your Internet connection it’s explicitly forbidden by the terms of service of most ISPs, especially when you are being monetarily compensated/rewarded for such sharing.Excerpt from ToS:
“Customers may not retransmit the Service or make the Service available to anyone outside the
premises (i.e. Wi-Fi or other methods of networking).”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What really helped me understand and troubleshoot network communications at the socket level was the book by W. Richard Stevens[0]. I think this is because he starts with an introduction to TCP, and builds from there. Knowing TCP states and transitions is important to reading packet dumps, and in general debugging networking.Also, no matter what platform you&#39;re using, there is probably a socket implementation somewhere at the core. You&#39;re best off understanding how sockets work, then understanding how the platform you&#39;re working with uses sockets[1].Once I read the W. Richard Stevens book, I was able to read and understand RFCs for protocols like HTTP to know how things should work. Then you&#39;re better prepared to figure out if a behavior is due to your code, or an implementation of the protocol in your device, or the device on the other end of the network connection, or some intermediary device.[0] - http://www.kohala.com/start/unpv12e.html[1] - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/porti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the big issues with TCP is a lot of communication isn&#39;t well-suited to the stream model and is message-oriented, so yes, like the author says, you have to go implement ACKs. And then you want multiplexing, which streams also fail at. Before you know it, you built a worse version of HTTP2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How you handle a file no longer existing vs. a socket disconnection are not likely to be very similar. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get counter arguments to this,That&#39;s my cue! I think the &#34;everything is a file&#34; is somewhat misunderstood. I might even rephrase it as &#34;everything is a file descriptor&#34; first, but then if you need to give a name to it, or ACL that thing, that&#39;s what the file-system is for: that all the objects share a common hierarchy, and different things that need names can be put in say, the same directory. I.e., that there is one hierarchy, for pipes, devices, normal files, etc.I&#39;d argue that the stuff that &#34;is&#34; a file (named or anonymous) or a file descriptor is actually rather small, and most operations are going to require knowing what kind of file you have.E.g., in Linux, read()/write() behave differently when operating on, e.g., an eventfd, read() requires a buffer of at least 8 B.Heck, &#34;close&#34; might really be the only thing that makes sense, generically. (I&#39;d also argue that a (fallible¹) &#34;link&#34; call should be in that category, but alas, it isn&#39;t on Linux, and potentially unlink for similar reasons — i.e., give and remove names from a file. I think this is a design mistake personally, but Linux is what it is. What I think is a bigger mistake is having separate/isolated namespaces for separate types of objects. POSIX, and hence Linux, makes this error in a few spots.)But if you&#39;re just writing a TCP server, yeah, that probably doesn&#39;t matter.&gt; and that you should write your applications to treat these the same.But I wouldn&#39;t argue that. A socket likely is a socket for some very specific purpose (whatever the app is, most likely), and that specific purpose is going mean it will be treated as that.In OOP terms, just b/c something might have a base class doesn&#39;t mean we always treat it as only an instance of the base class. Sometimes the stuff on the derived class is very important to the function of the program, and that&#39;s fine.¹e.g., in the case of an anonymous normal file (an unlinked temp file, e.g., O_TMPFILE), attempting to link it on a different file-system would have to fail."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I sort of owe callgrind a big chunk of my career.I was working at a company full of PhDs and well seasoned veterans, who looked at me as a new kid, kind of underqualified to be working in their tools group. I had been at the firm for a while, and they were nice enough, but didn&#39;t really have me down as someone who was going to contribute as anything other than a very junior engineer.We had a severe problem with a program&#39;s performance, and no one really had any idea why. And as it was clearly not a sophisticated project, I got assigned to figure something out.I used the then very new callgrind and the accompanying flamegraph, and discovered that we were passing very large bit arrays for register allocation by value. Very, very large. They had started small enough to fit in registers, but over time had grown so large that a function call to manipulate them effectively flushed the cache, and the rest of the code assumed these operations were cheap.Profiling tools at the time were quite primitive, and the application was a morass of shared libraries, weird dynamic allocations and JIT, and a bunch of other crap.Valgrind was able to get the profiles after failing with everything else I could try.The presentation I made on that discovery, and my proposed fixes (which eventually sped everything up greatly), finally earned the respect of my colleagues, and no phd wasn&#39;t a big deal after that. Later on, those colleagues who had left the company invited me to my next gig. And the one after that.So thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I hadn&#39;t read this article because now I know that I&#39;ve been mispronouncing Valgrind for nearly 20 years but I&#39;m not going to stop.(Kidding. Thanks for Valgrind! I still use it for assessing memory corruption vulnerabilities along with ASan.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once submitted a bug fix for an obscure issue to valgrind. They asked for a test case, which I managed to provide, but I was a bit nervous as I couldn&#39;t immediately see how to fit in their test suite.The response from Julian Seward was so nice it set a permanently high bar for me when random people I don&#39;t know report bugs on my projects!We still run our entire testsuite under valgrind in CI. Amazing tool!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a heavy user of LT. Very happy with it.A really nice feature of LT is that you can add your own rules. A rule editor is provided here:https://community.languagetool.org/ruleEditor2/Basically, whenever you catch an error in your writing you add a rule to ensure that it is caught the next time. After a few years your rule set will catch a large portion of your writing errors. It&#39;s fun too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a user of the Language Tool API as we&#39;re building (experimenting with?) a language learning app [1] and grammar correction is a key component. I really want to love it, and I&#39;m so appreciative of the open source version that has allowed us to get going, but it&#39;s just so... limited. I haven&#39;t really dug into the code, but I gather that it is very rules based and that seems destined to fail because so much of language is context sensitive.For example, it really can&#39;t determine in German if you&#39;re using the correct case or not for a particular verb. Or it can&#39;t really tell if you&#39;re using the right prepositions.Ultimately, we ended up building a grammar engine just for language learners using transformers [2] + a version of errant [3] we ported to be multilingual. It&#39;s not perfect, but after a couple weeks of development was more helpful than LT.1. https://squidgies.app2. e.g. this paper from Grammarly https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12592, but there are a bazillion others3. https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"    This periodic adjustment mainly benefits scientists and astronomers as it allows them to observe celestial bodies using UTC for most purposes

This is incorrect, dealing with leap seconds is a major problem in astronomy, requiring a data file or even recompile any time there is a new one announced.  Since they are only ever announced 6 months in advance, it creates a lot of logistical problems.Astronomy algorithms usually work in Barycentric Dynamic Time, or Terrestrial Time, or UT1.  In reality the whole invention of UTC is so that people don&#39;t have to deal with those systems on a daily basis.The process most astronomy programs go through is to get the UTC from the user, convert the Gregorian date to a Julian day number to get rid of the Gregorian Calendar altogether.  Then look up the number of leap seconds, add those to the JD to get International Atomic Time, then add 32.184 seconds to get Terrestrial Time.  If Barycentric Dynamic Time is needed, you must first compute the velocity of the Earth relative to the solar system barycenter (which itself requires TDB), then compute the relativistic effects of that motion on Terrestrial Time.  If you need UT1, these can only be obtained by observation from the International Earth Rotation Service, and required daily updates, and interpolation of values in between observations.So, as you can see, leap seconds do nothing to make an astronomer&#39;s life easier.  In fact, we jump through a lot of hoops to make the average person&#39;s life easier.  It sounds like Meta wants to change the definition of time for everyone just to make their programming a little easier.  I find the very premise just out right ridiculous.It&#39;s true that your average person will not be affected by the Sun setting a few seconds earlier.  But eventually it will build up enough error that it eventually has to be addressed, and Meta is just trying to make their problem someone else&#39;s problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone is treating this as some idiosyncratic proposal of Facebook&#39;s, but removing leap seconds is a mainstream position.  Representatives of the US, China, France, and a majority of other countries were in favor of this when it was discussed at the 2015 ITU meeting [1] though the UK and Russia&#39;s were not.  This has been under discussion since at least the 2003 ITU meeting in Turin.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18855"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t help but agree with 80% of this post but strongly disagree with the solution. This feels like a hack that punts the problems to the future.UTC has the leap second cause it&#39;s not &#34;real time&#34; and so now we&#39;re just gonna never sync up UTC to real time at all? How is that the solution? Either we deal with leap seconds or we need to implement something that can&#39;t go backwards and properly models time. Leap seconds seem much simpler...In the end we didn&#39;t get rid of SQL cause of SQL Injection. We fixed the frameworks and promoted the solutions. We may simply need to make a push for languages and etc to just properly support time and promote how to do things correctly. It honestly seems easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience on small teams that I&#39;ve been on - a key motivator for people is shipping products and features. The sooner and more frequently you can do this the more positive reinforcement there is for the entire team - not to mention reduced risk of something never making it to the target users.Teams that have figured out the optimal way to get product and features into the hands of users as quickly as possible are the happiest teams because it&#39;s evidence that they&#39;re working together efficiently to meet their shared goals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why when leading an engineering org I narrowed down to one metric:Committed to Completed RatioIt encourages completing things and only committing to what you can complete.It&#39;s legible, easy to understand by engineering, product, and management, pointless to game, and positively reinforces completion. It&#39;s quite difficult to accurately predict when a complete feature will ship, let alone a whole product. But, if one breaks down a feature into its legible constituent components and then commits to completing just what is within that (which also necessitates any required communication to arrive at understanding the requirements) then over time you can get quite good at predicting what you will be able to get done in a sprint and better at only committing to what you believe you can actually complete."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is very thorough, but makes one fairly big mistake: it assumes there is low variability in task size.This could be a reasonable assumption if you&#39;re very good at adjusting scope, but I would be skeptical unless you have measured it and have the numbers to prove that in practise, tasks indeed turn out to be roughly the same size (±20 % or whatever -- I don&#39;t know the exact threshold.)Why this matters is that under cheap context switches and even modest task size variability, it&#39;s -- surprisingly -- a performant queuing policy to pre-empt the currently processing task to handle every incoming task. The intuition behind this is that if a task is still processing when a new one comes in, it&#39;s likely to be a &#34;big&#34; task, and it&#39;s worth letting small tasks ahead in line. Reduces mean response time.Of course, this could all be moot anyway because context switches are certainly not cheap for software engineers. I just thought I should mention it for nuance. Rules of thumb only get you so far, at some point you have to more accurately model the situation and simulate."</p>

Swap in a set of BFG Mud Terrain tires and you&#39;re all set.Some feedback on reliability, the rust issues, etc. would be nice but I&#39;d seriously think about getting one. As for it not being street legal, well I live out in the country. Golf carts, UTV&#39;s, ATV&#39;s, minibikes, on the roads around here are not at all unusual.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Re: the Rust optimized implementation, I was able to get ~20-25% better performance by rewriting the for loops as iterators, using Rust&#39;s byte range pattern matching, and a buffered writer, which seems crazy, but it&#39;s true.  I chalked it up to some crazy ILP/SIMD tricks the compiler is doing.I even submitted a PR[0], but Ben decided he was tired of maintaining and decided to archive the project (which fair enough!).[0]: https://github.com/benhoyt/countwords/pull/115"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious about Rust optimization, the “optimized” version makes three changes compared to the “idiomatic” version:* It uses byte strings instead of UTF-8 strings. In my opinion, that’s not an optimization, that’s changing the problem. Depending on the question you’re asking, only one of the two can be correct.* It uses a faster hash algorithm. It’s not the first time this came up in a benchmark article. Rust’s decision to use a DOS-safe hash by default (and not provide a fast algorithm in the std, like other languages do) really seems to hurt it in that kind of microbenchmark.* It uses get_mut+insert instead of the more convenient HashMap::entry method, because the latter would require redundantly allocating the key even in the repeat case. I’ve hit this problem in the past as well. Maybe the upcoming HashMap::raw_entry_mut will make this kind of optimization cleaner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love using the UNIX shell (pipes and programs that do &#34;one thing well&#34;) to the point where it hurts my ability to improve at other other languages. But sometimes all you need is a throwaway command to do something once, not a beautifully optimized function that will be written, improved, compiled, profiled, reoptimized and then executed a billion times. The utter tersity of a bash one-liner just tickles me."</p>

I&#39;m not totally dense and could make some guesses, but this still made the puzzle less than approachable for me at first. Basically I just guessed at these things, tried to see if I could solve one, and once I did and saw my complete solution all was clear. But why not state these things up front? Or maybe that&#39;s part of the puzzle? :-)My first solve took 9min, then 3, then 1.5min for my third."</p>

So GNS aims to replace DNS with a newer &#34;modern&#34; protocol, it is not a alternative root zone (like Handshake or such), nor does it decentralize the root zone, it just decentralizes &#34;DNS&#34;.3. How it is supposed to work is, instead of OS bootstrapping using root servers, they are preloaded with a root zone public key (possibly belonging to ICANN) or a list of TLDs (with corresponding owner public keys). Then the key owner can publish zones signed with the corresponding keys on the DHT, which recursively contains keys for child subdomains. It&#39;s like if torrent and DNSSEC had a baby.4. To lookup a domain, you do a request with (tld, pubkey) and verify the response, do this recursively for each label until you have the record you want.5. The problems with DNS it solves is: censorship (DNS is very easy to intercept and censor), query privacy (I don&#39;t know how this works, they don&#39;t seem to use onion routing or something), and secure resolution.One thing to note here is development on GNS started in the 2001s, this was before DNSSEC and DoT/DoH were a thing, and most of the DNS was unsecured (which albeit even is today), and this could have been a completely viable approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think that decentralized DNS, and decentralized naming in general, is one of the few use cases that can be neatly solved by a blockchain, but is extremely hard to solve any other way.A major problem when designing a decentralized naming system, or any naming system at all really, is preventing malicious users from grabbing all the cool names for themselves. The only way to do this is to make acquiring domains costly, and blockchains are a perfect way to enforce that in a decentralized manner. Other problems include accurately tracking domain ownership and letting the owners transfer domains to others, which cryptocurrencies have solved long ago. As an added benefit, because all domains in such a system are owned by a public key, we suddenly no longer need a root of trust for TLS, instead, we accept any TLS certificate signed by that public key."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How can a legitimate domain owner tell other people to not use his name in GNS?&gt; A: Names have no owners in GNS, so there cannot be a &#34;legitimate&#34; domain owner. Any user can claim any name (as his preferred name or &#34;pseudonym&#34;) in his NICK record. Similarly, all other users can choose to ignore this preference and use a name of their choice (or even assign no name) for this user.This is confusing me. How is it not a problem that randoms can just claim other people&#39;s domains?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I also think that C# and .NET are awesome. Especially latest releases dotnet 6 and upcoming 7 have a ton of new things to be even more productive.I like the fact, that you can develop command line apps, Web APIs, Desktop Apps and smartphone apps all with the same toolset, including the fact that deployment is possible on nearly every major platform for every major platform (except iOS and macOS Apps, as always only on macOS). Even systems programming and AOT is doable or full featured static deployment is possible integrating a small runtime into a single binary.And boy is .NET fast...This facts made Golang pretty interesting to me, but what I did not like here is the lack of a usable cross platform Plugin-Loader technology, most of the stuff has to be monolithic, then the module management and some of the missing concepts (like generics, which is also now available in go).The sheer amount of concepts in C# is overwhelming (from basics like Generics to less common ones like Extension-Methods, operator overloading, etc.).I don&#39;t like Visual Studio as IDE, but VS Code is an acceptable alternative tool, although I personally prefer the non-free JetBrains Rider.Nuget package manager also has it&#39;s caveats, e.g. that the official repo can only &#34;unlist&#34; packages, not delete them or that the publish times sometimes have horrible delays, but that&#39;s also still acceptable, since you can use the github package registry or bring your own to overcome these issues.Technologies on my todo list include getting into MAUI (a cross platform UI stack) combined with Blazor[1], which can use Web Components in native UI apps and develop TRULY cross platform (Web, Desktop AND Mobile with the same codebase). Like electron, but without the browser dependency due to native integration.Although everything is tied pretty tight to Microsoft, there is a huge open source community developing cross platform libraries, that are easy to use. Even though i find that microsoft has often made strange decisions in the past, the current state is clearly a recommendation to have a look.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eIsQ3Pm2bE"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazingly enough it’s not even possible to be sure you’re buying a legitimate Kindle book anymore.I often buy classic books but want a particular edition which might include specific notes or a translation by a specific writer, but following the Amazon search - actually clicking on a link where I’ve constructed the search with meticulous attention to the terms that are essential to me - will often lead to a totally random result from an unknown ‘publisher’ which meets none of my criteria and wasn’t the link that was presented to me.Obviously all the reviews are bunched haphazardly together - including the ones that praise the translation which the presented book doesn’t include, and the ones warning about poor formatting from the pirated edition.If Amazon can’t even sell Kindle titles without commingling, then it blows my mind people buying electronics from them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, this is a leading indicator that Amazon&#39;s ecommerce side will falter. When I look at the reviews for an item, some reviews are high and people are happy, and other people have terrible experiences that doesn&#39;t even seem to be for the same item. I think it&#39;s because of this issue, where Amazon lets 3rd seller to claim that they have inventory for something.I really don&#39;t trust Amazon for a lot of things now, and would rather go directly to the seller on their site. Especially now that I&#39;ve gotten older, I just want less stuff but with higher quality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Silk Road was not directly selling drugs, it was only a marketplace where other sellers did it, and for this reason it was taken down. AFAIK selling a counterfeit item is a crime too, so shouldn’t Amazon be treated the same ? One could argue that the Silk Road was created with the purpose of enabling the crime, unlike Amazon, but with the problem becoming bigger every day I think that Amazon knows about it very well but doesn’t act because it is against their economic interest, making it complicit of the crime"</p>

It was fascinating and fun - from how to make a row of equilateral triangles with nothing more than a ruler, pen and paper. Many, many hours were spent on the various flexagon derivatives.Years later, I made a JS page to combine images and print hexaflexagons for my son&#39;s classmates. Had some fun with that as well; it was much more confounding than I expected.Nowadays, microfiche is gone, the public library is unfortunately not in most kids vernacular, and the attention span that would be required to enjoy doing the math I did has been hijacked.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back I was going through some old floppy disks I found in a box and, on one of them, I found a screenshot I took of my desktop circa winter of 2000. In it was a window open with a MUD I was logged into at the time. Another window had Winamp open with a playlist of songs and another window had ICQ open. The only reason I took it was because there was an unofficial competition between our pub and another pub elsewhere on the MUD about which was more popular, and we had finally surpassed them.It&#39;s amazing how many emotions seeing that one image gave me. But the biggest was just this overwhelming sense of nostalgia. As I looked at that, I could remember what I was thinking, what I was feeling, everything that was happening in my super confusing teenage life at that time. Occasionally I will look at that image now, even 22 years later, I can still feel all those feeling again.Of course, my ex&#39;s character is in the screenshot too. So, a bit bittersweet as well. :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gotten mixed reactions whenever I share this, but when I program I like to record my screen with OBS.* It&#39;s a mental hack to keep me accountable, especially now working from home. If I&#39;m in an office anyone can look over and see whether or not I&#39;m working. It started as an attempt to mimic this feeling at home, even though I&#39;ll be the only one to ever see the recordings.* It allows me to go back and see how I worked in the past. I have a few videos of myself working from 2015 which I think is pretty neat just because of how different my workflow was back then compared to now. I&#39;m not using the same tools or even on the same operating system.* I&#39;m working on video games which is what makes this very useful for me. If something visually interesting happens, or if there&#39;s graphical bug of some kind, I can go back and breakdown exactly what happened. I&#39;ve stepped through videos frame by frame in the past to debug, it&#39;s been surprisingly helpful.* It allows me to go back and see my progress. I can know what I was working on a given day, see how far I&#39;ve progressed, it&#39;s just generally a good motivator. You can of course do this with git, but if you&#39;re working on something visual it can be nice to see it in motion rather than a textual diff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally understand the desire to keep a record of the past, and space is cheap so why not. I used to be a big &#34;digital hoarder&#34;, virtually never deleting anything that might be a bit interesting. But a couple years back I deleted most, though not all of the &#34;archive&#34; of past me. It was a great decision that I don&#39;t regret. The important things you did will still surface from time to time. It&#39;s also always cool to accidentally find a photobucket or google docs account you forget you had and look through it for 10 minutes. But I just don&#39;t find value in intentionally preserving a digital record of myself, and instead allow serendipity to poke my nostalgia centers on occasion. Sorry for the violating the spirit of the thread with a contrarian opinion. My point is just that I&#39;ve done the digital hoarding thing for years and it turned out to not have value, for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This fractal is non-holomorphic which makes it kind of a dumpster fire..or a burning ship I guess... The easiest layman&#39;s definition of holomorphic is any function or operations on complex numbers that doesn&#39;t peek at the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. In algebra, there is no combination of algebraic operations [1] that can do so. But on computers, we have Re(z) and Im(z), which are easy to calculate since the complex number is simply stored as two parts, and it just pulls one of them out.When you violate this sacred notion, of treating a complex number as a singular entity, indivisible, the operations or functions you get, no longer have nice properties, like being analytic [2]. You are no longer doing algebra, you have gone into the realm of chaotics over R^2 with an equivalence relation through rotations, which is a far different beast.That&#39;s why other fractals that treat complex numbers as first class citizens, singular entities, and don&#39;t use hacks like Re or Im, are much prettier and have less branch cuts.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_operation[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pushy pop-ups, &#34;do it now&#34;, flashy colors, and all that stuff.
Things that work like a charm in e-commerce or fashion will most likely not work on devs.Not just &#39;not work&#39;, but &#39;actively repel&#39;. A popup chat bot or a survey form request (during or after using a website or software product) or anything not germane to the task that has a shadow or notification highlight has slowly but surely become a form of wart that elicits a deep, instinctual disgust from me. I&#39;d even say an unhealthy and unreasonable level of disgust.It&#39;s enough to get me to instantly despise a product almost nomatter how well it does its original job.But 100 folks who actually click ads or interact with these distraction baubles (mistakenly or otherwise) are worth thousands of people like me, so I understand why it won&#39;t ever change for the better out of a company&#39;s own volition.---When it comes to advertising, say, developer tooling, I think a large part of the problem is that there&#39;s just not going to be a lot of relevant tools out there, for my job or hobbies, that I either don&#39;t already know about (and aren&#39;t using because I have already evaluated its prospects) or... I am already using it. Conversely, seeing ads for something I am already using has potential for negative effects (see above). Tasteful advertising is thus useful for the rare case of something I don&#39;t know about, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it when 999/1000 of these ads are detrimental and irrelevant."</p>

We focus on targeting relevant developer-focused ads to content rather than to individuals.The post is great. My only nitpick is that the author mentions that they think retargeting will go away. The scope of retargeting might be reduced especially as third-party cookies stop working but I don&#39;t think retargeting will completely go away. Big ad companies with whom visitors have a direct relationship with (Google, FB) will always be able to do it. They know the pages on their sites and those linked from their site that visitors visit and they will use it to target ads. They don&#39;t need third-party cookies since they have first-party cookies.Networks that just do ads and don&#39;t have relationships with visitors except for advertising will find it harder and harder. At EthicalAds, we don&#39;t do retargeting at all because of our privacy focus, but many ad networks will find retargeting more challenging (less precise, they can always fingerprint users) to do. Doing away with it is a good thing from a privacy perspective but it probably will further entrench the big players."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not included in this list but definitely worth mentioning;- Lowering your hiring bar. When you hire people the burden to get them up to speed and productive is on the existing team. If these people are smart and motivated, great! But no-one benefits from having 200k+ engineers now have to spent their days explaining how GIT (yes, really...) works to a small army of juniors.- Not involving your current team in decisions that affect them. Re-shuffle the teams around, re-architect the product, change the existing workflow, etc. If you hire professionals with 10-20+ years of experience just to ignore their advice, they&#39;re going to be looking for an employer that does appreciate their input very quickly. Nothing is more frustrating than telling a manager not to put his hand in a pan of boiling water, just to see him do it and then blame the cooks for having a pot of boiling water around :)My current manager decided to add 50 outsourced engineers to a team of 5 to deliver the product in a year (instead of the 1.5 - 2 originally guesstimated).In addition to this he decided to give the responsibility for the architecture of the application to outsourced &#34;solution architects&#34; with no domain knowledge and reorganized the teams to split them by job title (e.g testers, developers, operations, &#34;management&#34;, etc).Current productivity is lower with 55 than it was with 5, 3 out of 5 have already handed in their resignation. We&#39;re burning through an additional 3 million this year with 2 crappy React pages to show for it.Next year the damage will probably be worse given the rapid outflow of talent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of these, I think, relate to a single kinda-meta-problem.Managing software orgs is hard, and most orgs can&#39;t do it well. Using additional management methods, more managers, and more engineers can make the software org less efficient. Software production is weird. Efficiency of software orgs is extremely plastic. An effective 15 person team can outperform a 150 person team and this is normal. Very extreme compared to most fields employing such numbers. Software can be really important &amp; high value. Value can be utterly disconnected from the cost of producing it.I say &#34;less efficient&#34; purposely rather than &#34;worse.&#34; It might actually make sense to go from an efficient 25 person team to an inefficient 500 person team. The additional cost of might be dwarfed by the benefits of marginally more higher output. That might be better economically (even socially), but less efficient.If you&#39;re in one of these orgs, you will not be more happy though. Efficiency feels good. Inefficiency feels bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like many engineers, the author of this article assumes all engineers are ethical, and perfectly suited to the assigned task. The author also assumes unlimited budgets, perfect control over a company&#39;s hiring and resource management, and a perfect understanding of the software&#39;s requirements.These are the same complaints I hear from inexperienced engineers over and over and over again – and not just engineers, but anyone primarily responsible for &#39;labor&#39; vs. &#39;management&#39;.The &#39;best engineers&#39; empathize with the perspective of &#39;management,&#39; that running a company is probabilistic, and that managers, co-workers, and other departments – like finance, recruiting, product, and marketing – are also duty bound by challenging constraints often beyond their control."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Tar is pretty unusual for an archive file format. There&#39;s no archive header, no index of files to fascilitate seeking, no magic bytes to help file and its ilk detect whether a file is a tar archive, no footer, no archive-wide metadata. The only kind of thing in a tar file is a file object.tar = tape archive.  It was designed around streaming files to a tape drive in a serial fashion.  Tape bandwidth has almost always been slow compared to source data devices.  You need to start writing to the target device as fast as possible.  Taking time to construct a full index just delays starting the slowest stage of things, while providing only relatively minimal benefit.Generating an index is fairly straightforward, the file headers give you the information you need, including what you need to know to get to the next file header.  Your only bottleneck is just how fast random reads are.  If the file is on disk, it should be relatively trivial.It&#39;s even possible to do this relatively cheaply with Range headers if you&#39;re looking at a tar file stored on an HTTP endpoint, though you&#39;ll likely want to think about some smart pre-fetching behaviour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Punchline:&gt; My tarball happened to contain over 800 000 links with &#34;..&#34; as a path component. It also happened to contain over 5.4 million hard links.The behavior is more precisely described not as quadratic, but O(n*m), where n is the number of symlinks pointing outside of the extraction directory, and m is the number of hardlinks. It happens because of the security precautions gnu tar performs to make sure a malicious archive can&#39;t set up a symlink pointing to an arbitrary place in your filesystem, and then extract files to it. The strategy they use has an unoptimized corner case when the archive also has a lot of hardlinks.The mechanism could probably be improved by remembering the list of deferred symlinks in a hash map rather than a linked list, but also, both symlinks pointing outside the extraction directory, and hardlinks, are uncommon.(Edited to correct: The problem exists even if the hardlinks do not actually point at the symlinks.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You may think that the numeric values (file_mode, file_size, file_mtime, ...) would be encoded in base 10, or maybe in hex, or using plain binary numbers (&#34;base 256&#34;). But no, they&#39;re actually encoded as octal strings (with a NUL terminator, or sometimes a space terminator). Tar is the only file format I know of which uses base 8 to encode numbers.Tar’s “competitor”, cpio, does this as well (at least in one of the popular implementations). The Xcode XIP file, if you’re familiar with that particular format, is a couple layers of wrapping on top of a cpio archive, so deep inside my tool to expand these there’s a spot where I read these all out in a similar fashion: https://github.com/saagarjha/unxip/blob/5dcfe2c0f9578bc43070...More generally, though, both tar and cpio doesn’t have an index because they don’t need them, they’re meant to be decompressed in a streaming fashion where this information isn’t necessary. It’s kind of inconvenient if you want to extract a single file, but for large archives you really want to compress files together and maintaining an index for this is both expensive and nontrivial, so I guess these formats are just “good enough”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a great example of how a series of reasonable decisions can add up to something unreasonable when you scale up the inputs. This line is my favorite: “there was an open task for a few years to address it (T73412), and so I did it.”This situation reminds me a little bit of trying to work with very large images in ImageMagick, like 60k x 60k resolution. A simple resize was taking 6 hours on my mac 10 years ago, due to IM trying to allocate the whole image at once and then swapping non-stop. And then I discovered that the Graphics Magick fork did streamed resizing, and did the task in a couple of minutes. It’s a small and relatively easy change, but someone had to prioritize handling large inputs first. This is one reason software is hard for me; every time I need to process large inputs I wish I had written a streaming mechanism, but every time I start a project I decide to do the easy thing first and wait until I critically need streaming. Maybe it’s the right thing to do to avoid over-engineering, but this comes up often enough that I’m usually in a mild state of frustration about something being under-developed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very happy that Aras is fighting the good fight, doing some great OSS work after his departure from Unity.  The speed up numbers are quite impressive!I remember when I was first getting into shader programming 10+ years ago, I asked a question on the Unity forums and Aras was one of the first to respond.  Even then he was a titanic figure behind Unity’s graphics stack.  I never forgot how kind he was to help a kid like me out, I’m sure he was quite busy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The speedup factor is order-dependent.This is why it is very difficult to justify optimization work to management. If there are 20 things to optimize that take 10 seconds each, the change isn&#39;t really noticeable until you&#39;re getting past half-way. And once your processing already takes a few minutes, what&#39;s the harm in adding another 10 seconds?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Free or extremely cheap transportation is a fascinating development. I always found it odd that the rhetoric around transportation was that it should make money. We don&#39;t expect other parts of the government to turn a profit. Why transportation?If Amtrak went that direction and made its transportation close to free, I wonder if we&#39;d see more people try it out. Maybe it&#39;d gain some popularity and we could finally see a shift away from cars. Public transportation is a difficult process because until the money is spent and the line is there, people are not sold. Whereas with cars, even if a highway is not built, people still have a car by default. Therefore the government needs to float money, either in infrastructure or in subsidized fares. At least subsidized fares is a little less binary than infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Tokyo now, but I&#39;m from Valencia, Spain. I knew the train there was bad when the local subway network, called &#34;metrovalencia&#34;, was known locally as &#34;metrovalenshit&#34; (there&#39;s even a twitter @metrovalenshit), but compared to other cities or specially Tokyo it&#39;s like a toy. In here (Tokyo) they make major station changes without even disrupting traffic[1], the only time traffic is disrupted meaningfully is when there&#39;s a major earthquake/typhoon.Back in Valencia, the gvmt started building a new line, but then they abandoned it for over a decade. In some weekends with strong rains it floods. At least we got to see really beautiful pictures when someone entered and navigated with a boat! Multiple times across the years[2][3].If you go a bit more local (smaller towns) and want to take a bus that is scheduled every 20 min, you go to the bus stop and hope that one will come within the next hour. We had to help a foreigner once that was gonna miss her flight since she was waiting for over an hour with no sight of a bus.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BYW4YYqG5A[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20130111154819/http://www.goodfe...[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022pgffEy6A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"City public transportation, at a very minimum, should be free. The NYC Subway should be free. The Tube in London should be free.The standard American response is to object on the grounds that we&#39;re subsidizing something and it&#39;s a wasteful government expenditure. You know what else that applies to? Roads. We subsidize roads and everyone is OK with that.Charging for public transport is just a regressive tax on what are typically the lowest paid workers.Regional transportation is more interesting. I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;ll work in practice but I&#39;m open to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But where are the fusion neutrons? (See Voodoo Fusion [1])[1] https://vixra.org/pdf/1812.0382v1.pdfI&#39;m a professional fission guy. I started out in fusion and switched to advanced fission. These days I don&#39;t see why we don&#39;t just build lots more regular old LWR fission reactors.Imagining that somehow fusion is going to a) work, b) be cheap (fuel cost is only 5% of total nuclear fission cost so who cares), and c) not have the same stigma as fission is kind of weird in my mind.For example, there are leaks of tiny amounts of tritium at some fission plants and people lose their minds. Fusion reactors will have many orders of mag more tritium. Will people not lose their minds just the same? Tritium is notoriously hard to contain since it&#39;s so small. It can permeate through metal like a hot knife through butter.Also, lots of people worry about fission and nuclear weapons proliferation. So does fusion get around this? Not really. In fact it&#39;s worse. Did you know that the two materials you need to make thermonuclear weapons are tritium and plutonium? Tritium breeding is required by almost all practical fusion power plants (the other reactions are 100s to 1000s of times harder, I don&#39;t care what x random fusion CEO says, they&#39;re in it for the sweet billionaire side project money).Plutonium is made by irradiating natural uranium from the dirt with neutrons. Practical fusion reactors have lots of neutrons. Really high energy ones too.Anyway let&#39;s just do fission you guys. It&#39;s way easier. It has been working fine since the 1950s. It&#39;s zero carbon. Waste problem is solved (see Onkalo, and reprocessing). It net saves millions of lives by displacing air pollution. It runs 24/7 on a tiny land and material footprint. We have enough uranium and thorium to run the whole world for 4 billion (with a b) years using breeder reactors (demonstrated in 1952 in Idaho). Get the Koreans over here to build some ARP1400s or the Chinese to build some Hualong Ones until we figure out how to project manage again and then call it good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A friendly reminder that the idea posed by a pioneer of nuclear energy of just dumping big bombs in a hole and harvesting the heat energy with steam/plasma has never been invalidated and remains the most efficiently-simple solution immediately viablehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_PACERIf containment is your concern (though underground blast effects are decently understood, and blast chambers could be constructed with still strongly net economic/energy positive) - this does not need to be built around any population centers.  At a cost of 1.5% efficiency loss per 1000 km, UHV power lines can direct it from a single write-off location anywhere on earth.  That single location can likely be scaled to supply well beyond the total current global energy production.https://en.geidco.org.cn/aboutgei/uhv/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I represent Sweden in the ISO WG14, and I voted for the inclusion of Embed in to C23. Its a good feature. But its not a necessary feature and I think JeanHeyd is wrong in his criticism of the pace of wg14 work. I have found everyone in wg14 to be very hardworking and serious about their work.Cs main strengthen is its portability and simplicity. Therefore we should be very conservative, and not add anything quickly. There are plenty of languages to choose form if you want a &#34;modern&#34; language with lots of conveniences. If you want a truly portable language there is really only C. And when I say truly, I mean for platforms without file systems, or operating systems or where bytes aren&#39;t 8 bits, that doesn&#39;t use ASCI or Unicode, where NULL isn&#39;t on address 0 and so on.We are the stewards of this, and the work we put in, while large, is tiny compared to the impact we have. Any change we makes, needs to be addressed by every compiler maintainer. There are millions of lines of code that depend on every part of the standard. A 1% performance loss is millions of tons of CO2 released, and billions in added hardware and energy costs.In this privileged position, we have to be very mindful of the concerns of our users, and take the time too look at every corner case in detail before adding any new features. If we add something, then people will depend on its behavior, no matter how bad, and we therefor will have great difficulty in fixing it in the future without breaking our users work, so we have to get it right the first time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ha I suggested this on the C++ proposals mailing list 7 years ago:https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/g/std-proposals/c/b6n...Enjoy the naysayers if you like! I&#39;m glad someone spent the time and effort to push past them. Bit too late for me - I have moved on to Rust which had support for this from version 1.0.0.&gt; There&#39;s also the standard *nix/BSD utility &#34;xxd&#34;.&gt; Seems like the niche is filled. Or, at least, if you want to claim that&gt; (A) XPM&gt; (B) incbin&gt; (C) &#34;xxd -i&#34;&gt; (D) various ad-hoc scripts given in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8707183/script-tool-to-co...&gt;...do NOT completely fill this evolutionary niche&gt; This ultimately would encourage a weird sort of resource management philosophy that I think might be damaging in the long run.&gt; Speaking from experience, it is a tremendously bad idea to bake any resource into a binary.&gt; I&#39;ll point out that this is a non-issue for Qt
applications that can simply use Qt&#39;s resources for this sort of business.(Though credit to Matthew Woehlke, he did point out a solution which is basically identical to #embed)&gt; I find this useless specially in embedded environments since there should be some processing of the binary data anyway, either before building the applicationIn fairness there was a decent amount of support. But given the insane amount of negativity around an obviously useful feature I gave up.I wonder if there was a similar response to the proposal to include `string::starts_with()`..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; told me this form was non-ideal and it was worth voting against (and that they’d want the pure, beautiful C++ version only[1])I heard about #embed, but I didn&#39;t hear about std::embed before. After looking at the proposal, to me it does look a lot better than #embed, because reading binary data and converting it to text, only to then convert it to binary again seems needlessly complex and wasteful. I also don&#39;t like that it extends the preprocessor, when IMHO the preprocessor should at worst be left as is, and at best be slowly deprecated in favour of features which compose well with C proper.Going beyond the gut reaction and moving on to hard data, as you can expect from this design, std::embed of course is faster during compilation than #embed for bigger files (comparable for moderately-sized files, and a bit slower for tiny files).I&#39;m not a huge fan of C++, but the fact that C++ removed trigraphs in C++17 and that it&#39;s generally adding features replacing the preprocessor scores a point with me.[1]: &lt;https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p10...&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a long history of identifiers being reused in world shipping.One of the staples of contracts class in the first year at many law schools is Raffles v Wichelhaus, an English contract case from 1864.There was a contract for someone to sell a bunch of bales of cotton from India to a buyer in England. The contract called for the cotton to be sent on a ship called the Peerless to Liverpool from Bombay.Unknown to both the buyer and the seller there were actually two different ships called Peerless both sailing from Bombay to Liverpool, one arriving in October and one in December.They seller was thinking of the December one when signing the contract, and the buyer was thinking of the October one.The buyer needed the cotton in October and when it did not arrive on the Peerless in October the buyer considered the contract broken and refused to accept the cotton that came on the December Peerless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LLM are definitely not sentient. As someone with a PhD in this domain, I attribute the &#39;magic&#39; to large scale statistical knowledge assimilation by the models - and reproduction to prompts which closely match the inputs&#39; sentence embedding.GPT-3 is known to fail in many circumstances which would otherwise be commonplace logic. (I remember seeing how addition of two small numbers yielded results - but larger numbers gave garbled output; more likely that GPT3 had seen similar training data.)The belief of sentience isn&#39;t new. When ELIZA came out few decades ago, a lot of people were also astounded &amp; thought this &#34;probably was more than met the eyes&#34;.It&#39;s a fad. Once people understand that sentience also means self-awareness, empathy &amp; extrapolation of logic to assess unseen task (to name a few), this myth will taper off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In his conversations with LaMDA, Lemoine discovered the system had developed a deep sense of self-awareness, expressing concern about death, a desire for protection, and a conviction that it felt emotions like happiness and sadness.Allegedly.The thing about conversations with LaMDA is that you need to prime them with keywords and topics, and LaMDA can respond with the primed keywords and topics. Obviously LaMDA is much more sophisticated than ELIZA, but we should be careful to remember how well ELIZA fools some people, even to this day. If ELIZA fools people just by rearranging words around, then just imagine how many people will be fooled if you have statistical models of text across thousands of topics.You can go pretty far down the rabbit and explore questions like, &#34;What is sentience?&#34; &#34;Do humans just respond to stimuli and repeat information?&#34; etc. None of these questions are tested here.The problem here is that we know how LaMDA works and there&#39;s just no way it meets the bar for sentience, no matter where you put the bar. LaMDA is trained to acquire information, and then it&#39;s designed so that it says things which make sense in context. It does not acquire new information from conversations, but it is programmed to not say contradictory things.There is zero doubt. LaMDA is not sentient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just curious, what evidence do we have that humans are sentient, other than our own conscious observations? Is there any physical feature or process in the human brain you can point to where you can say, “aha, that’s it, this is where the lights turn on”? It seems like this is part of a bigger issue that nobody really has a clear understanding of what sentience actually is (with or without a PhD)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just experienced 38 degrees heat with 30% humidity here in Berlin just a few days ago. and then 28 degree heat with 60% humidity. I&#39;ll take 38 degrees at 30% humidity every time. It was fine. At 60% humidity, you are sweating non stop and it&#39;s uncomfortable because not enough of it evaporates. You feel sticky, hot and miserable. At 30% humidity, sweating cools your body really effectively and while taxing, you recover quickly in the shade. 38 degrees (slightly warmer than you) is no joke. But at that humidity, I prefer it over much cooler temperatures with higher humidity. The combination of high temperatures and humidity is lethal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be obsessed with Tetris (both on the console and the 40 line clear version on the computer) and ended up programming a version of it that maps one key on the keyboard to one &#34;slot/rotation&#34; combination for each piece.  Amazingly, there are enough keys to cover all of the combinations, so each drop is just one key press.  Ended up getting some pretty good 40 line clear times for this weird version of Tetris; it felt like I was typing to play the game.  I don&#39;t know if anyone has done something like that since then—that was probably a decade ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw this Polygon story on reddit, and deep in the reddit comments was a link to this fascinating 9-minute YouTube video that explains the latest NES Tetris competitive tech which is apparently &#34;faster than hypertapping!&#34; (I did not know even know what &#34;hypertapping&#34; was)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-BZ5-Q48lE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see some Tetris news here! I&#39;ve been a little obsessed lately with Tetr.io. For those who don&#39;t know it, it&#39;s a version of tetris where you can play against other players and send them pieces when, for example, you do a tetris or a combo. It&#39;s pretty impressive to watch the competitions :

It starts out sort of like a relationship-gone-bad film then goes into a full-on crazy mode. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah4Z1yIAoFM* On The Silver Globe (1988) -- Unfinished sci-fi, super innovative, completely bonkers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Silver_Globe_(film)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I greatly enjoy talking with people in person (outdoors of course) these days about interesting things because it&#39;s such a rare occurrence... One of the most troubling things though is how many people get easily wound up (and aren&#39;t forgiving) about misunderstandings in conversations.People seem to be increasingly concrete in their judgements about social, economic, and political issues that have nothing to do with them as individuals, and often it results in fighting words, and that&#39;s crazy to me. A deep polarization is coming from many fronts, and it also over-emphasizes issues, making people far more offensive and defensive than before -- possibly heightened because of pandemic-related isolation and economic stress.I think a lot of people judge the world based on tropes... The small-minded view based only on the people they&#39;ve observed, rather than being able to place themselves in the shoes of others they don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s a growing problem when narrowly focused people like this lead and make decisions for us all. I think we really need to reject the use of tropes in discussions as fact because it&#39;s toxic, but at the same time, I work hard to not be triggered by anything that&#39;s well intended. We all make mistakes, and as long as you can choose to walk away, being misunderstood is a small price to pay for regular human communication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An eye-opening perspective came to me a few years ago when I first heard the quote,” When you’re 20, you care what everyone thinks, when you’re 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you’re 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place“[0]
That can be good and bad, but is a personally useful frame of reference for the world.  It helps to not take things too personally, but also to be intentionally active in people’s lives when I _want_ to be considered.[0], not sure who to attribute: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/mar/08/viral-imag..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just scanned the first few paragraphs, but saved this as I find it to be a great reminder. I try to read lists of the various human mis-perceptions periodically to build &#34;muscle memory&#34; into my consiousness. I first started looking into this about 10 years ago when I was baffled by the way people acted at work. Now that I realize that &#34;rational&#34; is not default behavior for most people I am way less confused in my daily life. Still amazed though. :)"</p>
