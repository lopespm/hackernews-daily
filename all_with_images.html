								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the result is a big relief, I think it&#39;s not as decisive as I&#39;m noticing some headlines (and commenters) are claiming.One of the big open questions is &#34;are APIs copyrightable?&#34; The court skirted that question, and instead focused on whether it was fair use:&gt; To decide no more than is necessary to resolve this case, the Court assumes for argument’s sake that the copied lines can be copyrighted, and focuses on whether Google’s use of those lines was a “fair use.”That said, this case does establish a precedent that if your copying of an API is primarily for purposes of matching an interface so that developers can reimplement it, you&#39;re in fair use territory:&gt; Google copied these lines not because of their creativity or beauty but because they would allow programmers to bring their skills to a new smartphone computing environment.I&#39;ll count that as a win, on balance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Google  copied  approximately  11,500 lines of declaring  code from the API,  which amounts to virtually all the declaring  code needed to call up hundreds  of different tasks.   Those 11,500  lines, however, are only  0.4 percent of the entire  API at issue, which consists  of 2.86 million total lines.  In considering “the amount and substantiality of the portion  used” in  this case, the 11,500 lines of code should be viewed as one small part of the  considerably  greater whole.   As  part of an interface, the copied lines of code are inextricably bound to  other lines of code that  are  accessed by  programmers.   Google copied  these lines not because of their creativity or  beauty  but because they would allow programmers  to bring  their  skills to a new smartphone computing  environment.&#34;Sanity prevailed! This judgment could have had devastating consequences and turned software development into a copyright nightmare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very sad. I found the perfect smartphone for me - the V20. It almost feels like a smartphone that happened by accident and will never return in its glorious form again. Dont know what else to use if it dies. Already have a spare Screen and its 4th Battery ready to be used.The second screen is just the perfect solution for having an allways on display without a real (and stupid) notch. I love this feature. Also knock to power on is super convenient. Battery is replacable. The Screen is super sharp. Its thin despite its very accessible inner parts. The amp and music quality is absolutely awesome. The camera is awesome as is the sound recording quality. The IR Blaster ist just super convenient. Also the FM-Radio is a very nice addition. The camera-app is just awesome and i have yet not managed to find something simmilar. Also i like the gallery app. And the sound recording app. Its also fast, has enough power still to this day. And the SD-Card Slot combined with the internal memory gives me 640GB Storage. Also Dual SIM is nice.Really it is such an awesome phone that im not sure how this phone happened in the first place. As each Smartphone does at least 2 things stupid or hase some dumb features no one asked for.Its allways the same with me - as soon as i find the absolute perfect hardware - its already legacy and nothing like it is buyable in the future ...The V20 is like the perfect tool. No stupid features only used for sales, no shortcuts, just a very nice package. Two things i would change: Cameras should never stick out and the volume buttons should be on the back like on the G4."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find most sad about this is that LG appears to be the only manufacturer who makes phones with both wireless charging and a headphone jack. Somehow these features seem to contradict themselfs for other manufacturers. Wireless charging is seen as a premium feature, while headphone jack is seen as a budget feature. I unfortunately have gotten so used to both that I don&#39;t want to give them up. I love my wired headphones and my phone is pretty much always at 80% (Battery limiter) since it always charges when I&#39;m at my desk. Right now I don&#39;t see a reason to upgrade my V30 but when that time comes I hope someone makes a similar phone (my biggest hope is Sony as they at least appear to be interested in headphones, now they just need to add wireless charging)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can only think of a few reasons that LG couldn&#39;t make it, and none of them are enough to sink a brand:* Lack of updates
* Occasionally non-flagship hardware
* That Nexus issue many years agoTheir UI is better than Samsung. They&#39;re less intrusive than samsung. Their flagships are usually pretty good and come at good discounts soon after release.I have an S21 now, and the number of bloatware samsung apps has me wanting to move back to Oneplus or even Apple, maybe. I only bought it because I wanted a flagship high-refresh phone under 6.5&#34;.I&#39;ll miss LG a bit, it isn&#39;t as if we need fewer competitors in the Android space. It&#39;s Chinese brands, Samsung, and Google now pretty much, no?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason why the Economist articles all read the same is that they go through a process called &#34;subbing&#34; or sub-editing by the same small group of editors who own the Economist&#39;s &#34;voice&#34;.I interned at the Economist one summer in college and wrote two articles for it - the published articles bore a small relationship to what I had submitted. The sub-editors seemed to be mostly George Smiley-type Oxford and Cambridge PhD&#39;s of a certain age with an eclectic range of expertises, as far as I recall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In high school, there were two magazines I’d read regularly: The Atlantic had an absurdly inexpensive subscription price (I think it was $14 for 2 years at the time) and The Economist was...not inexpensive, so I’d just pick up a copy when I was fortunate enough to visit a bookstore that carried it.The Economist was the only magazine in my life I would regularly read cover to cover. Every article revealed something I didn’t know about the world, or about my own country, and the information was dense. Most articles were just a few paragraphs, so I didn’t have time to get bored before I’d move on to the next one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect the writing in the Economist. It&#39;s kept to a high standard and they put their cases well with evidence as the article here highlights. Even the times I don&#39;t agree with their position, I still respect it.I wonder how much it helps that their writers are anonymous and therefore less likely to go on personal flights of fancy or building an argumentative approach. It is perhaps puts the individual writer on the backfoot but makes the quality of the publication higher. Personally I think other sources would do well to consider this - frankly I would rather be a fan of an idea than a writer: the former seems reasonable the latter likely to vere into pointless worship. Plus it&#39;s much easier to switch to new ideas if they&#39;re superceded by better ones in due course."</p>

I was motivated and so our Hydrology professor made me the TA for his Hydraulics class.He would give me questions with no answers to go through in my sections. The questions were damn hard and I would sometimes ask them on Yahoo! answers and this particular guy from India would always come and answer them meticulously and write integrals using unholy script like: int(a,b)Sin x dx and such and I would happily decode them for half an hour before trying to understand the solution.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Seem” is the key word here. I’d be fine if they stopped at the scenery, but this quote is just outright misleading and makes it look like a paid hype piece:&gt; “All aircraft have been reviewed with professional pilots who have many hours flying these aircraft or test pilots from the manufacturers to make sure they are controlled exactly like they should.” … In other words, when sim-pilots try to yank-and-bank an A320, they will get the exact same response as if they were flying the real thing.For contrast read some takes by professional pilots, here’s one[0]:&gt; I’ll confess that I don’t know that type of modelling FS2020 is using. But given how it feels, and how it’s the child of FSX, I’m inclined to think it’s using a lookup table. This isn’t necessarily a problem — a good lookup table with many data points could be just as good, if not better than, a blade-element model. Unfortunately, FS2020 doesn’t seem to have a good lookup table. The the linear behaviour unrealistic and the non-linear modelling is terrible.&gt; Maneuvering is laughably easy — and not because the aircraft handles nicely. It’s easy because the aircraft feels like it has no inertia. Yes, the real plane is very maneuverable and responsive, but there’s a “weight” to direction changes which is completely missing. In FS2020, you can instantly pull 60 degree or more turns, and exit them just as quickly. In XP11, there’s a residual tendency to turn that you have to arrest when exiting a maneuver.If you care about how the world looks, get MSFS. If you care about the physics of flying, get X-Plane—it’s an excellent project developed by a smaller company and sold for a fraction of the cost of Microsoft’s product. XP strives to provide the actual fine-grained simulation of flight surface behavior based on weight, shape, etc. (Yes, this means your computer will spend most of its resources simulating rather than painting a pretty picture.)If I had to draw a parallel, X-Plane is more or less the iRacing of flight sims, while MSFS2020 is closer to something like F1 2019.[0] https://medium.com/swlh/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-no-c...Bias statement: I own a copy of XP11, otherwise not affiliated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Netflix recorded a worldwide income tax accounting expense of about 13.7% last year ($438M on $3.2B of Net Income). It also paid cash taxes of $292M (cash taxes differ from accounting taxes because of timing issues - just like revenue is not the same as cash-in).A lot of growing companies have US taxes that are quite low because they lose money for a long time while they&#39;re investing in growth. When they finally become profitable, they&#39;re allowed to roll forward those losses (within limits) to offset their profits. That&#39;s where a lot of these &#34;Zero taxes paid&#34; headlines come from.On the other hand there is a legitimate gripe about using IP offshoring to shift profits to low-tax countries and out of the US, using accelerated depreciation to decrease current year profits, allowing tax deductibility of interest and lots and lots of tax deferrals and deductions for property transactions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is crazy how economy is tilted in favour of these big corporations. If you are a worker, it is not uncommon to pay over 40% of tax and if you work on your own small business you can pay even more and have very little left to reinvest. Then you have progressive tax that is preventing you from saving much - if you want to save for a deposit to buy a house, spend time on education and getting a better job, you&#39;ll get hit by much higher tax and it will take ages to save anything. Such taxes are often sold to the public as taxes on the rich, but rich people can easily afford ways around it. 
I&#39;ll vote for any party that will reshuffle the tax system, so that big corporations will have to pay tax just as any other business and tax progression will be removed, so that people will have a chance of levelling up.
They should also add a tax on spending money with offshore cards, dividends and so on so that the rich will pay what they are supposed to pay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Among the mechanisms Netflix is using to achieve its next-to-nothing tax liability are accelerated depreciation (which appears to have cut the company’s tax expense by $148 million); deductions for stock options for Netflix executives and other employees ($339 million); and research and development tax credits ($113 million).These are straightforward deductions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;By default, PostgreSQL listens on a TCP port 5432.This post seems to outright state that by default postgres is listening to everyone via TCP for connection.This is not true.Unless you edit pg_ident.conf, your postgres install will not listen for connections outside of on localhost. So, while it&#39;s correct to say that it listens to TCP port 5432, there is a very narrow limit to whom it&#39;s listening for. Namely, the same machine.Postgres is pretty secure by default. It doesn&#39;t allow external connections. It also requires a username and password to connect with permissions on the database you&#39;re connecting to.Compare that to something like redis. They at least used to listen for connections external by default and not even have a password to connect. I can imagine it&#39;s still very easy to find all kinds of interesting stuff snooping around on port 6379."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally secure my postgres instances by putting them in a silod vpc without internet access. I then limit incoming connections to only be allowed from the separate vpc containing the application serverI then use a bastion host when I need to access ssh on the instance. The bastion host remains off and inaccessible except for when I need to perform maintenance.The advantages of this is that there is no &#34;always-open&#34; access to the instance.Not sure why the author does not advocate this."</p>

Evaluating different options for my new website, I ended up just using what I&#39;m familiar with: raw, vanilla PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS. Eliminates the need for any faff like server management on my part; PHP-enabled hosting is cheap and easy. No frameworks, just PHP. Not that novel, I know.There&#39;s a stark difference in research and production in terms of output, for me. If I wanna get stuff done I have to think less in terms of the newest, coolest thing and just use the right tool for the job.Edit: Wrote some details on the design and implementation [1][1] https://hypertele.fi/ec997be8c5933e87"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Link with a bit more actual information: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5...As far as I can tell, what&#39;s going on here is that there are multiple stages of antibody development.  People have circulating B cells, and these cells have their genomes modified by the the VD(J) recombination process [0] from the  genome in the human germline (i.e. what your germline cells and most of the non-B cells in your body have).  There are a large number, but nowhere near infinite number, of B cells and corresponding antibodies that can be produced in this process, and I think these are what the authors call &#34;germline&#34; cells.Once a naive B cell decides that it encodes a useful antibody (which is a complicated process), it starts to divide.  Some of the daughter cells further mutate in a process called affinity maturation [1] to produce what are hopefully even better antibodies.I think that the idea behind this research is that there are certain antibodies that can be produced by affinity maturation that are very useful against HIV, but that the &#34;germline&#34; B cells that lead to these antibodies are not particularly likely to be selected by the immune system when exposed to natural HIV antigens.  Instead, the researchers have developed customized antigens intended to target specific germline cells which are known to be able to mature into cells that can produce the desired antibodies.  If this works, the next step would be a series of additional vaccines (which are not the same as dose 1) that will try to encourage maturation into the useful antibodies.The takeaway is that this result is very promising and that there is (so far?) no reason to expect the trial participants to be immune to HIV.For the ML crowd, another way to think about this is that, when your body is exposed to an antigen, it runs a massively parallel search algorithm to find good antibodies in a truly massive space of possible antibodies.  Unfortunately, most people, when exposed to real HIV or to prior vaccine attempts, get stuck in a bunch of not-fantastic local minima.  The idea is to specifically aim the search in the right direction so, after a few rounds, it can find a better solution.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V(D)J_recombination[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interested to hear from people in the know: how good does this look?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding is that many HIV vaccine candidates have showed promising Phase I results but so far they have all failed in later trials.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_vaccine_development lists five vaccines that made it to Phase 2-3 (and all failed). Two of them appeared to increase the risk of contracting HIV. The strongest candidate appears to have been ~30% effective."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is something really pleasing about reading PDFs. It’s perhaps how static it is and it won’t change on me. I can zoom in or “operate” on it without some reorganization. It puts the mind to ease. There is no reflowing. There is no columns shifting. It’s just is. Like a piece of paper as an analog - the intent of the author and the designer is retained and frozen in time. Fonts are embedded and chosen by the creator. Haters of PDFs do not understand the human aspects of it - they just see it as a specification (which is convoluted)."</p>

I delete most of the images first so that I end up with files of 50-500KB. I then store said file in appropriate labeled directories.Now 15 years later I have a private stash of websites and wikipedia articles that I can consult by simply pressing command+spacebar (the files are indexed in MacOS search).To make a PDF file out of a website I currently use Printfriendly.com, but it wasn&#39;t always this way.Back in the days I loved to use Arc90&#39;s Readability (a firefox extension). I don&#39;t know what happend to that extension though, there are plenty of old HN articles about that Wonderfull plug-in though:Post from 2010, probably I started using it right after finding this post...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What upsets and concerns me the most is when I see poorly developed SPA on really important sites.  For example, government service application websites.  If reddit or nytimes has a bloated, intermittently failing SPA site, that&#39;s an annoyance.  When it&#39;s a form to apply for unemployment, ACA health care, DMV, or other critical services, it&#39;s a critical failure.  Especially since these services are most often used by exactly the population most impacted by bloated SPA (they tend to have slow or unreliable internet and slow computers, maybe even a cheap android phone is all they have).Such sites should be using minimal or no JS.  These aren&#39;t meant to be pretty interactive sites, they need to be solid bulletproof sites so people can get critical services.  And I haven&#39;t even mentioned how SPA sites often lack any accessibility features (which is so much easier to implement if sticking to standard HTML+CSS and no/minimal JS)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to add a bit more nuance. Modern frontend development provides many opportunities for failure. These failures often make their way into production. I, personally, get great results with modern FE development. My users are happy. I am happy. It&#39;s all very successful. All the defenders of modern FE development will likely chime in with the same sentiment. I also get great results with C, which arguably provides even more catastrophic opportunities for failure. I wouldn&#39;t say &#34;C is a failure&#34;, but I absolutely hate working in C, and I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve made improvements to systems programming. I think the point I&#39;m moving toward is that we absolutely should strive to make better tools for delivering web content, but the reasons for failure are far more complex than the tooling itself. So, let&#39;s not frame things in black and white and call something that&#39;s been used with large amounts of success a failure. That&#39;s not very productive and is just flame bait. The real question is, &#34;What&#39;s next?&#34;, how are we going to improve the current situation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of my tweet, that is a personal opinion based on my feelings, background and experiences, the discussions in the replies are interesting from the POV of understanding what different people think in the programming community. Some will say that critiques are only from old people, in the style &#34;when I was young we had only zeroes! You now have ones and zeroes&#34;. Others say that the web is slow because of ADs and trackers and modern frameworks would otherwise be fast. There is who believes that the problem comes from big companies imposing new standards in order to turn the web into the new Java applets (a full fledged application platform), and so forth."</p>

The controller tries to connect 80/443 on different AWS IPs a lot more often, even without me navigating the web interface. Other than that, no ill effects. Device firmware update notifications are gone, just says &#34;up to date&#34; now.Interestingly, I still see the ad for their &#34;dream machine&#34; on the dashboard, as it seems to be baked into the controller.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“Sick building syndrome” is a difficult topic to discuss because it’s very difficult to prove a connection between the vague symptoms and the building. In many cases, only a single person seems susceptible to the claimed building issues. In this case, the apartment complex appears to have over 1,800 units, which makes it surprising that only a single person is experiencing such dramatic effects.Unfortunately, doubting these people’s stories is taboo online so I’m going to tread carefully. However, when only 1 unit out of 1800 apartments (presumably 2000-3000 total residents considering multi-bedroom units) is experiencing severe and dramatic symptoms, my first guess would not be the soil under the foundation. I would be looking for building materials or chemical spills in that specific apartment unit.Also, I’m not suggesting that we discount this person’s story. Their symptoms are certainly very real in that they are suffering, but the selfie of the person wearing medical equipment in front of a mirror combined with measurements from consumer devices as evidence should be approached with caution. There is a relatively new phenomenon casually known as Munchausen by Internet where some patients are drawn to the increasing attention they can garner by sharing, and unfortunately exaggerating, their stories on the internet. These patients often post selfies of themselves wearing medical equipment, in doctor’s offices, or in hospital beds. More commonly, typical patients prefer not to be photographed with medical equipment or in medical facilities.  Again, I’m not suggesting we disbelieve this person, but it’s important that we consider the bigger picture (1800 unit apartment complex, apparently only one case of severe symptoms?) before accepting a single person’s analysis of what is causing her issues.Mistaken “sick building syndrome” diagnoses can actually be very detrimental to patients who mistake other illnesses as being caused by their buildings, as they hyperfocus on their presumed explanation to the exclusion of following more typical diagnostic work ups that would help them eliminate more common explanations for those symptoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years back I signed a lease in a luxury apartment hi-rise in downtown Chicago. The complex had been an add-on to an existing shopping center and mall. Long story short, the apartment smelled like old grease and trash often, and I could never trace the exact source as it would come and go.
No matter how many air filtration units I installed, or odor absorbing devices, the odors would still collect and infiltrate my clothing and furniture. Again, it wasn&#39;t constant but regular enough for me not to stay there very often.I ended up caulking the entire apartment with clear caulk and sealing any air gaps. Because the hi-rise was pressurized like most hi-rises, I concluded somehow this was drawing up smells from grease traps etc. Of course I could never prove it.My conclusion is that most of these buildings are so cheaply and poorly made that I will never again rent a unit like this. Too bad I spent 30k on the lease and hardly ever stayed there.  So the woman&#39;s experience seems pretty plausible to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Can the legal system help?&gt; I reached out to environmental attorneys. It quickly became an issue that my lease agreement included litigation and class action waivers.This bullshit needs to stop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve never been an FB &#34;person&#34;, but maybe 6-7 years ago the local running club moved to scheduling everything on FB.  For a while, the page was &#34;public&#34;, but then you had to have an account (which required a phone number) to see anything other than the club&#39;s &#34;landing page&#34;.  So I ended up making an FB account which I&#39;ve only ever used to be able to see the club pages (I haven&#39;t ever posted anything!) -- dumb of me I know, but FB had almost become a requirement to participate in life.However recently, I&#39;ve noticed that I now get a couple of junk text every day or two whereas up until a few weeks ago, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever had a single junk text.I wonder if this is why."</p>

Most records contained name and gender, many also included DoB, location, relationship status and employer. 65% were already in @haveibeenpwned[4]&gt; If we look at the data, email is rare, DoB is rare so the greatest impact here is the phone numbers. Even though it’s “only” 20% of FB users, the number is obviously substantial thus so is the impact[5][1]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt[2]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378485999781613569[3]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378513457209696256[4]: https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/137855490210063565...[5]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378474534760685568"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, I&#39;m the tech lead of Cloudflare Workers.This article contains several misunderstandings.If a Cloudflare customer has configured their origin server to respond only to Cloudflare IPs, then they MUST also verify that the &#34;Host&#34; header on any request actually matches their domain name. If they do not verify the Host header, then anyone can sign up for Cloudflare and simply configure their DNS to point to the victim&#39;s origin IP address, and requests will be routed there -- but will have the attacker&#39;s domain in the Host header. Workers is not needed for such an attack. This attack has always been possible and is common to basically all CDNs. Fundamentally, the CDN has no way of knowing if the origin server that a user has configured really belongs to them -- the CDN can only tell the origin (via the Host header) what customer it thinks it is serving, and expect the origin not to accept requests that were on behalf of a different customer.Instead of IP-based authentication, we strongly recommend using mTLS-based authenticated origin pulls (with a zone-specific key pair) or Argo Tunnel, as these methods are much more secure.As long as the origin server is verifying via one of the above means (IP+host header, AOP, or Argo Tunnel) that the request was processed by Cloudflare on behalf of the customer&#39;s zone, then the attack described in the article doesn&#39;t accomplish anything. If a Worker makes a request to a hostname that is on Cloudflare, then all of the target host&#39;s Cloudflare security settings will apply to that request the same as if the request came from an external client.Additionally, as mentioned in the article, any requests coming from a Worker will have the CF-Worker header identifying the zone which sent the request. If a customer suspects abusive requests coming from Workers, they should report it to us.~~The article claims that the X-Forwarded-For header can be forged, but this is not true if the target host is itself a Cloudflare customer.~~EDIT: What I said about X-Forwarded-For seems to be incorrect. CF-Connecting-IP has always been the header we use to identify the client IP, and it cannot be forged. X-Forwarded-For seems to have more complicated and subtle behavior that I&#39;m not familiar with. I&#39;m investigating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a nice trick, with some automation you should be able to register new domain names and Cloudflare accounts to get past the 100k limit as well.Cloudflare&#39;s anti bot tooling is terribly annoying while using Tor. I understand why they do it, though. Using Tor is a good way to show how terrifyingly much control Cloudflare has over the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As you can see, X-FORWARDED-FOR can be set to an arbitrary value, so you can bypass IP limitation requests during scrapping or more dangerous IP verification during a login procedure … The origin IP is not forwarded to the website, so the only way to block this kind of request on your server is to filter on CF-WORKER header.X-Forwarded-For should always be treated as forged at least for security purposes (except the hops set by reverse proxies under your control). If you do IP whitelisting based on untrusted X-Forwarded-For you’re doing it terribly wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that really keeps annoying me about HaveIBeenPwned is the fact that I can enter anyone&#39;s email and get their status immediately. This way I can anonymously check if that email had an account at a breached site at the time of the breach. The obvious solution would be sending out a link via email before results can be looked up, but this might not be in HaveIBeenPwned&#39;s interest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s also the cheapest route to drive, as it&#39;s optimizing for lower fuel consumption:    With insights from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab, we’re building a new routing model that optimizes for lower fuel consumption based on factors like road incline and traffic congestion.

Provided that the few extra minutes aren&#39;t critical to one&#39;s wallet, it&#39;s a cost savings. For me those extra minutes are rarely critical. If I could, I&#39;d usually choose the lowest stress route! But I&#39;m definitely going to enjoy using this additional information."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The important paragraph that most people probably care about:    Soon, Google Maps will default to the route with the lowest carbon footprint when it has approximately the same ETA as the fastest route. In cases where the eco-friendly route could significantly increase your ETA, we’ll let you compare the relative CO2 impact between routes so you can choose. Always want the fastest route? That’s OK too — simply adjust your preferences in Settings."</p>

Malls probably the hardest of the three, but still pretty easy IMO. I&#39;ve never had any issue finding a gate or baggage claim at an airport, since there are signs every 10 feet or so."</p>

If the deficit reduces cognitive function, and I can&#39;t make it up with more sleep, does it follow that for every short nights sleep I will have a permanent reduction in cognitive function? If I turn my alarm off and let my body decide it makes me sleep for longer after a deficit, is my body wasting its time?It doesn&#39;t feel like this can be 100% true"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I mean, at this point I think everyone should just accept that at the very least their name, age, address(es), email(s), phone number(s) and screen name(s) have been fully leaked if you have ever had any kind of online presence. Not saying that&#39;s right or good, but at this point it&#39;s just a fact.So if that&#39;s the case, I think we should move beyond really even trying to think of this info as private or a marker of identity, and we need to move everyone to more secure forms of identity verification.As has been pointed out on HN before, &#34;identity theft&#34; is a made-up concept to make it seem as if you had something stolen from you, when the real problem is banks and other service providers do an absolute shit job of identity verification. They&#39;re the ones at fault, and they try to shift the onus onto you to fix things when they screw up.Indeed, a social security number is pretty much the only additional piece of data to the stuff above that one would need to open up a bank account in someone else&#39;s name, and those have been leaked plenty of times too.The government needs to make harsher penalties for banks and others that can ruin your credit, etc. because they accept all this leaked info as &#34;proof&#34; of identity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should start thinking of these breaches in terms of their accumulated impact. It&#39;s not the 1990s anymore, where data is difficult to store and networking too slow to move it.We should assume the leaked data doesn&#39;t go away; that instead people out there are consolidating Equifax data with Vastaamo data, adding data from Exchange hacks and the Accellion hack, to cross-reference with data from Facebook... it&#39;s like water flooding a levee now, instead of evaporating.Not the first time I&#39;ve harped here about this (ie: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26604753, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24586258), but I hope we start planning for that kind of future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The root of the problem is not the privacy policy or the system security.  The root of the problem is the collection itself.  All large businesses, health care providers, and governments maintain databases.  Every one of them will eventually be leaked.  All it takes is a corruptible trusted insider."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The world desperately needs a replacement for YAML.TOML is fine for configuration, but not an adequate solution for representing arbitrary data.JSON is a fine data exchange format, but is not particularly human-friendly, and is especially poor for editable content: Lacks comments, multi-line strings, is far too strict about unimportant syntax, etc.Jsonnet (a derivative of Google&#39;s internal configuration language) is very good, but has failed to reach widespread adoption.Cue is a newer Jsonnet-inspired language that ticks a lot of boxes for me (strict, schema support, human-readable, compact), but has not seen wide adoption.Protobuf has a JSON-like text format that&#39;s friendlier, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s widely adopted, and as I recall, it inherits a lot of Protobufisms.Dhall is interesting, but a bit too complex to replace YAML.Starlark is a neat language, but has the same problem as Dhall. It&#39;s essentially a stripped-down Python.Amazon Ion [1] is neat, but I&#39;ve not seen any adoption outside of AWS.NestedText [2] looks promising, but it&#39;s just a Python library.StrictYAML [3] is a nice attempt at cleaning up YAML. But we need a new language with wide adoption across many popular languages, and this is Python only.Any others?[1] https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/[2] https://nestedtext.org/[3] https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YAML had a worse example, once.For the ease of entering time units YAML 1.1 parsed any set of two digits, separated by colons, as a number in sexagesimal (base 60). So 1:11:00 would parse to the integer 4260, as in 1 hour and 11 minutes equals 4260 seconds.Now try plugging MAC addresses into that parser.The most annoying part is that the MAC addresses would only be mis-parsed if there were no hex digits in the string. Like the bug in this post, it could only be reproduced with specific values.Generally, if you&#39;re doing implicit typing, you need to keep the number of cases as low as possible, and preferably error out in case of ambiguity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is important to keep in mind when you read articles and/or studies about how electric cars or wind or solar power is impractical. A lot of the data these studies use is just obsolete.Say you have an opinion piece in a news paper that says that electric cars will always be expensive toys for the rich. It relies on a scientific paper published in a technical journal 2 years ago. The scientific paper does not perform original research but relies on a study published 2 years ago, which study relies on official data reported by companies six months before publication.Perhaps nobody in this propagation chain meant to mislead. But in the end they are using old data that assumes that battery costs are five times what they are in reality and twenty times what they will be in the near future (for example) and draws all the wrong conclusions.Similar things are happening with articles and public comments about renewable energy. There are numerous arguments about how we will always need coal power or nuclear power, or natural gas and they all base it on old studies with obsolete high costs of batteries. These articles commit a further error by also neglecting the every decreasing costs of solar and wind power. These articles are even more egregious because while a car lasts only 10-15 years a power plant is supposed to last at least 30 (for coal or gas) and up to 60 (for nuclear). Furthermore, nuclear plants take 5 to 10 years to even build. In those years the costs of batteries and renewables will only go down further.In the financial press there were many articles about how Tesla will never be profitable, how it is an extravagant way for shareholders to subsidize luxury car buyers, how it will always rely on government subsidies and will need more of them, etc. Well, guess what the federal tax credit expired and lo and behold tesla is profitable.They weren&#39;t necessarily lying. But they were using automotive industry assumptions, and the auto industry with their internal combustion engines is a mature industry with few opportunities for cost reductions. But as far as batteries and electric motors and power semiconductors go ... well we are just getting started on them and hopefully we will have many opportunities for cost reductions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s remarkable what energy dense batteries have enabled. Drones and the entire quadcopter scene wouldn’t be possible without them.Some maneuvers made on a 5” quad can pull more than 100 amps on a 6S, 22V battery. That is around 2,200 watts—more than most consumer microwave ovens! The fact that a battery weighing no more than half a kilogram can supply this much power almost instantly is truly remarkable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, the cost of individual cells has long, long gone below $100 per kWh in wholesale volumes.And believe the cost of a pack itself is very quickly approaching $100/kWh as well if not crossed it already.Making batteries is still a rather profitable business with double digit margins, it&#39;s just latest equipment, and cathode materials became way more expensive, and hard to get than what small battery makers can afford.Despite China dominating the metallic cobalt supply chain, the cathode materials market are dominated by Japanese chemical companies, and I suspect some form of collusion is there.With cathode being the most expensive part of the lithium battery cell, it&#39;s hard to fathom how a free market price for it can be many times the cost of input materials for years on end."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Preview is one of the most underrated pieces of software in the world today.I make the assumption that Quicklook uses Preview (because surely it must).Being able to hit spacebar on just about any kind of selected document/image type file and see a near instant look, multiple pages and all, is so important.  Once you don&#39;t have that (move to the Windows world), you realize how much you miss it.  And you can, with a small bit of effort, add capabilities for additional files such as Markdown.Being able to open a PDF or image in a fast, reliable native viewer, and even do some level of editing (such as quickly adding a signature!) is super useful.In terms of reliability, every time over the last 20 years (some distant, some recent) where I tried to live with a Linux desktop, things would stop working after a short while.  Meanwhile, I have lived on my 2014 MBP since 2014, going through multiple OS upgrades in place  - no wipes/reinstalls - and find it just as performant as ever.  It is in most use cases more performant than my 2017 _much_ higher spec Dell XPS 15 (in Windows or Linux boot mode).There are still some things I hate, #1 being that when I cmd-tab to a window which is minimized, it doesn&#39;t raise that window.  What is the f*cking point of cmd-tabbing to an application if you don&#39;t make its window visible!?  This I have never understood.  But generally speaking, macOS on Apple hardware is unmatched by any alternative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;apt-get was a revolution when it was released in 1998 and it is still the best way to manage software today. brew is a mediocre replacement.While apt still isn&#39;t the best package manager (my heart belongs to pacman, no matter what the haters say), I completely agree that brew is a failed imitation. I wanted to use MacOS for the longest time, because I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s a real &#34;Unix system&#34;. Brew has distilled my fears into a sobering reality. The &#34;advantages&#34; MacOS offers really comes down to eye-candy or slightly more consistent shortcut mapping, but none of this really matters to me when I can&#39;t use the software I want, and the OS is always second-guessing my authority. Maybe I&#39;ve been spoiled by Linux, but I don&#39;t understand the hype. Not even on my M1 Macbook Air."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From someone who tends to try this switch about once a year (because the lack of TLC the Mac was getting in the last 5 or so years was getting very very worrying - M1 feels like Apple actually care about the Mac again), I agree with a lot of these pain points. My biggest personal issues end up being (and these are super subjective!):- Preview on macOS is great and no other OS has anything remotely equivalent. First class PDF support, ability to easily annotate anything, makes basic PDF editing easy.- I&#39;m far too used to the macOS touchpad gestures, and emulating these on linux doesn&#39;t end up working well. There is an ongoing project for this but it&#39;s very Ubuntu-centric for now. I am hopeful this will help the whole ecosystem improve though! This is still a pain for me on a desktop because my work setup uses a touchpad as the pointer device.- it&#39;s nigh impossible to eliminate tearing on multimonitor setups with X11, and X11 doesn&#39;t support a mix of DPIs for displays without scaling tricks that make text look awful on the low-DPI displays. Wayland was promising here last time I tried, but Wayland itself still has a lot of rough edges for a desktop. Plus since last time I tried I have replaced my last low DPI monitor on my dev setup, so this ought to be a point I can ignore going forward :)- Finding a mail client I don&#39;t hate on linux is tricky. I&#39;ve never been able to get on with the console clients, and I actually quite like Mac Mail. Thunderbird is kinda okay.- My chosen password manager (1password) still has a fairly awful linux experience. This is getting better - they&#39;re producing a native app now. Said native app needs to support the local browser extensions though!- I like the various iCloud/multi device integration features for Apple OSes far too much. This is mostly relatively simple things, that produce disproportionate pain - eg cross-device copy+paste, browser tab syncing, bookmark syncing, etc. Yes, Firefox has Firefox Sync, and Chrome has it&#39;s own sync stuff too, but there&#39;s nothing as all-encompassing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Windows 95 is probably the oldest OS easily usable by young people. It&#39;s fascinating because:- It has established strong foundations about Windows UI. The Menu/Toolbar couple, scrollbars with a relative size, 3D buttons, start menu, toolbar...- The gap between Windows 3.1 (1992) and Windows 95 is insane.- It was beautifully coherent. Today, Windows 10 seems like a mess with different UI pieces from different universes: Modern UI, Windows Vista/7 era utilities, Windows XP/2003 config things and some older gems. Fun thing: open a Word document from a pendrive and unplug the pendrive, MS Word will show an error box from Win95 era, asking to insert the floppy in the drive.- When booting a VM or an old computer with classic Windows I feel &#34;at home&#34;. Our first family computer when I was a child was a Pentium II / Windows 98. I have strong reflexes with this kind of UI and I&#39;m faster with classic window and menus compared to my phone or a tablet with modern touch interface."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently I went through the attic and found an old laptop (120Mhz CPU, 32Mb RAM, low-RPM 810Mb HDD) with Win98 installed on in. To my amazement it could boot and start Excel and Word within 10sec. Compared to my workstation (20 cores + HT @ 2.5Ghz, 110Gb RAM, PCIe SSD) which takes upward of 40 sec to get to the desktop.Really makes one question the current state of software. Sure, Win7 has some more features, but imagine someone in 98 saying: &#34;we have a great idea for a new OS, it&#39;ll have more features than Win98 and it&#39;ll only take 4 times longer to boot if you are running it on a cluster of supercomputers, but those new features are gonna be worth it&#34; =PSidenote on the hardware side: The laptop had a hinge for the keyboard so you could raise it to a 20 degree angle, the CD/Floppy drive had the same connector as the battery so you could swap the drive for another battery if going on a trip. There were two sliding switches for backlight and speaker-volume. Access to the internals via a simple latch. It may have been a brick but it had interesting ideas.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ThinkPad_760"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The contrast and distinction between the different UI elements is immediately obvious. No mistaking a button for static text, and vice-versa. Also, no hidden scrollbars or other auto-hiding UI elements that are difficult to discover and irritating to use even once you know about them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Unfortunately, disabling uPnP these days is too much of a hit to convenience, so I looked for other solutions.Don&#39;t do this, there is no good reason to run UPNP if you care about security, turn it off and learn to manage a firewall.If the author really cares, go one step further and replace the ISP owned router with something with more control.Finally, if one cares about the software one&#39;s NAS runs, build or buy from someone like TrueNAS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article focuses on the security issues surrounding his new NAS, and that&#39;s fine. But the problem isn&#39;t security. It&#39;s Trust.Consumers generally trust that manufacturers will follow Best Practices and that security is part of the deal: I pay you money, you give me a quality product that Just Works and is Secure.False.Products are made to be sold at a profit. You can imagine that some engineer at that company knows about this problem, put in a Jira bug for it and since it didn&#39;t affect overall functionality, and because the product needed to be released as soon as possible, they rejected the bug and sent it off.By default, we should NOT trust that things are Good and Secure. If we are security conscious, then it&#39;s on us as consumers to figure out how to mitigate these problems. Or is it?If I was this guy, I&#39;d box that thing up and send it back and give the company feedback as to why, and then I&#39;d show them this very blog post.The manufacturer probably won&#39;t care. They know that until the average consumer cares about security and knows how to mitigate problems it won&#39;t matter. And we all know that the average consumer, even of technical products, has security habits.Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I need to go take care of some security stuff on my boxes, this really got me thinking about it!  sudo passwd root

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am using an unofficial build of LineageOS 14.1 on my 6 year old tablet (Mi PAD 1 &#39;mocha&#39;). After using it for over a month, the ROM is amazingly stable.The earlier MiUi which the tablet shipped with (7.5.2 Android KitKat) had problems with memory management. For some reason, the 2GB RAM was partitioned into two parts, one for the OS and the other for the running apps. But LineageOS does not have this problem, and it is much quicker than when I bought it!I use FDroid to install apps and am very satisfied with it. NewPipe is excellent and videos can easily play at 1080p 60fps when earlier, the tablet used to lag on 480p videos.I have changed the governor to powersave and turned on doze mode. Amazingly, this 6 year old tablet can hold charge for over a week! Even when watching videos at 1080p, the device does not heat up.More power to the LineageOS team and XDADevelopers!EDIT: ROM version"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Trends is telling me that &#34;peak modding&#34; for android was around 2014, and has steadily been decreasing since. [0]What happened since then? Are people more satisfied with stock ROMs and see less use for them? FWIW, my own phone is on LineageOS, and love the freedom it provides.[0] https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2009-11-01%202..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately, even if LOS supports my device (it does), it&#39;s not a viable solution anymore for me as a primary smartphone OS (even though I really appreciate some of its features -- used it for years on previous phones) due to SafetyNet.- Google Pay will stop working.
 - My banks&#39; (multiple) primary apps and pushTAN solutions will stop working.and that&#39;s two of the most important things I use my phone for nowadays. (Forced)  bank  MFA and payments. Also for voluntary MFA with andOTP of course, because I&#39;m not against MFA, just idiotic pushTANs.Ironically, devices which haven&#39;t had security fixes in 1 year (thanks for nothing, Sony) will also pass safetynet, and the mentioned apps&#39; vendors will still deem them &#34;secure&#34;.Android security past device release remains a joke. Solutions like LOS exist to keep devices running well past the pitiful life span OEMs allow for, but they have become unviable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d argue differently. Congrats for having the courage to recognize your problem.The analogy that comes to mind is I&#39;ve been playing basketball in my local town, and now I&#39;ve gotten promoted to play in the big city. I now feel like a small fish in a big pond.If you enjoy software engineering, I&#39;d say, double down. Now that you&#39;re at the medium software company, seek mentorship and coaching from others.In addition, there might be more homework (hitting the gym sort of), things you also have to do on your own.It isn&#39;t going to feel good being humbled and I&#39;ve been there myself. But if you think about the goal as &#34;learning to get better&#34; than &#34;prove to others I am better&#34;, you&#39;ll have a better time walking through this challenge. This all comes from a person who is a PM.So some tactical thoughts of possible advice: 
1. Face the issues head on -&gt; take all the negative feedback on the code and rework the medium complexity task
2. Learn to unlearn bad habits. Yes, it&#39;s harder, but it comes with practice. 
3. Commit to maybe taking a course work online (maybe seek advice from others on what are good ones to address weaknesses you have)Hope this helps.BTW, you don&#39;t need to be able to code things the right way to be a PM. Coding is only one specific skill and not always necessary for a PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You could be suffering from impostor syndrome. This is the feeling that someone gets when they are in a role but feel like they aren&#39;t living up to it and don&#39;t belong there, even though they may not be doing anything wrong.I also have 10+ years in software development and have switched companies several times. Every place is very different in terms of how their architecture is set up and what&#39;s expected in a software solution. I&#39;ve been at my current job for only about six months, but there are a lot of nuances and things that have thrown me off in implementing various features and fixes.In some cases, I&#39;d start questioning whether or not I&#39;m taking the right approach or if I&#39;m even the right one for the role. Though, some of these things I would bring up with my manager who would either give me advice on ways I could understand their setup better or would give me reassurance that there&#39;s nothing fundamentally wrong with what I&#39;ve been doing. I&#39;d suggest you talk to your manager, too, because I get the feeling that we&#39;re in the same boat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A long time ago, I described what I did as a programmer, and my friend said &#34;Oh, so you get paid to learn?&#34; I thought about it, and agreed. Part of programming is learning.Sounds like you&#39;ve got a great opportunity to learn what you don&#39;t yet know: you already have a list of things you know you need to work on, a codebase, and a job. Do you think one or more of your co-workers would be willing to give you feedback?  Would you be willing to take time (maybe extra time, &#39;off the clock&#39;) to practice?If, e.g., hard-coding is where you&#39;re at, maybe something like working your way through &#39;Code Complete&#39; would be of help, but I would pair the reading with doing, as close to the company&#39;s codebase and personnel as makes sense.I&#39;ve heard tell of people who asked to be shifted to a lower-level position so they could work at the level they were comfortable with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love tax law, honest to goodness, and the US&#39;s tax code is so fascinating. Regardless of the political/economic reasons why a tax law exists, so many of the rules are so oddly specific that upon reading them I find myself smiling trying to think of the situation that caused a specific law to be made.When I read these rules, I thought of a potentially amusing tax loophole with regards to the stolen property section:&gt;Stolen property. If you steal property, you must report its fair market value in your income in the year you steal it unless in the same year, you return it to its rightful owner.There&#39;s another rule[0] on the books that says interest-free loans to friends and family can have tax implications, but if your friend/family _steals_ the money from you and repays it later that year, they could potentially get a short-term, interest-free loan without incurring the tax implications. I&#39;d have to dig into the details to see if this would actually work out, but it&#39;s an entertaining thought exercise nonetheless.[0] https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7872"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A semi-related thing - in Poland there is a law stating that income from prostitution is not taxable.When some people tried to take advantage of that (to cover illegal income of other kind), they were audited to prove that the money actually comes from prostitution:- the family was asked whether the person was in fact a prostitute- the tax payer was asked to specify where the services were performed- if they said that these were performed at the client&#39;s flats, they were asked to specify the addresses (and names of clients) who might also be interviewed- if they said they did it from clubs and so on, the club owners were asked about it (and likely denied, as even if the people were in fact prostitutes, it is a criminal offense to profit from other people&#39;s prostitution)- if they said they did this at home, the neighbors were interviewed whether the prostitution did in fact take place at homeIn some cases they also rejected these income statements because based on the age and looks, the amount of money was much higher than the woman could have been paid.And if you appeal this decision, you&#39;ll likely get a court decision supporting the tax authority, saying that you are in fact an ugly prostitute and that you have to pay 75% taxes since the source of income was not determined."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep, if you&#39;re a drug dealer and you don&#39;t want them to get you on tax evasion, make sure you report it.Or really any cash income.  You don&#39;t have to tell them where it came from.  You just tell them you got cash.  Like when you do a garage sale and want to be legit, you report it in the same place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read this article in full, and I have to say: Amen. This subject has a deeply personal meaning for me.I watched my wife go through similar things. Her stomach stopped working, and even with groundbreaking surgery and one of the top 10 gastroenterologists in the world at her side, nothing could be done. She tried to get treatments that she thought might help, until one day her GP just down the road finally told her what no doctor had the guts to say out loud: &#34;you&#39;re dying.&#34;That was a punch in the guts. That was late November 2019. She&#39;d just turned 45. She went on hospice care just 4 months later. Hospice care was the best medical care she&#39;d ever received. Finally she was in less pain (but still a lot of pain- starving to death is the opposite of pleasant). Finally able to have one on one care with a nurse who genuinely cared about her.She passed away at home in February 2021 at 46 year old. Nobody tried to violently resuscitate her. Nobody stuck tubes in bad places. Nobody caused her more suffering in order to prolong her suffering. The green paper on the wall said so. One of my own biggest fears was having our home invaded by EMT&#39;s and police, with EMT&#39;s shattering her frail body to try to save it. But that never happened.So, doctors have it right. Die in peace the old fashioned way, if possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My Mom just passed two weeks ago from terminal cancer.The Monday ~2 weeks before she passed she was at the hospital, I asked her if this was all really what she wanted. She really wanted to change over to hospice and focus on palliative care.We began advocating for her to switch. She didn&#39;t have a ton of energy at the hospital to express/follow up on her wishes without someone there. The hospital seems like they would have erred on continuing treatment until all hope was exhausted. But once we began advocating for this want of her, the gears really shifted. She got all the morphine she wanted, and various other comfort measures. The palliative care team was driving the show. She was eventually able to go home for home hospice, and she had a final weekend of energy before passing Sunday before last.All to say, having an advocate that help you with your wishes when you&#39;re in a weakened state feels like it is pretty huge. I can&#39;t imagine what would have happened if me and my siblings weren&#39;t able to help her. She _might_ have been able to get what she wanted ultimately, but all the follow up, checking in, caretaking etc you really want to have someone there advocating for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh wow... you have just given me some sense of comfort after feeling like a moron for over two decades.When I was growing up, my dad had visited Seattle and came back from the trip with a box of Microsoft Coffee. He claimed to have gotten it from a store called Egg-Head’s Software or Egghead Computing or something like that. (EDIT: Upon reading the full article it seems to have been Egghead Software.)I took it to my computer club and was laughed out of the room for it being fake. I believe he still has it somewhere, in storage...Needless to say, I have some friends to email given that I’ve been the victim of “my uncle works at Nintendo” style teasing about this for years."</p>

I joined Microsoft in 1997 but unfortunately I cannot confirm the story, I never heard this story before, but it doesn&#39;t surprise me, we had a lot of fun back then with all kinds of pranks, and Easter eggs, until one day it was all suddenly stopped, ship an Easter egg and get fired was what they told us.  That was a very sad day.  I can confirm that Microsoft was doing things with Java back then, I worked in an XML parser written in Java when I first joined Microsoft."</p>

Nice to see someone using the access for something cool.One of the reasons I decided to add it there was to give some visibility to this &#34;feature&#34; of EG-25G FW to people interested enough to look at dmesg."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"According to this[0] which is a neat read anyway, it &#34;has 256 MiB DRAM, 256 MiB NAND, and a single Cortex-A7 CPU clocked up to 1.3GHz.&#34;You can run DNS, a VPN, or a small web server even on a VPS with 32MB of RAM so those are pretty cool specs.[0] https://xnux.eu/devices/feature/modem-pp.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These modems are way powerful. This reinforces the need of open source firmware for them. They run their own OS and can stay on independent of the rest of the hardware consuming very little power. Imagine putting your computer to sleep while downloads continue and can survive geographical network migration.A fully open source firmware for GPS/LTE modem is badly needed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, man. The idea that TextEdit automatically parsed .txt files as HTML if they started with a certain file signature is problematic......but the fact that file:// schemes can access remote files by appending /net/ followed by a domain name is pretty shocking.I mean, the entire purpose of &#34;file://&#34; would seem to be to provide access to local/mounted files and only those.The fact that a Mac engineer thought it would be a great &#34;feature&#34; to allow file:// to access the entire internet is... kinda terrifying. Did that get patched, or was it only TextEdit?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two words: excessive complexity.It&#39;s always seemed strange that an application called TextEdit is actually more than a text editor. I strongly believe that content-type autodetection, much less HTML rendering(!), most certainly does not belong in a text editor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"File extensions are a kludge anyway. (And Windows 10 still hides them by default, because hey, backwards compatibility, and you wouldn&#39;t want to confuse Grandma who&#39;s seen the file be called &#34;grandkids&#34; since Windows 95..).Why should the filetype be dependent on the name? People even think renaming a .BMP to .JPG means now it&#39;s a compressed file!Old school Macs stored the filetype outside of a file, so you can rename the file &#34;grandkids.mp4&#34; and double-clicking it would still open it in the image viewer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope that the federal government can provide incentives to keep reactors running that would otherwise close prematurely.5.1 gigawatts of American reactors are expected to retire this year: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46436It&#39;s a shame that the US is retiring working reactors while still burning fossil fuels for electricity. Reactors are far safer and cleaner than fossil electric generation. It&#39;s mostly the low price of natural gas that is driving these early retirements. Low gas prices have also retired a lot of coal usage -- which is good! -- but we&#39;d make more climate progress if those low prices didn&#39;t also threaten nuclear generation.Some states like New York already provided incentives to keep reactors running for climate reasons:https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=41534Federal policy could be more comprehensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nuclear energy is the Amiga of energy sources.Ahead of its time, it was unjustly rejected and persecuted by the ignorant masses. Its advocates are bonded by the quiet pride that at least they weren&#39;t unthinkingly siding with those masses. (And they&#39;re right!) Meanwhile, as the Amiga stagnated for terribly unfair reasons, other, scrappier technologies like the i386 and UMG-Si grew from being worthless boondoggles (except in special circumstances, like spaceflight) to being actually far better and cheaper. But the Amiga advocates keep the faith, sharing their suffering and resentment. They inevitably try the alternatives a little and perhaps even start to like them. Gradually their denial recedes, decade by decade.But they know that however much fab costs go down and leave their beloved Amiga behind in the dust, you&#39;ll never be able to run nuclear submarines and Antarctic research stations on solar panels.— ⁂ —Wind, where available, undercut the cost of steam power (including nuclear and coal) a decade ago, and PV undercut it in equatorial parts of the world about four years ago, or in even more of the world if you don&#39;t include storage.  As a result, last year, China, whose electrical consumption has doubled in the last decade, built 48.2 gigawatts† of new photovoltaic capacity last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-climatechang... but only has, I think, something like 10 GW of nuclear plants under construction, scheduled to come online over the next several years.  PV installed capacity in China is growing by 23% per year, the same rate it has been growing worldwide for the last few years; with some luck that will return to the 39%-yearly-worldwide-growth trend that has been the fairly consistent average over the last 28 years.‡(A previous version was posted at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26218673.)______† China&#39;s PV capacity factor seems to be only about 13%, so those 48 GWp probably work out to only about 6 GW average.  It would be nice if China managed to site its new PV plants in places that could provide a capacity factor like California&#39;s 28%.‡ Why 28?  Because I haven&#39;t found figures yet on what worldwide installed capacity was in 01992 or earlier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a convert. I was anti-nuclear power, now I am pro with a boatload of caveats.As a person who changed their mind, let me offer this advice to the people commenting here. Don&#39;t pretend there aren&#39;t legitimate concerns with nuclear power. Accidents did in fact happen and, given enough time and more reactors, will absolutely happen again. That&#39;s not a reason not to build more nuclear power, but let&#39;s not play make-believe about it. Don&#39;t pretend that just because we are better at handling nuclear waste it is a solved problem. It isn&#39;t. A hundred-fold increase in nuclear power generation would be a roughly hundred-fold increase in nuclear waste that must be stored away from all life for several hundred years (until we develop technology to resolve the issue, likely long after we&#39;re all dead). And maybe most importantly, acknowledge that nuclear energy is far more expensive than other green energy options and, even if we could drive down the cost, it will not solve all our problems. It is, at best, a big part of the solution, not &#34;the&#34; solution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this is supposed to be a joke, but I feel like it&#39;s too close to reality to be funny.I recently ordered a custom tailored set of shirt, trousers, and belt. Their site was bragging about their great AI technology, but sadly I didn&#39;t notice that red flag early enough.The results were nothing short of disastrous. I sent in my measurements and they sent me a trouser with wrong measurements and a postcard that said that they adjusted my measurements with AI for a better fit. The belt they included was a completely different size than the trouser and I&#39;m still waiting for the shirt to arrive. And now I&#39;m fighting the usual uphill battle to talk to a human and get this mess fixed or get a refund.The core of Stitchfix is personalization, as they say. But that means an individual solution for each individual customer, and not AI for memorizing generic trends in a huge dataset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m sad this is an April fools joke because a lot of the sentiment rings true and I love the slogan “move slow and make things.”Artisans make beautiful things and software artisans make beautiful software, but it’s hard to do it and still be a viable business.And artisans moving slowly isn’t arbitrary. They move slow on the things that matter. The things that shine when attention was paid to the details."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it’s an april fools joke. But I’ve recently “discovered” why this is nevertheless very true. If you move slow, you have a higher chance of meeting the right customer, of actually allowing your idea to grow and improve over time. Without being locked into it in one form or another. Moving slow allows you to work on it as a side project first. Which means no financial stress.And then making things. To me this means no paper prototyping. Not selling people on your idea without having anything tangible. Some may call it smart. To me it feels like gambling with your believability / integrity. There are only so many times you can do this before people get tired of you and your stories / dreams / business ideas. Just make something, show it to people when it’s actually useful. And feel good about actually having made something people liked. Instead of selling something people liked and then suffer the feeling of non-stop pressure, constantly _not_ being where you’ve told others you are.Happy april fools :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I distinctively remember buying my first blue LED in what must have been the mid-90s. I simply walked into an electronic parts store and bought a single spare LED. I don&#39;t think I had ever seen a blue LED in action before, it was completely new to me, so I was very curious.It was of the very common standard shape and size LEDs were during that time, and its case was colorless but cloudy, not clear. A good thing, because that meant the LED would emit its light along the entire casing, not just straight forward, making it much easier to look at. It also wasn&#39;t much brighter than other LEDs, that came later.When I applied power and saw it shining in that beautiful blue color, I was positively amazed. This was so much cooler and so much more beautiful than the red, green, and yellow LEDs I had been using before. I distinctively remember just leaving it attached to power, sitting on my desk, just for something nice to look at."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh, I remember when blue LEDs became readily available (late 90s for me) and I would mod all my stuff to blue.Had this MS ergo keyboard, with the LEDs in the middle hump, came with green.  So, I replaced with these 2.5 hi-blues and I was blinded by my own Numlock-Beam.  Had to cross a resistor over there to take the edge off.Anyway, I think HN should get a black-bar because the blue LED is so cool."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fact an article like this exists speaks to how bad the keyboard shortcuts for tools like tmux are. It shouldn&#39;t be revolutionary to use basic features of a program.I&#39;m a huge fan of a command window, where you type words to do a fuzzy search of all the commands in a program.Sublime text and jetbrains products have it down so well to the point of me not needing to memorize key shortcuts. I just have to remember the first few letters and I&#39;m good to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using the tmux vi keybindings to copy and paste between panes is great if you haven&#39;t tried it.This copy/paste workflow is really nice for working with kubernetes on the command line.E.g., imagine that you need to delete a kubernetes pod.You&#39;d run a few commands like this:1. `kubectl get pods`2. Find the pod id, and copy it using mouse &amp; some shortcut3. `kubectl delete pod &lt;pasted-pod-id&gt;`Instead of this mouse workflow, you could do something like this in tmux:1. `kubectl get pods`2. Find pod id, `Ctrl+b [` to enter tmux&#39;s vi selection mode3. Navigate to the section you&#39;d like to copy; e.g. `k6ww` (up six lines and over two words, for example)4. Press space bar to start selection, and use common vim movements to highlight what you&#39;d like to copy (e.g. w or $)5. Press return/enter to copy the selection6. This text can be pasted with either Cmd/Ctrl+v (it gets copied to the system clipboard for me on macOS 11.2.1 with tmux 3.1c_1 from brew), or using the default tmux shortcut `Ctrl+b ]`. So that would allow you to type `kubectl delete pod Ctrl+b ]`.So yeah, it&#39;s a few more steps, but it&#39;s a lot faster for me.These are the relevant sections of my ~/.tmux.conf file:  # Use vim keybindings in copy mode
  setw -g mode-keys vi

  # Use emacs keybindings in the status bar
  set -g status-keys emacs

(I mention the `set -g status-keys emacs` config line just as an FYI since it&#39;s been really helpful for me with tmux. I&#39;ve never liked using readline-type inputs with vi-mode.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, copy/paste is a weakness of a workflow using tmux.With tmux you end up with four distinct copy/paste buffers: the OS, tmux, the shell, vi/emacs. You do get used to the mental gymnastic of juggling all those but it&#39;s not ideal.Same goes with managing the windows of the OS, tmux and vi/emacs."</p>

When you look at how many other languages have faltered and lost momentum due to transition issues (Perl 6, Python 2/3), it really shows have difficult of a task it is.Progress can seem glacially slow at times - it’s always disappointing to see your favorite upcoming feature get pushed to a later release - but the current language is undeniably light years better than what we started with.Respect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the primary features I&#39;m holding out hope for eventually making it into the language is ValueTypes: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html and the current Valhalla Project: https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/valhalla/MainThe simplest example of why this would be valuable (edit: this was not an intentional pun), the Optional type could become stack based, such that you could ensure that the variable referring to the Optional type is never null. This would help reduce a common class of bugs in Java code stemming from NPE&#39;s."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There were days on the internet when a car analogy was appreciated -- let me try here.Suppose there was a rally driver who would claim that rally cars could go much faster if they were always driven in reverse. He did some rudimentary experiments and might have found a significant improvement. The general public and other racing drivers, who in my analogy can all be wonderful people but happen to know little about the mechanics of cars, are naturally enthusiastic: a potential breakthrough in driving! But clearly we need more experiments. So other rally drivers get to work: they set up an elaborate system with ropes and pulleys so they can reverse the driver&#39;s position in the car and run a car as fast as they can, but in reverse, on a test track. What do they find? Sadly, their answer is somewhat inconclusive, probably negative, but perhaps the test track had many bends. So they would like to repeat the experiment on a track with a few more straight segments: they write grant proposals, build a track, and plan other test runs... and all the time their progress is eagerly followed by the general public.Now suppose you are a car mechanic in all this. What are you to do? This cannot work! It flies completely in the face of the way cars are set up, not to speak of the disadvantages in air flow. So you can loudly dismiss the claim as preposterous early on, but then you will be called a pessimist and the public point out that at least the rally drivers are trying something new - what the bleep have you been doing all this time? So you just wait the whole thing out, see it come... and go.I guess I should at least be happy that I did not buy any shares in EnDrive Inc?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For everyone that’s expressing a view like “what a waste of time”, consider this. This hypothesis was by a respected scientist. The experiments have been done by lots of labs. There has been a reasonable position the skeptics have taken throughout. It still has taken a very long time of a bunch of smart people on how to build an experiment to rule these kinds of things out. That means theories have tighter bounds. Technology has been improved in the area which can have knock on beneficial educational and technological effects, etc. Being able to quickly and efficiently rule out hypotheses is a hallmark of the area that science shines in. Being able to say “no, definitely not” with very good certainty is a useful thing to this disciplines toolbelt. From that perspective it’s a pure win and worth any distraction on the scale of all human investment globally."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I placed an order for their previous model, they assured me that I should get it 4 - 8 weeks. After I didn&#39;t get anything for 6 months I messaged them that I want to withdraw my order (the phone had already old hardware during release, and it was a year old when I ordered it, but at the same time it cost as much as a high end phone). I got no response from them. I then contacted my credit card company and they charged back.It sucks, because, I would really love phone with a hardware keyboard. I would place an order, but am afraid of the same thing happening again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still consider my old Nokia E70[0] my favorite phone of all time, so I am definitely in the target demographic for this, as I&#39;m 100% sold on the usefulness of a physical keyboard on a phone... However the CPU just doesn&#39;t match the &#34;pro&#34; branding, or the price range. I&#39;d personally rather throw an extra $200-300 on top to get a flagship CPU and then it would be close to a perfect phone for me! As it currently is, the Snapdragon 662 shipped in the pro-1x gets blown away by my current Pixel 5&#39;s Snapdragon 765G - and Pixel phones recently have been generally characterized as having &#34;above-average hardware specs but not enough to justify flagship prices&#34;.Separately, I am also curious for a phone like this that could run Android, LineageOS, and Ubuntu Touch - are there &#34;dual boot&#34; options in the mobile space? With 256GB storage it seems like it should be possible. I&#39;d like to have old reliable Android as a daily driver, but maybe periodically drop into a less stable but more flexible environment like ubuntu.[0]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E70"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s no free lunch, and it&#39;s easy to overlook the compromises involved in the devices that used to have physical keyboards. By modern standards, blackberrys had a woefully small screen and phones with slideout keyboards were very fat. This device doesn&#39;t look fat which suggests to me that the compromise might be either battery life or low processor power.That said, although this is definitely not for me, it&#39;s generally good for the market to have some devices that are genuinely different rather than just another &#34;me too&#34; Samsung/iphone lookalike."</p>

I guess if we get another wave very soon, maybe it could persist. But it just seems like this is on its way out between organic immunity and vaccine immunity (especially because the latter was focused on the vulnerable).I&#39;m not an expert, so don&#39;t take this as advice to go coughing on everyone. But we all have to make some decisions based on imperfect information and it seems like covid is nearly knocked out.There is some concern over another wave, but it might just be minor cases from unvaccinated young people. That hopefully won&#39;t lead to a lot more deaths."</p>

https://youtu.be/K3odScka55AFrom what we know so far, any of the approved vaccines are excellent and no one knows for sure if one is better than the other. The only logical thing to do is get what is offered to you as soon as possible.That being said, this is excellent news that Pfizer is protective against the SA Variant.

The article seems to suggest it&#39;s the latter, but it seems somewhat ambiguous. Does this term have a specific definition in epidemiology that journalists and pharma marketers assume everyone understands what kind of &#34;effectiveness&#34; they&#39;re talking about?"</p>

Now, Outlook - at least all configurations I have seen, has pictures via HTML disabled. I have sampled a few IT departments only, of course, but I feel like this is probably a pretty common policy.So let me tell you:Your picture banners, your &#34;rounded corner buttons&#34;, your main engagement centerpiece that&#39;s just a picture ... 
it all ends up being one of those nice 90&#39;s type beveled empty box we remember from surfing with IE and ISDN.This may be a shock, but it really doesn&#39;t make your important newsletter look any better. So, if you are not specifically going for nostalgic &#34;bad modem connection&#34; look and feel, maybe ease off the HTML pictures a bit, okay?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is desktop software, why is there a monthly fee?I occasionally want to send “nice looking” emails but get asked by lots of comms people about it. Recommending a monthly fee service is a non starter, but buying some software is pretty easy to decide. “Should I pay once? Or pay forever?”Is there anything in the functionality that takes advantage of SaaS? Other than updates and whatnot?Of course the price/value computation is up to y’all and your customers but office365 only costs $10/month. Seems tough to value authoring email as higher value than cloud productivity suite.It would be nice if there was a way people like me could use since our competition is an outlook template but still scale up to people who may do this all the time and be willing to pay $20+/month."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HTML in email is legacy hell. I wonder if someone wants to create a new MIME-type like text/html+css, and clients who want can implement it.In theory you could have representations of the message like video/mpeg4 and text/plain, and depending on the client capabilities and configuration, the receiver could watch a video or read plain text. The information content of the 2 (or more) don&#39;t even have to be the same! Found this out when trying to parse text out of emails into a CRM system, another system sent information in the HTML part, but an empty plaintext part."</p>

Nope, most of their exec layer is a bunch of people who cut their teeth the industry in the 90&#39;s, and are operating within a thick fog of local workplace politics. I guarantee that behind this move is an executive who believes that developers need to be physically colocated to be productive, because that&#39;s how it worked when he was coming up at WordPerfect or whatever. Backing it is also a group of people who have a lot to gain from it politically.At my employer we have some  pockets of embarrassing leadership like this, but thankfully I haven&#39;t seen it in anyone senior enough to make global policy like this.  My department is letting go of remote teams and only hiring in a handful of cities around the world, while ramping up office space spending. It&#39;s more expensive, less flexible, and less productive... and everyone knows it. But I guess it makes some people feel important, and it&#39;s how some others remember developing when they last did it 20 years ago. So it&#39;s happening anyway, and many of their best engineers are now on the market."</p>

I outspend you by 10x per head in my home office, and everything there is to my exact specification. The whole field of modern office design should be a discredited pseudoscience; management is addicted to it because of the real estate crisis though.This is also kind of terrible, because a lot of people use FAANG as their North star for every policy decision.“Well Google use primary colours in their logo, Brian”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been working remotely for decades.Most people can&#39;t work remotely and productively because they are not trained to do so. E.g. You are in your office (inside your home) and your wife, your dog or child enters it demanding you do some kind of non important issue right now, distracting you from your work.You need to be trained to not them let them distract you. The people living in your house need to be trained as well on what to do.The training for working in the(external) Office started at school, from a time fiber optics telecommunications were unheard for common mortals.Most people feel alone because they lack the social skills to make friends outside work, or just lack the initiative, knowledge and internal motivation to work without external pressure and supervision.The companies that will solve this issue at big scale in the future are those that solve it because the they have to in order to survive(against established companies). It will be a startup that faces all the risks involved, not an established company like Google or Facebook.It will not be companies that could pay millions for people living in ultra expensive places and are already making big bucks doing that. They don&#39;t need to change because the system already works for them."</p>

But it was already leaked through  a different hack at a health insurance provider in any case.It should be clear by now that as long as the data is stored somewhere it is at risk of being leaked. It doesn&#39;t matter how secure you think your tech stack is. Improving tech is not the solution. Here&#39;s the solution:1. Don&#39;t collect information in the first place, unless absolutely needed. Some schools collect DOB, address and so on just to register for a webinar.2. Don&#39;t permanently store information. If you collect SSN for employability verification then do the verification, store a flag, then delete the SSN. Similarly, after verifying DOB, store a flag then delete DOB.3. Assume information is already public. This is the most important part. Despite all of the leaks happening, many financial and other sites will let you use your DOB, SSN etc. to prove that you are who you say you are. This is absurd. It appears American businesses prioritize convenience over security. Americans need to demand better."</p>

They are not paying me a salary, so have no legitimate need for this number. I know why they want it, and that purpose does not benefit me. Not once has this led to a problem: they know that there is no legal basis for demanding the number, but ask for it anyway, as they have nothing to lose by doing so."</p>

Sure, emojis are in color. But could you make them black and white? Or apply the transform to each color channel independently. I&#39;m convinced there is a way, and if there is anyone who can find it, it is you.And if you do go this way, why stop at emojis? The world needs to know what a capital Mona Lisa looks like. Or the capitalest.I think you&#39;re on the path to general artificial intelligence here. iA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sublime Text has the strangest development cycle I can think of.It does big-bang releases with lots of features, followed by frequent bug fix releases that quickly resolve issues, followed then by years of silence even though there are still issues... until there&#39;s a major version bump and the cycle starts again.This then means that the plugin ecosystem is fairly under developed and inactive because there&#39;s little incentive to actively develop plugins for software that appears to be dead.I used Sublime for many years and it was hard to let it go, the speed was great and the SublimeGit plugin was the best Git client I&#39;ve used, but multi-project development was a pain because the Python/JS/etc plugins didn&#39;t have good support for virtualenvs/per-project config/etc, and it was clear that they were out of active development.I switched to another editor and it&#39;s slower, but fast enough. It&#39;s not quite as nice in many ways but it&#39;s nice enough. Critically though it&#39;s got a great plugin for most things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are text editors and there are IDEs, and each has its place. Sublime Text is, to me, the best GUI text editor around.(For those with the patience to master them, Vim or Emacs may be both objectively and subjectively better. But I&#39;ve never had that patience. Emacs has a hell of a steep learning curve.)You can&#39;t knock Sublime for not having the features of an IDE, because that&#39;s not what it is. If we keep pushing for Sublime to be as &#34;full featured&#34; as an IDE, we&#39;re gonna kill what makes it great.VSC seems to be trying to be both, and by all appearances, those who like it, like it a lot. I&#39;m not in that group, but I admit that there may be something(s) outstanding about it that I just haven&#39;t yet appreciated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I switched from Sublime to VSCode around 2017, and then switched back to Sublime in 2019. My return to Sublime was triggered by a funfunfunction video[1] wherein Mattias recounts an anecdote where he spent an enormous amount of time learning and configuring his IDE, editors, and tools.I realized this is what I was doing with VSCode -- adding more and more extensions, and spending an increasing amount of time configuring them or troubleshooting them when they broke. I realized I was happier and more productive using a &#34;dumber&#34; tool like Sublime Text. I still use plugins with ST, but try to keep them to an absolute minimum. If there is a CLI for what I want to do, I prefer to just use that instead of an extension that obfuscates it. Also, ST is significantly snappier than VSCode, an Electron app.I&#39;ve been using ST4 for over a week now, and it&#39;s been a breath of fresh air.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIjKJjzRX_E"</p>

Why should your unrelated purchases be disclosed to affiliates just because you clicked an affiliate link for whatever reason? Let’s say the affiliate website use accounts or know the identities of users through another channel, and track outbound clicks. With few enough clicks, they can exactly correlate your unrelated purchases with you, if I understand this correctly. In fact it seems you can easily prank unsuspecting acquaintances this way.To be clear, I have no problem with affiliates getting commission on random stuff.Edit: I can also see why the data could be valuable to marketers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article - funny &amp; interesting :)Question about &#34;Ads/advertisements&#34; (I&#39;m totally clueless about how they work):Does anybody have a link pointing to some kind of overview from the point of view of a website owner?   (e.g. list of different providers, amounts paid by views/clicks, which informations are/can be exchanged with them to provide for example an ad in the same context of what the website is showing, etc...?)Personally as a user, I would not be against ads if they would be normal ones like in a newspaper/magazine, but many show full-fledged small&amp;big animations =&gt; I get angry when I see my CPU usage at 100%/my fan spinning up/my battery depleting while reading on such a page, which is the main if not the only reason why I block them (I might even be interested in them, but they screw up my PC/notebook) =&gt; as a website owner do you have control on what kind of ads you want to show (technically speaking - like &#34;animated&#34; vs. &#34;static&#34;, with how many fps, etc...)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great news. Hopefully it fixes a lot of the jank that I&#39;ve always experienced with Android Bluetooth. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a smooth experience - even with a supposedly flagship device (Pixel 4a!) I&#39;ve encountered all of the following problems:* Devices getting stuck at max volume (thankfully not headphones)* Devices getting stuck at really low volumes* Devices randomly switching between absolute volume and relative volume (not really sure how to describe this, but sometimes changing the volume on the phone changes the volume on the receiver, and sometimes it changes the mix volume on the phone only (like an aux output would behave) and keeps the volume on the receiver)* Needing to enable Developer Settings to change the Bluetooth protocol version and other wacky stuff that I just shouldn&#39;t have to do [0]* Headphones cutting in and out when exercising, like the phone can&#39;t figure out it needs to stay in the higher of two radio power profiles that it&#39;s switching between, as the receiving antenna on my workout band moves 2-3 inches away from the phone and back again[0]: https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8hbcuu/the_100...Bluetooth has been awful on Android for a long time. I&#39;ve never not had to futz with it to get it to work. I hope this is a move toward making it as seamless as it should be. I couldn&#39;t imagine trying to figure all this out as a non-technical user."</p>

In fact, they were bleeding vast amounts of cash and went public with the statement:We do not expect to become profitable in the near future, may never achieve profitability, and have incurred substantial net operating losses, or NOLs, during our history.This is the price of cheap money. VC-backed competitors can simply outspend a bootstrapped company on customer acquisition, marketing, development and hiring, and cash out without the company ever actually making a profit.In the current environment, a bootstrapped company should ideally be:
(a) niche (and therefore outside the traditional VC market crosshairs)
(b) profitable from day one.A to-do list doesn&#39;t fit that mould at all, which this guy found out the hard way.[0] https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-228462/"</p>

You can’t play the vc game, get out vc’d, then conclude that bootstrapped can’t compete. Well I guess you can, but you shouldn’t!It’s entirely possible there were enough people who liked Flow and didn’t need mobile and native apps for Flow to have been the Basecamp of his dreams. We/he don’t know because he didn’t try for it.Edit: looks like he’s a vc now. Can’t help but wonder if instead of horribly misinterpreting his own story, he’s intentionally misrepresenting the conclusion. Frighten bootstrappers in to getting in touch to sell or take on funding."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; March 2021, Apple reportedly agrees to preinstall Russian softwareWait, this regulation is a result of an antitrust case against Google and Apple started by Yandex, as both were using their platforms against their direct competitor. The same thing that many people want to see in EU and US. Clearly it doesn&#39;t belong to the list and the author did zero research on this, but included anyway because it fits the bad guy narrative they are trying to push.What&#39;s even funnier is that Apple threatened to withdraw from the russian market rather than having to do this, so the question is who&#39;s the real bad guy here (how about &#34;a tech giant threatens an unimportant country to be able to bully domestic competitors&#34;?). I guess everybody is horrible in this story, because the government had to compromise and omit the requirement to be able to uninstall this software, and they also included many companies who were large enough to be able to lobby their interests, because obviously they didn&#39;t want to make a single company special. Now Samsung reportedly has a backdoor deal with Yandex to install their software as system on Samsung phones, so it&#39;s being shoved down customers&#39; throats. Nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s easy to pick on Apple, when you don&#39;t know the history of these political issues. Not picking on Red Hat, but because I know this from the first hand it was 18 years ago that they removed the Taiwanese flag from KDE3 control center: https://redhat-list.redhat.narkive.com/b3p8HQaa/bug-70235Apple is not a government, it&#39;s a business. They&#39;ll either have to obey the local laws or they&#39;ll lose business.While we are here, checkout how Google Maps handles these issues: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/14/google-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With the App Store, Apple’s really brought this problem upon themselves whether they agree with what they are told to do or not. Any sort of centralized distribution mechanism is always going to be the first thing an authoritarian government targets when trying to take down content they don’t like. On iPhone it’s even worse because the App Store is not only a centralized distribution mechanism but the only distribution mechanism. If you want something gone, you can just force Apple and that’s that for iPhone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non-US folks who need a translation here -In the US, we have a nationwide public healthcare system called “Medicare”. You generally only qualify for Medicare once you’re 65 except in special circumstances. Many of our citizens can’t afford to be diagnosed with cancer at an earlier age, as it will increase their non-Medicare private insurance premiums^, result in denied coverage for unrelated issues, and potentially send them into bankruptcy if treated. So they wait until they turn 65, and only then bring in pre-existing conditions for diagnosis and treatment, confident that they can no longer be bankrupted by doing so.^ Insurance premiums average $300-$700 USD per month per person nationwide, when not available through full-time employment or (65+) Medicare. ~75.000.000 US citizens age 18-64 are employed full-time, which compels their employers to subsidize their monthly health insurance costs; the remaining ~127.000.000 citizens are not employed full-time and thus do not qualify for mandatory employer-provided insurance.EDIT - Military veterans, poor people, and so on often have access to additional free public health systems other than Medicare, offered either nationwide or by member states of our union or by non-governmental organizations; degree of subsidy and quality of coverage varies wildly among them.# The above estimates were constructed using napkin math and the below links.“Average Monthly Benchmark Plan Premiums for a 27-Year-Old in Plan Year 2020 in Healthcare.gov States” https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-does-health-insurance-...&#34;Population estimates&#34;: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US&#34;The U.S. labor force&#34;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_force_in_the_United_Stat..."</p>

The omnipotence of the Mossad and NSA etc is limited too, and their interest in things is also limited.Basically the attack vector from them is polluting the Tor nodes (so that they control enough of them to understand information), timing attacks on onion services to figure out locations of people accessing the hidden services solely within in Tor, as well as undeclared exploits, and feeding local law enforcement around the globe the information about you.But 9 out of 10 things you could possibly even do are not things that would have them bother with you, although it is accurate that over time you begin to have a problem if you are really trying to stay both private and anonymous and are doing criminal violations (distinct from civil violations). So just keep rotating keys and move with purpose. Limit your Tor session to implementation and execution and consider using Tor just for casual reading or accessing RDP to actually browse clearnet from someone else&#39;s computer."</p>

You go to a 4 hour class and they teach you how to teach others to tie a knot using a set of instructions. This is how new hires a supposed to be taught. You are supposed to teach them right from a script using a set protocol. Becoming an ambassador was a way to get out of loading trucks, or packing boxes for 10 to 12 hrs. You may ambassador 1 day then unload trucks for the next 3.&gt;&gt; I stopped doing it after the first year I was there because it didn’t pay more. It’s voluntary. Your manager picks them.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Specify it in pixelsNo thank you.I regularly wonder if it might not be better for the web if we got rid of pixels as a unit entirely. We can&#39;t realistically do that for a lot of reasons, and there are legitimate reasons to use pixels sometimes, but resolution independent font-size and container sizing should be the default. If you are using pixels on the web for font sizes, consider this a public intervention that you need to stop.The fact that `em` units are not related to physical size attributes is intended. We don&#39;t want them to be related to physical size -- what `2em` is saying is that you want a piece of text to be twice as large as the &#34;default&#34; size of the specific font on the platform/device. That is a superior way to think about text size, because as a user I don&#39;t want you to try and figure out what the pixel density or screen ratio or resolution of my device is.Size your fonts with `em` and `rem` units, and size your containers based on the number of characters you want to fit in each line. Don&#39;t use pixels. It doesn&#39;t matter if your fonts are bigger on Mac or Windows. It is intentional that platforms can size their fonts differently, and your interface designs should take that into account.If anything, native platforms should be moving more in this direction, they should not be moving away from it. There was a period where you could decide to only care about responsive design on the web, but increasingly you should be thinking about responsive design on native platforms too. And resolution-independent font-sizes based on the user/platform are part of that process.EDIT: Yes, I&#39;m aware that pixels on the web are not necessarily 1:1 ratios with physical pixels on a screen. That doesn&#39;t change anything, pixels are still bad to use on the web. Tying font size to resolution, whether that&#39;s browser window resolution or physical resolution, is still equally problematic. And it certainly doesn&#39;t mean that we should move in the opposite direction on native devices -- the web&#39;s pixels are the way they are because the alternative, being tied to literal physical pixels, would be even worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic article and I welcome this conversation.As the author states, sizing of fonts and line spacing is currently inconsistent across OS&#39;s, inconsistent across fonts, and inconsistent with other UI elements.It&#39;s madness. There&#39;s no good reason for any of it except inertia and lack of forethought.The author&#39;s proposal to specify cap height is really the only reasonable solution I think there is, though I&#39;d modify it slightly:- When defining cap height, be clear what the logical obvious equivalent in other scripts, e.g. Chinese logogram height- Specify cap height in whatever unit other UI elements are specified in (the author refers to pixels, but that&#39;s arbitrary)- Then line height can also be controlled predictably and exactly in whatever unit UI elements are specified inEnd result: zero inconsistencies. Text shows up exactly where it&#39;s meant to no matter what.How do we get there? Browsers should adopt it first, with something like a CSS &#34;font-cap-size&#34; property that can be used instead of (and override) &#34;font-size&#34;, as well as something like &#34;cap-line-height&#34; overriding &#34;line-height&#34;. (And for units, recommend using &#34;px&#34;, or &#34;rem&#34; ultimately based on a root &#34;px&#34;, and never touching &#34;pt&#34;.)Then OSes can migrate similarly with new function calls/parameters based on cap height, and also try to phase out &#34;pt&#34; sizing in preference of the logical &#34;px&#34; sizing used in the rest of interfaces.I really think this is the way. I really hope browsers and the W3C can consider something like this. It&#39;s decades overdue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;I see no reason to honor the so-called “default line-height”. It’s basically a font designer’s personal preference, imposed on every user of the font in every viewing condition.Erm... To a large extent, these details of a font _are_ the the designer&#39;s -personal-preference- professional judgement, and that&#39;s the point.  We use different fonts because they have a distinct feel or quality, and how much spacing they have between lines is one of the many little details that add up to the gestalt of a font.  If you don&#39;t like the line spacing of a font, don&#39;t use it.  Or tweak it if you like. But don&#39;t pretend that declaring that all fonts should have a line spacing of 200% of their cap height isn&#39;t similarly trying to impose your personal aesthetic preferences on everyone else as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34; Modern cars regularly send basic data about vehicle components, their safety status and service schedules to car manufacturers, and mobile phones work in very similar ways.&#34; -GoogleThis is a beautiful quote because it is an example of one industry&#39;s bad behavior leading to another industry&#39;s bad behavior, upon which the first industry then users the second&#39;s similarity to justify themselves. Cars only started doing this because phones made it normal. It&#39;s wrong in both cases.It&#39;s similar to when Apple defended it&#39;s 30% store cut by claiming it&#39;s an &#34;industry standard&#34;... specifically, an industry standard that Apple established."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of 500px. I used to be a huge fan of 500px. It was the most beautiful photography site on the internet, designed with attention to every tiny detail. It allowed you to share your photos under a CC license, presented them beautifully and had fantastic curated feeds with photos by fantastic photographers.In 2018 they were acquired by an investor company and partnered exclusively with Getty. As a contributor, you were now pushed to &#34;earn money with your pictures&#34;, CC licenses were discouraged and (I think) eventually removed. The site stopped getting optimized for aesthetics, it was now getting optimized for selling stock photos. I deleted all my photos and left.I hope this doesn&#39;t happen to Unsplash. But I&#39;m not optimistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My main association with Getty is their &#39;copyfraud&#39; practises where they claim public domain images (NASA, Library of Congress etc) as their own and sell licenses[0].

Perhaps this a good time to create a mirror[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images#Claiming_copyrigh...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images#Acquisitions"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m going to instead see this as an opportunity for something better to emerge.My biggest problem with Unsplash is that they did not use a standard license that would easily be compatible with a Creative Commons or open source licensed work. If I incorporated images from Unsplash, suddenly I couldn&#39;t say &#34;you&#39;re welcome to do whatever you like with my work.&#34; In fact, they used to use a CC0 license, but then changed, because other sites were copying them. As a user, this was a feature, not a bug.I would far prefer to see the community band together and produce an image sharing website with CC0 as the default license. Creative Commons image search right now is in need of some TLC from an engaged community."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of misunderstandings in some comments : we are not talking here about desired RF emissions but about unwanted EMC emissions at harmonic frequencies which just happen to interfere with the regular 2.4 GHz devices.This has nothing to do with how much spectrum is allocated to wifi vs mobile vs whatever... Here it is only about EMC (and it is well known for years that USB is difficult with EMC and it requires a lot of care on the PCB design !). And USB3 is not the only product that leads to difficulties : there are for example a lot of debates (at least in Europe) now with regards to the impact of LEDs (which might surprise a lot of people). Another example are debates on Wireless Power Transfer (which are desired emissions but with very strong harmonics that affect sensitive radio services)"</p>

Until then it is a closed loop system, users and merchants cannot yet deposit or withdraw crypto itself, similar to Robinhood.Highly disappointed that Square (Cash) has not launched a BitPay competitor and still only supports Bitcoin. They’ve allowed BTC deposits and withdrawals for years (with great UX!) yet are lagging far behind in release cadence.The biggest barrier to spending crypto is still finding merchants that accept it, even through third parties. PayPal’s huge merchant userbase will allow dominance if/when they flip the switch to an open loop, “deposit your crypto” approach.Only PayPal and Stripe can flip that switch at scale with a hosted checkout experience. Merchants don’t care how a user paid, they want fiat."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great Twitter thread with many articles/resources if you want a critical lens at the global logistics supply chain.https://twitter.com/CharmaineSChua/status/137586855212986368...I found this article on the impact on super-sized ships on logistical infrastructure useful and fascinating. It describes how the creation of ships too big to fit in the Panama canal (post-PANAMAX ships) was received by 1) Panamanians 2) East Coast / Gulf Coast ports 3) West Coast ports. The Panamanians spent billions expanding their channel to bring port fees and promote attendant value-add services. Ports across the East and Gulf coasts overinvested in trying to make their port the preferred one for these new ships. Clearly, not every port can recoup investments in higher cranes and deeper harbors. There was an irrational optimism on the East Coast, as they sought to take business away from West Coast transhippers (dock in Southern California and ship to the east by train.) In response, the West Coast logistics industry sought and received a series of infrastructure improvements to make transshipment from their ports viable. So, just a few shipping companies are able to increase the size of their ships (for economies of scale) and end up having a major impact on billions of investment dollars in more than a dozen cities. Policy makers in the US aren&#39;t able to pick just a few cities to focus investment in. How can you tell a city that they aren&#39;t going to get those jobs? Perhaps the US should set a maximum ship size to prevent this wastage of resources; but one could argue the efficiencies for consumers could be worth it.https://www.ijurr.org/article/fungible-space-competition-and...The size of these ships keeps increasing at an astonishing rate. See the chart in this excellent talk: https://youtu.be/gdkvAXcZD7U?t=892Moreover, the hydrodynamic effects of these large ships in relatively shallow and narrow canals is underappreciated. We&#39;re liable to see more such incidents as ships get bigger and bigger.https://www.ft.com/content/171c92ec-0a44-4dc5-acab-81ee2620d..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice to see! How do they plan to monetize? I either became blind or missed it somehow. The article does say how they DON&#39;T plan on monetize:    &#34;Rest assured that Deno will remain MIT licensed. For Deno to grow and be maximally useful, it must remain permissively free. We don’t believe the “open core” business model is right for a programming platform like Deno.&#34;

There are some hints though:    &#34;If you watch our conference talks, you will find we&#39;ve been hinting at commercial applications of this infrastructure for years. We are bullish about the technology stack we&#39;ve built and intend to pursue those commercial applications ourselves. Our business will build on the open source project, not attempt to monetize it directly.&#34;

Does anyone have some insight into those? I haven&#39;t watch any Deno talk (maybe one actually?) so it feel a bit strange to make people watch technical talks to find hints of the monetization strategy.PS, if I was a rich investor I&#39;d throw money at this project even as a donation, so no complain at all, but I&#39;m very curious on the monetization plan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to see Deno get some financial backing!I&#39;ve been building my new multiplayer games website [1] with Deno over the last 4 months and apart from some minor growing pains, it&#39;s been a joy to use.The lack of unnecessary package management, and the TypeScript-by-default approach makes Web dev much nicer. We&#39;re also using TypeScript on the client-side, relying on VSCode for error reporting. We use sucrase to strip the types just as we&#39;re serving the script files, so that there is no extra build time, it feels like TypeScript is Web-native and we can share typed code with the server.[1] Not yet launched but we ran a preview past weekend with hundreds of players over WebSockets: https://twitter.com/MasterOfTheGrid/status/13757583007179735... - https://sparks.land"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find most exciting here is:&gt; Our infrastructure makes it possible to... create custom runtimes for different applications [like] Cloudflare Worker-style Serverless FunctionsFascinated to see what happens here. The serverless / edge compute paradigm fits Javascript hand-in-glove philosophically, but until now it&#39;s always felt quite clunky to me. When I&#39;ve tried it out, I&#39;ve always been left thinking &#34;but this would just be so much easier with a server&#34;.Reading this has made it click for me why that is. A new paradigm needs a new set of tools native to that paradigm.The entire server-side JS ecosystem is currently structured around Node, a fundamentally stateful-server paradigm. You can try to abstract over it, but only so far. It&#39;s not the serverless paradigm that&#39;s clunky, per se, it&#39;s that the tools right now were built for another way of doing things.As a concrete example - Deno has an import system based on URLs, rather than on-disk node_modules. I thought that was a cool feature for convenience, less overhead, more open and sharable packages, etc. But now I realise the full intent of it. It&#39;s much more than all that, it&#39;s a fundamental shift in the paradigm: no implied dependency on stateful disk in the runtime itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a believer and someone who attends church regularly, this is sad but not unexpected. From my own personal experience - if the church cannot answer questions clearly, their members will look for answers somewhere else. A lot of churches unfortunately are so elementary in their teaching or turn to &#34;feel good preaching&#34; (see Elevation Church). The longterm effect is that a person ends up being tired of getting the same &#34;baby food&#34; and they look to other places. The churches where theology is solid (and clear) tend to be stronger in number and in regular attendance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Because here&#39;s something else that&#39;s weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship—be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles—is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It&#39;s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It&#39;s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.”David Foster Wallace"</p>

The third parameter to `zend_eval_string` in the commit [1] is the &#34;filename&#34; [2] of the executed code, which is probably used for stack traces. Which is quite a strange choice, because seeing that in the logs would probably ring alarm bells immediately. Overall, this commit seems strange in its structure IMO - not in a &#34;good&#34; covert way, but in a &#34;why does it not try to hide better&#34; way.EDIT: According to zerodiums charts, this would have been a payout of up to 250k$. However, I&#39;m not quite sure what the attackers plan on cashing out on that would have been, given that the exploit would have quite obviously referenced zerodium and therefore would make the submitter the primary suspect of being the author.

Another option might have been to wait until just before a release and fiddle with the tags or the newly opened QA branch (if any).Check out https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2013/10/09/the-linux-backdoor-... for another attempt, that one at least requires careful review to notice the problem"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s a common sentiment here, 
but I&#39;m turning into a more extreme anti-advertising zealot every day.Even the large ad networks show paid content that violates what I would consider widespread ethical norms - presenting everything from hyperbolic claims to straight fraud to people with little repercussion. I&#39;m reminded of a poignant example in television, where episodes of Jeopardy! are intertwined with their shilling quackery like Prevagen to an audience using the fear of aging. Perhaps I&#39;m growing increasingly blind to any positive impacts of the discipline, but ethically I find it hard to separate the fraudsters from the engineers that enable them.I guess advertising is saving me a lot of money in the end by cultivating this hatred, and though I can&#39;t change the world this screed was therapeutic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the reasons I have used Ubiquiti over the last few years is their product quality over other networking hardware. The inclusion of ads leads me to revisit those assumptions before my next purchase.Ads, even if self-promotion, are a bellwether for a company being desperate or greedy, neither of which bodes well for their long-term product quality, usually because it indicates sales people are making the decisions. They also often lead to a slippery slope of increasing user data collection"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One auto update they broke my laptop&#39;s ability to connect. Turns out they&#39;d auto enabled 5 GHz band steering, but my laptop&#39;s chipset only did 2.4 GHz. Even when it was enabled, the Android management app said the setting was disabled.Customer support directed me to the forums. Ubiquiti didn&#39;t respond to my post. I posted on a thread where someone else was seeing the same problem, where a number of people gaslit me and blamed me for the problem.I still have no idea if they&#39;ve fixed their band steering. Or how they decided to force 5 GHz on a 2.4 GHz chipset. Or how to get support. Or how to report a problem.Definitely won&#39;t be buying their products in future.https://community.ui.com/questions/Intel-Centrino-2200-N-cli...https://community.ui.com/releases/UniFi-Network-Controller-5...https://community.ui.com/questions/Default-AUTO-OPTIMIZE-NET..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, I don&#39;t have time to read the entire paper, but I thought it would be interesting to share my experience from the other side. I lead the engineering for a company that does the &#34;data work&#34;, we gather terabytes of data, mostly photography and lidar, every day.So far it&#39;s been a crappy industry to be in, it seems the only way to make money is to provide the entire value chain, and this is the business model we&#39;re pivoting to.Just a bunch of photography and lidar scans isn&#39;t worth much to anyone, and it&#39;s very costly to establish a quality data stream. We had enormous capex on sensor gear, training personnel, running the operations. All this to save a couple bucks on sending an inspector physically to the site.If you do the entire value chain, you gather the data, you process it into information, and then you turn that information into actionable reports. So that means that besides running our operations, we&#39;re also doing the modeling work, and we&#39;re providing the industry specific expertise for the actual inspection. So our customers pay for knowing what is broken, where it&#39;s broken, and what the impact of that defect is.In the end, I believe we&#39;ll be very successful, but it will be because our investors were willing to take us all the way, where many other companies have simply given up on the concept."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Real story. I worked on nudity detection for mobile realtime video chat app with on-device deep learning model. (It was successful.) Should be easy: label some data, start from a good network pretrained on ImageNet (we used SqueezeNet), fine tune. The problem was that ImageNet is photos, not video frames, and distribution of video frames from mobile video is somewhat different. Incredibly large proportion of frames are either blank (camera is blocked) or ceiling (camera is misdirected). We ended up adding lots of data for blank and ceiling explicitly labeled as blank and ceiling. It became an excellent ceiling detector, detecting ceilings it never have seen before.Is there a mobile video frames dataset for labeling ceilings? Why not? I can&#39;t believe I am the only one who experienced this. Why is not a ceiling dataset worthy of, say, CVPR? It will improve mobile video on-device deep learning more than most of CVPR papers. This is a serious problem.Edit: I understand why niche datasets remain in industry and not academia. Public datasets are better if they are of general interest. But ceiling dataset is of general interest to anyone who wants to process video frames originating from blocked or misdirected camera aka smartphones, and it&#39;s hard to imagine topics of more general interest once you have obvious things like face."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, this is extremely common and extremely frustrating.Companies, governments, individuals come to me all the time asking how to &#34;Do AI&#34; without knowing anything about their product, data provenance, testing plans, state observability etc...Sure, you can do a toy problem with some interesting vision or NLP framework and some off the shelf data that isn&#39;t ready for production or anything serious. Who cares? That doesn&#39;t do anything novel, it doesn&#39;t actually change your product function.Chomsky said the most important thing to do as a young person is to follow the phrase &#34;Know Thyself.&#34;People who want to do AI need to &#34;Know Thy-data and product architecture&#34; first.I did a talk last year on exactly this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK-SBu1iiHo"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Female founder friend (non tech space) was in a female focused incubator / competition. She got only one set of somewhat critical feedback - ie, lacks experience in X and Y which are key in product space Z.She posted a comment on her social media focusing on this feedback as &#34;criticism&#34; that came from a sexist guy &#34;of course&#34;. It was pretty easy to draw the line to the three panelists, one of whom was a guy. Ouch.In a previous life, I&#39;d worked in a awesome (female led!) product company. While I had no experience prior to this, I quickly realized that the product itself and its quality etc was almost irrelevant to success, the X and Y mentioned by the male panelist was unfortunately everything, which you&#39;d only know if you were in the space itself. The female led company I worked for was bought out by a (male led) competitor, who then using much strong x and y skills - cleaned up. Company I worked for got basically nothing.Fast forward - my friends business not doing so great, she asks me for feedback. I said nothing other than enthusiasm. Partly because I was really enthusiastic - she&#39;d put her heart into this project. But her comment on social was in my mind - I had no desire to be next sexist guy &#34;shooting down&#34; an ideaShe&#39;s out of the business I think mostly. Anyways, this parallels the take of the article."</p>

If you don&#39;t want to find yourself a victim of these kinds of people, then you better keep these two links as a reference, and always take them to heart:Narcissists Online: http://www.issendai.com/psychology/narcissism/narcissists-on...What to Remember When Dealing with a Narcissist: http://www.issendai.com/psychology/narcissism/narcissists-wh...People who do this sort of stuff have narcissistic traits at minimum, which of course is an armchair diagnosis. But, these people really do not need to meet the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder. All you need to know is that they are people who will harm you in some incredibly hurtful way, because they have contempt for you being yourself.Some of these people have antisocial traits, and are malignant narcissists. Some of them outright have both narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder.Regardless, these people tend to masquerade as &#34;entrepreneurs&#34;, &#34;researchers&#34;, &#34;thinkers&#34;, &#34;doers&#34;, or as &#34;authors&#34;, when their entire works are just plagiarized material from others. People make entire livings off of such grifts and it becomes a central identity, if not their only identity. Of course, it is always about getting the next award or accolade, even though it is &#34;empty&#34; to them because they have intrinsically low self-esteem and an unbelievably fragile ego.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of something I experienced on HN and Reddit, though my case was a far less significant level.I posted a comment on HN in response to some article about Emacs.  Later that day I saw someone had copied my comment word for word in reply to the same article on Reddit.I still have no idea why someone would do that.  I thought at first it was some kind of karma farming operation but the post history of the Reddit user didn&#39;t really fit that profile.  Plus,it seems like r/emacs would be a really poor choice for that.I&#39;ve always been curious to know why someone would do something like this.  It&#39;s interesting to read about it happening on a way larger scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that
something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so
bad as it was made out.Is one&#39;s first feeling, &#39;Thank God, even they aren&#39;t quite so
bad as that,&#39; or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling
to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies are as bad as
possible?If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process
which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to
wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we
shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally we
shall insist on seeing everything -- God and our friends and ourselves included -- as
bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of
pure hatred.-- C.S. Lewis"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Doomscrolling caused by &#34;engagement&#34; metrics.When engagement is all that matters, the most engagement comes when people are divisive, mad/angry or even pushed to extremes.When you feel yourself getting bothered, angry and you have to prove someone wrong on the internet, step away. You are taking valuable time from your own projects and quality of life.People can have different opinions and that is ok, your ideas and opinions are what make you, see that as your unique tool to success. On top of that many &#34;organic opinions&#34; are actually astroturfing and PR designed to promote or get you to &#34;engage&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"100% agree with the premise. Outrage culture is ruining all reasonable discourse in this country (and world), and is now massively fueled by politicians, corporations, media for their own gains.I do not, however, agree with their solution. Turning off the news/Facebook/Twitter and ignoring everything happening around you is not going to make things better.The world has made a lot of progress over the last few centuries (as the article calls out), but all of it has been driven by common people like you and me getting outraged over things that might not directly concern us. Anger is sometimes justified.Instead, when you read something that angers you, take a few minutes and do that extra step of research. Could it be completely fake? Does the headline reflect the contents of the article correctly (it is normally not written by the author)? Is the data researched and sourced? Is what you are reading heavily opinionated? Are you subscribed to a healthy mix of sources?If enough people actually did this (instead of reading the title and going straight to Twitter/Reddit/HN), meaningless outrage will disappear without the trade-off of not being informed about the world. You will organically discover that everything is a lot more reasonable and moderate than people want you to believe. And if something actually isn&#39;t, you will be able to see it."</p>

Too cooperative. Talks too much.  Talks too little. Gets his story perfectly straight. Fucks his story up. Blinks too much, avoids eye contact. Doesn’t blink.

I also grabbed the full list of newspapers and used imagemagick to annotate each image with the paper name and location. It&#39;s a little hacky, but seems to work.It&#39;s admittedly an expensive display, but it really is very well made piece of hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always thought the future of newspapers was an iPad sized e-ink reader.  One cheap enough for papers to give away to their subscribers.  Yet it hasn&#39;t happened and I&#39;m left wondering why?I think it&#39;s because the newspaper industry has tunnel vision.  You might ask what about newspaper apps on phones?  First it isn&#39;t an ideal screen size for a newspaper.  Second they only show a fraction of the articles.  They also keep articles on their scroll for days and days.  I don&#39;t know about you but I don&#39;t chose a digital delivery to get days old stories.I think the industry needs a well funded disruptor.  Living in Michigan I can tell you that without Elon Musk we&#39;d never be moving toward battery powered automobiles.  I&#39;ve dealt with Gannett&#39;s customer service and I have come away convinced that they hate their customers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because in 2021 developer tools are fundamentally not profitable. Jetbrains is the exception, not the norm. Developer tools are loss leaders for large corporation to acquire developer goodwill and mindshare. Previously we sold developer tools/PaaS. Programmers do not like to pay for their tooling. You have to sell to management, and when your target is management, then the metrics are completely different from what developers want.This is why no-code and low code are so much more successful than developers tooling startups in terms of revenue and profitability. The people using are the same people who are running the business. The value proposition is clear. &#34;Better developer experience&#34; alone is not sufficient for selling to enterprise. And programmer productivity cannot be quantified in lines of code written. This is hard point to explain and get across on HN because this forum is inherently dismissive of the value of RPA and RAD software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The kinds of tools like those in the article suffer from being outside of the &#34;main loop of coding&#34;.What is the main loop? Well, as it&#39;s defined since the rise of interactive computing, it&#39;s typing in the editor, compiling, then testing and debugging.Thus we optimize for:1. Typing code fast(or typing less code)2. Compiling code fast(by doing less compilation)3. Minimizing testing and debugging time(by narrowing our definitions of testing to that which is easy to automate).The main loop of coding is not software development. It does not study the domain problem, define new benchmarks for success, untangle communication issues, or refine principles of development. It is a path to coder flow state, feature factoryism and shipping the org chart. These things sort of resemble development - a happy coder delivering features within a definite architecture does serve someone at some point - but also manifest dysfunction. Development failing is just shrugged off as bad programming or bad management.Tools like a Whyline or Reflexion models are not in the main loop. They are an invitation to look carefully at whatever horror has been wrought and address it at a deep level. But that really needs a  researching mindset, not a shipping one.In practice, the available tools very slowly move in the direction of the suggestions of research. There are improvements, but they need projects that put together the pieces and make it a goal from the language design(the main interface) upwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As many on this discussion have noted, JetBrains tools not only don&#39;t collect dust, they are widely used, and the company is profitable. The company is privately held. I hear that they are constantly turning down investments. This proves 1) there is money in tools; 2) The VCs who routinely say &#34;there is no money in tools&#34; are insufficiently imaginitive, which is not surprising if you&#39;ve spent any time with VCs.Why is JetBrains so successful where others have failed? A few thoughts:- Intellij was released in 2001. Eclipse was a close competitor for a while, which made no sense to me. Intellij just worked, and it was intuitive. I found Eclipse to be uglier, slower, flakier, crashier, and far less intuitive. Haven&#39;t heard of it in years.- It was always the case that at least some version of Jetbrains tools are zero cost. I got hooked on it early on. I have been using emacs far longer, and yes, while a sufficiently dedicated developer can make emacs behave like an IDE, it really isn&#39;t one. Intellij just worked out of the box. In the preceding two decades, there were high-end development tools available (Lisp machines and their all-encompassing environments, Lucid for C++, Purify for C/C++ memory problems, Atria, Rational. Trivia: Did you know that Purify was founded by Reed Hastings, the guy who went on to found Netflix?)  The tools were expensive, and I don&#39;t think there were free versions. These companies all went out of business, or were acquired.- Jetbrains is incredibly focused. Having been through several VC-funded technology companies, I can easily see how VC brain farts can destroy a company&#39;s focus. (This dynamic isn&#39;t entirely the VCs fault. Founders stretch the truth to get funded, and then VCs insist on the fairy tales they&#39;ve been told.)- Jetbrains has expanded to other languages, and other kinds of tools (besides just refactoring Java code). The number of languages, technologies, and frameworks that they support is just mind-boggling.- Consistent focus on improving developer&#39;s lives, through steady improvements in functionality, performance, and quality, over 20 years at this point. They started far ahead and have widened the gap.OPs tools look useful. I suspect they would attract a much wider audience if made available through Jetbrains products."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is why I use Framer, they have a built-in export to React function that is really powerful for early startups (as the whole tool is built on React)My team has been using our Framer export (with a few tweaks) as the actual final UI for our early product. Designing is as easy as in Figma, with the advantage that you have actual React components out of the box (working chart libraries, video components... any package you want to use). Whatever you design is responsive, can be connected via API to any database, and all of this is done collaboratively in the same document.It has been a mind-blowing experience in terms of product shipping speed, and as a designer, it really makes you connect in a deeper way with the complexity of the final code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can see a bright future for this approach. Figma is very &#34;constructional&#34; design tool, encouraging the use:- variablized colors and fonts, that can become CSS variables and classes- Components and component hierarchies, that can turn into React components- Auto-layout that is based on Flexbox- Component propertes (Variants in Figma, but with enough effort it can turn into attributes for React components).With a bit of annotation inside Figma, I can easily see pretty good results for this conversion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If Figma has their eyes open, they&#39;ll run with this idea. Design once in Figma, generate UIs for React, Vue, Jetpack and SwiftUI. Designers become way more productive, doing part of the work of front end devs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good read. For a long time I explained to people that the value of search advertising was that it matched a buyer who had just asked a buying question with advertisers who wanted to answer that question. This was HUGELY different than previous Internet &#34;banner&#34; advertising. Think of it this way; I put a poster up in the metro that says &#34;Best Deals on Rolex watches&#34; and a million people a day  &#34;see it&#34; but a vanishingly small number want to buy a Rolex. However, if Google gets a query &#34;Where to buy a Rolex&#34; or &#34;best deals on Rolex watches&#34;, well you know that person is perhaps already considering buying a watch, so you want first crack at the deal.The secret sauce was instantly pairing &#34;commercial intent&#34; (or the intention to do some commercial action, buy, sell, hire, Etc.) with vendors and firms who can satisfy that intent or &#34;aspects&#34; of that intent. (You might get an Uber ad on a query for &#34;restaurants near me&#34; for example)Amazon has that in spades. If you are on the Amazon site, that is a huge signal that you are intending to make a commercial transaction. Either with Amazon, or perhaps you are reading reviews of things you can get locally, but the probability that you are about to do something commercial is much much higher. (So does Facebook along a different vector but that is a different post for a different time.)I know from experience at Blekko that one way to piss off Amazon is to out advertise them :-). That just told me that they considered Ads strategic and selling stuff was secondary to that goal[1].[1] I reasoned it this way, if selling stuff was primary then any additional exposure is &#34;good&#34; even if you have to pay affiliate fees for it. If advertising was the money maker, then someone doing it better than you (converting your ad revenue into their affiliate revenue) then you respond harshly to that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon makes more revenue from ads than Youtube does (and Youtube makes 100x what Reddit does). That&#39;s nuts.Chart of each ad/marketing channel by spend for context:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in the ads org at Amazon an year ago and yes I can tell you the revenue generated by ad products across their services is insane. It&#39;s a well executed operation and it is only growing rapidly year over year. From a customer perspective they are also very relevant most of the time.The remaining part is making sure they don&#39;t upset customers way too much since that would conflict with the idea of &#34;customer satisfaction&#34; the company has."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some articles&#39; job is to spark a great rebuttal. This is a great read, and great debating.  Nerd-bait-ey information density so high.The economic equilibrium of the Bitcoin economic model is as follows: the total cost of all electricity invested into the network over a 10-minute period strives to be equal to the present financial value of 6.25 Bitcoins. If electricity becomes cheaper, then more electricity gets poured into the system, producing the exact same output. That is why Bitcoin is not a battery — Bitcoin is a sink: its economic output is constant, regardless of the amount of resources poured into it.³ When miners pour more electricity into Bitcoin, they don’t get more Bitcoin; instead, the entirety of the Bitcoin network becomes more secure. Security is not a commodity,.... Bitcoin is indeed incentivizing the creation of cheap power sources, but those sources are not going to be used for anything...I learned more about bitcoin in a few minutes than so many hours of people talking while saying so little. Glass of ice water in hell. I can now deduce that the &#34;equilibrium energy cost&#34; of bitcoin is currently $45m per day."</p>

It&#39;s not really useful anymore for any of its advertised goals - Ethereum is a far better coin for all practical purposes. But since it&#39;s the first and it&#39;s accepted everywhere, it&#39;s going to maintain its dominance. Obv. Bitcoin is also deflationary having a fixed supply.But really it&#39;s really about it being the gateway to the altcoin universe, where actual useful stuff is being built.

( My perception could obviously be wrong, bit it would get silenced immediately for bringing it up)We have a powerfull union here in Belgium ( connections with politics) and since a lot had already accomplished, they keep fighting for ridiculous things for the mere purpose of keeping themselves relevant.One of their most favorite is classifying teachers as very hard labor. Coming from a background where my dad worked 18/24 and 7/7 that stings. I know multiple teachers and I don&#39;t consider that hard labor. It&#39;s important labor, yes. But they don&#39;t have a lot of stress of other professions, not much working hours and a lot of vacation.Keeping your course up to date every year is not stressful ( if that even happens. A lot of professors copy-paste their work)Important note: depending on the students age they teach ( toddlers, middle aged, adults. I do believe it gets harder and they need to add more hours. But classifying everyone as one is a mistake in my POV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Labor was once fighting for their rights with rifles and unprecedented multicultural unity. Workers knew their enemy very clearly and knew how to attain their goals. The alternative was starvation and corporate enslavement.Now the concern is deleting tweets. Embourgeoisiement has slowed and confused the struggle of labor. The reckoning of the owner class is long overdue, as evidenced by this typical hubris.In today&#39;s world, this reckoning must be at once international and complete. We have the infrastructure for liberation on a global scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, in a way: asking to delete the tweet has likely given it far more audience than it originally had. Streisand effect, maybe?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve tried Github pages, Netlify, and Cloudflare Pages. Moved last night to the latter.Github pages is fine, but the extra gh-pages branch is kind of annoying. It&#39;s fairly clear (for obvious reasons) that they mainly think about Jekyll users, though I had a Hugo blog there for a while.Netlify sounds great, but in practice I ran into an annoying issue that I couldn&#39;t resolve where I had to rerun every automatic build.  This probably isn&#39;t really their fault but the forums didn&#39;t work.Cloudflare Pages kind of just worked out of the box, and since I was already using it for my DNS, changing where the domain pointed took a few seconds.I&#39;d suspect, if you corrected for how many issues were particular to me, I&#39;d say Cloudflare Pages ~ Netlify &gt; Github Pages. I&#39;m kind of surprised the latter charges you for custom domains; I do have to say there&#39;s more documentation for Github than any of the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hosting a personal blog on old / cheap hardware at home and accepting some downtime now and then should be a trade-of worth making for most. An interconnected web of documents served from personal computers residing under a desk or in a basement – it is a beautiful thing.We nerds often seem to fall into the trap of over-engineering things, like, spending a lot of time building personal stuff that can scale into the infinity – only to end up never having more than 10 concurrent visitors at any given time.By accepting and embracing the intermittent and slightly unstable nature of serving websites from our homes, we can take back much of the in(ter)dependence and hacky, quirky fun that many of us fondly remember from the 90&#39;s and 2000&#39;s.Setting up a webserver on a Pi and serving it from home can be a fun project, not necessarily trivial for everyone, but definitely within reach for most technically inclined people.Might be among the cheapest, easiest AND fun ways to host a static site :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitHub Pages or Netlify for sure. With either of these options, your static site can be set up to deploy whenever there&#39;s new commits to the specified branch.Me and a friend mentor for Code Louisville, and we&#39;re able to get the beginner frontend students up and running very quickly using these options - they&#39;re free and much easier to use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just Qualcomm it&#39;s closed source driver blobs in general.Even if your CPU might still be supported your other hardware might not. A common offender is camera drivers as far as I know and while you sometimes can still make the camera work it often comes with noticeable decreased quality (as the special patent encumbered closed source image post processing sausage is missing).Besides that potential but as far as I know less likely  offenders include the modem.Ironically both might be integrated into the SoC which then massively increases the chance for problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s mind-boggling to me that Qualcomm only guarantees 2-3 years of support for their chipset. Compare that to the PC processor space, how much does AMD/Intel provide? 10 years? More?Somehow people seem to be running on 15 year-old Thinkpads without a problem, yet a $1000 phone apparently can&#39;t scrape by for more than three years due to vendor support?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulations to Fairphone. This sounds like a massive task especially for such a small team. I run a Fairphone 3 and I couldn&#39;t be happier. Sure it was on the pricy side but it&#39;s served me well, takes great photos, has survived numerous drops (the phone protector shipped with it is great), looks cool,strikes up interesting conversations now and then, and will apparently have Android updates well into the future. Fairphone&#39;s a great company shipping a great product. Well worth the investment!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think that this is the answer to &#34;only google can crawl the web&#34;. This is a huge archive suitable for making a web search engine maybe.What if you want to make a simple link previewer? An abstract crawler for scientific articles? Most websites are behind cloudflare which will block/captcha you, but happily whitelist only google &amp; major social sites. Tha answer is measures that bring the web back to basics, not this over-SEOed bot infested ecosystem. FANGS succeeded in sucking out all the information of the web, but they suck at creating protocols that are interoperable (even twitter now needs its own tags!).Incidentally, maybe the next search engine should use a push-system , where websites will ping to it whenever they have updates. If the engine has unique features, it might be actually seen as a measure to reduce the loads from bots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good resource, admirable intention, great that it simply exists. Good sized index.I see a lot of people subscribe to the idea of this being the feeder to alternative search engines.I&#39;d guess part of the problem with doing things this way is the &#39;crawl priority&#39; of what the search engine thinks are the next best pages to crawl, it&#39;s totally out of their hands or at least, they&#39;d still need to crawl on top of the Common Crawl data.The recent UK CMA report into monopolies in online advertising estimated Google&#39;s index to be around 500-600 billion pages in size and Bing&#39;s to be 100-200 billion pages in size [0]. Of course, what you define as a &#39;page&#39; is subjective given URL canonicals and page similarity.At the very least, the common crawl gets around crawl rate limiting problems by being one massive download.Would be interesting to know if there&#39;s an appreciable % of site owners blocking it, though going on past data (there is some data in the UK CMA about this also), it&#39;s not a huge issue.[0] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article seems to be saying that it&#39;s reasonable to expect that google should avoid reporting or fixing security vulnerabilities being actively exploited by the US government, and this isn&#39;t something that should make other counties consider Google to be working as an agent for the US government and therefore deserving of being blocked or sanctioned.By the same token should we we also consider it reasonable for companies Huawei to avoid fixing security vulnerabilities being exploited by governments like China and not consider them to be deserving of having importation of their products blocked on this basis?I don&#39;t think other countries would necessarily want to use google products if they are intentionally leaving security vulnerabilities open, so maybe it is better that all companies fix all security vulnerabilities they find?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a lot of words to say that Google found and caused the patching of security exploits in consumer devices such as Safari, iPhones and Android phones.And the users of the exploits were a state actor that was friendly to the USA.Which is effectively saying that wanting vulnerable software is a patriotic thing.Especially calling it a &#34;counter terrorism&#34; operation. Where did the author of the article get that information from?It seems like a hit piece."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, this is not a difficult decision or a debate.Allowing vulnerabilities to remain open/undisclosed because your government approves of them... for one thing, they aren&#39;t only useable by your government/allies, you don&#39;t know who else knows about them.Our government&#39;s approach of finding security vulnerabilities and keeping them for their own use (instead of responsibly reporting them to get fixed) puts all our security in danger. There isn&#39;t much we can do about that (except, well, try to use our &#34;democracy&#34; to get the government to behave differently).But in USA at least, private citizens can&#39;t generally be compelled to cooperate.If engineers at a private company find a vulnerability, it should be responsibly dealt with to fix it. No matter who else knows about it or may be taking advantage of it.I think it is unethical for a software engineer to do or go along with anything else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Last night I was writing a blog post about how to use const generics. I included instructions on installing Rust Beta, and setting your directory to use the Beta compiler instead of Stable. I started to write a disclaimer like &#34;By the way, this will be stabilized in a future version of Rust, probably on...&#34; and realized that const generics were being stabilized in less than 9 hours! So I removed all that stuff.If you&#39;re interested in some concrete examples of using const generics to write faster code, my post on them is here: https://blog.adamchalmers.com/grids-2/"</p>
