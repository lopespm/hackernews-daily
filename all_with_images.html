								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations on the launch! I wonder if this kind of business model, where it looks like there is basically &#34;one really rich guy self-funding&#34; for a couple of years, is going to be more common.That is, just looking at the site, my guess is that building everything from the ground up (core banking stack, acquiring the chartered bank, then all the APIs and tech on top of that) must have taken many years and many, many millions of dollars. And kudos, because the first thing that struck out at me is the documentation looks excellent. Overall, it looks like something where the the team had all the luxury to &#34;do things right from the ground floor&#34;, instead of scrambling and making shortcuts before their runway ran out. I just think it would have been very hard to find a VC willing to be patient enough to wait that long with no revenue or customer feedback (&#34;where&#39;s your MVP???&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Create account numbers that point to a single bank account and create specific permissions and limits for each one.I love that; there are so many places that give a 6% discount for using ACH but I don&#39;t want to give out my bank account details willy-nilly---If you have influence over it, I wouldn&#39;t recommend having https://status.column.com/uptime default to &#34;Sandbox&#34; since I doubt seriously that&#39;s what anyone would care about when going to an uptime page, and can also mislead a reader in a hurry if the Sandbox environment is having woes but Production is finenit: I would guess you meant &#34;sweep&#34; not &#34;sweet&#34; on https://column.com/bank-accounts&gt; We support FBO, sweet, clearing and custom account types — all FDIC insured."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having worked on this in Skia (and so Chrome, Android) for a good while, I can vouch this is an issue browser/phone developers would have liked to fix a long time ago, but have kept by default for compatibility with old expectations.  A lot (~all) of web/app design was and still is done with this broken interpolation in mind, which then all breaks when math is done in a way that more accurately models light.It’s a bit of a chicken and egg problem that we can really only fix by allowing content to explicitly opt-in to linear working color profiles.  And sadly that’s not going to solve everything either: while a linear profile is good for color interpolation, sRGB encoding is ideal for brightness interpolation.  You’re stuck choosing between ugly red-green interpolation and nice white-black (sRGB) or between nice red-green and ugly white-black (linear).  There are some more complex color spaces that do try to be the best of everything here, but I’m not aware of any browser or OS providing support for working with these perceptual color spaces.A similar problem comes up when trying to manage color gamut on screens and systems that are intentionally blown out to look vivid, vibrant, shiny… looking at you Samsung phones.  Any properly color-managed image there looks incredibly dull compared to the bright defaults you’ve grown accustomed to.  If we take 0xff red to mean “full sRGB red”, that’s much less bright these days than if we just assume it means “as red as the screen will go.”  It’s much like how TVs are (hopefully were?) set in the store in bright shiny mode to induce you to buy them, not set to reproduce colors accurately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Web color is somehow still a garbage fire.About a decade ago I was hearing that web-safe color was effectively obsolete. Today Firefox chokes on P3 color, and Chrome doesn&#39;t appear to care at all about display color profiles.I recently launched a website that had a fire-engine red background and was expected to have a rotating animation above the fold (https://worldparkinsonsday.com). Even once we got the animation synced perfectly between Chrome and Safari, it turned out that iOS Safari was rendering the video differently. Eventually I gave up and replaced a 128kb mp4 video with a 5mb transparent animated GIF. Shameful.And I had this lil&#39; fellah on my desk smiling at me the whole time

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The gradient mixing example is broken.&#34;Color gradients are supposed to be equally bright around the midpoint&#34;This is false. Nobody mandates this.There is no &#34;correct&#34; way to do it, every one of them is arbitrary (although some do look better than others and the suggested method is better than the default linear interpolation).It is completely analogous to smoothing curve in animation - it&#39;s about what sort of interpolation mechanism you use.If there would be a standard for specific perceptually pleasing gradient, then one could claim &#34;does not follow standard X&#34;.The point of the article is usually abslutely correct, though:
&#34;The correct way to process sRGB data is to convert it to linear RGB values first, then process it, then convert it back to sRGB if required.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is hard to say one couldn&#39;t see this coming. Of the few features left in Server, the only one I remained interested in was Profile Manager, and that hasn&#39;t worked right for a bit now. I&#39;m fine with an Apple that wants to do hardware and operating systems more than software, but I wish they&#39;d make Profile Manager-like features more available for regular people, not just Education or Business users. It would be infinitely useful to have such features for iPhones of family members who aren&#39;t so good with tech and could use a heavier hand in making sure the device is up to date and findable when lost. But I digress. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s just ending, even if it&#39;s barely a surprise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company that used the phrase &#34;getting jamf&#39;d&#34; as a verb to describe when the management system broke things on your macbook.E.g., &#34;I&#39;ll be able to test that code change in a bit, I got Jamf&#39;d pretty hard this morning and now my build is broken...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the mid 2000s, it looked like there was good hope that Apple would finally make inroads into corporate IT. In addition to their professional software suites (Shake, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Aperture, Motion, etc.), they had already released XServe, which was really good by those days&#39; standards, as well as XSan -- these products solved many of the needs of small professional creative groups. Mac OS X server&#39;s abilities to handle small offices&#39; needs seemed like a prelude to larger things.Sadly, those hopes never really panned out. Apple is historically reticent to entering a market they aren&#39;t confident they have a good chance of dominating if they execute well, and their own growing internal use of Linux servers (and maybe other 3rd-party corporate domain/directory services, like Active Directory?) probably persuaded them to scale back their efforts around 2010."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Actually, if you know what you are talking about, this filing actually shows Elon is about 21 billion dollars short. This is because 21 billion dollars of the commitment is coming from him and not from any financial institution. He is a very rich man but almost his entire wealth is tied up in tesla shares which he cannot sell in such large amounts and ownership of spacex which is even harder to sell.If he tries to sell 21 billion dollars worth of tesla shares, the share price will collapse.So no, once again he does not have funding secured. And once again he is trying to bullshit his way around the issue, although this time the bullshitting is a little more sophisticated.It is still possible that he tries to sell a lot of tesla shares to get the cash to buy twitter, but it is unlikely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I think Musk is having a bit of a laugh. This will never happen. *Twitter operating income for 12 m/e 31 Dec 2021 was negative. For the q/e 31 Dec 2021 it was $0.167B. Why he thinks Twitter is worth $45b is beyond me. What would Warren Buffett do? Well, he wouldn&#39;t buy Twitter, that&#39;s for sure.* Time will tell, of course. I&#39;ve been wrong before. But the whole thing seems like madness to me."</p>

What follows seems like Elon is &#34;paying&#34; for Twitter with... imaginary money.&#34;A debt commitment letter&#34;&#34;A separate debt commitment letter&#34;&#34;An equity commitment letter&#34;Am I understanding it correctly that effectively $0 is coming out-of-pocket for purchasing Twitter?Why can&#39;t anyone do this?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Why is it so expensive?&#34; - commentary from someone who does this for a living at SequentialSmall Volume - each unit is more expensive than a large volume product, you don&#39;t get price breaks on any components or tooling costsDesign focused - Who is the product for? It isn&#39;t for people who want to spend 250$ on a Behringer mixer. It is for people who want something that is high quality and doesn&#39;t break. Reliable. For people that rely on their tools to be creative or appreciate design. You are paying a premium. See Apple for lots of examples. This is also one of the biggest strengths of the company, if you want something cheap you&#39;re looking in the wrong place.Complex - the amount of balance of various components here adds a lot to the design and development costs. Battery is an unusual feature but puts it in a different product category. Balancing that with the audio quality and reliability is not a trivial problem. Add in wireless, audio drivers (not trivial at ALL), Complexity increases development time and adds risk to the long term stability of the product, that is added into the cost.Most of the small features feel like somebody there thought it would be fun and/or easy to put in. It&#39;s a good way to iterate through design ideas, you have to see it in reality. That type of prototyping isn&#39;t easy. Most people don&#39;t use 90% of the features but when you are in a creative industry the 1% that does absolutely LOVES it and uses it in ways you never expected. It&#39;s difficult to balance the amount of development you put into fun things vs. business cases.If you are trying to figure out why you&#39;d pay for this you aren&#39;t their target market. It&#39;s far more interesting (to me) to think about why some people WOULD pay for this and what a market looks like that you are not a part of"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like most Teenage Engineering products, it&#39;s an absolutely amazing-looking, well-engineered product with a ton of functionality that does a thing I don&#39;t actually need for far more money than I can justify spending on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;I think Go is the best programming language by far. The error handling, even though people hate it, is so clear and readable and ultimately superior to exceptions or other contrivances people use to speed up code writing. Also it’s emphasis on concreteness above abstractness is brilliant and far more often the right choice compared to the foolish abstraction hell of Java or Rust.Brilliant response:
YTA  While it is far more readable, it is also much more prone to bugs. The bugs will not be easy to find, because the errors won&#39;t give you much information about where to look. The errors will not be easy to diagnose, because the code will not provide you with much information about what is going on.  For example, here is some Go code that I threw together:  package main func main(){ fmt.Println(&#34;Hello, world!&#34;) }  And then I tried to run it:  $ go run Example.go hello, world! $  And I got:  $ go run Example.go hello, world! hello, world!  And I don&#39;t know what the hell is going on, and I don&#39;t know where to look to figure it out. And this is just one of many examples.  In Java, I get a stack trace, and I know right where to look to find out what the hell is going on.  In Go, I have no idea. I have to go look at the compiler output to see that the compiler got confused and ran my program multiple times in succession, jumped back and forth between"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hopefully this piece gets a lot more views, because this is an issue that pretty much any rational technoligist should get involved with. Here in NC, our state legislature also caved to cableco and telecom pressure to make it nearly impossible for muni broadband to spread. That was after a single city&#39;s service succeeded so spectacularly that the incumbents had visions of Armageddon.That&#39;s because they knew that even in this relatively center-right leaning state, people will know a good deal when they see it: so job 1 was to make sure they never do. So far their efforts at blocking competition have been successful. Except for a few very limited areas where Google Fiber was able to pry its way in, there has been no competition to the incumbents from muni or private parties.At this point our best hope may be that changing demographics and the undeniable drift away from traditional programming will result in their financial collapse, finally allowing communities to serve themselves.The other option is for people to get out and pressure their political reps to make muni or community broadband easier to deploy, maybe even run for office themselves and replace those who have sold out. Broadband access isn&#39;t as important as homelessness or healthcare, but it is important. Maybe it&#39;s a good place to start reversing the crappification of everything many here have lived through their whole lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We’ve had gigabit municipal internet here in Chattanooga for 12 years now. It’s better than Comcast in every possible way—speed, price, reliability, customer service, install time, install windows, availability (within the state limited geographical area) etc…There was a question on a local Facebook group the other day from a person who just moved here asking which ISP she should use.The replies were nothing but pages and pages of EPB, EPB, EPB… (EPB is the name of the municipal power company and ISP). Along with glowing reviews about how better their customer service is than Comcast.EPB is so much better, I’d have a really hard time moving somewhere else that didn’t have something similar."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in one of the few Canadian cities who were progressive enough to install city-managed fiber in most areas zoned for high-rise buildings.  Actual internet service is provided by ISPs, but they deliberately excluded the large telcos.Similar to the author, I also get 1Gbps symmetric, no outages, no data caps and I pay only $32 (Canadian) a month.  The telcos charge four times as much for the same service (but less reliable) in the residential areas not covered by the city network."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can vouch for the Framework. It doesn&#39;t feel beta at all. I&#39;m running Xubuntu 21.10 on it an it rocks. Someone created a repo with salt scripts which works all the kinks of the laptop under Ubuntu. The only thing I needed it for was to fix the touchpad issue after resume from sleep (it would be at max acceleration) and to enable hibernate (just note that you must disable secure boot first). https://github.com/lightrush/framework-laptop-formula"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lenovo has some pretty good sales on thinkpad X1s (at least they do in Canada - didn&#39;t check the US site).  But, if you&#39;re in Canada, I just bought this: https://www.newegg.ca/p/N82E16834233446?Description=gigabyte...It&#39;s got a gorgeous 4K OLED screen, a quite decent CPU and GPU, and it&#39;s currently $350 off + a $300 mail in rebate (there was an additional $350 off over the easter weekend, too).  The track pad is not my favorite, but it&#39;s good enough, and the keyboard is very decent.  I haven&#39;t had it very long and mostly it&#39;s plugged in so I can&#39;t comment too much about battery life.My biggest complaint is that the screen is too good.  When I&#39;m done with the laptop and come up to my desktop, my IPS screens look washed out and sad.  :PEdit: I didn&#39;t buy the X1, I bought a Gigabyte Aero 15."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recent and related:Go will use pdqsort in next release - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31106157 - April 2022 (112 comments)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi all, I&#39;m the author of pdqsort that&#39;s credited in the post (to be clear: the authors acknowledged pdqsort at the bottom, I am not associated with the posted work directly). I recently held a talk at my institute on efficient in-memory sorting and the ideas in pdqsort, in case you&#39;re interested in hearing some of the theory behind it all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz-PBiWwNjcNext week I will hold another talk in the Dutch seminar on data systems design (https://dsdsd.da.cwi.nl/) on glidesort, a new stable sorting algorithm I&#39;ve been working on. It is a combination of adaptive quicksort (like pdqsort, fully adaptive for many equal elements) and an adaptive mergesort (like timsort, fully adaptive for long pre-sorted runs). It is the first practical implementation of an algorithm I&#39;m aware of that&#39;s fully adaptive for both. Like pdqsort it uses modern architecture aware branchless sorting, and it can use an arbitrary buffer size, becoming faster as you give it more memory (although if given a constant buffer size it will degrade to O(n (log n)^2) in theory, in practice for realistic workloads it&#39;s just a near-constant factor (c ~&lt;= 3-5) slower).The source code isn&#39;t publish-ready yet, I have to still do some extra correctness vetting and testing, and in particular exception-safety is still not yet fully implemented. This is important because I wrote it in Rust where we must always give back a valid initialized array, even if a comparison operator caused a panic. But I do have some performance numbers to quote, that won&#39;t significantly change.For sorting 2^24 randomly shuffled distinct u32s using a buffer of 2^23 elements (n/2), glidesort beats Rust&#39;s stdlib slice::sort (which is a classic timsort also using a buffer of n/2) by a factor of 3.5 times. When stably sorting the same numbers comparing only their least significant 4 bits, it beats stdlib slice::sort by 12.5 times using 6.5 times fewer comparisons, both numbers on my Apple M1 Macbook. All of this is just using single-threaded code with a generic comparison function. No SIMD, no threads, no type-specific optimizations.Finally, glidesort with a buffer size of &gt;= n/2 is faster than pdqsort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun safety problems.Towards the end of this post, the author mentions a bunch of places where std::sort() blows up if your data or your sort rule doesn&#39;t exhibit strict weak ordering. In some cases you get a bad sort, which feels fair enough since you violated the rules the sort algorithm is relying on, but in others it literally has Undefined Behaviour in C++.Notably Rust&#39;s sort() and unstable_sort() do not have this problem, because of course these are safe Rust, and safe Rust doesn&#39;t have Undefined Behaviour. But why can this work?First up, one bullet which gets dodged is that Rust&#39;s floating point types (f32 and f64) are not Ord. Rust acknowledges that NaN != NaN and therefore we can&#39;t expect to go around sorting a slice of floating point values. In C++ that&#39;s on the programmer, in C++ the fact you can write a &lt; b means that type counts as ordered, even though it trivially isn&#39;t for several built-in types. So if you simply naively try to sort an [f32] Rust says you can&#39;t because it isn&#39;t Ord, you will need to write a lambda or whatever to Order these f32s and then if some of them are NaN your lambda is responsible for deciding what to do about that.But even if we insist on getting in harm&#39;s way, safe Rust promises to protect us anyway. For example if I make an array of a thousand misfortunate::OnewayGreater&lt;u8&gt;s they&#39;re only one byte each, yet they all insist they&#39;re Ordered greater than each other and even than themselves, Rust&#39;s sort() doesn&#39;t cause Undefined Behaviour on this input. It may never succeed, since all the elements to be &#34;sorted&#34; insist they&#39;re greater than each other, but it definitely won&#39;t segfault, trash unrelated memory or cause chaos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good lesson about the benefit of time when it comes to software development.  Mario 64 could have been a much much better game on the same hardware, but the time cost would have resulted in a release late enough that the entire game might have been considered irrelevant.Game consoles have had the benefit of the platform freezing for a few years allowing improvements to accumulate and later titles utilizing knowledge gained from the earlier titles.Much of the software we use every day could benefit from this level of scrutiny but the pressure to deliver on time means we won&#39;t get to see such benefits unless it becomes a crazy persons labour of love."</p>

This might be unpopular among the HN crowd, but I think you can monetize this further by bundling this with an advising service.This idea of FIRE has been spreading beyond techies/Internet nerds and into other highly paid professionals like doctors. [0]. The main difference is that non-programmer professionals generally don&#39;t get a thrill out of min/max-ing financial projections.Such people might be willing to pay a few hundred dollars a year for someone to generate this kind of analysis with them and simply execute on it each year. Similar to how people pay for CPAs. My employer actually pays Goldman Sachs to provide a similar service for its employees (no commission, fiduciary advisors) but their tools suck compared to this.[0] For example https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/, https://www.physicianonfire.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, I took some time to get a fairly in depth plan together. There are two things that stuck out:1. You&#39;ve got RSU&#39;s (at first it wasn&#39;t clear  to me where this would be addressed, but I think it made sense once I came across it) but I don&#39;t see a dedicated strategy for dealing with ISO/NSO&#39;s. That&#39;d be helpful for the tech community especially.2. I spent the 10-15 minutes working on a plan knowing that I&#39;d need to upgrade to pro for every feature, but it seems like I need to upgrade to save my plan. I ended up not paying because I don&#39;t have enough time right now to fully evaluate this, but I might look back later. It would have been great if I could have entered my email and saved my plan without paying, and then had to later pay to access it. This gives you the benefit of getting my email address, and then sending me an email to access my plan so that I&#39;ve got a second touchpoint to your product when I check my email in the future.Looking forward to using this more in depth in the future!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so incredibly impressed with this tool. In addition to the slick interface, it has some killer features and niceties:- You can add a &#34;dependent expense&#34; (have a kid) at a certain age- You can run Monte Carlo simulations of your portfolio performance- Expenses can be configured to increase linearly, with inflation, up to an amount, or using a custom function that the user can input graphically- Adding a house purchase automatically cancels out your existing rent expense if you indicate that it will be your residence- Easily visualize all of your projected earnings from portfolio growth and losses due to inflation and taxesAs an avid YNAB-er, this is heaven."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is amazing how many large-scale applications run on a single or a few large RDBMS. It seems like a bad idea at first: surely a single point of failure must be bad for availability and scalability? But it turns out you can achieve excellent availability using simple replication and failover, and you can get huge database instances from the cloud providers. You can basically serve the entire world with a single supercomputer running Postgres and a small army of stateless app servers talking to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To resolve this, we ended up choosing to leave foreign key constraints unenforced on a few large tables.&gt; We reasoned this was likely safe, as Retool’s product logic performs its own consistency checks, and also doesn’t delete from the referenced tables, meaning it was unlikely we’d be left with a dangling reference.I was holding my breath here and I&#39;m glad these were eventually turned back on.Nobody should ever rely on their own product logic to ensure consistency of the database.The database has features (constraints, transactions, etc) for this purpose which are guaranteed to work correctly and atomically in all situations such as database initiated rollbacks that your application will never have control over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey folks—I wrote the post! This was my biggest Postgres project to date, and it proved quite tricky since I didn&#39;t rehearse with a test database of the same size. I learned a bunch about Postgres, not least the incredibly powerful NOT VALID option for safely and quickly adding constraints.Happy to stick around and answer any questions you have."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Their math seems off.  I really don&#39;t see how you get to 97% renewable when the state was burning natural gas to generate 2.8 GW of non-renewable power and had about 1.1 GW of nuclear at the time.  There might be some funny math here where they assign all of the &#34;dirty&#34; power generated in the state to exports and can claim that that California is running on renewable power.Source:  https://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/supply.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The grid operator cited is the California Independent System Operator.  How much of CA&#39;s electricity consumption is fed by that operator?In the article they mention 23GW from wind and solar.  A quick search says in 2018 CA&#39;s electrical generation capacity was 80GW (which I assume has only gone up).  So this 97% is a bit misleading, no?  It doesn&#39;t represent 97% of total CA electricity usage... it&#39;s less than 30%?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a cool milestone, but it belies the current state of CA renewables, shown here at a very fine grain (data not current, need to go back a week): http://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/supply.htmlTo summarize, CA has to burn a lot of natural gas and import a lot of (mostly non-renewable) electricity from other states at night, and even more in the shoulder periods at morning and evening. Only untold billions in new batteries at the expense of ratepayers, and (barring storage breakthroughs) new nuclear or geothermal generation will fundamentally change this situation.A cool thing is that you can see grid demand drop hard during the days when behind-the-meter rooftop solar is on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are cases when server-side rendering (without SPA) is easier and faster. For example: documentation sites, blog-like sites, internet stores, sites like Hacker News. In all these cases, you can save on development time by writing just one application instead of two (server and client), and improve performance (no need to load multimegabyte JS applications and make multiple AJAX requests to display a page).Of course, there are cases when SPA-style application is better, for example: (graphic/circuit/text) editors, IDEs, mobile newsfeed-based apps - everything that resembles an app rather than a page with text, menus and images. But in these cases you usually don&#39;t need server-side rendering. And sometimes you cannot even use it - for example, if your code needs to know browser windows size to arrange objects on the page.So I think that SSR (running JS on server) is rarely useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using server-side rendering for many years now and I find it to be almost zero overhead at this point. Yes, I had to do some initial work to set things up, but these days I don&#39;t even remember it&#39;s there.Most people make an assumption that in order to have SSR you need to run JavaScript (e.g. Node most of the time) on your backend. That is not a valid assumption.I think the title of the article could benefit from adding &#34;using Node&#34;, because much of the complexity described is something I do not encounter at all. I&#39;m using Clojure and ClojureScript with Rum as a React interface. Much (if not most) of my code is in cljc files, which get compiled with Clojure (for JVM on the backend) or ClojureScript (for JavaScript on the frontend). And the ClojureScript advanced compilation takes care of only including what is strictly necessary in the frontend compiled JavaScript.I mean, sure, you need to be careful not to do stupid things like trying to read from files, but otherwise I just don&#39;t encounter much friction. And I reap the benefits of using a single language for both backend and frontend, with most of my data model (e.g. business logic) code written only once, with SSR being a nice cherry on top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been saying it for years - the hard part is not &#34;server side&#34; vs &#34;client side&#34;, it&#39;s making sure the state stays consistent between those 2 buckets.If you want to remove the hell from your life, you need to be all in on one or the other.For us, we&#39;ve been keeping all state server-side using things like Blazor and hand-rolled js-over-websocket UI frameworks. We never have to worry about more than ~10k users, so this works out great for us.If we were webscale, we&#39;d have to consider client side options."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any kids, so I don&#39;t really feel comfortable telling folks how to raise theirs.But I will tell you my perspective.As someone who grew up in the &#34;be back home in time for supper&#34; 1970s, today&#39;s world seems completely foreign. When I started kindergarten, Mom walked me to school on the first day so that I&#39;d know the route. And after that I walked to school on my own until I learned to ride a bike.I rode to junior high, where there was parking for hundreds of bikes. Recently I drove by that school, and the bike racks were gone. This whole concept of waiting in traffic to pick up or drop off your kid wasn&#39;t even a thing.And I&#39;m so supremely grateful that I was raised that way. I&#39;m absolutely certain that early autonomy paid off later in life in countless ways.I&#39;d encourage you, if you&#39;re raising kids, to consider the upsides of so-called &#34;free range&#34;. Or, as we called it in the 70s, &#34;being a regular kid&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not in the US they can&#39;t.&#34;officials placed two brothers into foster care after one, 11, was found playing basketball alone in his own yard.&#34;He&#39;d gotten home early from school and his parents came 90 minutes later. He was in his own yard. The family lost their children to foster care. Ironically in foster care ACTUAL abuse rates are pretty darn high!&#34;When Cindy and Fred arrived home they were arrested for child neglect — then fingerprinted, strip searched, and held in jail overnight.Their kids, meanwhile, including their 4-year-old boy, were removed from the home and from their parents’ custody&#34;Mom worked in the school district ironically.&#34;We still do not have our children, we are fighting for our own freedom and due to the nature of my employment I am no longer employed,” she wrote. “My son was in his own yard playing basketball, not in the street or at the park. The authorities claim he had no access to water or shelter. We have an open shed in the back yard and 2 working sinks and 2 hoses. They said he had no food. He ate his snacks already. He had no bathroom, but the responding officer found our yard good enough to relieve himself in while our son sat in a police car alone.&#34;Being accused of child abuse / neglect is a career ender. The idea of my 4 year old being taken is beyond belief. What is so ironic is so many real / terrible things are happening (crime of all sorts / abuse in the traditional sense / financial fraud online) where nothing happens. But your kid shoots some hoops in their own yard, you lose custody. You are jailed and strip searched. You lose your job.I realize big government is here to protect us, I just wish they would focus on the harder problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a parent, none of the risks are as profound as that of some other member of the public calling the police to inform on your “dangerous parenting”.I’ve deliberately chosen to live in a walkable part of the Bay Area in the hopes that my kids can be more independent when they get older, but I’m more worried about the social pushback than I am about their safety."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m excited to see more profiling tools for Python!This sounds like it does peak memory, which is critical for batch jobs, since that&#39;s the bottleneck. Memory is fundamentally different than performance in that it&#39;s a limited resource, instead of cumulative cost; making any part of the program faster almost always helps speed up the program (at least a little, or at least reduces CPU load), but optimizing non-peak memory has no impact. You have to be able to identify the peak in order to reduce memory usage.If you want peak memory profiling for Python that also runs on macOS, check out https://pythonspeed.com/fil/ (ARM support has some issues, but once I unpack my new Mac Mini I plan to fix it.)Ways memray is better than Fil:- Native callstacks.- More kinds of reports, and ability to do custom post-processing of data.- Much lower overhead (but not always, see reply).- Subprocess support.Fil I suspect has better flamegraphs: https://pythonspeed.com/articles/a-better-flamegraph/And if you&#39;re running Python batch jobs, and want both peak memory and performance profiling in production, check out Sciagraph: https://pythonspeed.com/sciagraph/(You can probably cobble together something like Sciagraph with py-spy + memray, but you won&#39;t e.g. get timeline reports designed with batch jobs in mind.)"</p>

My current one (HFT,MM) wouldn&#39;t go for it.It also shows good engineering practices.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why is no one questioning whether this is real?Reddit is full of far-fetched stories like this that ultimately turn up to be completely fabricated (obviously for the purpose of internet points). While this one isn&#39;t ridiculously far-fetched, it&#39;s definitely borderline.Also, the first thing that came to my mind when reading this was the movie Vivarium [1], where one of the main characters does almost exactly this. It sounds like the author watched that movie, modified it slightly, and posted it to /r/advice.[1] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8368406"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s interesting about this to me is the way it sort of causes you to examine why certain things are acceptable hobbies and other things aren&#39;t. This particular hobby has three notable attributes:1. It&#39;s risky.2. The end product doesn&#39;t seem particularly useful if we set aside the mental/physical benefits. i.e.: it&#39;s done for it&#39;s own sake.3. It&#39;s novel.I would argue that 1 and 2 are attributes that a great number of hobbies share. Skiing, Mountain biking, football, kayaking, woodworking, sitting in a chair and playing video games all weekend. All these things carry some very specific and often non trivial risks to health or bodily harm over time.Of course because these hobbies aren&#39;t novel, the benefits of the hobby are well understood. Our understanding of the risks and how to mitigate them are also quite a bit more understood.It seems to me that the real &#39;problem&#39; with this tunnel digging hobby is how novel it is. Which consequently leads to a lack of knowledge about what the risks and benefits may be.Of course it&#39;s possible the poor guy is just dealing with a mental illness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Second, AMP is bad for security. By design, AMP confuses users about what site they’re interacting with. Users think they’re interacting with the publisher, when in actuality the user is still within Google’s control. User-respecting browsers defend the site as the security and privacy boundary on the web, and systems like AMP intentionally confuse this boundary.They&#39;ve actually been pushing to confuse that boundary even more since 2019, with their Signed Exchanges specification[0][1]. In essence, when you (unintentionally) visit an AMP page from Google Search, the URL typically starts with google.com/amp/websiteyouwantedtogoto.com. Signed Exchanges is essentially a way to drop the &#34;google.com/amp/&#34; bit, as demonstrated by one of the animations on [0].Even Cloudflare supported this and rolled it out on their free tier[2].[0]: https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/04/instant-lo...[1]: https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18402628/google-amp-url-p...[2]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-amp-real-url/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos to Brave - they&#39;re a sometimes weird actor, but some of their initiatives are commendable, and they often do what Mozilla should have, but didn&#39;t.I rarely end up in AMP pages on my mobile, but when it happens I immediately feel like I stepped on a turd, and promptly backtrack / close the tab before it hijacks my back button, half the screen, standard controls (including doing something weird to scrolling) and other unpleasantries like banners whose &#34;x&#34; somehow overlaps my browser&#39;s bars, and are therefore out of reach (and said browser bars somehow do NOT autohide when scrolling, unlike on normal pages)Getting AMP results from Google search has been one of the drivers leading me to switch to DDG, so congrats Google, one less customer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything you need to know about AMP is in one very specific section of the spec:&#34;AMP HTML documents MUST...contain a &lt;script async src=&#34;https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag inside their head tag&#34; [1]Meaning, &#34;Your content must load and run some Google controlled javascript, that does who-knows-what to your content and end users&#34;.In the past, that&#39;s included injecting a big header that pushes your content down, hijacking swipe events on your page, an [X] button that looked like it would delete the AMP banner header, but instead navigated away from your page back to google, etc.[1] https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/spe..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These are boogieman policies that have zero influence on the root cause.Foreign investors jump into the housing market because the current system ensures that the supply of housing is limited so it is an attractive way to park your wealth.But that is not the root cause.The root cause is the system that is geared to keep houses always appreciating via supply constraints: aggressive zoning, discretionary permitting, NIMBYism.Until we liberalize zoning, legalize building, and reject the idea that houses have to be appreciating assets, the issue will continue.As it is often the case, politicians go for the headline with the highest electoral ROI, rather than tackle the real issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a homeowner in Toronto and I don&#39;t think this will help. They&#39;ve eliminated a small number of buyers from the market but have added other incentives like a first home buyers tax credit that will only fuel the fire - Australia tried this with tragic results.&gt;&gt; working with provinces and territories to develop and implement a Home Buyers’ Bill of Rights and bring forward a national plan to end blind bidding.Blind bidding is where multiple parties submit a sealed bid on a property. The realtor and seller review these bids behind close doors and then often request subsequent rounds of bids from the bidders *without telling them the current winning bid, or who&#39;s bid is winning*. Bidders end up out-bidding themselves.IMHO blind bidding is an unethical practice that should be outlawed regardless of its impact on housing prices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick look at the data suggests only about 2% of properties in Toronto and Vancouver are owned by overseas investors. Yes, housing is priced at the margin, but this won&#39;t do anything at all to prices over the long term.I&#39;m sure this will be wildly popular politically, because people LOVE the idea that some foreign boogieman is the reason their children can&#39;t afford homes anymore.It&#39;s much easier to outsource your problems to some outside &#34;other&#34; then deal with the much harder task of introspection over the poor housing policy that you and your neighbors have voted for over the last 60 years.Like all cities in areas with heavy-handed zoning regulations, abuse of historic preservation clauses, and filibuster-style city council meetings blocking new construction...the issue is one of supply.It&#39;s the same problem in literally every developed country on earth right now. The industrious, forward-looking people who originally built the cities during the major growth phase died...and then their kids grew up believing that the way things ended up was somehow divinely ordained. Never to be changed or built upon again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting concept. However there are a few issues that surface quickly (this is all assuming a feed through scanner and not a flatbed).#1 - It rotates AND scales to fit. It&#39;s not obvious until you rotate a stupid amount, but pages don&#39;t shrink when scanned for real.#2 - The scanning rotation is way too uniform. Most scans twist a bit, typically near the top when more of the page is in the scanner to straighten it out.#3 - With #2 there should be some stretching/skewing that isn&#39;t uniform.#4 - The noise is way too uniform as well. It looks like static. Typical scanned documents have noise that is much more variable. You also get other scanning artifacts like streaks for dirt on the scan head.#5 - The page ends often aren&#39;t even and introduce artifacting as well.#6 - Needs an option for chewed up staple corner and/or holepunch."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ooh! I have a mockingbird in my yard that I can try this on! I counted 20 different songs the other night, and it was probably a lot more, I just stopped being able to distinguish. They can have a repertoire of over 200! I  was actually wondering if something like this project existed, or maybe just an app really, but then hadn&#39;t thought about it since (I&#39;m just an insomniac, not a bird watcher). Very cool.If you don&#39;t know about the North American mockingbird, they fly up to a high perch at night and claim a yard sized area of territory by reciting all the songs it knows, as loud as it can. Over and over again, until it is exhausted. The little psychos. Thus impressing all the lady mockingbirds in the area. Apparently they do a little dance as well, but given it&#39;s usually the middle of the night when this happens, I haven&#39;t seen it.They used to drive me nuts until I read up on them. Now I try to count how many songs they know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BirdNET and Pl@ntNet have to be my favorite uses of AI to date. A true use of technology for the greater good.I&#39;ve actually been thinking about automated bird recognition for a while now, I live underneath a flight corridor for migrating common cranes (near Berlin). I&#39;d love to be able to one day track their migration across the continent in real time using data from crowdsourced base stations.I wonder if migrating birds could be identified in flight using optical/radar/audio. If anybody else has had similar ideas I&#39;d really love to chat on this topic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be very cool to have network of these listening to calls while birds are migrating at night. With a large enough network you&#39;d get an amazing way to visualise large scale movements which are generally completely invisible. Wiring up the eastern seaboard around Massachusetts, southern Spain, the vast steppes around the Caspian Sea or pretty much anywhere else would be incredible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there&#39;s a valid concern with this; a concern which is not necessarily distilled down to &#34;big brother&#34; or &#34;corporate overlords&#34;.Google is so large that any stance they take, no matter how minuscule, has immense influence.Case in point, from this article:
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/technology/google-maps-ne...&gt; For decades, the district south of downtown and alongside San Francisco Bay here was known as either Rincon Hill, South Beach or South of Market. This spring, it was suddenly rebranded on Google Maps to a name few had heard: the East Cut.&gt; The peculiar moniker immediately spread digitally, from hotel sites to dating apps to Uber, which all use Google’s map data. The name soon spilled over into the physical world, too. Real-estate listings beckoned prospective tenants to the East Cut. And news organizations referred to the vicinity by that term.My point is, it might seem like a small, inconspicuous change.  But at Google-scale, this actually has an impact on the real world, and personally I don&#39;t feel confident with Google deciding what words are the correct words."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Me: 20 years in the defense space business. Stating my own opinion.This is basically right. The problem with space imagery is that almost everyone who wants it has a niche use case, and those few organizations without a niche use case (the US Weather Service, various militaries, etc) generally want imagery that&#39;s so specialized to their own problem that they have to spec, buy, and operate their own orbital assets.Take Ukraine as an example. Leaving aside the moral question of whether a satellite imagery company should be profiting off the Ukrainian war, Ukraine appears to be using commercial orbital imagery providers to figure out Russian troop movements. That use case is not one any commercial provider anywhere is going to build an ML model for. But analysts working on behalf of Ukraine can absolutely either use raw pixels or develop their own ML algorithms that run on top of the raw pixels to find Russian tanks.And almost every other potential user is similar. They&#39;re all looking for something different. Oil companies want to pre-screen drilling locations. NGOs want to look at deforestation in Brazil or methane leaks in Saudi Arabia. You could even go all the way down to individuals -- at the right price, individual farms might want to look at relative growth rates of corn in their fields, or soil moisture levels, etc. Or they might want to count heads of cattle or sheep, or... or... or.The point being, outside of weather, which we already know how to get to end users without having them subscribe to an orbital imagery provider service, every customer is different, and what they want from the pixels is different. It&#39;s basically the long-tail problem. In order to be profitable you have to fill an enormous number of niche use cases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Allow me to put it more succinctly: selling derived data as a subscription product does. not. work. I don’t care what it is. The juice is never worth the squeeze.¹ Count cars. Count airplanes. Count ships. Segment land cover. Track oil inventories. Estimate biofuels. Measure water levels. Etc. Etc. Etc.I see that he outlined a few exceptions at the footnote… I&#39;ll also add Plaid. I think this guy is making some huge generalizations that don&#39;t hold up beyond his industry.But that said, I recently downgraded two potential startups based on data feeds to personal projects because I realized that nobody really pays for data, and if there is any value then the providers will figure that out inevitably…Another recent example: I&#39;ve been using Deliveries for Mac and iOS for over fifteen years, a very simple, perfectly-designed, laser focused app. Both Amazon (not surprising) and Fed Ex (quite surprising) have decided that freely providing delivery dates to consumers is too valuable to leave to third parties, so the beloved app is shuttering sometime this year.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an agronomist I used satellite imagery a lot for monitoring farm crops for our customers.  Started in the early eighties going up in a Cessna laying on my belly where the passenger seat was sticking a 35mm camera out a repair port.But that got old and started researching satellite options.  Problems was our company entire sales area was three West Michigan counties.  All the companies wanted to sell me, I forget the term but say a tract (scene?), that was half the state.I didn&#39;t have a problem with the price per acre but wanted to buy by the section or 640 acres.  It didn&#39;t make a lot of sense to buy the township but they wouldn&#39;t even sell me by the county.  At the time probably 5% of my customers wanted this service and only wanted to buy just part of their acreage.I asked all these vendors why they couldn&#39;t sell me by the township.  They routinely answered they&#39;d lose money because they couldn&#39;t sell the rest of the tract.  I said now you understand my problem, at a certain point you&#39;ve got to break up a tract or give up on the market.  Most of the company&#39;s ended up leaving ag.I eventually found a company that would sell by the section at a higher but still manageable price.  Course then I discovered that in four flyovers a season the majority had clouds over the field and you couldn&#39;t see anything ;&lt;(.  Such is the pain of being an early user in any field.FYI The military has satellites using radar to see through the clouds, but in thirty years that tech hasn&#39;t made it to the commercial operators.The answer I think is automated drones that fly a circuit.  The tech has been available for a few years but the government won&#39;t approve it for that use.  In fact the FAA won&#39;t even let a Detroit company demonstrate they could successfully evade objects, they ran out of funding and shut their doors ;&lt;(."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting, the separate compute and storage tiers is another system going that direction which I think is becoming almost the standard at this point, especially for &#34;cloud-native&#34; things designed to run on k8s. From what I can tell (it isn&#39;t very explicit on this point) they are avoiding a distributed consensus at the storage layer and instead relying on a single writer/multiple reader model with the single writer being enforced by assignment of the tablets in the compute tier, with the tablet being responsible for writing to multiple storage nodes for durability? (But I might be wrong)Assuming yes this approach, I think, is under utilized and is pretty similar to how Apache Pulsar works (my day job),but I am not sure how many distributed RDBMS have tried it out, will be cool to see how it evolves! It isn&#39;t clear how they ensure the assignment of a tablet to only a single compute node, but I think that is an easier problem relative to distributed consensus at the storage tier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems random developers were targeted as well as European Parliament members (and more):&gt; Jordi Baylina is the technology lead at Polygon, a popular decentralised Ethereum scaling platform. He is also an advisor on projects related to digital voting and decentralisation, and has built a widely-used privacy toolkit. He was extensively targeted with Pegasus, receiving at least 26 infection attempts. Ultimately, he was infected at least eight times between October 2019 and July 2020.&gt; Baylina received a text message masquerading as a boarding pass link for a Swiss International Air Lines flight he had purchased. Targeting in this case indicates that the Pegasus operator may have had access to Baylina’s Passenger Name Record (PNR) or other information collected from the carrier.Scare stuff that not just random text messages can infect you (we knew this) but combined with harvesting other data (like PNR), they can time to exploit messages with other actions you do (like buying an flight ticket) and get you that way.I was scared of receiving random text messages already, but easy to just ignore them as they have nothing to do with me. But if I buy a flight ticket and receive a text message that looks relevant to me, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to guess it was actually malicious. Scary stuff.Edit: The more I read, the worse it gets:&gt; Another common mode of targeting was to masquerade as official notifications from Spanish government entities, including the Tax and Social Security authorities.The messages also used SMS Sender IDs to masquerade as official agency accounts.&gt; Notably, fake official messages were sometimes highly personalized. For example, a message sent to Jordi Baylina included a portion of his actual official tax identification number, suggesting that the Pegasus operator had access to this information.Seems clear at this point that the official Spanish government was behind these attacks, or the official registries got hacked (together with various delivery companies). Both are bad, but that signs are pointing to the earlier makes it even worse.It seems that the Spanish government can&#39;t help itself to give more fuel to the fire that is the fight for Catalan independence. Who&#39;d want to belong to a state that constantly suppresses and surveillance you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"CEOs, executives, members of parliaments, journalists, researchers at industrial labs, those working in defense/military, etc are at elevated risk of being hacked by governments and hacking companies such as NSO.I wonder how these people protect their digital assets?
Are there guidelines?For example, if I am Microsoft CEO, would it be okay if I use the closed source iPhone from a competing company? Or perhaps these people use special hardened devices?Because even Apple CEO uses iPhone, and Pegasus apparently could hack any iPhone with zero click. So what prevents acquisition of highly valuable inside information by NSO or its customers (sensitive data about the company, iOS source code, implanting malware by infecting Apple engineers for the next exploit, etc)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;On LinkedIn, our members trust us with their information, which is why we prohibit unauthorized scraping on our platform.&#34;This is an unpersuasive argument because it ignores all the computer users who are not &#34;members&#34;.  Whether or not &#34;members&#34; trust LinkedIn should have no bearning on whether other computer users who may or may not be &#34;members&#34; can retrieve others&#39; public information.Even more, this statement does not decry so-called scraping only &#34;unauthorised&#34; scraping.  Who provides &#34;authorisation&#34;.  Surely not the LinkedIn members.It is presumptuous if not ridiculous for &#34;tech&#34; companies to claim computer users &#34;trust&#34; them.   Most of these companies recieve no feedback from the majority of their &#34;members&#34;.  Tech companies generally have no &#34;customer service&#34; for the members they target with data collection.Further, there is an absence of meaningful choice.  It is like saying people &#34;trust&#34; credit bureaus with their information.  History shows these data collection intermediaries could not be trusted and that is why Americans have the Fair Credit Reporting Act."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Web scraping is legal&#34; seems to be an overbroad interpretation - the Ninth Circuit is merely reaffirming a preliminary injunction in light of a recent and separate ruling by the Supreme Court. The opinion [1] only weighs the merits hiQ&#39;s request for injunctive relief, and doesn&#39;t say anything about the meatier topic of web scraping legality.I think the real action will be the ruling of the district court.[1] https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2022/04/18/1..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I have sympathy for what the scrapers are trying to do in many cases, it bothers me that this doesn&#39;t seem to address what happens when badly-behaved scrapers cause, in effect, a DOS on the site.For the family of sites I&#39;m responsible for, bot traffic comprises a majority of traffic - that is, to a first approximation, the lion&#39;s share of our operational costs are from needing to scale to handle the huge amount of bot traffic. Even when it&#39;s not as big as a DOS, it doesn&#39;t seem right to me that I can&#39;t tell people they&#39;re not welcome to cause this additional system load.Or even if there was some standardized way that we could provide a dumb API, just giving them raw data so we don&#39;t need to incur the additional expense of the processing for creature comforts on the page designed to make our users happier but the bots won&#39;t notice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The upsells on TurboTax are getting a lot more shameless in recent years.  I saw the exact same one pop up at least 2-3 times.The one that really aggravated me though was the one at the end: after you FILE your taxes, they present this damned progress-bar looking thing as if you are somehow “not done” yet, as if this totally optional product sale is a required step!!  No, no, no, that is just misleading garbage, and it is so annoying to have to constantly hunt around the page for the magic text to get around these things.  I mean, I couldn’t even reach the page that lets me download my forms as PDF until I skipped this upsell.What’s more, the product itself is getting more expensive but worse.  On desktop, the whole thing is just a blown-up mobile UI (are that many people doing taxes on their phones!?) with all kinds of things unnecessarily hidden.  On page after page, there is more than enough space to show everything but instead it’s giant white space everywhere; they HIDE things behind disclosure arrows, and with no logic whatsoever; e.g. on one page it shows the 2020 numbers by default but hides all the 2021 numbers behind arrows!?Guess what isn’t an insultingly-small, truncated experience on desktop?  The ads, the upsells.  THOSE are full-page, taking full advantage of screen space and even scrolling off the edges.Really shows their priorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done my taxes on Turbotax for a few years, and didn&#39;t even check alternate options because I had the perception they were clunky.I&#39;ve tried for the first time FreeTaxUSA to prepare my mother&#39;s tax return. Guess what? It&#39;s even better than Turbotax in some aspects(the UI is similar, but doesn&#39;t waste your time with animations), and way cheaper. It only charges you to file state but, if you come from the Free File IRS website (and are under the income requirements), it doesn&#39;t even charge you that. There&#39;s one upsell for their tax consultants or whatever, but it&#39;s only done once.It does not automatically import W2s though, but that saves you maybe 5 minutes per W2. Not sure about stock transactions import either, it seems they can&#39;t import from brokers. I will have to check next year. They do seem to have spreadsheet import, so maybe that&#39;s something we (as in, HN community) could fix until they have the feature.The competition seems to have improved as well, although I don&#39;t have first hand knowledge (but watched some youtube reviews where they walk through the filing with every software).It&#39;s time we ditch Intuit. If we can&#39;t have free IRS software, then we should at least bleed Intuit dry.EDIT: it&#39;s particularly egregious that Intuit came up with the Free File program as a compromise so that IRS wouldn&#39;t have their own tax software, only to leave the program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Spain I log onto the tax agency website using my digital certificate. It tells me what I have been paid during the year, what I own, how big my mortgage is, etc. If I agree I click a button and pay whatever I owe. If I don&#39;t agree, or some info is missing, I add it in and then click the button.It&#39;s astronomically easier than filing the same tax information in the US and takes far less time even though the tax code is less clearly written and user support is almost totally nonexistent.The nonexistence of a national ID system makes digital identification unnecessarily difficult. The idea that an individual has to redeclare to the IRS what has already been declared to the IRS on W2s and 1099s is just stupid.The US tax filing system is simply primitive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the years, I have become convinced that much of the observed age-correlated cognitive decline in people younger than ~70 results from voluntary life choices, such as settling into fixed behavioural patterns (e.g. doing the same thing over and over for decades) and lack of exposure to new stimuli.It&#39;s the case for some physical activities as well: almost all people&#39;s actual performance degrades way, way faster, than their potential peak performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m 53 and recently embarked on a complex self-guided mini-medical education to try to understand my son&#39;s rare condition.I&#39;ve pushed my way through a 400 page nursing textbook, dozens of scientific papers and a 900 page freshman neuroscience textbook (currently at page 90).I never took any bioscience class after high school software chem.There have been ups and downs. Mentally comparing myself to when I was in school and reading comparable material, I feel my ability to master it was at or above that - at its best. However the amount of time I spend &#34;at my best&#34; in general is MUCH lower than when I was that age.Today I have trouble sleeping many nights. An old hip injury and also anxiety.A night I don&#39;t sleep well is definitely not going to be followed by a day where I gain understanding of neuronal membrane chemistry.Didn&#39;t have those issues when I was 17 - any time was study time.So I guess this goes along with the thesis of the story. Mental powers are there, but other body systems aren&#39;t able to support the brain&#39;s demands at quite the same level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AbstractResponse speeds in simple decision-making tasks begin to decline from early and middle adulthood.However, response times are not pure measures of mental speed but instead represent the sum of multiple processes.Here we apply a Bayesian diffusion model to extract interpretable cognitive components from raw response time data. We apply our model to cross-sectional data from 1.2 million participants to examine age differences in cognitive parameters.To efficiently parse this large dataset, we apply a Bayesian inference method for efficient parameter estimation using specialized neural networks.Our results indicate that response time slowing begins as early as age 20, but this slowing was attributable to increases in decision caution and to slower non-decisional processes, rather than to differences in mental speed.Slowing of mental speed was observed only after approximately age 60.Our research thus challenges widespread beliefs about the relationship between age and mental speed."</p>

Unfortunately, it seems health clubs(and I assume gyms?) are exempt from this when they are like 80% of the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; Today, just six conglomerates — Comcast, Disney, AT&amp;T, Sony, Fox, and Paramount Global (formerly known as ViacomCBS) — control 90% of what you watch, read, or listen to.No google/youtube?  No twitter?  No facebook?  Is this article from the past?  Most people do not get their information from the television and so I doubt these six control most of anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Americans spend an average of 12 and a half hours per day consuming news via the television, Internet, newspapers, magazines, and radio.This just doesn&#39;t make sense. The average American spends the majority of waking hours consuming news?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My anecdotal experience with the people I meet and talk with fall into two very clear buckets: those that read books and those that don&#39;t.I&#39;ve been able to predict with 100% accuracy so far (N=12) which bucket a person falls into solely based on if the person regurgitates mainstream narratives uncritically, regardless of political party. Having a discussion with someone that has additional information external to the narrative seems to be in short supply and stands out, probably more than it should.I&#39;m curious if anyone else on HN has experienced similar and/or can provide some further insight to this phenomena. Thanks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From reading the other comments here, I understand that it&#39;s easy to pick something RMS said and say &#34;Yeah, right...&#34;But you have to keep in mind that RMS advocates the free software philosophy - the complete left end of the software spectrum - the white angel on your shoulder (not the red devil on the other).And while I find some of his points too radical to implement practically in my own situation, I believe it&#39;s very important that we have someone like him in the tech world. As a result, whenever there is a RMS talk, I listen to it. And each time I gain new and valuable perspectives about free software that help guide future decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, more free games? It doesn&#39;t satisfy an urgent practical need, obviously... But the crucial thing is, free ones might make it easier for some people to say, &#39;Let&#39;s move off this non-free thing, and play a game that is free. So we can have the same pleasure, but without paying freedom as the price.&#39;“i&#39;m sorry but i just can&#39;t read this without laughing. what does stallman think gamers are like?i can only imagine the average teenage gamer trying to get their friends to stop playing virtually every game on the market and instead play some obscure game and trying to teach them how to install gcc and git to get it running"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Around the 8 and 9 min mark RMS talks about old hardware losing software support, like 32 bit systems. I am a kernel developer and the kernel removes code for a lot of older systems all the time (often lesser known 32bit ARM systems).Phoronix reported that 5.18 removed the Andes NDS32 CPU arch code. https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux-51...The reason they do this is because a lot of these systems can break as the internal kAPIs change all the time and the users will not know since the embedded custom distro of software + kernel is not upgraded. Support can be broken for these arches for years until someone gets these systems second hand and posts about them, but may not care to fix it or it is cheaper to replace it.RMS calls this a major issue, specifically 32-bit support in Ubuntu. I do not agree. My last 32 bit computer died a long time ago after the battery died years ago. It was a Gateway so getting replacement parts would be difficult. I also was never able to get it to run Linux. Aside from my brother-in-law finding his old laptop no one I know uses 32 bit computers (well except for myself with my Pi Zero: ARM v6, which I used once).It just feels like the wrong battle to pick when Linux&#39;s biggest competitor is forcing practically all PCs to use a bootloader signed with their key. Major vendors can choose to refuse to allow users to install their own key. They are already locking CPUs (Ryzens) to their brand of motherboards with a builtin fuse provided by AMD. He of course talks about it-it just feels like the 32 bit part distracts from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not to tone police that much but I really don&#39;t get people like Casey. Like his whole thing is spending a billion years writing his game engine, and then whining about all these &#34;bloated&#34; tools. Just completely dismissive of everything that doesn&#39;t align directly with his values (which don&#39;t include actually shipping game!)I like people who write their own engines and make bespoke things for fun. Just really dislike people who lack the imagination to wonder why some people just want to make games rather than spend their life writing engine code, and actively shitting on stuff that exists. Just so much negative energy to put out in the world.Of course in practice Unity _is_ a major pain in the butt but UE has the nice aspect of actually working for very large projects and shipping stuff. Yeah there&#39;s obtuse stuff, but in practice what happens is you join a team and then you actually learn to use it. In exchange you have releases.The one thing that really is rough for me with _both_ UE and Unity is that they&#39;re both very oriented towards teams with dedicated art people who can put out assets to use. BSP-based workflows where you can quickly greybox out levels to playtest (basically giving level designers without art sense a fighting chance) are much nicer with older engines.There&#39;s a nice missing middle that Valve kinda fills with Source, except everyone that has worked with Source seems to dislike it for other reasons. But I&#39;m sure we could make 3D engines with nicer usability for people who, for lack of a better word, can&#39;t 3D model too great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a software developer I&#39;ve worked with Unity and Unreal in a professional capacity for many years, and shipped quite a few games on both engines. Unreal is powerful, but really shows its game development studio and FPS game roots. Unity has limitations, I won&#39;t deny that. And both engines have their own issues and different frustrations in using and deploying them. I have also shipped games on internal, custom built engines too. From a business perspective, hiring Unity developers, i.e. people who can code in C#, is a lot easier. Unreal developers are plentiful, but their knowledge of the guts of Unreal usually stops at the surface level, barely dipping below Blueprints, at least from my experience.Personally, I prefer Unity over Unreal, but am not averse to using either, in the right context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In this critique of unity they say that the back half of making a game is the half of suffering. In my experience, it highlights something else that is a massive problem in the game dev space. The game dev community is stuck in software practices of 2005, leading to naive implementation patterns.As a hobbyist game developer of ~1year, one thing that struck me was how I have not found many good sources of teaching that explains how to make a maintainable game. How does one make a code base for a video game that has desirable the non-functional qualities like maintainability? That question doesn&#39;t really have an answer...I think it doesn&#39;t have an answer because those teaching game development haven&#39;t really asked. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s due to many factors.For anecdotal, I&#39;ve asked about testing and CI/CD for unity in online spaces. There isn&#39;t much content on these critical subjects in the video game education space. I usually get a mix of responses but one that stuck out to me is that video games aren&#39;t appropriate for tests and it just slows down game creation.I think that thought process more than anything is what leads to back half issues. I think that the video game industry has lagged behind the rest of the software industry and there is a huge opportunity for disruption.In 5-10 years people should think it&#39;s absolutely outlandish to start a complex software project such as a video game project without a CI/CD engine running a suite of sensible tests. I think today that is true for most software projects, although as a community were still wrapping our heads around &#34;what is a good test?&#34;My 2cents"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My key takeaways:1. Uber is actually a higher cost/less efficient producer of urban car services than the taxi companies it has driven out of business2. Individual Uber drivers with limited capital cannot acquire, finance, maintain and insure vehicles more economically than Yellow Cab3. Expenses other than drivers, vehicles, and fuel account for 15 percent of traditional taxi costs but Uber charges drivers 25-30 percent without coming close to covering their actual costs4. Uber’s surge pricing does not improve efficiency, it simply prices those night shift workers out of the market5. And as Uber has demonstrated, unlimited taxi market entry can lead to ruinous overcapacity and can allow part-timers to cherry-pick the peak revenue that full-time drivers depend on to cover their costs6. Uber’s investors knew that it needed raw political power to accelerate growth, and to maintain its hoped-for dominance7. Uber’s major strategic breakthrough was to treat business development as an entirely political process, using techniques that had proven successful in partisan political settings8. All of Uber’s early popularity and rapid revenue and valuation growth are explained by the billions in predatory investor subsidies needed to drive those more efficient (but poorly capitalized) incumbents into bankruptcy9. That [early popularity] allowed [Uber] to pursue more stratospheric valuations by exploiting anticompetitive market power and rent-extraction and buying out any potential competitive threats"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel this entire thread has quite missed the point of the question
the way a neutrino passes through a solid object and interacts with
nothing but empty space.People have talked about microeconomics, gig economies, labour
shifting, bad old days, safety, subsidies, licenses.... but we&#39;ve
gotten no closer to understanding;&#34;Why Is a Company That Lost Billions Claimed to Be Successful?&#34;To answer this one must ask &#34;What is financialisation?&#34; The short
answer is; a system in which the success or failure of a company is of
no relevance to its &#34;value&#34;. Under financialised logic it is
absolutely immaterial whether Twitter, Uber or whatever make a
penny. Ever. Or whether any of the stakeholders are served. The rules
of traditional business go out the window. All that matters is the
stock price of a tradable financial entity (a company) based on brand
confidence/perception.Under that system, Uber is successful so long as the financial market
says it is. When it decides it&#39;s not successful, it&#39;s not. One has to
realise that a total detachment of political economics and power has
taken place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When traveling in India, I foolishly took a cycle rickshaw. It was gross/shameful. A man far less fortunate than I was sweating, working hard, barely getting paid, and breathing horribly polluted New Delhi air while I just sat there.When Uber started to squeeze its drivers, I again felt just like this. I hated hearing drivers complain about their life problems. I hated doing the math and seeing how little these people were making out of this transaction. I hated feeling like a perpetrator of class division.The common argument in support of Uber’s poor economics is their superior user experience compared to taxis. However, exploitative industry is a terrible “user experience” for the ethically- or morally-conscious. And that’s just the privileged party’s perspective…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Key takeaways:1. One of the best ways to improve your writing is to learn how to cut out words that are not necessary2. Stuffy writing is bad writing! It lowers the power of your brain and mine!3. What words should you never use in writing? Words whose exact meanings you don’t know! Never use a word unless you know EXACTLY what it means4. If your writing is nonsense, maybe your thoughts are nonsense too!5. To keep things clear and readable: Put the main point of each paragraph in its first sentence6. Pretend you’re writing a textbook! That’s how I ended up writing so many books...Organizing knowledge Learning is a lot like writing a book7. I often write the introduction last, after I know what it will introduce!8. Never draw the reader’s eye to anything that is not the main point"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my writing gem: when you send an email, you either want them to know something or do something, so say that in the first sentence:Good: &#34;FYI, our etcd cluster is broken, but we&#39;re working to fix it.&#34;Bad: &#34;I came in this morning, and while I was going through my emails when I saw a message about one of the nodes in our cluster. So I checked it out, and sure enough it was down, and I went to the console and saw the kernel had panicked, so I ... [much further down] and that&#39;s when I realized our etcd cluster was down.&#34;The later is what I call The Narrative: people have a natural inclination to tell a story, but the irony is that usually what&#39;s at the end of the story is the thing that should be first (&#34;the cluster is down!&#34;).Similarly when asking for something:Good: &#34;Could you please get me a new monitor? I&#39;m getting headaches from the current one&#39;s constant flickering&#34;Bad: &#34;I had a headache yesterday, so I had to leave early—I hope that&#39;s okay. Anyway, I&#39;m not sure about the purchase requisition process. I think there&#39;s a resonating frequency between the 60Hz electric system and my monitor&#39;s refresh rate, but I&#39;m not an electrical engineer. By the way, the new chair is great ...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One useful first step in becoming a better writer - in particular if your subject is complex - is to to delete your Twitter account and never look at another Twitter thread.  Character limits kill creativity and complexity.The presentation does leave out one very necessary requirement for becoming a good-to-great writer: you have to do a lot of reading.  If you&#39;re going to write about a complex scientific or technical subject, you should have some examples in mind of great texts that you&#39;ve read.  What did other writers do that you liked or that stuck with you?  Equally true, what are some really bad examples, some things to avoid?For example, here&#39;s what I think is an excellent popular history book, and if I ever wrote something with a historical bent, I&#39;d flip though it first:
&#34;By Steppe, Desert, and Ocean: The Birth of Eurasia&#34; by Barry Cunliffehttps://www.amazon.com/Steppe-Desert-Ocean-Birth-Eurasia/dp/...The point about Twitter is really this: you have to develop the skill of composing a paragraph as a coherent entity in order to become a decent writer, and Twitter doesn&#39;t allow for paragraphs, just sentences (and short ones at that).  Paragraphs should have an internal cohesion to help the reader absorb the concept being presented.  Once you have that, you can start chaining paragraphs together, reordering the sequence of paragraphs, with the goal of constructing a path that the reader can follow through the whole essay or chapter.  Getting the order right is important for complex topics, as point D might rely on a good understanding of points A and B, and so on.  Your goal should be to make the reader feel smart.Of course that&#39;s just advice for non-fiction writing; if you&#39;re doing fiction or poetry basically anything goes.  The public might like it or hate it, but the literary critics can safely be ignored."</p>

Provisioning high QoS to the speedtest site is common practice (see fast.com for countermeasures), but changing the entire subscriber QoS because traffic to one particular destination is detected seems like too much work and doesn&#39;t really achieve anything useful.If you are on a wireless network (either your upstream from a WISP, or internally on your own network), then I&#39;d suspect some wireless air access control syndrome is the cause -- e.g. stations are usually randomly fighting for air, but when you pull down your big speed test file that ends up putting the network in a state where your station gets all the air time. Lo and behold all your traffic has better QoS. Basically your speedtest traffic, because it is a constant stream, shoved everyone else off the air and allowed your other traffic to get through at the same time as a result."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I taught comedy improv for many years. One tip I would give new performers is to adopt an alter ego for the stage (a fun fake name and/or personality) and to choose a totem (an object) that they wear to do just that such as shoes, a shirt, watch, etc.This helped so many different people such as accountants, pre-k teachers, stay-at-home moms, and even university professors get out of their shells, prevent their stage fright, and to be more energetic on-stage when their normal persona is calm, cool, and collected.I do believe we also have an alter ego in three different situations such as work, home, and play. Another common thing I would teach is that you can alter your characters in scenes easily by adopting one of those personas of the character you&#39;re portraying.I believe many people adopt an alter ego without knowing it today. These are YouTubers, Streamers, Conference Speakers, and really anything where there&#39;s a concept of a &#34;stage&#34;.The book &#34;The Alter Ego Effect&#34; by Todd Herman goes into this further, but my favorite material on this is &#34;Impro&#34; by Keith Johnstone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Immediately made me think of VTubing. A lot of vtubers now are among the most popular streaming channels on Youtube and many of them are probably what you could call above average performers in terms of what content they put out, from music to narrative fiction.Also reminded of me of an interview with Buckethead explaining his alter ego:&#34;&#34;Because I was always super scared to play, and I didn&#39;t really link that together, I just thought &#39;This is weird.&#39; Like a horror movie guy. And when he saw it he was like &#39;You should just go for it!&#39; I was like &#39;That would be cool.&#39; Because I could do everything I liked doing as this character that I&#39;m totally scared to death to do otherwise. And it applied to all the stuff I like, like Disneyland and martial arts and dancing, all that stuff I liked. I was like, &#39;I can&#39;t do it just like me.&#39; It was a great way to get all the stuff out.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can also reinvent yourself whenever you move from a place to another. I used to live in a small and enclosed community to my twenties until I moved out into an environment I knew nobody. It gave me a clean-slate, and after returning a year later, people close to me told I had changed a lot. Moreover, I continued to be the new me. The gap in the shared history cut both ways: I could forever hide behind it and explain e.g. some opinion of mine to come from influences of that time, but on the other hand, it was also the last time someone else than I knew a coherent history of me.Since then, I have moved into new environments four additional times. Each time I see it as a possibility to reflect what I&#39;d like to change and work towards that. And whenever I return to home, I feel like a tourist now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the interview question here. I came up with the idea after working at the company for a couple months and realizing that the skill of &#34;diving into an unfamiliar area of the code and quickly figuring it out&#34; was very important for us. Database codebases are large and complex -- so much so that almost every new feature you work on for the first year or so feels a lot like doing the question.Over the years of evaluating with it, we learned a lot about its quirks (both false positives and false negatives). At one point, someone got so frustrated that they threw their laptop on the floor. Happy to answer any questions about it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great interview question I don&#39;t want to be &#39;that guy&#39; by picking at what may be a detail but there is another response to look for from a candidate.We should think very carefully about adding a multiplication command because it introduces a failure mode that may be unanticipated by the client. Code that previously worked could begin to fail after this command goes into use.Specifically, if the client needs to revert a series of operations on integers, and if the operations are transitive, there is no need for a mechanism to ensure they occur in any particular order (the usual caveat about working within the limits of precision applies.) This holds true for addition and for multiplication, in isolation, but is not true if they are combined. Change the order and the end result will change. Adding multiplication puts a burden on the client to understand this risk and be explicit in the ordering.Some people may argue that the client should already understand it and they have a point. We can&#39;t defend against every possible misunderstanding. I think there is a good discussion to be had on this question and if the candidate were to go there, it would be a favorable sign of experience on their part."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To everyone praising how good this challenge is, calm down. There&#39;s nothing great about making somebody sweat for 3 hours during an interview. It&#39;s even worse if &#34;someone got so frustrated that they threw their laptop on the floor&#34; like the top comment claims.Yes, it would be great to avoid hiring people who have a bad temper and tend to throw tantrums when nervous, but, then again, it&#39;s beyond me why anyone would need to prove they can cope with such pressure without breaking down. We&#39;re talking about a desk job here, which requires writing good quality code according to some requirements during normal working hours, not disarming a bomb with a timer attached to it."</p>

If you are on one OS and this non-natve-looking app comes along, you have to mentally map it for your OS so it&#39;s none-nativeness requires mapping to the OS-nativeness.If you, on the other hand, only work &#34;in&#34; this application and just take it with you regardless of the OS, then you would indeed not need to mentally map the application itself.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One little girl had 6 eggs in her basket by the end. That kid terrified me.I took our six year-old to an indoor climbing venue last year.   She&#39;d never done any kind of climbing before (although always seemed to be &#34;climbing on&#34; anything/everything at playgrounds and in kindergarten, particularly things that aren&#39;t really designed to be climbed.  Had had a few interactions with gravity, including landing on her face at a playground, one of the reasons that prompted me to check out options for some proper climbing instruction for kids)We pitched up, she met the trainer, she&#39;s the youngest in the group and also the last experienced, they get kitted out and head out to warm up then start climbing, I did what any HN parent does: fired up my laptop to catch up with work and stopped paying attention...About 15 mins later another parent came over to me and asked &#34;is that your daughter right at the top?&#34;  (about 16 meters/50 feet up, at the top of the wall)Me: &#34;err ... yeah&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our family hunts were epic. In good weather the eggs were outdoors - on the roof, in the car tailpipe, buried under a rock, up in a tree. they rarely found half.One year we used camo eggs - and all three of our kids have red-green color issues. They found very few.Just a month ago my wife found one in a decorative pot on top of a cabinet - where it&#39;d been for 20 years. Each time we have one of these epic finds, we share it with a family text."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will never understand why people choose VSCode/Jetbrains over a terminal based editor. I can edit the kernel with clangd and get hover reference, autocomplete, go to def, ref, dec, smart refactor, and that&#39;s on top of being able to easily jump and fix lint/bugs using Vim&#39;s already great support for parsing compiler errors. With term added (which is a core Vim feature) it also has excellent support for gdb debugging. I am very glad that neovim is also making things EVEN BETTER with tree sitter and baked in LSP support.So I get 98-100% of what an IDE gives me, I can use my editor over ssh and edit anywhere, I don&#39;t need a GUI to even be installed on the system where I have all of my cores and RAM for compiling the kernel, it starts up instantly, and it&#39;s completely free and open source, not driven by a corporation, and there&#39;s decades of documentation on how to use it.Edit:I really don&#39;t understand the comments of &#34;I will literally not spend a single minute configuring my editor&#34;. I guess it&#39;s the systems developer in me that can&#39;t fathom someone that wants to use a tool to make a living without understanding it fully and being able to tweak it to their exact liking over the course of their entire career.I personally consider my investment into Vim one of the best I ever made. If dumb college me can do it in a few weekends, you can do it. I recently setup Emacs and got it to the same level as my Vim usage in about two days of tinkering just for fun. Then again, I suppose some people are just here for the money and want to clock in and clock out as fast as possible. I really wish I could share with you the joy of tinkering, learning, and growing your knowledge about how these wonderful machines work."</p>

Shirky&#39;s early essays were fundamental to way we understood the potential of the Web back in 1999-2008.I actually discovered this while looking for another old Shirky essay which, as far as I can tell, is now entirely gone from the Web."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suppose we can look at this with nostalgic eyes.I was a big Shirky reader back in the day.But the truth is that all kinds of things disappear all the time in all aspects of life. The web is no different at all.Take my dad for instance - a quite profilic and famous mid level artist. It’s coming to the point where not much people remember him. And when my siblings pass on that will be that.Let’s not get too nostalgic. If someone is interested they should try to preserve the writings and keep them going.That’s why certain groups have taken it upon themselves to preserve old important films. And as we know they are always fighting for more donations to keep things going.Because in the end… no one really cares.50 years from now children will be asking who was Van Gogh."</p>

He was convinced that we needed to integrate RDF into every product to remain relevant.  Shirky&#39;s essay persuasively articulated why this would have been a waste of effort for us.Years on, these ideas still influence my analysis of elevator pitches, business plans and requested features.edit:Thank you, Clay![0]: https://web.archive.org/web/20150323162650/http://www.shirky..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Smart TVs were created for all kinds of agendas but none were actually for us the consumers. All those agendas require an OS which takes time to boot. Making it worse, some of those TVs&#39; CPU are crap and thus every operation takes much longer than those dumb ones. Lots of vendors also start to ship new remotes that removed all the essential buttons, especially the video source button, and I have to press 5 or more times than before just to switch to a different source.So we are actually paying more(of course, lots extra hardware cost) for less. But it does not end there. Vendors put lots of Ads in them, some vendors even put boot-up Ads regardless it is connected to internet or not. The worst I guess was mentioned in a couple of day ago some rouge vendor even started to put customized Ads based programs we are watching on air.I guess my replacement for a TV would be a big monitor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TVs without a tuner are quite popular in Austria. You save around 30€ per month on payments to public TV stations, if your TV is just a monitor and has no tuner.You can get for example one of those (german, but you probably can read the specs anyway):https://nogis.at or https://www.gisbefreit.at/Most devices are not high end though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick story. I purchased a Sony tv with android OS. In the store, the OS did everything I wanted.When set the system up at home, it worked just like in the store.Then five days later, an OS update forced ads onto the front page. The entire home page was changed from what I had purchased.Fortunately, I could reset the device back to the previous OS version and not let it anywhere near a wi fi.What I purchased and what I was having in my possession became antithetical to what I wanted with a software update."</p>

It’s the bait and switch.At least being taken through existing code you know what you are getting yourself in to. Also looking at the current open pull requests and closed pull requests to see the standard and speed of delivery. Bonus points for no PR’s and trunk driven development as that shows a very mature team.My simpler interviews have often been with companies that have held a higher bar than the ones with tougher interviews. Those companies have often been sink or swim though and if you don’t make the grade you’ll be kicked out pretty quick. My last company had a reputation for new starts disappearing and not great that way, but the team was probably the strongest bunch of people I’ve ever worked with as only do good survived."</p>

This app has some bugs we will solve to get it working (nothing that&#39;s a trick... actual, commonly encountered bugs that have all the error messaging you need to solve them). Once it is working you will walk me through a particular flow of the app, explaining what is going on and why we do it this way. There are optimization opportunities (purely optional, there for you to notice), areas we can dig into if we choose (or if I feel the need to). If you tear through it we can examine a different flow in the app. Perhaps we could discuss the database structure and how it might be improved or changed, maybe we dig into some CSS or into some GraphQL or any other aspect that we need to. I&#39;ve had people stumped and unable to continue but the vast majority of devs can make a good stab at it, even if they are not familiar with the specific stack. The best devs are barely slowed down by such unfamiliarity and can still reason, logically, about the code.So far I&#39;ve had really positive feedback from job candidates. A couple even described it as their favorite interview ever! I feel like it has worked well, given the people we have ended up hiring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s interesting, I&#39;ve never heard testing code skills by reading instead of writing.An example would have been nice though, as I&#39;m not sure how to find a piece of code that does something standalone that is too large to grasp in 20 minutes yet make a reasonable prediction at the output. That combination seems kind of weird.I wonder how well it would work to modify OP&#39;s idea and present a candidate with some code that has a bug in it (you reveal what the bug is to save time, they&#39;ll need to understand the code anyhow) and you ask them how they&#39;d fix it. First broadly, like what approach, then actually write part of it.To take my own advice and make the discussion more concrete, I should add an example. Random script from my github: https://github.com/lucb1e/randomdirectory/blob/master/random...To prepare for the interview, one could add an argument like -h to show usage (in the same style as -v is currently implemented), then tell the candidate that the bug is that passing -vh executes neither -v nor -h (one would commonly expect it to execute both). Fixing this requires a &#39;structural&#39; change to this little bit of code, but it&#39;s small enough to easily grasp and implement. The candidate might propose to loop over each character after a single hyphen to fix this, or they might propose to throw out this custom reinventing-the-wheel and use a proper arg parsing library. Either is fine, but they should be prepared to write the code (in any language, they can write just the changes in C, Python, JS, or whatever language they&#39;re comfortable with).Has anyone tried such an interview coding question?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello HN! Here is some context to decorate this announcement:The Zig self-hosted compiler codebase consists of 197,549 lines of code.There are several different backends, each at varying levels of completion. Here is how many behavior tests are passing:       LLVM: 1101/1138 (97%)
       WASM:  919/1138 (81%)
          C:  740/1138 (65%)
     x86_64:  725/1138 (64%)
        arm:  490/1138 (43%)
    aarch64:  411/1138 (36%)

As you might guess, the one that this milestone is celebrating is the LLVM backend, which is now able to compile the compiler itself, despite 3% of the behavior tests not yet passing.The new compiler codebase, which is written in Zig instead of C++, uses significantly less memory, and represents a modest performance improvement. There are 5 more upcoming compiler milestones which will have a more significant impact on compilation speed. I talked about this in detail last weekend at the Zig meetup in Milan, Italy[1].There are 3 main things needed before we can ship this new compiler to everyone.1. bug fixes2. improved compile errors3. implement the remaining runtime safety checksIf you&#39;re looking forward to giving it a spin, subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/89) to be notified when it is landed in master branch.Edit: The talk recording about upcoming compiler milestones is uploaded now [1][1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqDdWEiSwMM"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Zig’s compatibility with C is such a valuable feature.I also wish we could rewrite everything in a modern language, but the reality is that we can’t and that if we could, it would take a LONG time. The ability to start new projects, or extend existing ones, with a modern and more ergonomic language—Zig—and be able to seamlessly work with C is incredible.I look forward to the self-hosted compiler being complete, and hopefully a package manager in the future. I’d really like to start using Zig for more projects."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is way overdue for long form tweets! (Musk&#39;s response)this may very well be the first thing in my life I&#39;ve agreed with Musk on. By god scrolling through an entire essay chopped up with random replies and profile links thrown in because you have to click &#34;show more replies&#34; (which pops up twice?) over and over is awful. Just link to a Twitlonger.On yishan&#39;s actual points I agree though. Companies moderate haphazardly and improvise and they care about their bottom-line and to extinguish shitstorms. There&#39;s no coherent ideological bias on any sufficiently large social network, they just pivot to whatever is causing chaos on any given weekday.One important point stuck somewhere in the middle is his observation that in the physical world, no public square, or public debate looks like what&#39;s on display on internet social networks. All of them have rules, civility is a thing, if you&#39;re crazy someone&#39;s likely going to throw you out, there&#39;s identity instead of anonymity and so on. Maybe provocatively, &#34;cancel culture&#34; is simply culture. Culture is a bunch of rituals, rules, coercions, customs and traditions that predominantly tell us what not to so so we don&#39;t behave like a bunch of naked apes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thread is an interesting perspective on social media &#34;censorship&#34; that you don&#39;t hear often.Of course everyone working at a social media company has an ideological bias, and that can come out in the product. But consider also that the latest censorship controversy creates negative PR, makes people leave the platform, attracts regulatory attention, and ultimately, hurts the company&#39;s profits. Content moderators are at least as worried about that as they are about making sure their ideological opponents aren&#39;t given a voice.Social media companies are in the unenviable position of playing referee in the culture war, and like referees in any sport, they&#39;re going to constantly be criticized for doing it, right or wrong. These companies are global and universal, and there&#39;s no way they can satisfy all parties. Sometimes, the values of left and right, or Iran and the US, or Israel and Palestine, are just irreconcilable. You&#39;re better off just trying to avoid as much trouble as possible, and avoiding negative media attention.Reddit is probably the most ham-fisted example of this approach. Their content moderation is pretty hands off, but as soon as any subreddit attracts negative attention, it&#39;s quarantined or banned, no matter if the controversy is justified or not. When Russia invaded Ukraine and Russia Is Bad Now, they just straight up banned /r/russia and any link to an .ru domain! That does nothing to address the conflict, but it does keep those NYT opinion pieces from showcasing Problematic Russian Bot Behavior on Reddit.I&#39;ll note that I don&#39;t think this model fully explains moderation policies at Twitter or other social media sites. I genuinely believe moderation leans left due to an ideological monoculture (I&#39;ve seen it first hand). But it&#39;s important to recognize the difficult situation social media sites are in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve sometimes wondered if the way American media and culture treat people like Musk, Bezos, Gates is that we have no royalty -- there&#39;s no hereditary monarchy and indeed the old money keeps a studiously low profile.Do human cultures just need kings and princes? Is there a special kind of celebrity niche that the billionaire businessman fills that occupies an ancient hierarchical part of our society?I read Yishan&#39;s post here as kind of like a duke commissioning an epic poem in the hopes it&#39;ll influence the king. Maybe it&#39;ll work -- he shot his shot, and he&#39;s a pro at putting in just the right Internet comments in just the right place. But I wonder why I&#39;m so fascinated about seeing this conversation between these two nobles. Is this how the English lower classes saw their royalty in the 17th century? Did they chatter about the king&#39;s foibles on the street while they were out costermongering?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a much bigger problem than Heroku.There are countless SaaS applications asking for full-repo  access to Github (all the source code, with write access).- Productboard- Bugsnag- Sentry- Skylight- Percy- CodeTree- DataboxThere are heaps of others, these are just some on top the of my mind. A ticking supply chain attack waiting to happen, since these companies make themselves into alluring hacking targets.Most of them need access only to issues (a few need read access to code or recent commits, almost none need write).Solution:- Let customers give granular access (only issues, only read to source code, etc) when the integration is setup. This is possible with Github&#39;s APIs.- Try to use push instead of pull where possible, i.e. provide a CLI tool to use with Github actions or use Github&#39;s webhooks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Additionally, we recommend disconnecting Heroku from your GitHub repositories.I have respect for the Heroku/Salesforce Security team for willing to ask users to perform this action.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re a small org with a github connected to heroku. All of our repos were cloned between April 8 and April 15 with the majority of them having no activity for several years.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might feel &#34;overengineered&#34; to people outside the Japanese society, but it actually just solves common issues here and it&#39;s not overengineering.
 The rotating mechanism is the easiest to see this.First, Kanji signs are more detailed than the alphabet and uneven lines can make it really ugly/hard to read. Same issue with breaking lead, causes ugliness.Second, traditionally handwriting in Japan have been seen as a way to measure one&#39;s upbringing; you can fake looks and style but if your handwriting is bad, that signals that your parents didn&#39;t raise you well. This was(and still is in some places) the reason resumes have to be handwritten.So tools that helps your handwriting had uses beyond just utility.(my handwriting is garbage and I&#39;m happy IT and tech jobs doesn&#39;t check this)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting article and statistical analysis, but I really don&#39;t see how it concludes that the DK effect is wrong based on the analysis. The fact that the DK effect emerges with _completely random data_ is not surprising at all - in this case the intuitive null hypothesis would be that people are good at estimating their skill, therefore there would be strong a correlation between their performance and self-evaluation of said performance. If the data weren&#39;t related, then this hypothesis isn&#39;t likely, which is exactly what DK means. And indeed if you look at the plots in the article (of the completely random data), they depict a world in which people are very bad at estimating their own skill, therefore, statistically, people with lower skills tend to overestimate their skills, and experts tend to underestimate it.Also wanted to point out that in general there is no issue with looking at y - x ~ x, this is called the residual plot, and is specifically used to compare an estimate of some value vs. the value itself.That being said, the author seems very confident in their conclusion, and from the comments seems to have read a lot of related analyses, so I might be missing something. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excerpt from a newer paper by Nuhfer (2017) adds more clarity:“… Our data show that peoples&#39; self-assessments of competence, in general, reflect a genuine competence that they can demonstrate. That finding contradicts the current consensus about the nature of self-assessment. Our results further confirm that experts are more proficient in self-assessing their abilities than novices and that women, in general, self-assess more accurately than men. The validity of interpretations of data depends strongly upon how carefully the researchers consider the numeracy that underlies graphical presentations and conclusions. Our results indicate that carefully measured self-assessments provide valid, measurable and valuable information about proficiency. …”https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312107583_How_Rando..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is correct.  The effect is statistical not psychological.  It emerges even from artificial data and occurs independently of the supposed psychological justifications even for data where those justifications are clearly removed.If you adjust the experiment design to avoid introducing the auto-correlation you get data that doesn&#39;t show the DK effect at all.  Some might take issue with the adjusted experiment as using seniority related categories like &#34;sophomore&#34; and &#34;junior&#34; as skill levels has its own issues. To show the DK effect is real you need to come up with a better adjusted experiment that avoids the autocorrelation while still generating data that generates the effect. It&#39;s unclear if that&#39;s possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ha, Flash Boys 2.0 was from 2019. This blog post is literally &#34;I read a thing from three years ago and have lost faith in something that I never believed in in the first place&#34;.As someone who knows and has worked with all the people involved with the write-ups referenced in this blog post, I can pretty confidently say that the author is way way behind here. There have been some insane advancements in recent years that would blow his mind.MEV harvesting is actually an insanely fascinating field of study, and it comes down to consensus in a world where information can only move as fast as the speed of light.Front-running is a general problem where, if you can find out that someone wants to buy something, and can buy it first and sell it to the person who actually want it at a premium. This gets really interesting in the blockchain space, because Miners (Validators) decide the order of transactions, and in some cases validators can be incentivized/coerced to move around transactions in a way that might be beneficial for certain users. This is what is referred to as &#34;Miner Extractable Value&#34;.Yes it&#39;s a problem, yes there are mitigations, yes there are fun and weird ways around those mitigations, etc.This is what happens when people are incentivized to take a really good hard look at what global consensus really means. At a high level, most users don&#39;t really need to know or care about any of it, but it exists as a parasitic force constantly extracting value from the network. Still, IMO the parasites that feed off MEV are at a significant disadvantage compared with those who feed of legacy financial networks (for more on that, you can read the actual Flash Boys book https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Crypto Andys like to hand-wave about the risk of a 51% attack but consider this:&gt; This is in addition to the long-standing concentration of Ethereum mining power, with normally three and sometimes only two mining pools controlling over 50% of the mining power.There is further hand-waving about how Proof-of-Stake (over Proof-of-Waste) will magically fix these problems. But it&#39;s actually this PoW computing power that makes the network more resilient to hostile takeover.I&#39;ve heard it described that the attraction of Crypto is the essence of the American Dream: by getting rich by doing nothing while lauding how smart you are over other people. So much of Crytpo can be explained by Bitcoin FOMO. Everyone just jumps on the latest shitcoin or NFT because &#34;I&#39;m not missing out this time&#34;.Ultimately something has to create value or it will come crashing down. The only use case we really have is illegal activity. Some of that is justified on ethics grounds (eg bypassing capital controls in Venezuela). A lot of it is just shady.There&#39;s a ton of talk about the &#34;potential&#34;. So far the offshots (eg NFTs, Web3) are just ludicrous boondoggles in finding problems for a solution. I have doubts this will ever create value for the masses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While many contracts within Ethereum have clear flaws, that doesn&#39;t mean Eth as a whole is broken.Time bandit attacks go away once proof of stake finality arrives. Also, trading ought to be done in Layer 2s. Does MEV work on L2s?Re: certain token drops wasting lots of gas, it&#39;s up to the token authors to use an implementation that avoids gas wars.Once you go into claiming equivalences with P = NP, you&#39;ve lost me. Theoretical optimums are an academic game, in reality you can get 95% of the way there with heuristics.&gt; Because Ethereum transactions are programs, the halting problem means that it isn&#39;t possible to accurately predict the resources needed to execute them.Ah, more appeals to theory. They&#39;re programs with a low ceiling on the number of steps and possible codepaths. They barely even have loops half the time. Estimating isn&#39;t that hard in practice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"According to the original complaint, a few months after being interviewed by an FBI agent on returning from his trip to North Korea, Griffith had the following conversation over text messages:Griffith: I need to send 1 [REDACTED UNIT OF CRYPTOCURRENCY] between North and South Korea.
Other Guy: &#34;Isn&#39;t that in violations of sanctions?&#34;
Griffith: It is.A few day later, also in text messages to someone else:Someone: What interest does North Korea have in cryptocurrency?
Griffith: Probably avoiding sanctions... who knows.&#34;It looks like it wasn&#39;t just speaking at a conference after being denied permission from the US that got him in trouble, it looks like both before and after the trip he was working on a variety of ways to get the North Korean government more onboard with cryptocurrency, including discussions about mining ventures, moving funds in and out of the country, and offering connections with other cryptocurrency people."</p>

It&#39;s a shame that this happened.The situation is kinda similar to the one with Bobby Fischer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer&#34;In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the US government, which warned Fischer that his participation in the match would violate an executive order imposing US sanctions on Yugoslavia. The US government ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After that, Fischer lived as an émigré. In 2004, he was arrested in Japan and held for several months for using a passport that the US government had revoked. Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic passport and citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing, allowing him to live there until his death in 2008.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of comments have said &#34;stay in therapy&#34; or &#34;quit therapy&#34;, but my immediate reaction is that maybe you have the wrong (ineffective) therapist and need to switch.My spidey sense went up when you mentioned what &#34;you told your therapist&#34;, full stop. I was at least expecting &#34;what my therapist responded&#34; or &#34;what my therapist told me that didn&#39;t work&#34;. That really (spidey sense, no evidence really) implies that your therapist is having low impact.I&#39;ve had half a dozen therapists in my life. What I realized is there&#39;s a huge difference between most therapists and good ones. With a typical therapist, not much happens, you phone it in and they don&#39;t notice or call you on it. A good therapist somehow has a way of listening and then catching you properly off guard at least once or twice a session. They can stare into your soul and see through your bullshit, even when you don&#39;t notice the bullshit you&#39;re saying. If you don&#39;t feel that incisiveness, perhaps it&#39;s time to start shopping for a new therapist.Therapy really is a 100x profession."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in my late 20s, but I noticed that people live as if they are forever.They spend half of their life working for survival, preparing and planning for their (!) future.Some people die in the process and never live to see that future, 
but some people reach that point and become aware of the finite time that just elapsed.Having physical needs met is trivial in our society. 
Everything beyond is self imposed suffering by comparing oneself to others.But for what purpose? Just to have more than someone else? Just to be better than someone else?Nobody truly cares. Nobody cares about how fancy the technology is that someone built to make people click more ads online - even if that someone thinks he is doing god&#39;s work.We came to this earth naked and we will leave naked. Just like my parents did. Any material possessions and people will be left behind. Most of us will be forgotten 2 generations ahead or end up as UTF-8 characters on wikipedia.I can at least walk joyfully in the present and not suffer my imagination about the future. I can also make a conscious choice to not indulge in activities that destroy the planet for others. I don&#39;t think the older generations see it the way I do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, you have reached the zenith of your career. Congratulations. You are self-sufficient and able to provide for the financial needs of your family. This is a true victory.Now, it is time to focus on people other than yourself. Most other advice on here is awful; it amounts to different directions to run on the hedonic treadmill.Instead, you have to give back now. What good is there to be done, that only you could do? What will be worse off if you don&#39;t lend a hand? This can range from finding better ways to support and mentor your children, to donating time to tutor students in programming, to building a well in Africa. Think hard about what you really care about, and then work hard to bring that into being."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing how much collateral damage is caused by our horrible copyright laws. Mostly just so the MPA/RIAA can protect their roles as gatekeepers of what we&#39;re allowed to see and hear.They can put enormous pressure on even the wealthiest and most powerful companies to act as copyright police on their behalf. Even Google is afraid of them. ISPs are forced to spend huge amounts of time and money working for them. Now duckduckgo is being strong armed into doing a bunch of free work for them too? Maintaining lists of websites and domains to block and removing links to even non-infringing material like youtube-dl just to keep from being sued into the ground.I don&#39;t know what it&#39;ll take to rein in these guys, but I doubt the courts will be the ones to do it. So far courts seem fine with the idea that ISPs must permanently ban users from their service over nothing but repeated unsubstantiated claims of infringements which is an insane amount of power to give any industry.Has any US politician ever run on a platform that includes copyright reform?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is like the Framework laptop but it&#39;s a UK-based company that has been around for years, and with an explicit focus on Linux compatibility to boot. I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t come across them before as I&#39;ve been looking for Linux-compatible laptops for years.They do some things better than Framework such as supporting Ryzen processors, and seem a bit cheaper overall. The battery life seems like it would be better. They have a spare parts store as well and a full disassembly guide as well as an &#34;open warranty&#34;. I was never a fan of Framework&#39;s swappable ports.The biggest disadvantage seems to be that the screen is bog-standard 16:9.I&#39;m curious on the quality of the speakers, webcam, keyboard, and trackpad. I have a feeling they will not be great - in comparison to a Macbook at any rate.From reviews it looks like the trackpad is poor because it is not whole-trackpad clickable, and the keyboard is also poor due to the short key travel.Are there any other decent alternatives available in the UK?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got one of these in December 2021 and frankly love it. Got fed up with being pretty much the only person on earth who had a shitty experience with Apple Silicon, so jumped back to Linux after 17 years away. I don’t use it as a portable, or at least haven’t yet - it’s my daily driver for work and permanently plugged in to a monitor (which also is a USB hub). I opted for Manjaro and enjoy using it way more than I did the M1 macbook pro it replaced.I really like that they provide a detailed pictorial complete disassembly guide: https://support.starlabs.systems/kb/guides/starbook-mk-v-com..."</p>

It&#39;s fascinating that Apple has a reputation for being anti-libre, yet the hardware they built is arguably very libre-friendly.&gt; This puts them somewhere between x86 PCs and a libre-first system like the Talos II in terms of freedom to replace firmware and boot components; while a number of blobs are required in order to boot the system, none of those have the ability to take over the OS or compromise it post-boot (unlike, say, Intel ME and AMD PSP on recent systems, or the DMA-capable chips on the LPC bus running opaque blobs that exist on even old ThinkPads).&gt; From a security perspective, these machines may possibly qualify as the most secure general purpose computers available to the public which support third-party OSes, in terms of resistance to attack by non-owners.[0]: https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Introduction-to-Appl..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After reading Wim Hof and James Nestor a couple years ago during the pandemic, I used their techniques in full while battling long Covid.I had a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter on my bedside table that I would experiment with doing these various techniques and seeing my heart rate go down, my blood pressure go down, my anxiety would disappear, lung/chest inflammation would settle, and even oxygen levels increase up to 5%.I did this primarily because Covid reduced my average running mile time by around 20%. I was hopeful that I could make a full recovery which I did and then some.This new tool I believe saved my life, and I’m excited to use it for the rest of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; not necessarily meant to replace exerciseI&#39;m hoping someone can answer a question to which I&#39;ve never heard a really satisfactory answer:  Why does human health benefit from exercise whereas any kind of simple machine wears out with exercise? For example, doing a hundred stretches per day improves my health whereas stretching an elastic band 100 times per day will cause it to lose elasticity and soon destroy it. So what&#39;s the low-level mechanism by which exercise improves health in people but not in simple machines?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclosure: I own FREQ stock.The failure of the prior trial was suspected, and I believe it, due to a refractory response by overdosing the inner ear with too frequent administrations of the drug, and then testing for effect too soon. I bet even those candidates of the phase IIa trial though would, if checked on now, show some improvement.Animal research has shown that natural cochlear hair cell regeneration and resultant hearing restoration is very real, we mammals just don&#39;t have the natural cellular signaling to redifferentiate those base cells - small molecule drugs like FX322 do exactly that. I am optimistic they&#39;ll eventually find the right dosing regimen to see reliable and optimal clinical effect, and it will be a seismic advance in medicine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article says the treatment focuses on increased speech intelligibility. Speech, depending on how you define it, can occupy a fairly narrow range of the audio spectrum that humans can perceive.My hearing loss is mostly on the high end (10-12K and above) and impedes my ability to hear speech in noisy environments. More troubling has been the inability to enjoy music/sound in those upper ranges, resulting in the music lacking a certain sparkle and brilliance.I hope this therapy regenerates hair cells across the entire spectrum."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even before the poison pill was adopted, the evidence is the market wasn&#39;t taking Musk&#39;s offer seriously. That&#39;s because he was offering $54.20 per share (ha ha, 420), but the stock price never closed higher than $48.36. So almost $6/share was left on the table.Part of it is that Musk doesn&#39;t have $43B in cash, he&#39;d have to raise it or borrow it. He&#39;s worth more than that but it isn&#39;t liquid; as an officer of Tesla there are some restrictions on when he can trade. Another part is that many doubt whether Musk is serious or if he is playing games again, like the last time &#34;420&#34; appeared in a financial announcement from him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, I&#39;m not very corporate savvy and this might be a very stupid question. Is there a NON-culture/political reason for all the push back against Musk buying Twitter? From the read, this just seem to be opening the door for someone else to try and take majority control and pining away for the days of Dorsey (which, if looked at objectively, weren&#39;t great... just filling an opportunity)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand how any board can implement a “poison pill”, not just Twitter but Netflix and others, and not be found working against the interest of shareholders. Can anyone help me understand?You’re categorically changing the profile of the stock. This has a chilling effect on large investors, including but not limited just to Musk, right?Vanguard, for example, has just had its range of further investment limited arbitrarily. Isn’t that bad for all stockholders, to know that large stakeholders will not drive the price up if they somehow gain substantial belief in the company?The risk portfolio of Vanguard just went up considerably because in the case that they fully lose faith in the board, they no longer have the option of installing a friendly board, they must simply liquidate their holdings. This, in turn, makes them more skeptical of further smaller (non-takeover) investment because it’s more to liquidate and more risk.Who does this benefit besides the board? I guess I understand that the board is not beholden to the interests of all shareholders equally, and I’m not suggesting that this doesn’t benefit some shareholders, but where does the line start?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find sponge really useful. Have you ever wanted to process a file through a pipeline and write the output back to the file? If you do it the naive way, it won’t work, and you’ll end up losing the contents of your file:    awk &#39;{do_stuff()}&#39; myfile.txt | sort -u | column --table &gt; myfile.txt

The shell will truncate myfile.txt before awk (or whatever command) has a chance to read it. So you can use sponge instead, which waits until it reads EOF to truncate/write the file.    awk &#39;{do_stuff()}&#39; myfile.txt | sort -u | column --table | sponge myfile.txt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one I use the most is `vipe`.&gt; vipe: insert a text editor into a pipeIt&#39;s useful when you want to edit some input text before passing it to a different function. For example, if I want to delete many of my git branches (but not all my git branches):  $ git branch | vipe | xargs git branch -D

`vipe` will let me remove some of the branch names from the list, before they get passed to the delete command."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; errno: look up errno names and descriptionsI like this. Reminds me of a couple very useful things I&#39;ve done:1. Add a -man switch to command line programs. This causes a browser to be opened on the web page for the program. For example:    dmd -man

opens https://dlang.org/dmd-windows.html in your default browser.2. Fix my text editor to recognize URLs, and when clicking on the URL, open a browser on it. This silly little thing is amazingly useful. I used to keep bookmarks in an html file which I would bring up in a browser and then click on the bookmarks. It&#39;s so much easier to just put them in a plain text file as plain text. I also use it for source code, for example the header for code files starts with:    /*
     * Takes a token stream from the lexer, and parses it into an abstract syntax tree.

It would be great if YouTube updated their ToS to permit this because that could unlock some really interesting innovation. Until then, devs should at least be aware that building a product with these APIs is risky.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms"</p>

(hard pass on even trying this out, especially if it&#39;s good/nice I&#39;ll want to use it and kick myself later for being an idiot.)"</p>

The manager asks you every hour how your manuscript is coming along.&gt; 3. You are not allowed to leave the store until you have finished writing your manuscript or writing project.Sounds like a cute idea. I wonder what would happen if you decided you wanted to leave before finishing. Do they berate you? Do you lose a deposit? I imagine you can&#39;t hold customers hostage or trap them in your cafe if they actually want to go."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this is really cute and wonderful. I think there&#39;s some room to improve here, e.g. an AR ghost overlay of previous frames as well as ML extracted frames from pure paper without having to print a template (both of which I believe are feasible). But overall I love that people are experimenting with this stuff (and wouldn&#39;t want to react negatively here in any way to discourage this type of work).Some might argue moving from digital to pen and paper is a step down but I&#39;d argue the opposite. I&#39;d love and look forward to a possible future where we move digital advancements into the analog world in this way. As Theil says you can barely tell the difference between this world and the 80s if you remove cell phones and computers, but things like this are a cool way to hopefully get us closer to computers aiding more natural forms of interaction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi Dominic, thanks for open sourcing the library. I have quite a few questions though:1. Marijn has built an awesome open source richtext library (https://prosemirror.net/) which has a huge plugin ecosystem and bindings with a bunch of front-end frameworks (including React). Is there any specific motivation behind building one from scratch?2. How is this different from Facebook&#39;s own DraftJS lib?3. What&#39;s the story of realtime collaboration support with OT/CRDT? Prosemirror had this in mind when designing its state model and delta model, so it comes with out of the box support for realtime collaborations. Can we expect the same with Lexical?4. What&#39;s the cross platform strategy for Lexical? If I store the editor&#39;s state as JSON on the server, how will I render it on devices and native desktop apps?We&#39;ve built our own library on top of Prosemirror to power the comments and feedback sections of Zoho Writer - https://writer.zoho.comI&#39;m always looking out for better approaches/alternatives in this space and I&#39;m curious how different Lexical is. Thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the big frustrations with DraftJS is that Facebook moved on (which is understandable), but the core repo wasn’t given control to the community, so patches and updates couldn’t be pulled in. Obviously it’s open source and could be hard forked, but that’s not ideal.I’d be curious if there are plans internally to make sure Lexical continues
to be supported by Facebook and doesn’t end up with the same fate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The examples shown on the site are code editing. Which puts it in direct competition with the more established Monaco from Microsoft [1].Competition is welcome, but the description sounds like this is more of a library than a finished product (which Monaco isn&#39;t), and if so, some examples showing how to take advantage of that would have been helpful.[1] https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Twitter was at $70 per share a year ago. So what? Jack Dorsey was CEO a year ago, too. The share price was $33 less than a month ago.But, despite an absolutely incredible roller-coaster news cycle, things have been definitely trending down at Twitter ($33/share last month), which was reflected in its share price. The current executive team (and Dorsey) had wasted time focusing on things that didn&#39;t matter instead of things that did matter.Boards have several fiduciary duties to the shareholders. As an all-cash offer, this generates for the shareholders a substantial return with NO RISK, and so the board has a serious legal obligation to carefully review this offer and make a decision.If the board elects to reject this offer, then their reasons for doing so need to be very clearly elucidated, because, as Twitter is a public company, they would have to see something in their crystal ball that the rest of the market does not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s ignore personality and societal issues for a moment and look at the value proposition. The &#39;best and final offer&#39; of $54.20 per share is just too low to be acceptable for major investors.Just  over year ago, Twitter shares traded at about $70 per share. Musk&#39;s offer is about 25% lower than last years peak. There&#39;s no reason to assume Twitter shares can&#39;t reach the same levels ever again, nothing much has changed fundamentally over a year.Musk&#39;s offer is a cash only offer. $43 billion is a lot of cash. That&#39;s a lot of Tesla shares to sell, or massive loan. If Musk thinks Twitter is that valuable to take such risks,  current major  investors will probably want to unlock that value themselves.I think the takeover offer is just as believable as last week&#39;s announcement that Musk was joining the Twitter board."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this post.While the author clearly feels bad about the fact that they&#39;ve lost his community and that GitHub didn&#39;t restore it (which is honestly what any of us would&#39;ve felt under similar circumstances), they&#39;re also focusing towards the future and using their personal experience as a parable all of us can learn from.Lesson 1 on UI design I think is really important. I often think scary popup boxes are enough to get people to think about what they&#39;re doing, but this example clearly demonstrates that what&#39;s important is to use design not to scare (alone?), but to convey the information which makes a dangerous action dangerous as well. I also really like the fact that when the action isn&#39;t dangerous, the distractions (&#34;Type this repo&#39;s name&#34;, etc) just go away. It&#39;s super intuitive, and (for a newbie designer like me) really helps build an intuition for various design principles put in action.Lesson 2, which was to use soft deletes, is something I have more thoughts about. I assume that the cascading done on GitHub would be done on a FK constraint, but I&#39;m not really sure how you&#39;d do a &#34;cascading soft delete&#34; without making some kind of manual cascading logic? If anyone&#39;s aware of a standard way to accomplish this, please do let me know. Of course, the best way may just be to simplify the model so they aren&#39;t needed at all haha.As designers and developers we&#39;ve been given a chance to sharpen our toolkit. Thanks, HTTPie! You&#39;ve gained a new star :)Edit: Changed GitHub couldn&#39;t restore to GitHub didn&#39;t restore, as pointed out by @ncmncm (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31033758#31034195)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The problem is that the box looks exactly the same for repos with no commits and stars and for repos with a decade-long history and 55k stargazers and watchers. And it says “Warning: this is a potentially destructive action.”It seems a bit much to expect the website to show you a warning of different levels of severity depending on the stars a repos has, particularly when the standard message is pretty severe and explicit. It even makes you type the name of the repo you want to make private before proceeding - I don&#39;t see how that wouldn&#39;t make anyone snap out of autopilot. I sympathise with the author&#39;s misfortune but it is pretty hard to look at that warning dialog and conclude that he was not sufficiently warned of the consequences or given a chance to reflect.I find it disappointing that all of the lessons supposedly learned from this ordeal are lessons for other people, not the author. Surely lesson #1 should have been &#34;check what repo you&#39;re in before taking destructive actions&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sure, the author should be responsible.Yes, GitHub should have a better UX around this action.But...There is another thing to consider:Is it really necessary that a repo that is accidentally made private and then made public should lose its stars anyway?Is that really what the repo owner or the people who starred the repo even want to happen?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some sites that are so useless and they have never ever helped me once, yet somehow they are always in the top 10 results1. w3schools2. pinterest3. microsoft answers and all microsoft websites actually (it always looks like the person asking the question is asking exactly what i want, but unlike stackexchange, there are seldom any useful answers)4. all the code clones for SO5. all alternative to / review sites like capterra, g2, alternativeto, etc. They might have some good suggestions but they always hide the link to the software/site and instead link it to their spammy page. So you have to select part of the link and then re-search it on Google. Doing this for OSS projects can sometimes lead to a whole new rabbit hole.6. The best of lists. Google for the love of god, please ban them.. they are always always SEO spam and product placements. Often the blog post itself says &#34;to put your product on this list pay us a $1000 and we will include them in our list.&#34;7. Quora and similar answer sites.. okay it&#39;s a mixed bag but you have to be very careful on these sites as most often the answers are just spam. I never read any answer with a link in it.  But I think it&#39;s more Quora&#39;s problem than google. But if google is strict with them they may do a better job at moderating I guess. Also now quora hides answers and asks for a payment. Did they learn nothing from experts-exchange!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know google search is probably not the same as google flights, but I spent a few hours recently (over a few days) using google flights and it was a delight to use compared to the Expedia children.We had a bereavement in the family and had to book multiple independent tickets because we could not travel together. This was just after the Ukraine war started so prices had gone through the roof. Exact number of days was not that important as compared to the price and the duration and using google flights UI to slice and dice the data was such a joy. Want to freeze the airline and look at the alternatives - which include from and to dates, number of days of trips, or freeze any other parameter and analyze others, the response was sub-second. Did not eventually book through them since I did not want to get into the google payment system (they offer booking through others that I did not explore).On the opposite side was Expedia children where they would show a price of 2800 and when you click the price invariably it has gone up to 3600. Again. And again. And again. Not sure if that problem existed with google although I paid the exact same price as the airline as shown by google, it could just be a coincidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one thing I wish that Google offered would be the ability to blacklist sites for a period (coud be fixed - say 6 months).So damn annoying when the top search results all lead to shitty SEO-optimised sites that use a whole page to blather on and on, leading to a tiny information nugget at the end. No value, just excellent SEO scamming.As these scam artists get better and better at this, Google gets less and less useful.When I see a site like that, I can be quite sure there is no value to me from that site. I want to blacklist it - not forever (though I&#39;d settle for that) but so I don&#39;t see it in search results again.The crazy thing is that this could even be a benefit for Google themselves. They could aggregate these signals and use them to identify SEO scammers, since their algorithms clearly can&#39;t. I&#39;m sure that Google aren&#39;t happy with the lacklustre performance of their search in modern times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 10 years ago, I had a internship at Newell Rubbermaid. As part of the experience, the entire group of interns across all the brands got to have lunch with the CEO and basically ask him anything we wanted.At some point, someone asked about his biggest regret. We all expected some business blunder, but he said that he was offered an executive position by Kraft to lead their Asian segment, and that his wife really did not want him to take the job because it would require them to move to that region. He regretted not listening to her, because it ended up being the catalyst that dissolved their marriage.We were all stunned silent, and you could tell that he was genuinely remorseful and so vulnerable in that moment. There are only a handful of moments in that internship that I vividly remember, but that was by far the most impactful one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of folks are misinterpreting this article, or just using it as a jumping off point to get something off their chest.This article is not literally about the dirty dish. It&#39;s not even about compromise. Rather, the article is really about having healthy communication with your partner.The author&#39;s wife was trying to communicate to him: &#34;when you do X, I feel like Y, and it hurts me.&#34;But he wasn&#39;t hearing it. Not really. Now maybe his wife wasn&#39;t communicating as effectively as she could. But the author seems to indicate that she was and that he could have done more to recognize what she was saying and to empathize with her. He didn&#39;t get it, and now he clearly regrets it. It&#39;s too bad a healthy relationship didn&#39;t come out of that, but sometimes there&#39;s just too much damage.My wife and I have been together for 33 years, married for 26 of those (we met in HS). I&#39;m extremely fortunate that she&#39;s empathetic, compassionate, and has the patience of Job. Because it turns out that for a large portion of our marriage, I behaved like an asshole. She&#39;s not confrontational, while I thrive on it. We had a rule never to let a day end angry at each other, but mostly due to faults on my side she wasn&#39;t always heard because I wasn&#39;t open to listening to her. This built a lot of resentment. It came to a head years ago, but we worked through it and our relationship is healthier than it&#39;s ever been.&#34;You&#39;re not wrong Walter; you&#39;re just an asshole.&#34;The hard work in a relationship isn&#39;t compromise. That&#39;s table stakes. The hard work is communication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My relationship just ended for mostly similar reasons (it wasn&#39;t just glasses in the sink, it was a few other things I did that she considered disrespectful that seemed minor to me)I was the only one working and paying for the apartment, her hobbies, and school, but things like the above would escalate into long arguments that I would ask to defer. The problem was, I would sometimes forget details that were important to her if we postponed an argument for a few days, so she wanted to have them now and that was disruptive of my work (I WFH, she studies from home). I might miss an entire day of work because of some minor thing that exploded into a 6 hour argument, while I was trying to disengage the whole time, but couldn&#39;t.A couple weeks ago I had enough, and decided I needed more autonomy, and moved out. I didn&#39;t want that to be the end of relationship, but for her it was the end.Not sure what my point is, I just wanted to get it off my chest. Sometimes these seemingly minor things may just be a sign of deeper incompatibilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like they&#39;re trying to make an insidious suggestion about the usage of these. IMO, there&#39;s likely a good reason - user experience.At a hardware level, grabbing the microphone can take time. Even worse that timing is inconsistent across devices, workloads, etc. That leads to a bad experience when unmuting and needing to delay your commentary. The solution to this is to keep the microphone on, but mute at a software level. This way the mic is always hot and ready to relay audio as fast as the software can switch.I&#39;d be somewhat willing to bet continue to stream audio is also a quality assurance mechanism. Some networks will shape traffic according to load. A quick jump in bandwidth can introduce unexpected jitter and latency. By continuing to stream audio (but not necessarily process or re-transmit), video conferencing can better ensure an un-interupted experience.----With that being said, if you really care about privacy, consider getting a hardware mute microphone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Meet at least it&#39;s very obvious to tell they do this because if you talk while muted, they will show a pop-up saying that you&#39;re talking but you&#39;re muted.Whether this functionality is justification for more nefarious data usage remains to be seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Deaf person, the notification annoyed the heck out of me and there are not even an option to disable the notification. I muted my mic because I am Deaf and I don&#39;t use my voice to communicate with my fellow Deaf friends over Zoom/Teams.And there is no option to disable Zoom joining-room audio (the one that when you join the room, Zoom present the option to ask which microphone you want to enable). Why would I need to enable the microphone if I am signing to my Deaf boss? Deaf communities have major grief with those notifications.At least, I can disable the microphone access in my macOS and Zoom won&#39;t complain. However disabling mic permission in iPadOS will make Zoom to whine about it. Every time I join a meeting, it will let me know that the microphone access is disabled and &#34;kindly&#34; asked me to enable it. In Windows, I can deny the microphone access to Zoom in the Windows setting, however for some reason that made Zoom to crash."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d just like to add to this:  I find it absolutely reprehensible that The White House is trying to blame this on Russia, even coining a phrase &#34;the putin price hike&#34;.Inflation is hurting Americans, and the war in Ukraine is killing Ukrainians.  The idea that these people would try to use one of these things to advantage themselves politically instead of addressing the suffering that their policies are causing (and changing course) is reprehensible to me.There is a daily White House press briefing that I suggest everybody watch (you can 2x speed through it).  Here is a link to today&#39;s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07-AMwJbXQYJust the way that they talk about this is so...vile.  8.5% inflation is a nightmare.  You&#39;re in charge.  Take ownership of that, and for the love of god stop trying to use the massacre of innocent people in Ukraine is a political tool for youself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stepping back from the numbers and into the realm of personal anecdotes:1. I was listening the radio a couple weeks ago and the DJ invited people to call in and talk about the mask mandate being lifted (in Toronto). Woman calls in, says she went to the grocery store, got three bags of groceries, $146. The dj asks &#34;and... were people wearing masks?&#34; &#34;oh yeah, some were&#34; says the woman before going on to explain how she paid $14.50 for a roll of aluminum foil. The topic was masks and the caller didn&#39;t even want to talk about that, the cost of goods was her top and only issue.2. Standing in a park, an older gentleman is walking by with two small bags of groceries in his hands. I look at him to greet him as he passes, but he walks straight up to me as though he wants to address me. He stops in front of me, looks right in my eyes, lifts his groceries and says &#34;FORTY DOLLARS! Too much money!!&#34; (English was not his first language.) I directed him to the discount grocery, he confirmed that&#39;s where he is already shopping, and it&#39;s a green grocer with dry goods so I know his bags contained no (costly) meat, just vegetables and maybe some bread, pasta, or eggs.I frequently hear of &#34;inflation&#34; etc. on the news or economic reports, but this is different. I have never been approached by strangers on the street who are so frustrated and shocked by price hikes they couldn&#39;t walk all the way home without telling someone, even a stranger. This economic situation is different from any I have experienced in my ~40 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest story here is in shelter prices.https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-pri...March saw a continuation of a year-long trend in which YoY shelter inflation accelerated by almost exactly an additional 0.3% each month. March came in at 5%, 0.3% higher than February&#39;s 4.7%, and so on.Shelter is the largest category in the CPI basket, and it is critical for a reason. It isn&#39;t coming from Ukraine. It mostly isn&#39;t coming from supply chain bottlenecks and shipping container shortages. It isn&#39;t discretionary. And most importantly, it&#39;s a deeply lagging indicator with a long way still to go to catch up to the current activity in the housing and rental markets.My expectation is to see this trend continue. Base year effects (in the second derivative) might slow it down a bit, but by June we could be looking at almost 6% inflation in shelter alone.And remember -- a linearly increasing growth rate is faster than exponential price growth.Interest rate hikes may help, but the dynamics are such that they&#39;ll need to make things worse before they make things better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes. And it’s a strange one.I made a program to gender swap any text you put into it and then got a book deal to rewrite and illustrate Fairy Tales. It’s been published around the world.https://genderswappedfairytales.comThe idea is to shine a light on the original versions but it also creates a lot of never-written-before characters. A lot of brave princesses and lady-beasts, but also men desperately wanting children and being rewarded for kindness.I wrote the gender swap algorithm in Swift. It seemed like it would just be a simple auto replace type thing when I started but there’s some weird things in English, for example with his/him/her/hers where they don’t swap back and forth sensibly and you have to understand the context.It was his &gt; it was hers.It was his sword &gt; it was her swordSo I ended up down this rabbit hole of natural language processing to break up each sentence into verbs, nouns etc to work out the correct words to use. Even tried training an AI to do it based on the finished swapped text but a whole bunch of rules worked more reliably."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t Tor-like multi-hop (but is similar to other multi-hop VPN providers out there). A proper multi-hop would happen across two different vendors in control of two different networks, as it were.The iCloud Relay paper outlined a pretty private and secure design [0] (and the intention to standardize it via IETF would probably make it simpler to self-host such a solution [1][2]). Among the VPNs, orchid.com&#39;s distributed VPN stands out as a cross-provider multi-hop solution whose privacy guarantees are closer to Tor&#39;s.Eventually the hope is HTTP (www) itself bakes in desirable privacy properties, so regular users don&#39;t have to pay the cost of multi-hops [3].[0] Overview: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/111/materials/slides-11...[1] https://ietf-wg-masque.github.io/[2] https://tfpauly.github.io/privacy-proxy/[3] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ohai-ohttp/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use (and really like!) Mullvad, but have never tried the app, preferring to use my existing OpenVPN clients with the profiles Mullvad provides.This isn&#39;t because I have any reason to mistrust their app, but just because if I&#39;ve already got a perfectly serviceable client on my device, why add another binary to do the same thing?But I would be interested to hear, from folks who have used the app, what you like and don&#39;t like about it. In particular, I&#39;ve had some headaches setting up split tunneling/proxying via OpenVPN - I was never all that good at its config language - and I&#39;m wondering if the Mullvad app might make those easier to achieve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m wondering how this compares to Apple’s iCloud Private Relay.Mullvad is trying to increase their transparency and make sure users can trust them which is great. But would there be a way for them to make it so that users do not have to trust them? What if the second server was hosted by another entity?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My first attempt uses the small alpine image, which already packages thttpd:  # Install thttpd
  RUN apk add thttpd

Wouldn&#39;t you want to use the --no-cache option with apk, e.g.:  RUN apk add --no-cache thttpd

It seems to slightly help with the container size:  REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
  thttpd-nocache   latest    4a5a1877de5d   7 seconds ago    5.79MB
  thttpd-regular   latest    655febf218ff   41 seconds ago   7.78MB

It&#39;s a bit like cleaning up after yourself with apt based container builds as well, for example (although this might not always be necessary):  # Apache web server
  RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y apache2 libapache2-mod-security2 &amp;&amp; apt-get clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists /var/cache/apt/archives

But hey, that&#39;s an interesting goal to pursue! Even though personally i just gave up on Alpine and similar slim solutions and decided to just base all my containers on Ubuntu instead: https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/using-ubuntu-as-the-base-fo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love stuff like this.People will remark about how this is a waste of time, others will say it is absolutely necessary, even more will laud it just for the fun of doing it.  I&#39;m in the middle camp.  I wish software/systems engineers would spend more time optomising for size and performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is remarkably a good hack and I did learn quite a bit after reading the post, I&#39;m simply curious about the motivation behind it? A docker image even if it&#39;s a few MBs with Caddy/NGINX should ideally be just pulled once on the host and sit there cached. Assuming this is OP&#39;s personal server and there&#39;s not much churn, this image could be in the cache forever until the new tag is pushed/pulled. So, from a &#34;hack&#34; perspective, I totally get it, but from a bit more pragmatic POV, I&#39;m not quite sure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve repeatedly asked Atlassian if:1. They can confirm that they have backups of our data (about a thousand stories, substantial confluence, opsgenie history, and three service desks).2. Will our integrations, configuration, and customizations also be recovered, or will we need to rebuild those once our data is recovered?I have received no response, and no human is even willing to acknowledge those questions. The service desk staff ignore them as if I never asked. Repeatedly.Also, I&#39;ve been asking around, and haven&#39;t been able to find a single story from somebody that can confirm that they were down, who has had their data recovered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding the backup restores:I once worked a company that had a data loss issue. There was nothing else we could do, we had exhausted every option we had over almost 40 hours. At the end of the second day, it was decided to restore from backup.We had done this before, as a test. It took about 12 hours to restore the data and another 12 hours to import the data and get back up and running.One small thing was different this time, and it had huge consequences. As a cost-saving measure, an engineer had changed the location of our backups to the cold-storage tier offered by our cloud provider. All backups, not just &#39;old&#39; ones.This added 2 additional days to our recovery time, for a total of five days. Interestingly enough, even though we offered a full month&#39;s refund to all of our customers, not even half of them took us up on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember finding out one of the senior managers from my company ended up as head of software at Atlassian.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Edited to upload the image to imgur and avoid spammy advertisements).Here I&#39;ll date myself: I remember this as &#34;diode with a gate&#34;. Back when we did circuit diagrams with stencils, you had the diode stencil which looks like a triangle with a line on top, and then with the electrical stencils you had &#34;decorations&#34;.The intention was to put down the original symbol on the paper, move the decorations stencil over top of it and then add the required decorations. It&#39;s why diode symbols look like this: https://imgur.com/a/0tSLV7O (notice &#34;step recovery diode&#34;).The &#34;lightning bolt&#34; isn&#39;t a lightning bolt, it&#39;s a hint that this diode is going to have a very sharp &#34;snap off&#34; in the waveform. See: https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_compon...OK so why do we have a seperate decorator for a diode? Can&#39;t we just have a pocket full of stencils for diodes? Space was at a premium back then. It goes back to daisy wheels and typeballs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing)#Impact_pri... You would have one position for &#34;diode&#34; and one position for &#34;decorator&#34; and the printer would know when it got one ASCII char it would print the diode, then send whatever the thin space is to advance the print carriage a small step, then print the decorator.Someone should be able to find a daisy wheel or typeball dedicated to circuits and bear this out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Haidt makes an excellent observation about the mid-20th century unity being an aberration due to the technology of the time:&gt; Gurri is no fan of elites or of centralized authority, but he notes a constructive feature of the pre-digital era: a single “mass audience,” all consuming the same content, as if they were all looking into the same gigantic mirror at the reflection of their own society.Something I think we overlook is that America was more fractious prior to the mid-20th century, but the stakes were lower because our institutions were more distributed and more local. The federal government had a vastly smaller scope back then, but so did nationwide and multinational corporations. Differences in world view are less significant when the bureaucrats and executives with power over your life live nearby instead of in another city and state. Our current structure, with a homogenous federal government and nationwide corporations arose against the backdrop of that unity.What I see missing from Haidt&#39;s analysis is increased federalism and localism as a solution. Aside from maybe California, our individual states remain vastly less fractious than the nation as a whole. Here in Maryland, for example, our Republican governor has an approval rating over 70% in both rural and urban areas. That&#39;s not because the state doesn&#39;t have ideological diversity--a third of the state voted for Trump. But the extremes are compressed compared to the nation as a whole--Baltimore isn&#39;t San Francisco but neither is Carroll County rural Alabama. Not only that, it&#39;s hard to get folks in Carroll County worked up about Baltimore they way they get worked up about San Francisco, and vice versa."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I am a big fan of Jonathan Haidt, and have read several of his books, I can&#39;t help but feel that this is written from a point of view that is entirely too impressed with (if also afraid of) technology.Peter Turchin predicted escalating levels of polarization in the US, reaching a peak around 2020, without any need to look at social media.  The level of political polarization now, while high, is less than the late 1850&#39;s.  I also think he&#39;s more impressed with AI-generated content than is warranted; unpaid zealots can crank the stuff out in more than enough quantity.Turchin blames elite overproduction; it seems a much more fundamental issue than social media.  Haidt even provides evidence for that here:&#34;These two extreme groups are similar in surprising ways. They are the whitest and richest of the seven groups, which suggests that America is being torn apart by a battle between two subsets of the elite who are not representative of the broader society.&#34;Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I am no fan of FB or Twitter, but I don&#39;t think Haidt&#39;s take on this is accurate.  The stupidity of current discourse uses social media, of course, because that&#39;s the dominant media, but I don&#39;t believe they caused it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“He described the nihilism of the many protest movements of 2011 that organized mostly online and that, like Occupy Wall Street, demanded the destruction of existing institutions without offering an alternative vision of the future or an organization that could bring it about.“Calling Occupy nihilistic is strikes me as blinkered, and shows the neoliberal bias of the author. Occupy is where the 99% vs. 1% lens arose, which is a reasonable description of concentration of wealth and power across Western countries and especially the US. Occupy attempted to employ more empowering and less alienating peer-to-peer governance.Occupy didn’t “succeed”, probably due to both internal and external forces, but it wasn’t nihilistic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not really fair to compare this, which takes heat at 2000°C, to a steam turbine that takes heat at say 550°C.A turbine system would have much better efficiency than 40% if its heat was available at that temperature. For example a closed Brayton cycle gas turbine + steam turbine system. Certainly complex and expensive, but could get much better than 40% efficiency."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The university where I did a post-bacc had a research project back in the late 1990s to build a TPV-powered hybrid electric car that used compressed natural gas to heat an emitter surrounded by water-cooled PV cells.With the technology at the time they weren&#39;t able to get the efficiency to be competitive with an internal combustion engine, but something like this probably could&#39;ve made it competitive. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any need for it with today&#39;s battery performance/price, but maybe as a range extender or something.https://vri.wwu.edu/viking-series-cars-history/ (scroll down to Viking 29)https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/97...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK, so perhaps it&#39;s not the de-carbonization future we all wanted, but this could be an absolute game changer for planetary exploration, where RTG (nuclear-decay-driven thermal engines) are common. The existing efficiency for those is abysmal, which is actually OK since heat is such a useful product in itself.I&#39;m looking at Dragonfly, specifically, where an RTG provides the electricity and heat to keep everything alive. Imagine what 10x longer flights would do for that mission."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A well-written article, especially clearly listing out the differences in the forms of communication helped make the point.
But sadly, the people most prone to bad-faith communication are also probably least likely to take this criticism and improve. I have also resorted to bad-faith communications in conversations where it seems like that is the only way to be heard.Consider this example:
Person A, displaying some humility, says : &#34;You might be right, there is a chance politician X is in the wrong&#34;.
Person A assumes this is interpreted by Person B as: &#34;There is uncertainty about politician X being in the wrong&#34;
Person B actually interprets this as: &#34;Person A has admitted, without any doubt, to politician X being completely in the wrong&#34;If I ever find myself in a conversation where I&#39;m in the shoes of Person A, using good-faith communication means actually risking a complete failure of communication. Why even bother to communicate?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an alternative ending: what if good faith communication was superior to bad faith in a systemic way ?Clues:- at a personal level: have you ever tried to put in practice &#34;highly skilled, non-naive good faith communication&#34; ? If you did, you&#39;ve probably noted that more often than not, it doesn&#39;t make you weaker. It increases your value, your status, even your financial success. So maybe this could also be a contagious/unstoppable strategy simply because it has an edge for personal success ?- as an organization: good faith leadership, good faith communication... seem to overall be a competitive advantage because it goes hand-in-hand with happy &amp; productive people- as a society: democracy emerged despite a world of tyrants to take over most a the world. Why ? Maybe because it was stronger in a systemic way ? It unlocks collaboration, decentralization, resilience... Moreover, it doesn&#39;t sound unreasonable that democracy would be fittest as poverty diminishes. So maybe authoritarianism, not democracy, is in danger of extinction in the end ?Result: instead of spiraling bad faith, maybe we will have (though slower) spiraling good faith ? Maybe &#34;good faith&#34; will win simply because it&#39;s stronger, in a kind of evolutionary sense.This has implications in everyday life : practicing &#34;highly skilled, non-naive good faith communication&#34; may be the best way to personal success.
And this may also be the best way to incidentally induce a &#34;good faith&#34; society"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be great for people who desire good faith communication to call out people who are resorting to bad faith techniques.  Especially, and most importantly, when those bad actors are of the same political stripe.It&#39;s impossible for those bad actors to hear criticism from &#34;the enemy&#34;.  Only people who share a position of almost total fundamental agreement, can maybe be heard in any criticism of how to better deal with the opposition.TLDR:  We should be most aggressive and loud in criticism of those we agree with most."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Deno core team member and TC39 delegate here.We have pondered about capability based security for Deno in the past. Our conclusion has always been that this is not possible to do securely in JS without freezing all prototypes and objects by default. The reasoning for this is that you need to make sure the capability token does not ever leak. For example as a malicious user I could override `globalThis.fetch` to exfiltrate the capability token destined for `fetch` and use it myself later.One could also override `Map.prototype.set` / `Map.prototype.get` to exfiltrate  a token every time it is added or removed from a `Map` (people will want to store tokens in a `Map`).One could also override `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` to exfiltrate tokens  stored in arrays if those arrays are destructored, spread, etc.There are many more cases like this, where one can exfiltrate tokens because of the very dynamic nature of JavaScript.It is unlikely that freezing all intrinsic prototypes and objects is even enough. People will find ways to exfiltrate tokens."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The impression I get from the companies I&#39;ve worked at is to not trust packages that are mostly maintained by one person. Ironically, those packages are usually the ones that don&#39;t have outrageously large dependency trees and can usually be audited by a developer on a weekend, and the more &#34;trustworthy&#34; larger packages with hundreds of maintainers typically have monstrous dependency trees.Not saying 1-man tools are inherently better, but in my experience, these tools seems to have a tighter focus and less chances of scope/dependency creep."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Founder of Socket (https://socket.dev) here, a new tool built by npm maintainers to help solve JavaScript supply chain security.I totally agree with the idea that we should assume all open source packages may be malicious. Socket.dev uses &#34;deep package inspection&#34; to characterize the behavior of an open source package. By actually analyzing the package code, Socket can detect when packages use security-relevant platform capabilities, such as the network, filesystem, or shell.For instance, to detect if a package uses the network, Socket looks at whether fetch(), or Node&#39;s net, dgram, dns, http or https modules are used within the package or any of its dependencies.This entails running static analysis (and soon, dynamic analysis) on a package – and all of its dependencies – to look for specific risk markers.In this way, Socket can detect the tell-tale signs of a supply chain attack, including the introduction of install scripts, obfuscated code, high entropy strings, or usage of privileged APIs such as shell, filesystem, eval(), and environment variables.We are taking an entirely new approach to one of the hardest problems in security in a stagnant part of the industry that has historically been obsessed with just reporting on known vulnerabilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like a perfectly reasonable way to end a service. The server died, and the effort to bring it back up seems high.This is a reminder to pay for services you depend on. Per the Pinboard founder&#39;s post:&gt; I love free software and could not have built my site without it. But free web services are not like free software. If your free software project suddenly gets popular, you gain resources: testers, developers and people willing to pitch in. If your free website takes off, you lose resources. Your time is spent firefighting and your money all goes to the nice people at Linode.&gt; Like a service? Make them charge you or show you ads. If they won&#39;t do it, clone them and do it yourself. Soon you&#39;ll be the only game in town!https://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project was killed by invisible complexity. I felt a little sad
reading about it. There are lots of comments talking about the
sustainability of projects with respect to money and burnout, the need
to pay for services etc. I get that and agree. But I also get the
impression that wouldn&#39;t have helped here.When we reach a situation where some unknown person pushes an upstream
update, which causes a cascade of problems that even someone with deep
technical knowledge and daily connection to the project cannot unpick,
that&#39;s a breakdown in modularity/dependency.It&#39;s what we faced in the 1990s and from it evolved package managers,
version control, dependency management and all the good things.I think in 2022 we&#39;re back in a similar situation again.
Virtualisation, containers, cloud services and whatnot have regressed
development reliability.I predict the day when a really major service provider comes out and
says; &#34;Sorry everyone. It&#39;s been 10 days downtime. We&#39;ve put our 1000
top engineers on the problem and nobody knows what&#39;s wrong. We just
can&#39;t fix it.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He says he had hundreds of users and hosting costs were a problem. This made me curious how this could be. Testing SSL for a few hundred users should pretty much free these days.He said Patreon pledges paid for 25% of hosting. So I looked up his Patreon. Turns out he has 3 (!) patreons, together paying $9 per month.The web is a strange place.Here comes a fun fact I can add: He is doing better than me. I have a website with about 500000 monthly users and 5 (!) patreons. So while he only had 1% paying users, I only have 0.001% :)Did I say the web is a strange place? Will this ever change?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did some research on this as part of my undergrad in the early 00&#39;sI skimmed the article but it seems to align with the literature back then. The thinking was during our evolution that high volume low frequency sounds would represent a precursor to mortal danger (avalanches, earthquakes, stampedes, thunder, wind) so we were attuned to secreting stress hormones in early response. Unfortunately, much of our urban built-environment is full of (human-made) constant low-frequency sources, although we appear to have adapted to a degree (HVAC systems in buildings, traffic, industrial process plants, airports and air traffic, explosions, concerts).What isn&#39;t mentioned here, that I remember finding particularly concerning, was that while we seem to adapt, it&#39;s over our own time, as children we secrete more cortisol to low frequency noise than when we are adults... maybe some form of long term CBT I don&#39;t know.I have no idea where my old paper is but I remember (and someone with more time might want to check/confirm this) one important study showed cortisol levels of children at schools close to Heathrow compared to out in the UK countryside and how this affected standardised testing. There were limitations, and of course you had to control for a range of factors, socio-economic, teaching staff etc, but there was some measurable negative effect (again no idea if this was repeated/corroborated).The actual research I was doing was into our auditory perception of urban spaces. We took recordings of various urban settings and had participants listen and rate their emotional responses, if it felt &#34;hot&#34; or &#34;cold&#34; (and other adjective pairs), we also had them draw something to represent what they were listening too.Our &#34;findings&#34; were pretty limited for a short undergrad project but it was interesting how we generally appreciate background chatter and live-music and generally fearful and cold from large flat surface reflected sound (empty city plazas)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the things I struggle with the most in life. I feel like most people don&#39;t seem to care about noise pollution and zero care is put into designing living spaces or cities to minimize it. I&#39;ve moved into apartments and nearly cried because I realized that there was some noise pollution that wasn&#39;t apparent when I visited it (e.g. a water boiler that ran constantly at night, road noise during the day, etc) and would have to deal with it for a year.One of the few countries I&#39;ve been to that takes noise pollution seriously is Switzerland. A beautifully peaceful and quiet country."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It all works this way (though a certain female family member would disagree, claiming to remember conversations word-for-word years later).But my memory works this way.  A summary &#34;party at so-and-so&#39;s house, weather was nice, overall vibe was ___&#34;.  The rest is context.  You know what the house/backyard is like, you know the general feel of that time of year, you know the crowd that usually comes, you can easily synthesize details like the smell of the BBQ and the taste of the food... build up a complete &#34;memory&#34; from stuff that could be summarized in a paragraph of text plus generic (not specific to one memory episode) context.I can build up a relatively vivid mental image of my walking route to school (from the bus terminal) over 40 years ago.  Is it accurate?  Who cares.  As long as no detailed record exists to compare it to that would reveal the &#34;lossy compression&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone suffering from Aphantasia [0] (I don&#39;t have mental imagery at all) and I&#39;ve been telling people for the longest time that this is how I relate to the world. I summarize things. Even my mother&#39;s face.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Compression is a component of general intelligence. A few years ago I was very sceptical of machine learning ever leading to general intelligence. I&#39;ve since changed my mind. There are a lot of parallels to this work and the concept of &#34;embeddings&#34; in machine learning.Intelligence requires the ability to generalize. A prerequisite for generalization is the ability to take something high-dimensional and reduce it to a lower-dimensional representation to allow comparison and grouping of concepts.We&#39;re doing this all the time. Take a pen for example: we&#39;re able to combine information from sight, touch, and sound. Through some mechanism, our brains reduce the multi-sensory information and create a consistent representation that is able to invoke past memories and knowledge about pens.Our brains encode the embeddings in a very different way to deep learning neural networks, but the commonality is that both are able to compress data into a _useful_ representation. Note that as a result of this, the quality of the compression is important. Some forms of compression might be very efficient but they also tangle concepts together, resulting in loss of composability. The ideal compression (from an intelligence point of view) is both information efficient and maximally composable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Living in Spain, I love trains and take them over airplane when it&#39;s an option. However, trains are often around twice as expensive as flying for may routes. I know nothing about trains, but intuitively I would expect the opposite, and I really wish it was more affordable, specially high speed rail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here in Germany, for as long as I can remember, the government praises itself every year for investing as much in rail as never before. I have not noticed the service quality to change for the better over the last 15 years. The ever-rising investments seem to be only enough to keep the status quo of the crumbling infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an American who doesn&#39;t drive, the experience of trains in the EU compared to the US is just delightful. Yes, there are super cheap flights and I used them often for longer haul trips but the trains were always amazing- I&#39;ve done trips including Mariupol to Lviv, Budapest to Berlin, and Berlin to Munich and always had a great experience. The Romania-Chisinau line is quite old but part of its charm. I see a lot of people talking about the expense compared to the cheap flights- those are solid and I&#39;ve used them a lot but after you factor in the waiting time at airports, the unexpected fees in case your bag is a kilo too heavy, the uber to and from a far away airport, etc. it&#39;s really not that much of a difference. There is no comparison to trains in the U.S. (e.g. I took one for 3 days from DC to LA; while I enjoyed it, it was a slough with no real food facilities for the passengers not in sleeper cars, old chairs, etc.). I hope there will be more investment, especially in the Baltics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I loved, loved, loved my Pebble Time. It did everything I wanted out of a smart watch, especially eliminating my phone-checking habit, because I was always on top of whether new emails were worth reading, it was a sanity saver during an intense M&amp;A process. Also, it somehow had a super long-lived battery, and it had so much more personality than most electronic devices, with its little 8-bittish animated icons, reminded me of a Gameboy Advance or something. Thanks for making one of my favorite devices of the last decade, Eric."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pebble had an incredibly clever design for their watch apps.  The watch itself had a limited processor and even more limited RAM but it could hold a few apps and those apps had a lot of capability.Each app had both a on-watch component and an on-phone component and you could install these apps from their own app store and same app worked on both iOS and Android.  They got around both the app install limitations on iOS and the cross-platform compatibility issues by making the on-phone portion run in the platform&#39;s JavaScript engine.You could, for example, create a weather application that fetched the weather from the Internet and displayed it on the watch.  The on-phone app would fetch the weather from the Internet using JavaScript code and then transmit that data to the corresponding C-based watch app.  Watch apps could even have settings that were just HTML pages.I always impressed by the cleverness and simplicity of that design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We sold 2 million watches and did over $230m in sales.&#34;So from 0 to 2 million in 4 years?I was just explaining to my child that many &#34;failures&#34; are only failures from a strange but important angle. They might have been profitable at the time they were canceled, but they were perceived by their maker as less profitable than some other potential product. A venture might net $1m/year and be deemed a wild success. Or it might be deemed a failure if the maker thinks they could net $5m/year on a different venture using the same resources."</p>

I suspect that the &#34;0.18%  impacted&#34; number is relative to ALL users of Atlassian, including free/limited accounts, and that the percentage of large/serious organizations who are impacted (and who would have a use for an asset management product), is much higher."</p>
