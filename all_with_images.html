								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HIV is incredibly sophisticated. It&#39;s actually kind of amazing how effective it is. I mean obviously the resulting disease is bad, no question. You can still appreciate the sophistication.HIV has resisted efforts to develop a vaccine for 30+ years at this point.I am already beginning to wonder if the 2020s will be the story of the social transformation caused by mRNA vaccines. An effective and relatively cheap HIV vaccine will be huge.Apart from Covid and HIV, mRNA is going to have a huge effect on the flu vaccine too. For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, predictions are made about what flu strains will dominate the coming winter 4-6+ months ahead of time and the vaccine is made from that. Those predictions may not be accurate, which largely explains the variance of efficacy. mRNA has the potential to reduce that down to 1-2 months so you can potentially react to the actual dominant strains.Cancer of course isn&#39;t a single disease. Even something like lung cancer are a collection of different diseases. But some cancers are caused by viruses. A notable example is cervical cancer where it seems like most cases are caused by HPV strains. Australia is on track to essentially eliminate cervical cancer by 2035 [1]. To be clear, this isn&#39;t an mRNA vaccine.But mRNA vaccines may greatly reduce the time required to develop a vaccine and make it possible to eliminate whole classes of diseases.This is all super-exciting.[1]: https://www.vcs.org.au/blog/our-impact/news/australia-can-co...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Video of the lifecycle of HIV.  To me it&#39;s absolutely mind-blowing to think that this entire process developed on its own, in dark, and is mindlessly progressing along so effectively that despite all of our technological capability we can barely contain it.https://vimeo.com/260291607(also how awesome is the music?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The graveyard of HIV vaccines that failed at Phase II is unfortunately large, and this isn&#39;t even there yet.  I won&#39;t be holding my breath on this one.  HIV is tricky."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What shocks me most with this story is that there is a vaccine (Lymerix), and it&#39;s pretty effective (76-92 percent after three injections) but apparently some anti-vax propaganda and a class-action lawsuit essentially removed it from the market. Based on a very rare side effect. Wtf? How can that be? Just tell people the risks of side effects, and if they are ok with that risk then the manufacturer is off the hook.I&#39;d totally take that shot. 59 cases out of 1.4 million is nothing, and even for those it&#39;s unclear how they actually were related to the shot.Sadly, this indicates that the new shot could suffer the same fate. Give it to a million people, some will for sure have some issue, anti-vaxers come with conspiracy theories and convince a few to a class action, and there we go, another few decades without a shot. Gotta be fast this time before it&#39;s too late again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a US new england-er, this is game changer for walking through woods.For those un-informed, on a walk through any woods, you should always wear high socks, and do a full body check for ticks after.Deer ticks can be as small as a few grains of sand, and near undetectable if they latch on unless you have sharp eyes.Obviously they can transmit lymes.I had a close encounter a few years ago, but very luckily giant rings appeared around the bite site, making it a very easy diagnosis.That only happens in 30% of cases though. The rest likely have no idea, and over time the disease will work it&#39;s way into your nervous system, causing permanent damage if not treated quickly enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this is about Lyme disease, but let me add another word of caution while we are discussing ticks.  Two years ago I was bit by the Lone Star tick. Since that time I developed an allergy to all red meat. It was hard to diagnose and a few of the doctors I worked with along the years still don’t believe its true.  If your interested in learning more search for Alpha Gal.  There is an excellent Radio Lab podcast about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recommend almost anything else at all other than Zoom.As a security researcher that has reported a number of issues to Zoom, I can say without reservation they are one of the most security negligent companies I ever worked with.It was evident after multiple calls with their team they didn&#39;t employ anyone strong technically in their US offices and had no idea how to translate security issues, even obvious ones like DNS takeover, to their (I assume China based) eng teams.The software was designed without security as even a thought as many researchers have demonstrated. To this day the clients expect administrative access for no reason. I refuse to install them and tolerate the webapp when people insist on Zoom.A friend and I compiled this list to consider.https://gist.github.com/dacruz21/dd2480f195f5b48a9ab7af8b41c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Offer a comparable alternative, then. I spend half my day on meetings either internally or with clients, and every time I have to jump on a client meeting with Microsoft Teams/Google Hangouts/WebEx/GotoMeeting because their company bans Zoom, it&#39;s a recipe for a fruitless meeting. Someone will fumble the sharing controls; screens will take forever to present; at least one person&#39;s microphone will become inaudible, static-y, or suffer from &#34;robot voice slow-down&#34; lag.To say nothing of the clusterf*ck that happens when two company-specific instances of Microsoft Teams try to communicate with each other and I&#39;m left with a bunch of orphaned chatrooms with outside personnel after the meeting concludes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I live in a bizzaro world...First, I’ve been working remotely over skype, audio-only, for over a decade.
Yet in 2020 and with the emergence of zoom, it’s suddenly become an expectation that everyone is incessantly and awkwardly staring at each other through screens for the  whole workday.Second, the few times I’ve used Zoom it’s been absolutely garbage, with video and sound dropping or just not there (this was a university paying for Zoom’s services).Yet I use teams everyday, and while I have plenty of complaints about it, at least I can get the sound and (screen-sharing) video that I actually need for my work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article mentions losses at the hohlraum but doesn&#39;t mention losses in the laser. &#34;Ignition&#34; means they controled the implosion well enough to break (almost) even on laser energy, but the laser itself is less than 1% efficient on wall power. Input energy to the entire system is over 400 MJ per shot. Even at max theoretical fusion yield, it wouldn&#39;t come close to breakeven.There&#39;s also a firing rate issue. Even if the system produced net power, significant production would require many shots per second. Currently, the laser flash lamps are expendable and it takes on the order of a day (and lots of money) to prep for each shot.Some of these drawbacks were addressed in the LIFE proposal, which would use fusion neutrons to burn fission fuel in a blanket around the fusion chamber. You could burn spent reactor fuel subcritically (no fission chain reaction), for example. But then it&#39;s a fission machine, and criticality excursions aren&#39;t much of an issue in conventional fission reactors. In the end, there are many drawbacks and little benefit with such a setup -- even if it worked.I love lasers, and NIF is a marvel. But there really is no sensical story about power production in it. Even the machine&#39;s stated purpose -- stockpile maintenence -- is highly dubious. It is really an elaborate welfare machine, given to weapons scientists in exchange for their support of testing bans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Herrmann noted that in previous experiments, neutrons exiting the capsule on one side of the implosion arrived a few picoseconds earlier than did those flying off the opposite wayLet’s all just take a step back here and marvel at this statement. We (science-humans) are capable of building a machine that can detect and quantify picosecond level variances in neutrons traveling in an enclosure.  We can do amazing things.Side note - the lab is just down the road from me, I’m proud of my fellow Livermorons, and continue to hope they keep all those megajoules contained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the info so far...I would advise a frugal dose of 
moderate optimist toned down with a spice of healthy scepticism:&#34;The lab hasn’t yet reproduced this month’s results, and Herrmann cautioned that doing so might not be straightforward. “We don’t know what variability will be in successive shots. It’s a nonlinear process where alpha heating heats up the fusion fuel and creates more fusion, which creates more heat.” Herrmann says the 3.5 MeV alpha particles, which remain in the plasma, produced 20% of the fusion yield, with 14 MeV neutrons accounting for most of the energy.&#34;&#34;The lab is still analyzing the results from the shot. It’s not yet known which or what combination of advances to the targets, laser pulse lengths, or other variables led to the leap in performance. Some of the instruments were saturated by the unexpected yield of the reaction. A few that are used in the target chamber for other, non-ignition experiments will need repair.&#34;&#34;Herrmann acknowledged that the announcement deviates from the standard practice of peer-reviewed publication. But the results, he says, were leaking, “so we wanted to put it out so people could discuss the facts.”  &#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zoom has a popular feature which allows for screen sharing a single application window instead of the entire desktop. I assume this is how its discovering running applications with GUI windows open in a cross-platform manner. Perhaps there is a better API for this? Its not a common use-case that an app would need to know all of the other open windows, but it seems like a perfectly valid use case, and frankly handy for sharing a PPT without fear of an embarrassing email showing up in during a meeting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Why would it do that?We can answer part of that with just a little more reading.  What&#39;s pid 3844872?For me, the series of queries against /proc happen from a process that, just a bit earlier, called exec.  So it&#39;s not really zoom reading &#34;all processes and arguments&#34; but ... `pidof gnome-session`, so I guess zoom is looking for the pid of gnome-session.To what nefarious purpose zoom intends to put this knowledge of gnome-session&#39;s pid, I can&#39;t say - I am not running gnome-session so my trail goes cold; but at least for me, for that particular run, zoom itself doesn&#39;t actually see the contents of all of those files."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have no specific comment to make on the (first two chapters of the) book recommended by this blog. However I have become wary of people recommending a textbook because it finally helped them understand something they had tried to wrap their head around for years.I heard a conjecture once that the best textbook you&#39;ll find on any given topic is your third. The point, of course, is that it simply takes about three serious attempts to make it click - but it is a fallacy to give all the credit to the third book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious what the target audience this book is for. The chapter &#34;Our Goal&#34; says that the books is to teach programmers how to engage mathematics, but programmers have wide range of mathematical maturity. The second theorem in the book is as follows:For any integer n &gt;= 0 and any list of n + 1 points (x[1], y[1]), ... , (x[n+1], y[n+1]) in R^2 with x[1] &lt; x[2] &lt; ... &lt; x[n+1], there exists a unique polynomial p(x) of degree at most n such tat p(x[i]) = y[i] for all i.So, it seems the author assumes that a reader will have math maturity of a good senior high-school student, as most of students wouldn&#39;t need to worry about property of existence. The book also covers the proof of such theorem with formal notations and the proof is built up with previous theorems -- a pretty standard way in math books which nonetheless requires math maturity of a good high school senior. The table of contents also shows that the book will cover linear algebra, calculus, and group theory in a whirlwind. Again, such content demands close-to-college-level math maturity. I&#39;m also generous here, as public schools of the US do not really teach that much formal math.So, here is the dilemma: people with this level of maturity should already be good at math or have access to other materials to help them with math. People who do not possess such maturity will not go through the book anyway, or have more beginner-friendly materials to read. Note I&#39;m sure there are exceptions, but I question the percentage of such exception."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I maintain that it isn&#39;t just hard, it is computationally impossible.We should all know that given a belief about the world, and evidence, Bayes&#39; Theorem describes how to update our beliefs.But what if we have a network of interrelated beliefs?  That&#39;s called a Bayesian net, and it turns out that Bayes&#39; Theorem also prescribes a unique answer.  However, unfortunately, it turns out that working out that answer is NP-hard.OK, you say, we can come up with an approximate answer.  Sorry, no, coming up with an approximate answer that gets within probability 0.5 - ε, for 0 &lt; ε, is ALSO NP-hard.  It is literally true that under the right circumstances a single data point logically should be able to flip our entire world view, and which data point does it is computationally intractible.Therefore our brains use a bunch of heuristics, with a bunch of known failure modes.  You can read all the lesswrong you want. You can read Thinking, Fast and Slow and learn why we fail as we do.  But the one thing that we cannot do, no matter how much work or effort we put into it, is have the sheer brainpower required to actually BE rational.The effort of doing better is still worthwhile.  But the goal itself is unachievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are some good bits in here. I love the subtitle especially: &#34;The real challenge isn’t being right but knowing how wrong you might be.&#34; Knowing when not to provide an answer is hard. A big part of my job is communicating statistical findings and giving a good non-answer is much harder than giving a good answer, both technically speaking and socially speaking.One thing I&#39;ll add that drives me nuts is the fetishization of bayesian reasoning I see some times here on HN. There are times that bayesian reasoning is helpful and times that it isn&#39;t. Specifically, when you don&#39;t trust your model, bayes rule can mislead you badly (frequently when it comes to missing/counterfactual data). It&#39;s just a tool. There are others. It makes me crazy when it&#39;s someone&#39;s only hammer, so everything starts to look like a nail. Sometimes, more appropriate tools leave you without an answer.Apparently that&#39;s not something we&#39;re willing to live with."</p>

I found them on github https://github.com/widelands/widelands where it&#39;s described as:
&#34;Widelands is a free, open source real-time strategy game with singleplayer campaigns and a multiplayer mode. The game was inspired by Settlers II™ (© Bluebyte) but has significantly more variety and depth to it.&#34;It makes me quite excited. I really loved settlers II and I am waiting curiously for the next release of the settlers saga, as I haven&#39;t liked the follow-ups. The next instalment is said to be more like settlers II again. Maybe this open and free game is all I really wanted? 
I will try it out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think most game styles do not fit the &#34;open source&#34; development model. Mainly because games often need a &#34;surprise effect&#34; when released and that is a poorly fit for open development and also because it is easier to contribute code than convince an artist to contribute art tailored to a very specific style.RTS and games like Wesnoth are an exception: they are born a certain way and slowly evolve through contributions to a point where they sometimes finally became very interesting. I have high hopes for the future of 0ad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To those here riffing on the theme of “this misrepresents the volume and beneficiaries of the transactions involved” - you’re not wrong. Accurate representation of public info like this is a top organisational problem for our species at the moment.But I do think you miss the point, so aptly put by Mr Eisenhower:“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.”In a strictly limited sense, I’d rather get my cross of iron at 66% off than for the full $6.4T. Better yet would be universal healthcare, enough homes to go round, clean, sustainable energy production systems, and bridges that keep on bridging."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Medicare for all”, the single payer universal healthcare system in the US, was projected to cost between $16-34T [1] over a decade. I know there are some big questions around the actual cost of US aggression / state terrorism since 9/11 (ie 6.4T vs 2T as per other entries in this thread). A rough 80/20 analysis suggests:* We could have funded free healthcare to roughly one quarter of the US population for 10 years (see [1])
* We could have funded free medication for all US citizens for 20 years (assuming US spends an average $1100/yr per patient, approx double of other countries [2], viz a biz the estimated spend of $1K USD / yr per US citizen spent over 20 years on aggression since 9-11 mentioned above)
* …I quite like the following quote by Noam Chomsky on US international terror in Afghanistan (and Nicaragua, Iraq, Sudan and many other places):“ The U.S. is officially committed to what is called “low–intensity warfare.” That’s the official doctrine. If you read the definition of low–intensity conflict in army manuals and compare it with official definitions of “terrorism” in army manuals, or the U.S. Code, you find they’re almost the same. Terrorism is the use of coercive means aimed at civilian populations in an effort to achieve political, religious, or other aims. That’s what the World Trade Center bombing was, a particularly horrifying terrorist crime. And that’s official doctrine. I mentioned a couple of examples. We could go on and on. It’s simply part of state action, not just the U.S. of course.” [3]It sums up the meaninglessness quite well.[1] https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-will-medicare-all-cost
[2] https://data.oecd.org/healthres/pharmaceutical-spending.htm#...
[3] https://monthlyreview.org/2001/11/01/the-united-states-is-a-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps they should&#39;ve spent this much on medical research instead.  For the same money perhaps we could save a few million people dying of various diseases or cancer.  It would take a whole lot of terrorist events to counter the benefits of significant R&amp;D funding for medicine (or maybe a lot of other things)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love these text-based languages for music composition. Its something that is approaching a gap in music composition in real-life vs via computer. In real-life you can tell your bandmates to &#34;just play a I V IV in C&#34; and they get it. But we are still not quite at a place where we can tell a computer that exact phrase and get something useful. I love how close these text-based languages are getting though!I&#39;ve actually made my own musical language too - called miti [1], which is just one of many others including textbeat [2], foxdot [3], sonic-pi [4], chuck [5], and melrose [6]. Each has their own goals and capabilities.- [1] https://github.com/schollz/miti- [2] https://github.com/flipcoder/textbeat- [3] https://foxdot.org/- [4] https://sonic-pi.net/- [5] https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/- [6] https://github.com/emicklei/melrose"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry to be a downer here, but can someone explain to me what the appeal of these projects are? In the past year or so I&#39;ve seen a number of text-based music notation projects hit the front page of Hacker News and don&#39;t really understand the purpose they are trying to achieve.If I want to transport music notation between software programs, I have MIDI for that, which does a good job of capturing all elements of a performance (keys, timing, velocity, pedals, aftertouch, etc.) These types of notation formats almost always fail to achieve MIDIs precision across all the aspects of a performance.If I want to compose music, I need a format that makes it easy to visualize and manipulate notes in context of the other notes playing across all instruments. DAW piano rolls do a fantastic job of overlaying note information, and traditional combined scores do the same too. Again, text notation usually falls flat here - for example, if you had a large ensemble, and wanted to know which chord was being played on the 2nd beat of the 5th measure, how easily can do you do that? How do you determine if it&#39;s an open spacing or closed spacing? How do you determine the root without walking back through all the octave shifts?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s funny about having to rely on unauthorized clones to provide a fast native UX was that Spotify&#39;s original client back in 2008 started out as beautifully light, custom rendered native client.Few Apps ever had that wow factor the first time I used it, it was so much lighter and more responsive than anything else of the day. I remember being perplexed at how I could search and skip to any part of a song quicker than iTunes could looking at a local library. Everything was latency-free and instantaneous.We were building a Music Startup at the time, so we investigated how it worked. We we’re very surprised we couldn’t find any evidence of an established UI toolkit. It looked as though they had built their own custom UI renderer and optimized TCP protocol which sent back its metadata in XML. Their traffic looked like it was initially seeded from their own (or CDN) servers (for best latency) and then overtime we would see some P2P traffic on the wire.Our QT/C++ client had decent performance but was noticeably heavier than Spotify&#39;s. I was disappointed to see their native client eventually be abandoned and succumb to become yet another Chromium wrapper. I expect it fell to the pressures of a growing startup adding 100s of developers (without the skill of their original CTO/devs) where a native UI couldn&#39;t be updated and re-iterated as fast as a Web App. I wish they maintained 2 desktop clients, and left their native client alone to just be an audio player and push all their new social features to their new flagship CEF app.It&#39;s unfortunate the skill and desire of building fast native UIs are being lost to Electron and CEF wrappers. Seems the larger the organization the more likely they are to build new Web rendered Desktop Apps and we have to rely on unauthorized Indie efforts like this for fast, responsive native UIs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that has devastated me about recent Spotify updates is that now, when viewing an Artist, you do not get to see all of the albums (or at least the first 10 newest albums) for that artist straight away with all of the tracks listed. It&#39;s now much harder to find a song that you don&#39;t know the title of, but you know an artist has sung.It&#39;s also small changes that are extremely annoying. Pressing &#34;New Playlist&#34; used to come up with a dialog box asking what the playlist should be named. Now it just gets called &#34;New Playlist&#34;. Clicking the playlist name to rename it does not automatically select the textbox to give it a name, meaning that to create a new named playlist - an action that used to take one click, is at least three clicks and two keyboard presses... I mean, come on Spotify!The search bar used to always be visible. Now I need to click search first, then click the search bar.To me, Spotify was the epitome of software completion five years ago. The client worked. It was perfect. It seems like every single update since they released the &#34;Daily Mixes&#34;  has both downgraded the performance of the app, and made discoverability harder. I want Spotify how it was 18 months ago.Spotify on my machine sometimes chews up 2GB of RAM. Reached out to support, and the best that they can give is &#34;try restarting the app&#34;. That helps, until 12 hours later you need to do it again. A music player should not have 10% CPU usage on a modern MacBook.Finding Psst has been a life changer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this point, I&#39;d be willing to pay for a Spotify client that works exactly the same, but just ignores the existence of podcasts entirely. I use a dedicated podcast client when I want to listen to podcasts, and they keep shoving them in my face and taking up precious UI real estate everywhere.But any client without support for Spotify Connect might as well be dead to me. Controlling my wifi speakers from my phone, or playing music on my desktop Mac from my laptop or gaming PC is critical functionality at this point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with the idea that SPF, DKIM and DMARC are somehow hard. They&#39;re all one-liners in DNS config that can easily be generated with some online tools if you don&#39;t want to read the standard. In my experience, correctly configuring mail server software is a lot harder than configuring the DNS to make your email arrive as reliably as possible. Obscure configuration formats are par for the course for almost every mail server setup.I&#39;ve personally had a much harder time getting DNSSEC to work than I ever had issues with the various email DNS records. Even that is manageable if you&#39;re willing to Google around for a while.My solution to getting self-hosted email right is using Mailcow. A cheap VPS (Contabo FTW) plus Docker is all you need to get it to work, and it spits out all the DNS records you might need to add. That also includes autoconfig records for tons of software, which is nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Normally, this means that spf.messagingengine.com has its own SPF DNS record, which will probably list some valid IP addresses that emails can be sent from. There&#39;s also one for Mandrill, for transactional emails. You can have as many of these as you want.This isn&#39;t strictly true (that you can have as many as you want), because SPF has a (IMO) very silly hard limit of 10 DNS lookups per record. From RFC 7208:&gt; Some mechanisms and modifiers (collectively, &#34;terms&#34;) cause DNS queries at the time of evaluation, and some do not.  The following terms cause DNS queries: the &#34;include&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;mx&#34;, &#34;ptr&#34;, and &#34;exists&#34; mechanisms, and the &#34;redirect&#34; modifier.  SPF implementations MUST limit the total number of those terms to 10 during SPF evaluation, to avoid unreasonable load on the DNS.  If this limit is exceeded, the implementation MUST return &#34;permerror&#34;.We see this not infrequently at Fastmail, when customers report DMARC validation problems, and the answer turns out to be that they&#39;ve got too many includes in their SPF records, so SPF always fails."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s another angle to the App Store scam: Family Sharing.Most people don&#39;t know this but the &#34;Parent&#34; (read:credit card holder) of a family sharing account can&#39;t see, let alone cancel, any subscriptions a minor on the account has purchased.Let that sink in for a second. Apple will happily charge the parents&#39; credit card a weekly recurring fee but there is nowhere in their interface (on device nor on the web) where the parent can even see that subscription.[0]Apple expects the child to go into their interface and cancel the recurring subscription. Something many (most?) adults find confusing. In my case, the child just deleted the App when the trial was over. Which is of course perfectly logical thinking. No bueno.So if the child is away at school (as in my case), or the phone gets left at a friend&#39;s house, or worse... stolen. The only way to get it cancelled is to call them.There&#39;s more to this story, including details on how the built in parental controls are intentionally crippled (IMHO) but I&#39;ve got to run. In summary: The entire &#34;Family Sharing&#34; system is built to rip off people while still maintaining plausible deniability.[0] A senior Apple rep told me this is for privacy reasons. But two things: the minor should have no expectation of privacy when spending their parents money (how is that a good thing?). And secondly, Apple does email a receipt for the subscription to the card holder... so the privacy excuse was pure bullshit. In my case I missed the email because I have more than 6 or 7 recurring Apple subscriptions. I do take partial blame because of that. But I&#39;ve still not been given a good reason why a parent can&#39;t easily cancel a childs subscription."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The submitter of this story here on HN is the developer of FlickType. He had also filed a lawsuit against Apple for allowing apps that have been outright cheating people with incredibly high in-app purchases and has pointed out several instances of scammy apps.I thought larger companies keep tabs on the &#34;noisy and popular&#34; ones in media (and social media) and would take more care not to annoy them further. But this story makes it seem like Apple has decided to just keep pushing his buttons as some sort of punishment.I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s anyone capable in Apple top leadership who&#39;s spending any time in leading the App Store team appropriately. The scammy apps and the contrasting meaningless rejections of praiseworthy apps only tell one thing – the App Store is an abandoned space run by &#34;bots&#34; with almost no oversight.As an Apple iDevice user for long, this story (from the beginning) as well as others have made me wish for alternate app stores on iDevices enforced through regulation. The wait has been too long already, and Apple isn&#39;t being the steward it imagines itself to be or portrays itself in media to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Right. As I&#39;ve pointed out previously, Tesla seems to be unable to detect sizable stationary obstacles that are partly blocking a lane, especially if they don&#39;t look like the rear end of a car. In addition to emergency vehicles, Teslas on autopilot have plowed into freeway barriers and a street sweeper. That&#39;s the usual situation for first responders, who usually try to block as little of the road as possible but often don&#39;t have enough shoulder space.It&#39;s clear what Tesla really has - a good lane follower and cruise control that slows down for cars ahead. That&#39;s a level 2 system. That&#39;s useful, but, despite all the hype about &#34;full self driving&#34;, it seems that&#39;s all they&#39;ve got.&#34;Full self driving&#34; just adds some lane-changing assistance and hints from the nav system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I believe the approach of incremental improvement towards full self driving is fundamentally flawed. These advanced driver assist tools are good enough to lull users into a false sense of security. No amount of &#34;but our terms and conditions say you need to always pay attention!&#34; will overcome human nature building that trust and dependence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people in here saying it is not possible to drive safely with partial self driving.  I wonder, how many of those people have actually driven a car with autopilot?I have autopilot on my car, and it definitely makes me a better and safer driver.  It maintains my distance from the car in front and my speed while keeping me in my lane, so my brain no longer has to worry about those mundane things.  Instead I can spend all my brainpower focused on looking for potential emergencies, instead of splitting time between lane keeping/following and looking for emergencies.I no longer have to look at my speedometer or the lane markers, I can take a much broader view of the traffic and conditions around me.Before you say it&#39;s impossible to be safe driving with an assistive product, I suggest trying one out."</p>

They acknowledged they did NOT call me at any point that day, that a transaction WAS attempted AFTER I froze the card, and issued a new card.The caller was calm, call-centery, had my full name, credit card number, expiration, 4-digit CVV, and phone number.I also learned that AMEX doesn&#39;t actually cancel the old card... my regularly billed transactions and new online purchases went through just fine with the old card info.  I called AMEX to ask them to unambiguously reject all attempts for all previous card numbers, they acknowledged.  Tried a few days later, the old number still works..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One other thing people may not realize. If you use your credit card at a merchant online or in person and you associate any information such as a telephone number or email with that card. Any time you use that card, online or off, to make a purchase with that merchant those transactions can be tied together regardless of whether you provide your email/phone on future transactions. Large vendors such as walmart etc now associate that phone/email and card(s) with your facial recognition information. The second you walk into the store based on your face they can pull up your entire purchase history and contact. They are now crunching that data to improve retail layouts, marketing pitches, etc and there is growing market of selling aggregates of that data across merchants."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The October before covid me and Mrs. Asciimov went on a cruse with Royal Caribbean.  We got dropped off at the port, put our luggage in the loading area, and proceeded to walk inside, all without talking to anyone.Not 30 seconds after walking into the Port Building, a RCL rep walked up and greeted me and the mrs by first name. Said please walk this way, I have you all checked in, you just need to go through the returning voyagers boarding line. (metal detector/contraband check)To be honest it was both creepy to have them just know who I was, and kinda awesome to get to skip the regular check in step. I asked the lady how she knew who we were, she told us that between the cameras in the port and the photos we submitted during the cruise purchase they knew who we where, and the information pops up on their tablet when they are assigned the next customer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, this is exciting. The performance and latency is a huge variable though.For a lot of these experimental hacker-friendly devices, I&#39;m willing to tolerate a lot of compromises. Even here, the software, the out-of-the-box experience isn&#39;t really that important to me. Arguably, you can get away with even more compromise on a device like this than on something like the Pinephone. But it has to have amazing pen performance, or it&#39;s just not worth working with. Everything else except that is either fixable or something that probably isn&#39;t getting in the way of the core point of the device.IMO Remarkable got this right -- their software support is by many metrics quite bad (although I guess it&#39;s slowly started to improve). Their device handles PDFs kind of poorly from what I can tell. It&#39;s expensive. The interface seems slower and more laggy than many other EReaders. But none of that really matters, what matters is they have arguably the best pen latency and physical texturing on the E-ink market, and that writing on the device feels good.So the same thing applies here: the price seems completely reasonable to me, I have no issues with a $400 price tag. I&#39;d pay $600, the price isn&#39;t the issue. But I need to see videos and testimonial that the pen latency isn&#39;t just &#34;acceptable&#34;, but that it&#39;s really good. Otherwise it&#39;s not even worth $100.Writing experience is one of those things where once you get used to a lack of latency/offset, and used to a more accurate feel, it gets progressively harder and harder to go back to anything that&#39;s worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a direct competitor to the Remarkable[0] which I own, and is a great device. The Remarkable is also &#34;mostly&#34; open. The main binary running the UI of the system is proprietary, but the Linux system underneath is ssh-able, and the hacking community of the device is pretty active and large [1].Looking at the announcement page of the PineNote I&#39;m very excited! I&#39;m hoping the open software running on the PineNote will be comparable to the Remarkable, and if it is I&#39;m definitely going to be making the switch.As a side note, I&#39;m hoping maybe this encourages the Remarkable team to open source their proprietary binary. Their advantage here is definitely the hardware not the software.[0] https://remarkable.com/[1] https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a pretty sweet looking device. Even despite this call out “As for the actual user interface, we’re currently talking to the good folks at KDE and trying to figure out whether Plasma Mobile or regular Plasma (with panel-specific tweaks of course) will be the best fit for this particular device. As you can probably tell, this is an uncharted territory for all parties involved, but we’ll figure it out. Needless to say, the software isn’t finished – indeed, we don’t really even know yet what will work well with this technology and what won’t. It is just the beginning of our journey with e-ink technology, and it will take a long time and much effort to make the PineNote end-user worthy.” This still seems worthwhile to pre order if you’re a heavy reader and note taker.Anyone know how this compares with the remarkable?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two interesting (to me) books on Pixar - one is by the (tech) founder Ed Catmull and is good on the storytelling and hard work side, and a really good &#34;other side of the coin&#34; is by Lawrence Levy who Jobs brought in as &#34;the money guy&#34; to find a way to make Pixar profitable as they tried to land Toy Story - it goes from a little way into the pre-production of the film all the way to the IPO - and it really shines a light on the inner thinking.  No one really had a clue how to monetise things, the IPO was a huge risk etc etc.Fascinating all of it, But for me the big thing to contrast is how Ed Catmull described the IPO (how did Steve plan this, how did he know? I am axed at his business acumen) versus Levy (we were all terrified, movie studios refused to give us their business models, the IPO could have failed at any moment).In short there is always several sides to a story, and if anyone is confident of a future plan but has not done it twenty times before, they are faking it !"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t buy the whole premise about storytelling being the big thing.  In particular I think doing the thing is much much much much much more important than telling the story.  If you do the thing then the story tells itself.I was 1 of a team of 2 or 3 on every pitch in 2 or 3 separate processes to raise over 1bn dollars and make the company I worked for (OakNorth) the most valuable fintech in Europe at the time. We did about 30 investor meetings covering everyone in the PE world, some of the big tech investors, some key VCs, some family offices etc.  We ended up massively oversubscribed so and picked the investors we thought were the best fit. In every single pitch the most important things were:    1. your company should actually do something important/valuable.  Solve an important problem etc.
    2. you should have a plan for a future where the unit economics work, and you should know the plan inside and out
    3. you should have thought through something about how what your company does intersects with *this particular investor&#39;s* interests, and be able to articulate that clearly
    4. You should have clear asks - not just money for valuation but what else you&#39;re looking to get from them (strategic advice, intros, synergies with other companies in their portfolio etc).

The deck, pitch itself etc are much less important than doing something important and actually knowing what you&#39;re talking about. In particular, avoid the thought that you can hack the process with a slick pitch and a cool-looking deck.  It may take you to a first meeting, but it&#39;s not going to get you to close with anyone of substance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That way of boiling down Finding Nemo seems to miss why the story is designed that way. It doesn’t describe anything about what happens to Marlin as a character, just a few basic plot points, and then in the end he somehow learns that “love depends on trust”. Uh, ok.If you actually want to understand why Finding Nemo “consistently tugs at heartstrings worldwide”, Craig Mazin used it as his primary example in “How to write a movie”, episode 403 of Scriptnotes[1]. (TL;DR: the purpose of everything that happens in a movie is to expose the hero to as much agony as possible, so that the change they’re forced to go through feels real. I don’t know what that means for your startup pitch, though.)1: https://johnaugust.com/2019/scriptnotes-ep-403-how-to-write-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In other HN comments on this subject I&#39;ve (hopefully) made it clear that I&#39;m not really in favor of this project of Apple&#39;s, and that there&#39;s a legitimate &#34;slippery slope&#34; argument to be made here. So I hope people will entertain a contrarian question without downvoting me into oblivion. :)Here&#39;s the thing I keep circling around: assume that bad actors, government or otherwise, want to target political dissidents using internet-enabled smartphones. The more we learn about the way Apple actually implemented this technology, the less likely it seems that it would make it radically easier for those bad actors to do so. For instance, the &#34;it only scans photos uploaded to iCloud&#34; element isn&#39;t just an arbitrary limitation that can be flipped with one line of code, as some folks seem to think; as Erik Neuenschwander, head of Privacy Engineering at Apple, explained in an interview on TechCrunch[1]:&gt; Our system involves both an on-device component where the voucher is created, but nothing is learned, and a server-side component, which is where that voucher is sent along with data coming to Apple service and processed across the account to learn if there are collections of illegal CSAM. That means that it is a service feature.Will this stop those bad actors if they&#39;re determined? No, of course not, but there are so many ways they can do it already. They&#39;ll get cloud storage providers to give them access. If they can&#39;t, they&#39;ll get network providers to give them access. And if those bad actors are, as many people fear, government actors, then they have tools far more potent than code: they have laws. It was illegal to export &#34;strong encryption&#34; for many years, remember? I&#39;ve seen multiple reports that European lawmakers are planning to require some kind of scanning for CSAM. If this goes into effect, technology isn&#39;t going to block those laws for you. Your Purism phone will either be forced to comply or be illegal.I wrote in a previous comment on this that one of Silicon Valley&#39;s original sins is that we tend to treat all problems as if they&#39;re engineering problems. Apple is treating CSAM as an engineering problem. Most of the discussion on HN about how horrible and wrong Apple is here still treats it as an engineering problem, though: well, you can get around this by just turning off iCloud Photos or never using Apple software or throwing your iPhone in the nearest lake and switching to Android, but only the right kind of Android, or maybe just never doing anything with computers again, which admittedly will probably be effective.Yet at the end of the day, this isn&#39;t an engineering problem. It&#39;s a policy problem. It&#39;s a governance problem. In the long run, we solve this, at least in liberal democracies, by voting people into office who understand technology, understand the value of personal encryption, and last but certainly not least, understand the value of, well, liberal democracy. I know that&#39;s easy to dismiss as Pollyannaism, but &#34;we need to protect ourselves from our own government&#34; has a pretty dismal track record historically. The entire point of having a liberal democracy is that we are the government, and we can pull it back from authoritarianism.The one thing that Apple is absolutely right about is that expanding what those hashes check for is a policy decision. Maybe where those hashes get checked isn&#39;t really what we need to be arguing about.[1]: https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Apple will publish a Knowledge Base article containing a root hash of the encrypted CSAM hash database included with each version of every Apple operating system that supports the feature. Additionally, users will be able to inspect the root hash of the en- crypted database present on their device, and compare it to the expected root hash in the Knowledge Base article.This is just security theater, they already sign the operating system images where the database reside. And there is no way to audit that the database is what they claim it is, doesn&#39;t contain multiple databases that can be activated under certain conditions, etc.&gt; This feature runs exclusively as part of the cloud storage pipeline for images being up- loaded to iCloud Photos and cannot act on any other image content on the deviceUntil a 1-line code change happens that hooks it into UIImage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t like the idea of stuff running on my device, consuming my battery and data, when the only point is to see if I am doing something wrong?An analogy I can come up with is: the government hires people to visit your house every day, and while they’re there they need your resources (say, food, water, and electricity).  In other words, they use up some of the stuff you would otherwise be able to use only for yourself — constantly — and the only reason they’re there is to see if you’re doing anything wrong.  Why would you put up with this?"</p>

Though old coding exam questions would equally offer up some great material to push this thru it&#39;s paces."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is a link to the arXiv version of the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00010Incidentally, I used to work in dynamics and Hagai is great to work with.  To give you a sense of him, I went to a conference on dynamics that he organized about six years ago, and he opened it with the following story:Many years ago, the philosopher Nasreddin was on his farm looking out into the distance and saw some people approaching.  He had heard that there were bandits in the area and became afraid that they would come, beat him, and steal all his things.  So Nasreddin ran away.  As he ran, he came to a graveyard, and there he found an open grave.  In case the bandits followed him, he decided to take off all his clothes, get in the grave, and pretend to be dead.It turned out that the men were not bandits, but were Nasreddin&#39;s friends.  They saw him run off and wondered where he was going and so followed him.  As they were walking through the graveyard, they came upon the open grave and saw Nasreddin lying there naked.  So they asked him, &#34;Nasreddin, why are you lying in this grave with all your clothes off?&#34;Nasreddin opened his eyes and saw it was his friends, and replied, &#34;My friends, there are some questions which have no answers.  All I can tell you is that I am here because of you, and you are here because of me.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"T-Mobile has had recurring data security deficiencies. I know because I served as CTO of the FCC&#39;s Enforcement Bureau, before returning to academia.In 2017, the FCC determined that T-Mobile had violated federal law in a data breach involving customer credit information [1]. There was reportedly no fine because Congress has imposed a strict one-year statute of limitations on FCC enforcement actions.In 2020, the FCC charged T-Mobile with again violating federal law in failing to protect customer location information [2]. The FCC proposed a $91.6M fine, widely criticized as insufficient at the time [3-4]. I don&#39;t believe the FCC has finalized or collected that penalty.There have been several other incidents, including in 2018 [5], 2019 [6], early 2020 [7], and late 2020 [8].I hope there has not been a new data breach. But if there has been, this is the latest in a pattern, and the incentives have to change.[1] https://www.nexttv.com/news/fcc-admonishes-t-mobile-breach-1...[2] https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-916m-fine-against-...[3] https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-27A4.pdf[4] https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-27A5.pdf[5] https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-dat...[6] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-disc...[7] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-data...[8] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-data..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like companies like this should have to register a data breach like this in a national register, and then should someone become a victim of identity theft, the companies on that register associated with that person should bear the costs associated with that theft (importantly without the victim having to show that it was a direct result of that breach). E.g. John Smith ss#123-45-6789 (T-mobile, Experian) has a false refund filed in his name, $10k in legal costs associated with clearing his name, t-mobile and experian each owe him $5k…Until companies are held accountable for the negative externalities they are causing, this won’t end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of weeks ago I was receiving someone else&#39;s T-Systems internet contract and personal data via email. The customer was from Munich. I live in The Netherlands. I was more than 10 years ago customer of T-Mobile Austria.I immediately informed T-Systrms via their crappy contact form on their crappy website. After a couple of days I received an e-mail which I could not reply to, asking me to provide more proof that I was receiving someone else&#39;s emails through. It also said I can&#39;t reply directly to the email and I had to provide this info via their crappy contact form on their crappy website.I refused to do so, since I had already given them the name, address, and customer id of their new customer and it seemed that the procedure is going to be unnecesarily time consuming.After that I received emails about tracking of a package containing the hardware for the internet connection. Then I received an email that nobody was home to pick up the delivery and when the next attempt will be. UAnd utimately that the package was going to ve returned. After that I guess the customer got in touch with T-Systems and fixed the email error.Nobody from T-Systems contacted me asking to destroy the documents and emails containing someone else&#39;s personal data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish that instead of buying more IPv4 blocks, AWS would drastically lower the price of NAT gateways, then charge extra for EC2 instances and Fargate tasks with public IPs, to make it a no-brainer to stop wasting public IPs. As it stands, it&#39;s cheaper to waste public IPs than to use NAT gateways.Addendum: I also wish I could volunteer to be switched over to CGNAT for my personal IPv4 traffic. This discussion got me thinking about what it would take to get my company&#39;s IPv4 footprint down to zero. Might as well do that for myself as well if I could."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my journey to learn Rust I sought for a person criticize my Rust skills, so I searched for a &#39;good first issue&#39; in GitHub, by writing a PR in Rust I could fullfil two dreams of mine
1. Learn Rust.
2. Having a code that I wrote run on large amount of devices across the world.Eventually I ended up on MeiliSearch repo, I fixed an interesting bug, and I must say that the maintainers were super nice across all the process, a couple of months after my contribution they sent hand written letters and a bunch of stickers to all of the project contributors, one of the nicest interactions I ever had on the internet (ironically the first PR that I wrote that got accepted involved one line of CSS, which is field I&#39;m proficient at)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m using it in production for https://opencoaster.com (very wip site). It’s fast.Their team is fairly responsive to bugs but I had one negative experience when trying to help them fix their instantsearch lib. They were grabbing as many pages as you had set for max pages at once and would re query it on pagination - huge waste of data transfer. They refused to see the problem so I just did a private fork just to get it working but far as I know that’s still a bug.I need to upgrade the engine itself but looks like they added the ability to upgrade and not lose all the data. That was frustrating but understandable.Overall I’m very impressed how stable it is"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As seen previously on another post about MeiliSearch after reading an extensive comparison in [0], I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m not convinced with it yet as it is extremely limited and immature.The only argument here that is being made here is that it is &#39;written in Rust&#39;.Just use something production ready like Typesense.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The older and more experience I get the more I find myself turning into a complexity zealot, to a really extremist extent. Every time I see something introduced at any level that isn&#39;t 100% strictly necessary to the problem being solved it triggers a kind of accumulated PTSD is almost physically painful.I know everyone thinks they like simplicity but my observation is that about 95% of software developers have a complexity fetish. Literally any opportunity they get to introduce something over and above what is essential to the job they are doing they will do it. For many its almost built in as a part of their value system (if all I do is solve the basic problem then I&#39;m just a mediocre mundane developer right? I want to be a rock star who develops frameworks and invents new things that other people use).  And yet the epitome of genius in my mind is finding the solution that solves the problem without introducing anything at all.Again, I know 80% of the people reading my comments right here will nod their heads and identify with it and yet still go away and see themselves as exceptions to the rule and create another abstract class or define an optional configuration file or make their code automatically parse an extra environment variable with a regular expression or .... you get it....We had to add something to the database the other day. Big argument. Should be one to many? many to many? what if this or that happens? what if requirements change? You know what - for the requirement wa actually had it was solvable with a single integer field on an existing table. But this is a battle that has to be fought ... over and over and over ..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is one more level where you hate everything, but then embrace loving the people that make shit.I bought a new truck, and after putting 100 miles on it the transmission started acting strange. I take it in, and they don&#39;t know what is wrong with it. So, they are going to replace the entire transmission next week.Now, I could say &#34;oh, why did I buy that brand&#34; or be like &#34;lolz, these people are n00bs&#34;. Instead, I realize that they are making something at a massive scale and bad things will happen, so I&#39;ll accept the inconvenience and move on with my life. Shit happens, and that&#39;s life.I&#39;ve hated software for a long time because I value precision and reliability, but these are exceptionally hard to scale organizationally. Suppose you fix reliability today, well tomorrow&#39;s feature could just fuck it up.Now, I still hate software, but I come at with a mindset that software is an artifact of a culture which requires nurturing and love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It goes both ways. I certainly hate un-needed complexity but somethings are just complex. Good examples are font rendering https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/ and text input https://lord.io/text-editing-hates-you-too/  You think it&#39;s going to be easy. It&#39;s not. It just isn&#39;t.Often software is too simple. I just recently got my first &#34;Smart Lights&#34; (my mistake). I&#39;m using Apple Home to control them. I put 3 bulbs in a 3 bulb standing lamp. Home has no way to for me to designate those as a single lamp. To Home they are 3 lamps. The solution is supposed to be use normal bulbs and a smart switch. But that precludes being able to set the colors of the bulbs. In other words, they thought it was simple but it&#39;s not.It gets worse. At first I thought this would be cool, but now I realize if I have a house guest, they won&#39;t be able to turn on the lights if I left them off. Arguably, if the power is cut and comes back on, maybe the lights should default to full white? At least then, in an emergency they just work. But again, designing lights that do that would be more complexity, not less.I can even add another wrinkle. My Siri is set to Japanese. So, my English speaking house guests will not be able to ask for the lights to be turned on if I had a HomePod, which I don&#39;t. More complexity because the world is complex"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The silver lining of using this complicated DCP interface is that DCP does in fact run a huge amount of code – the DCP firmware is over 7MB! It implements complicated algorithms like DisplayPort link training, real-time memory bandwidth calculations, handling the DisplayPort to HDMI converter in the Mac mini, enumerating valid video modes and performing mode switching, and more. It would be a huge ordeal to reverse engineer all of this and implement it as a raw hardware driver, so it is quite likely that, in the end, we will save time by using this higher-level interface and leaving all the dirty work to the DCP. In particular, it is likely that newer Apple Silicon chips will use a shared DCP codebase and the same interface for any given macOS version, which gives us support for newer chips “for free”, with only comparatively minor DCP firmware ABI updates.How interesting: by moving some of the driver to firmware, Apple has effectively made it easier for OSs like Linux to have good support for the hardware, because the OS&lt;-&gt;hardware protocol operates at a higher level of abstraction and may work across multiple chips.The trade-off is that the protocol is not stable and so Linux has to decide which versions it will support, and make sure the OS driver always matches the version of the hardware firmware:&gt; As a further twist, the DCP interface is not stable and changes every macOS version! [...] Don’t fret: this doesn’t mean you won’t be able to upgrade macOS. This firmware is per-OS, not per-system, and thus Linux can use a different firmware bundle from any sibling macOS installations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since there are clearly a lot of people who have been following the asahi development in detail, I would like to hear your takes on this quote from their FAQ:&gt; No, Apple still controls the boot process and, for example, the firmware that runs on the Secure Enclave Processor. However, no modern device is “fully open” - no usable computer exists today with completely open software and hardware (as much as some companies want to market themselves as such).I think they&#39;re aiming at purism here, but might have forgotten about the MNT Reform, even though it is currently specced at the lower end of &#34;usable&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Now we know that it’s possible to make really good transistors with impure chemicals, no cleanroom, and homemade equipment.The good news here is that 2 of those 3 issues are pretty easily solvable.  With some work, and a ton of HEPA air purifier machines, you could probably turn an area the size of a small shed or 1 car garage into a class 10000 cleanrom pretty easily.  It would be simplest if this area were embedded in a larger area, like a 2 car garage, but, you could probably squeeze it into just a plain old 1 car garage.Chemicals, you can buy online from scientific supply houses.  Some, like acetone, you can buy from less specialized sources in high purity.  Water and alcohol, you can either buy at high purity pretty easily, or buy lower grade stuff and purify it.Of course, at the point where you&#39;re going for higher purity stuff like this, you might want to switch from acetone as a solvent to DMSO.  DMSO itself is safe to handle and doesn&#39;t evaporate like acetone will.&gt; SilaneYeah, nasty stuff.  Toxic as hell, ignites spontaneously when exposed to air.  I used to work near a rather large storage tank that contained the stuff.  Needless to say, I am glad there never was an accident. :-)  Very wise to avoid this stuff.---https://www.americancleanrooms.com/class-10000-clean-room/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxidehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silane"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve taken a news literacy class at Stony Brook about 10 years ago, when it was then a relatively new program.  I think it&#39;s an incredibly valuable thing.It was taught in more the general sense of how to apply critical thinking to judge news stories. To the people saying that this just instills propaganda about specific news sources: consider learning a little bit more about the class.It teaches about how to tell journalism apart from other kinds of information, like entertainment and opinion; the hallmarks of good reporting, like transparency; discerning assertion from verification, and evidence from inference; the idea of seeking out multiple sources and how to reconcile them, etc.  It&#39;s more a toolbox of how to inform oneself, regardless of any specific source.It definitely included examples of bad reporting from all sorts of sources, because the message is that its ideas are applicable to any source of information.Ideas: https://www.centerfornewsliteracy.org/what-is-news-literacy/Class: https://www.centerfornewsliteracy.org/stony-brooks-center-fo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO the most effective and most widely deployed (especially among the supposedly more reputable publications) propaganda tool isn’t outright lies, but rather, selective reporting of cherry-picked facts and omission of others to shape stories into their predefined narratives. TFA doesn’t address that at all. It seems to me that students’ main takeaway from this course would be to trust NPR, NYT and the like, rather than viral content. Which is of course great for NPR, but doesn’t help when your “trustworthy” media selection decide to suppress all arguments from another side, or remain silent on certain stories altogether.Note: This comment was expanded a few times, but the gist remained the same.Edit: No, I’m not saying “trust NPR, NYT and the like instead of viral content you see on Facebook” isn’t a good takeaway. I’m saying the more effective type of propaganda (at least for people who don’t tend to fall for the obvious crap) isn’t discussed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given the primary example used on the kids, the 2016 election, this seems more about instilling bias under the name &#34;news literacy&#34;.  Are they going to do a section studying the &#34;coverage&#34; of hunter biden&#39;s laptop?  Remember, for weeks it was cast as Russian propaganda.  What about the origins of covid.. will they discuss how at first the lab leak theory was discarded as &#34;misinformation&#34;?  I could not trust a public school to ever touch such topics.This is as comforting as hearing that schools are teaching religion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I investigated egui early this year. It&#39;s a very good library! For me, getting used to immediate mode UI was a change from being used to DOM / React-style UI. imgui works well for a lot but it struggles with complex layouts, eg flexbox. This is acknowledged in egui&#39;s READMECouple things I built with egui:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use this in a few of my projects. Simple, no complaints. Compile time is faster than it takes for me to yawn most of the time (using mold linker and sccache, which improves compile time a lot with a far superior linker and caching compiled dependencies, respectively).(Edit to add: below complaint is entirely within rust and irrelevant to this library)Only problem (not the fault of egui) is sometimes the elements disallow me using the templateapp object mutably as a whole: sometimes I have to mut borrow a part of `self` before the ui part (instead of mutating `self.whatever` within the UI element, I have to do `let borrow = self.whatever.borrow_mut()` before the UI element then call that borrow) which seemed odd to me as a beginner. I think this is mostly a rust &#34;problem&#34; but also maybe because of how UI element creation was designed.If you understand the borrow rules then you&#39;ll probably understand it fine. I might be able to just lock an Arc Mutex instead and avoid the problem but I just learned how to use them so :p"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most HN posts always compare with FAANG jobs and salaries, while there is a whole different world out there.For instance, in Europe and especially low-paid countries in the south or eastern Europe, i foresee zero chance that top talent will stay in their countries to be given low salaries for jobs with local/low impact. These people are already working or looking to work remotely to companies in richer countries (e.g. UK, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland) and are already profiting for this. I personally switched to a remote-only job and got the biggest raise of my career, with a salary that no local company can match unless we are talking C-level manager position."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What bothers me more is that these tech companies aren’t even trying to have a conversation with their employees. If they did a survey and collected opinions from their employees the decision would be pretty trivial. But the managerial gang knows that and they want to side step it.The companies want to pretend they care about the employees. They claim to be giving them perks. In reality, these perks are just gamification to make the employee spend more time in the office.The managerial gang gamified CS careers with silly interviews and performance reviews. They gamified apps and information dispersal. Entire democracies were at stake and nothing changed.WFH won’t ever happen. These managers have to maintain appearances, name drop names and pretend to be “in the know”. Every engineer knows that 90% of these people are like language models regurgitating what they’ve heard. They can’t do that effectively via video.To me this is the most blatant admission of their inability to measure developer productivity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve only just skimmed through this. And it&#39;s a subject I already know so I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s actually a good resource. However, my initial impression is that I love it.I think that textbooks, math textbooks in particular, are an example where print publishing does a disservice. (I&#39;m counting PDFs here too.) By having to lay everything out in print form, you have to clutter up your explanations with examples and footnotes that take up physical room. Here, the examples are toggle-able. If I _want_ to explore an example, I can. But I don&#39;t need to. This kind of thing is especially helpful when reviewing content for, say, a test rather than learning it for the first time.Also finding things in textbooks is a real pain. It&#39;s difficult to index things in a helpful way, so you just have these counting schemes in LaTeX that increment for every definition, theorem, etc. I&#39;d love to be able to tag things then search the tags.And that says nothing for when you want to explain something that&#39;s difficult with static images. Being able to interact with animations by zooming, panning, pausing, slowing down, speeding up, etc. is a boon. (I don&#39;t think I actually saw an example of a non-static image here, but I think my point still stands.)All in all, I&#39;d love to see more interactive textbooks. We&#39;ve got this really expressive kind of document via the web. I think we should be taking advantage of it more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote an entry on Wikipedia on visualizing the QR algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_algorithmThe visualization helped me spot an unstable fixed point and understand the behaviour of the algorithm near eigenvalue clashes. The behaviour&#39;s quite sophisticated.I think I wrote this there, but here goes again. The idea is that a positive-definite symmetric matrix can be visualized as an ellipse. This follows from the spectral theorem. Each iteration of the QR algorithm causes the ellipse to fall towards the x-axis, as if under the influence of gravity. The unstable fixed point corresponds to when the ellipse is standing up precariously, unable to fall in either direction. If you tilt it by just a bit, it will fall over (so the fixed point is unstable).The case when the ellipse is nearly circular (corresponding to near eigenvalue clashes) causes the ellipse to fall over slowly. I think this also makes physical sense, if you think of it being under the influence of gravity. If you think of this near-circle as being a matrix, then this matrix is nearly equal to a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, so its eigenvalues are essentially known. The fact that the ellipse falls very slowly implies that the eigenvectors are unstable near eigenvalue clashes, but the eigenvalues are easy to find.Note: The issues surrounding the unstable fixed point can be fixed using Wilkinson shifts. This makes each iteration into a discontinuous function, allowing all the fixed points to be stable. The issue surrounding instability of the eigenvectors near eigenvalue clashes cannot be fixed, as it&#39;s intrinsic to  eigendecomposition (even of symmetric matrices). The latter difficulties can be dodged by slightly perturbing the matrix, but the resulting eigenvectors can be very different from the eigenvectors of the unperturbed matrix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was achieved also by ignoring open issues and simply closing the bug even though the issue still exists. An example of this is:https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=21526In general, I find too much emphasis is now on &#34;closing&#34; an issue as soon as possible. I understand that open issues can be a burden for maintainers. However, filing issues, especially making them reproducible, can also be a burden to users, and users will stop filing issues if too many of them are closed unilaterally without actually correcting the root cause.As I remember it, the Emacs maintainers used to put a lot more emphasis on actually correcting issues instead of only closing them, and this may also be the reason why fewer issues are reported now.A great attraction of Emacs is how easily one can actually report issues, using Emacs itself: M-x report-emacs-bug RET."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you work for a corporation and feel overwhelmed try what the emacs people did, example for email: 1) select everything in your inbox, 2) mark as read, 3) archive. For bugs it would be unassign everything from yourself, or just close them without fixing.I&#39;ve done this several times and it&#39;s magical how you end up losing almost nothing important in the end. I think it works because if something is important enough you&#39;ll either remember it yourself or it will be communicated to you again, perhaps even via a &#34;higher priority channel&#34; such as the management chain.And if you think I&#39;m being extreme then yes, maybe, but maybe you haven&#39;t yet drowned in the never ending stream of problems for a long time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most fascinating thing to me about this blog post is that here we have a guy in his fifties who got insanely rich by working very hard (no doubt) and then selling a major stock broker platform (it is briefly mentioned as &#34;in banking&#34;) - and what does he choose to do now with spare time and more money than anyone could use? He is maintaining Emacs. For fun. This is why open source will grow. It feels meaningful to contribute. He could sail, travel, invest, buy expensive stuff, etc. But Emacs hacking it is.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m sure others who&#39;ve spent more time in Costa Rica can provide more color, but I found it a very interesting place. There&#39;s generally an &#34;enlightened&#34; government in place with relatively low corruption.The government has prioritized important things like clean drinking water, food safety standards, power, and internet (sometimes at the tradeoff of roads). There&#39;s a national emphasis on preserving the natural ecology of the country, and there&#39;s no military. The budget for which goes into social programs, education, and health care.You can go from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean in a few hours, which is great. But be warned the coastal areas are both incredibly hot and humid. Fortunately, much of the country is at altitude and not nearly as hot thanks to numerous volcanoes which also feature a hot springs culture in certain areas. Because of the rain forests there&#39;s an impossible number of flora and fauna (and of course rain). All of this combines to make the country quite beautiful with some of the freshest tropical fruits you&#39;ll ever eat.The population is generally well educated, Intel used to have a chip fab there for a time and HP, Dell, Bayer, Bosch, IBM and more operate there. It&#39;s a heavily services oriented economy. Housing is affordable and the people are generally friendly enough. Food can be relatively basic, but is very filling and generally cheap.It&#39;s also fair to point out the downsides. Transportation around can be...rugged and the cities can be bogged down with traffic. The Capital city, San José...I didn&#39;t care much for...at least near the city center. It&#39;s also a very small country with a very small population (~4 million). This can be constraining for some outsiders.Overall though, I found it a fascinating and beautiful country and really did enjoy my time there. I would definitely go back given the chance. I also had a friend who lived there for several years and ran an consulting business to companies in the U.S. The timezone turned out to be rather advantageous and he was able to easy support U.S. East and West coast companies.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"</p>

They have a particular current interest in digital markets, and are forming a new unit specifically to deal with tech antitrust issues (the digital markets unit)While the CMA public consultation on the Apple/Google mobile platforms work has closed, their investigation team can be contacted via the email inbox listed at [1]. When engaging with regulators like this (for anyone not familiar), it is helpful if you explain why a particular move has harmed you, and can give examples or any available evidence about it, and explain the impact that it has had on you, and the impact on the wider ecosystem as a result.I&#39;m sure other regulators are looking into this, but for those who are unhappy about this situation, I&#39;d urge you to contact a regulator. If your own national regulator isn&#39;t looking into it, there&#39;s no reason not to contact the UK one (or indeed any other), and explain your concerns and help them with finding evidence - often for policy and enforcement teams, getting evidence together is the hard part of their job, and I can say from experience they do read their emails.[1] https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-ecosystems-market-study[2] https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-gi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the problem Apple ran into was that there was no confusion at all. Apple announced they were going to scan users&#39; devices after years of marketing themselves as a &#34;privacy-focused&#34; company. Shockingly, customers were pretty mad about the whole thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of those failure apologies, that&#39;s just making us dislike them even more.I have no idea why they haven&#39;t done a 180 yet, this is a bigger failure than the butterfly keyboard. They are letting themselves become the symbol of technological dystopia in the public consciousness. Even an acquaintance who does construction was venting to me about how bad apple&#39;s policy is and why she is getting a pixel.After entirely removing that feature and making a commitment to fight against that kind of future I feel like they owe two more apologies to get on my good side - one for screwing up this bad in the first place and one for insulting my intelligence with their handling of the outcry. This isn&#39;t 1990, you don&#39;t handwave a mistake this big."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the &#34;confusion&#34; was 100% intentional. That the two features (iMessage scanning &amp; on-device spying pre-upload to iCloud) were intentionally released at the same time to make the whole thing harder to criticize in a soundbite.Confusion is the best-case scenario for Apple because people will tune it out. If they had released just the on-device spying, public outcry and backlash would have been laser targeted on a single issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the tone of this, it’s like the musings of an explorer who discovered a jungle city abandoned by a mysterious civilization.“there were old wall slogans inside that must have been added to motivate and inspire the employees” … “ the tall building had several brick structures on the lower main level. He suspected that those structures probably had plants and ferns in them so that important business clients and employees would be met with a pleasing sight upon entering.” … “Martin Gonzalez also noticed pictures of people using Motorola products that had been left on the walls of the building.”Indeed, the ways of the people of the Motorola civilization of around 2011CE are mysterious and strange to us. Perhaps the central atrium served some kind of ritual purpose? Were prisoners perhaps thrown off the upper balconies as a sacrifice to their gods? We will never really know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for the expression but &#34;holy shit!&#34;.I worked in Motorola for 10 years from the late 90&#39;s. I was based in Europe but travelled to Schaumburg every two months or so (or to Phoenix).It is really a shock to see this place abandoned - last time I was there (15 years ago) it was very much alive.It has been a long time since I had such a nostalgic squeeze of heart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing that neither the article nor any of the comments so far mention that Google bought part of Motorola, for its 10,000 patents. Then sold it a few years later.I was in Google Patents and I interviewed people for the position of &#34;acquirer of patents.&#34; This was a period when they actually thought the &#34;throw weight&#34; of your patent portfolio really mattered in cross-licensing deals. Most of those patents were utterly worthless in any sort of deal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m fine with this change for my usage, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve used password auth for myself or any automated service I&#39;ve setup for years now. However, this will introduce more confusion for newcomers who already have to figure out what Git, GitHub, etc are. I just spent some time last weeekend teaching someone the basics of how to create a new project. Such a simple idea required introducing the terminal, basic terminal commands, GitHub, git and its most common commands. It took about 3 hours for us to get through just the most basic pieces. Adding on ssh-keygen, key management adds even more friction.It&#39;s certainly a difficult problem. How can we offer a more gentle learning curve for budding developers while still requiring &#34;real&#34; projects to use best practices for security and development?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok I&#39;ll admit it. I&#39;m the dingus who is still using https and login/password. It&#39;s how I learned to use it years ago and since I only ever access GitHub via cli it&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever learned. I don&#39;t program anything complex and I&#39;ve never put anything secure up on GitHub (it&#39;s public, after all, so i had the expectation that all info on there is insecure). I don&#39;t understand why this is being deprecated when it&#39;s the default suggestion GitHub provides you when you add a new repo to your profile so that you can connect your local git repo to it. For hosting my trivial personal projects it seems so silly to have to go onto github&#39;s web interface and click through a bunch of their ui to build a personal passkey(which is just a password with a different name afaict).  Am I just not the intended audience for the change or am I missing something crucial that doesn&#39;t make this seem like a bunch of extra effort for no meaningful change?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclosure: I&#39;m the Git Systems PM at GitHub. Opinions are my own and I wasn&#39;t directly involved with this effort.GCM Core is a really straightforward way to auth with GitHub and several other Git hosts. It comes with Git for Windows by default, can be installed with `brew` on macOS, and from a .deb on Linux. https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core (it started under the Microsoft banner but is maintained by GitHub employees now)."</p>

All the best."</p>

For developers the learning process happens when you start coding not by watching videos. But most of the platforms like Udemy they only support text and video materials.

I went ahead and signed up as an author and have had a couple of issues so far:1. The first time I clicked the magic link in the login flow took me to another login prompt. I re-entered my email but got a warning that I was requesting another link too soon. I went back and clicked the link again and was logged in right away.2. Once logged in I see an empty page at https://app.slip.so/author - there is the side nav, but nothing in the main well.3. I did notice a couple of console warnings around cookie attributes:
Cookie “__tld__” will be soon rejected because it has the “SameSite” attribute set to “None” or an invalid value, without the “secure” attribute. To know more about the “SameSite“ attribute, read https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cook...I was also wondering for the SQL course if it would be feasible to stand up an in-browser sqlite database via sql.js and/or make an API call out to a service to stand up a database for student use.Congrats on the launch and keep me post if this could be a viable course for your platform!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might seems like a simple feel-good story for some, but it&#39;s more than that. I didn&#39;t imagine how much children learn and cope through toys until I had my own kids.Example 1: when my daughter was 2 she got a fishbone stuck in her mouth. I gave her lots of bread and water so that something would force the small bone to go down. After 5 minutes the issue was resolved and she immediately jumped to her teddy bear and started playing &#34;you have a bone teddy, you need bread, take this, take that&#34;. The first plays were urgent and quite serious and the teddy was always &#34;cured&#34; quickly. But later through the following days as she played the same idea she started to improvise. Teddy, in her hands, would cough and cough - I would offer him things for 10 minutes and more and nothing would help him. And she would laugh at this. After these plays fish bones in her mind were no longer serious.Example 2: when she was 3 we tried to adapt her to a kindergarten. After the first day when she was home she picked up her toy cars and started playing. Some of the cars were teachers, others were children, one was me, another one was her, and one small car was a smaller child that cried all the time. And we played the routine where I came to the kindergarten with her, stayed for a bit, and then went to work. At the moment the &#34;dad&#34; car went to work she would physically tense up and become silent, as if it was really happening. But those moments became easier once she learned more details about what to expect during the typical day in the kindergarten and that later the &#34;dad&#34; car always comes back to take her home. Seems like this experience was helpful as, despite being somewhat shy, she never cried during her adaptation period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of stuff is super helpful.My dad was a surgeon who treated kids with scoliosis. He also happened to make teddy bears as a hobby. So he made a teddy bear with an artificial spine in it that he put scoliosis hardware on.When he was meeting with a kid for a pre-op consult, he would let the kid hug the teddy bear, and then he would show them the teddy bear&#39;s X-Ray. It really helped them understand what was going to happen to them, and put them at ease."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This dad is carrying on a fantastic, but not at all new tradition. I had surgery in the early 1970&#39;s when I was three, and I&#39;ve still got the old teddy bear up in a box in the attic that the staff at the hospital made for me that &#34;needed the same surgery&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really want to like Snopes, but I&#39;m not convinced that they weigh evidence correctly. For example, they debunked the myth that Marilyn Monroe had 6 toes. First, I don&#39;t believe that she did. Or even care, for that matter. But at the time, one of their &#34;facts&#34; was that if she&#39;d had a toe removed, she&#39;d basically have to learn to walk all over again because it would throw her balance completely off. (Note: the article no longer includes this fact. It did at one time, though.)However, my wife&#39;s a podiatrist. Part of her job is amputating parts of feet when they&#39;re damaged or infected beyond repair. I asked her what it&#39;s like for an otherwise healthy adult to recover from a pinky toe amputation, and she said it&#39;s basically a matter of waiting for the wound site to heal and then they continue with life as normal. Contrary to popular belief, even a big toe amputation isn&#39;t that disruptive. A vestigial 6th toe hanging off to the side? You&#39;d never notice it was gone.I emailed Snopes and said hey, while I agree with your conclusion, this particular supporting fact is invalid according to an expert in the field. They replied basically that I was an idiot for believing she had 6 toes, and they left the article as-is.That&#39;s not at all what I thought, and I actually agreed with their conclusion. I just didn&#39;t like that they were using incorrect facts to support it, and especially didn&#39;t like that they reacted poorly to a well-meant correction.Since then, I&#39;ve been skeptical of Snopes. Although I think they&#39;re probably right most of the time, that left a bad taste in my mouth. Are other people sending them corrections about their own fields of expertise and having them rejected? I have no way of knowing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All modern media companies today have been built by using these kinds of shady &#34;growth hacks.&#34;Doesn&#39;t anybody see the irony of Buzzfeed calling out a fellow media company for using such tactics?Buzzfeed&#39;s entire growth strategy for years was copy-pasting content from trending reddit threads and turning them into &#34;listicles&#34; with clickbait headlines, then feeding them into Facebook.Was that not also plagiarism?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Netflix, like countless other online services, is not built for global citizens - people that work in different countries to their own.I am a British born expat, living in Qatar, so of course I want to watch the UK orientated Netflix programming and not the Arabic or Hindi. I have a UK TV license but of course, I can&#39;t watch UK TV from Qatar. Trying to pay for things online is frequently a nightmare as many companies won&#39;t take payment from a UK card unless it&#39;s from a UK IP. Same trying to pay tax on my US houses, also some websites don&#39;t even let you connect to them unless you use a US IP address! Google rightly defaults to Arabic if you&#39;re not logged in, that&#39;s fine, but even they don&#39;t provide a simple way to change the language to English! Similar with Spotify, same with Apple music. Whatsapp voice calls are blocked in Qatar.All of these problems and many more are bypassed with a good VPN. It amazes me how few services ever take into consideration that people don&#39;t always live and work in their country of origin. If VPN&#39;s are clamped down on it&#39;s going to make life difficult for tens of millions of people. VPN&#39;s are actually VITAL in many situations."</p>

A &#34;great firewall&#34; if you willThey&#39;d set up home-made VPN&#39;s using Raspberry Pi&#39;s etc for family to tunnel into and watch Netflix on typicallyNetflix however even in 2017 was smart and their algorithm would see these thousands of people logging in while everyone else in Seattle was typically asleep and eventually ban the entire ISP&#39;s IP range. Logging in would give a &#34;please turn off your proxy/VPN&#34; error messageEvery time this happened the ISP&#39;s phone tree would explode, going from mere seconds to literal 6-10 hour queue times. The NOC was entirely upskilled CS agents who had no idea how to contact Netflix&#39;s relevant teams to get the IP ban removed, instead they&#39;d simply tell CS to have customers wait until the IP ban expired (usually a few days)This would happen almost every other month"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disney+ had inexplicably blocked my IP address for &#34;being a VPN&#34; for close to year, despite me never running a VPN from my home network. Though the block didn&#39;t stop me from watching their content, it just stopped me from paying for, which I was more than willing to do and spent far to long dealing with their support to try to make it happen.If the same thing happens with Netflix, it also won&#39;t keep me from watching Netflix content, I&#39;ll just stop paying for it. Other than the aforementioned Disney+ content, I rarely pirate anything these days and I&#39;d rather not if I can help it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article glosses over the biggest deal in the bill.Section 3 subsection d - INTEROPERABILITYA Covered Company that controls the operating system or operating system configuration on which its App Store operates shall allow and provide the readily accessible means for users of that operating system to—(1) choose third-party Apps or App Stores as defaults for categories appropriate to the App or App Store;(2) install third-party Apps or App Stores through means other than its App Store; and(3) hide or delete Apps or App Stores provided or preinstalled by the App Store owner or any of its business partnersLet&#39;s see how far this goes before it gets mangled all to hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this idea - I paid a grand for this thing, I should be able to run whatever I like on it.However, this does make it significantly more difficult for Apple to dictate terms to every random app that your network of friends and colleagues makes you download, and makes it more likely that those apps will be a regression in terms of actual consumer experience.Regulation of access to  your camera roll and contact list is a terrible idea, so I don’t see a solution.Apple is the only thing stopping WhatsApp (let’s face it, an essential app in 2021) from demanding your location at all times. We don’t notice this on the web, because Mozilla and Google (!) enforce terms for us (and most desktops don’t have GPS receivers).Take out the gatekeeper on mobile and we might find that the benevolent dictatorship wasn’t so bad after all.Edit: want to add that replacing Apple’s consumer protection gatekeeper role with a government agency is a non starter. Apple (and to give them credit, Google) know that the data available to the gatekeeper role is toxic and dangerous. Government thinks it’s a big bowl of lollies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is mostly good, but it forces Apple/Google to hand over your email address (or other means of communication) to anyone you download an app from so they can spam you.The bill says they don’t have to allow spam, but specially allows “legitimate business offers, such as pricing terms and product or service offerings”… which is spam unless one explicitly opts-in to it.I don’t appreciate the double-talk. This part of the bill is user hostile and should be deleted."</p>

Actually nothing happened."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This CSAM Prevention initiative by Apple is a 180 degress change of their general message around privacy. Imagine investing hundreds of millions of dollars in pro-privacy programs, privacy features, privacy marketing, etc... just to pull this reverse card.Of course this is going to spark concern within their own ranks. It&#39;s like working for a food company that claims to use organic, non-processed, fair-trade ingredients and in just a day deciding that you&#39;re going to switch to industrial farming sourcing and ultra-processed ingredients.It&#39;s a complete change of narrative and there&#39;s no easy way to explain it and still defend Apple&#39;s Privacy narrative, wihout doing extreme mental gymnastics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just do not want Apple scanning my phone for the purpose of finding something they can send to the police.I’m not even talking about any “slippery slope” scenarios and I’ll never have any of the material they are looking for. And right or wrong, I don’t really fear a false identification, so this isn’t about a worry that they will actually turn me in. I just don’t want them scanning my phone for the purpose of turning me in. I definitely do not want to take an OS update or new phone that does this.(False positives are the huge flaw in this system, though. There are human judgements by anonymous people using opaque processes without appeal throughout this. A lot of damage can be done before anything goes to court, not to mention courts themselves are susceptible to the illusion of infallible technology. Others have well laid out the scenarios that will result in serious consequences for innocent people.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is funny and sad to me. We had SQLite in the browser[0]. I only did a little bit of work with it but it seemed actually pretty nice.It was torpedoed because it was SQL-based (and not trendy &#34;key value&#34; and &#34;web scale&#34;).There was the whole excuse that the specification was &#34;whatever SQLite does&#34; and, therefore, not suitable for being a standard. There would be worse things than SQLite upon which to base a standard, all things considered. I still believe it was torpedoed because of lack of trendiness and &#34;not invented here&#34;.[0] https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"James is one of the world&#39;s great techno-adventurers, &amp; getting to para-socially share in wild adventures like this makes living on Spaceship Earth more lovely &amp; lively! James has also done cool projects like sweet.js macros, helped kick off Firefox devtool&#39;s transition to react (iirc), oh and lead the basically industry standard JS formatter Priettier project. I&#39;m forgetting a dozen other things over the years but it&#39;s always been fun.Just a heads-up, the File System Access API[1] is underway in Chrome, which potentially removes nearly all of the absurdity here. It has other benefits too. A web page using this could write a .sql file on to your drive, that other programs could then access. One of the other bright stars in my world is Karli Koss, who has an extensive personal data-extraction setup for a ridiculously colossal variety of services &amp; devices[2]. A vast amount of this massive massive data-gathering framework is just reading sqlite databases of the various devices and apps. If the web can help participate more actively, can let apps write sql files to store state: so much the better I say. Help externalize your state beyond the browser, please![1] https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/#api-filesystemwri... https://caniuse.com/native-filesystem-api[2] https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SQLite, even though it’s implemented on top of IndexedDB, easily beats out IndexedDB in every single performance metric. The absurdity!This really is quite incredible. Same idea extends to your filesystem too. Tracking millions of 1KB objects on disk? You could load the whole set into memory substantially faster from SQLite using the same disk. If WAL is enabled with reasonable sync flags, the same applies going back out to disk as well.SQLite is the most powerful dependency that our product uses today.  We have been using it in production as the sole persistence mechanism for 100% of our data for the last 5-6 years now. Recently, we have started leveraging the actual SQL engine to process all of our business logic as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a newborn at home, and like every other parent, we take thousands of pictures and videos of our newest family member. We took pictures of the very first baby-bath. So now I have pictures of a naked baby on my phone. Does that mean that pictures of my newborn baby will be uploaded to Apple for further analysis, potentially stored for indefinite time, shared with law enforcement?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whoever controls the hash list controls your phone from now on. Period. End of sentence.Apple has not disclosed who gets to add new hashes to the list of CSAM hashes or what the process is to add new hashes. Do different countries have different hash lists?Because if the FBI or CIA or CCCP or KSA wants to arrest you, all they need to do is inject the hash of one of your photos into the “list” and you will be flagged.Based on the nature of the hash, they can’t even tell you which photo is the one that triggered the hash. Instead, they get to arrest you, make an entire copy of your phone, etc.It’s insidious. And it’s stupid. Why Apple is agreeing to do this is disgusting.And it doesn’t make sense. If I were a pedophile and I took a new CSAM photo, how long would it take for that specific photo to get on the list? Months? Years? As long as pedophiles know that their phones are being scanned, they won’t use iPhones for their photos. And then it will be only innocent people like me that get scanned for CSAM and potentially getting that used against me in the future.If they really cared about CSAM, this feature is useless and stupid. All it does is make regular people vulnerable to Big Brother tactics which we know already exist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My opinion about:
1. Every pedophile know about the existence of this system, so I don&#39;t think it will be useful to fight those monster, maybe only marginally;2. Anyway, is that legal ? Even if some crazy store material on his Apple hardware isn&#39;t that illegal search non usable in law courts ?3. Child abuse is often used as Trojan horse to introduce questionable practice. What if:- the system is used to looking for dissidents: I look for people that have a photo of Tiananmen Square protests on their pc, for example;- for espionage: I have the hash of some documents of interest, so all the PCs with that kind of documents could be a valuable target;- profiling people: you have computer virus sample on your PC -&gt; security researcher/hacker;I think that the system is prone to all kind of privacy abuse.4. this could be part of the previous point, but, because I think it&#39;s the final and real reason for the existence of that system, I give to this point its own section: piracy fight. I think that the one of the real reason is to discourage the exchange of illigal multimedia material to enforce copyrighs.For the listed reasons, I think that is a bad idea. Let me know what are you thinking about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am beginning to wonder if this was the plan all along. Back in 2013 via the Snowden leaks, it was revealed Apple was associated with the NSA domestic surveillance program, PRISM. It appears they (NSA and Apple, et al) pulled out due to the level of negative PR.After 8 years, the intelligence community and tech companies figured out they could sell their surveillance through a thinly veiled effort to “protect X group” (in this case it was children)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having worked at a place with 11+ years of a project in  ZeroVer, I would caution against ZeroVer as it can mentally wear on software developers. The 0. is not something embraced, but a taunting God who takes pleasure in suffering. The followers of ZeroVer all believe that with some combination of magic and hard work a 0. will turn to a 1., but the mighty 0. never rolls over. To topple the 0.,  they will try tricks like a full rewrite of core code, new scrum patterns, new directors of software development, more code reviews, iron clad  specifications, testing specialists, and more. They’ll  try to do things they see 1.0 software doing: sell the code, use it in production, make billion dollar decision based on its output, have entire livelihoods wrapped up in its existence, and still the 0. is unchanged. The myths of a roadmap to 1.0 will build over time, some say it’s always existed, but there’s no sign of a road or even civilization when you look around. The ZeroVer faith says that everyone is always on the road to 1.0 if they believe, but outsiders continually taunt them for not knowing when 1.0 will reveal itself."</p>

I&#39;m not saying the majority would switch to Linux phones either (like Librem 5 &amp; Pinephone), simply that the two dominating app-stores (Play &amp; Apple Store) would be phased out and people would probably fund independent FLOSS app stores to replace them.In the end, the people will speak out and respond to back-doors. In-fact we need FLOSS app stores right now (Similar to F-Droid[0], but baked in as the default store), and they need to be funded properly &amp; they need sound economic incentives to continue. No more &#39;free&#39; apps where you pay for them with your data. It&#39;s possible to have FLOSS apps that are not gratis where people pay for them with money, not their data.(The reason I suggest we switch to FLOSS app stores is that the apps can easily be checked for back-doors or malicious code since the code is open source. It makes the apps readily available for audits too)[0] https://f-droid.org/"</p>

And this is before even considering that governments around the world are on the side of hostile technology.Write to your representative, they say, but when our “democratic” representatives couldn’t care less about the needs of their constituents, yet term after term get re-elected regardless, who will hear us? And again, before considering that a) they’re voted in by the same careless majority, and b) that they are empowered by the very hostile technology we want them to combat?I just don’t see a future that isn’t plagued by the overbearing influence of soulless tech companies and the corrupt scumbags that enable them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a few qualms with this app:1. For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem. From Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.2. It doesn&#39;t actually replace a USB drive. Most people I know e-mail files to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to perform presentations, but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems. This does not solve the connectivity issue.3. It does not seem very &#34;viral&#34; or income-generating. I know this is premature at this point, but without charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off of this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a very early Dropbox adopter but eventually switched to OneDrive a few years back because they bundled Office 365 with 1 TB of storage. I just went and looked at the official Dropbox plans to see if there was a family plan similar to the 5 users I get with Office 365/OneDrive...and found their plan/pricing page overwhelming. There&#39;s rows upon rows of features to compare across versions like &#34;Traffic and Insights&#34; and the &#34;Plus button&#34; forcing me to keep scrolling just to see that a family plan costs $16.99 a month for 2 TB. No option for a cheaper plan with less storage. I feel like they are missing the mark when it comes to marketing to consumers here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dropbox is still the bestOneDrive (I use it at work): if one file fails, all files stop syncing. It sometimes tries to sync some files from teams and just never finishes. It also has very strange file name restrictions. if the file name is bad (eg whitespace at the end) it will just stop syncing anything. Still better than Google Drive as it is a standard folder. if it crashes your data is HERE.google drive (I used that at work): on MacOS is it is utter crap as it is not a folder but a mounted thing. So it is not &#34;there&#34; when you login. So every application that tries to open a file on google drive just fails. Because it is not an apple FS a lot of apple apps will complain. MySQL Workbench will often fail to save and often destroy files. If not running it is not mounted and none of your files are here. you also can&#39;t copy out google files (writer, spreadsheet, etc). For whatever reason.iCloud: some strange folder nested hundred levels deep. I only use it because of some ios stuff.So yeah, Dropbox might be pricey but through all the years it really worked very well for me. (And I really don&#39;t care about any of the other services they have)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think he kind of missed the elephant that is modern communication technology has reduced the marginal cost of skilled services enabling pretty much every object designed in an office and manufactured in a factory to benefit from a broader array of engineering and design professionals and methodologies.  The average product and service that the average actor in the economy interacts with is designed and optimized to a far greater degree today than they were historically.Look at the bottle of Elmers glue on the table.  Today the glue probably works better (barring regulation that forces compromises to product efficacy) and comes in a bottle that uses half as much plastic.  Something like a bottle revision that would have formerly required expensive salaried employees to come up with multiple options, send them to the supplier, supplier has to respond to each with details and quotes, etc, can now be accomplished in a fraction of the man hours thanks to email and CAD being ubiquitous in the entire supply chain from marketing, to engineering, to the vendor&#39;s contractor who will actually design the tooling.  Sign off might take days instead of weeks.  This sort of efficiency improvement allows more engineering, design work, or other optimization to be done to every good and service in our economy allowing it to penetrate into even the most thin margin use cases.  From farming to high finance products and services are substantially more influenced and optimized by specialist professionals than they were in 1990. Increase efficiency like this throughout the national and global economy is how lawnmowers and A/C units can be sold on sale for $100 and still make a profit. (yes I know that example isn&#39;t perfect but you get the point)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a golden age blog post, when lists turned out to be an understudied literary device. I&#39;m a fan of &#34;dumps.&#34; Some interestingly debatable ones here:&#34;Intellectual Property Maximalism rollback: copyright terms have not and probably will not be indefinitely extended again to eternity to protect Mickey Mouse, and in 2019, for the first time since 1998, works entered the public domain&#34;I think the easy indicator may be the wrong one here. Defined more broadly, the public domain is not being enriched. For example, the web was a lot smaller in 1999, but it was a much more public domain. Today&#39;s web and post web internet is more centralised, controlled and therefore private property. Google could crawl pages, links, forums, because they were public, and use that access to create a search engine. Content, connections and signal are, today, proprietary. You can&#39;t order the world&#39;s information if that information is facebook&#39;s, only facebook can.Or patents, more stuff of the last generation is patented than the previous&#39;. Does that mean we invented more or we patented more? What happens to stuff that doesn&#39;t get patented? It&#39;s public.Old copyright expiry deadlines might be a symbolic lead indicator, but they&#39;re determining the location of a fence post in county scale land dispute. A tiny, legible, part of the whole. In real terms, Disney&#39;s copyright portfolio is worth more, not less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Environment: air quality in most places has continued to improve (and considering the growing evidence on the harms of air pollution, this may well be the single most important item on this whole page), forest area has increased , and more rivers are safe to fish inBecause almost all the industrial production that pollutes water and air moved to third-world countries, where people suffer from pollution. Same for thrash that is taken to China, India, Indonesia for &#34;recycling&#34;, but is actually burned in fires or thrown into the ocean. I wouldn&#39;t consider it an improvement due to advances in technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Serious question: if I were to use this, would Microsoft collect analytics on me (code written, keystrokes, mouse movements, sleep/work schedule, productivity metrics, etc) and monetize that data by using it to build some AI product like Copilot, or build a productivity dashboard so managers can fire people for not being productive enough (like Xsolla did), use it to serve me ads, or do some stupid/irresponsible/unethical thing with it that will ultimately end up hurting me in the long run?Because I feel like the answer to that is yes, and I can already see myself in the future writing something angry in the comments section of an article on HN that exposes some evil/stupid shit Microsoft did with this, or happened as a result of this.I&#39;m not against the concept of using a thin client for development, but it just doesn&#39;t seem smart to me do it in such a way where you have to place trust in a company that, throughout their entire existence, has consistently proven that you should not trust them, because they have no incentive to (and thus never will) act in your best interests. It&#39;s like if Facebook released their own web browser and &#34;promised&#34; to respect your privacy; you&#39;d be an idiot to believe them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My friends, I’m here to tell you I was a Codespaces skeptic before this started and now I am not. This is the way. ~@iolsenI don&#39;t actually doubt that this (and the 4 other glowing employee quotes) are real, but even assuming they are, I can understand people remaining skeptical about the sample size of 5 being broadly representative of the 100s (1000s?) of engineers at the company.Also slightly hilarious that &#34;This is the way&#34; is a Star Wars callback referring to a character blindly following dogma before eventually realising the error of their ways...On the other hand, there&#39;s quite a few &#34;hints&#34; littered throughout the article that their current setup is a bit of a beast, so I can definitely imagine some engineers being relieved to be able to get such a behemoth off their physical laps/desks: I guess if the local development experience is sufficiently brittle &amp; frustrating, any alternative may seem welcome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m 61 and have been working in high tech since 1983 or so, writing embedded software, doing system administration, and managing people.The article strikes me as good advice. I didn’t find anything to disagree with in it.Ageism is a thing. People have all kinds of biases of which they may or may not be aware. You have them too, and so do I.A line from another source that I keep in mind is this: “If you’re always getting angry, you’ll turn your nature against the Way.” [1] It doesn’t pay to be the angry, unapproachable person in life.[1] https://www.dailyzen.com/journal/bloodstream-sermon"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This captures a lot of what I have always wanted to express. I am of same cohort as the author, and aside from being laid off once (which, honestly, was wonderful) I have managed to stay well employed 30 years in tech.  I hold no degree. I have no specific super powers.  But, yes... everything stated here rings true for me.  I would, humbly, add some of my own.Learn the people patterns.  Every where I have worked has at least a few, if not all, members of Typical IT Cast Of Characters.  There is the &#34;know-it-all-but-does-not&#34;, &#34;wise old sage&#34;, &#34;management climber&#34;, &#34;new guy&#34;, &#34;one-job-and-doesn&#39;t-want-to-change&#34;, &#34;hockey-jersey-guy-who-smells-but-knows-too-much&#34;, etc.   Pick your own.  Most of these people will avoid, tolerate, get along with, or maybe love the others.  Or some combination thereof.   I have found being the impartial mediator to be advantageous.  Be the &#34;Ferris Bueller&#34;.Know the business as well as the tech.  Technologists that can dive into the business language and work with both groups are invaluable.Diagrams. Work hard on developing the capability to express ideas/concepts/flows in a diagram that fits on one sheet of paper.  Do this all the time...even for one-offs.  As the author states, it helps build your brand.  It&#39;s advertising. When I see a one-pager I did 6 months ago on a desk covered with coffee stains, or pinned to the wall above monitor...I know I have made an impression.  I worked with a few masters of this craft, and honestly, they are all magic on any team.Share credit constantly.  Don&#39;t ever appear that you need validation.  Give good ideas away for team members to catch and grow. You will build a community around you that seek you out for guidance.  Time passes quickly... that junior dev you credited for a schema re-jig 5 years ago is now a VP at BigCo.  She didn&#39;t forget.  Keep in touch, right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a great article.I&#39;m 59, and have been out of the &#34;market&#34; for the last 4 years. I have no intentions of ever working for anyone else again. I&#39;m fortunate, in being able to do that.What did it for me, was the atrocious way that I was treated, when I went looking for work, after leaving my previous employer; just shy of 27 years. I stayed that long, not because I&#39;m a &#34;clinger,&#34; but because I was damn good at my job, and they valued me.It seems that us &#34;olds&#34; are not popular. It appears to be personal and emotional; not based on any empirical data (Did I mention that I&#39;m actually fairly good at what I do?). Quite strange, in an industry known for its data-driven approach.It didn&#39;t take me long to figure out that the current environment does not want me around. I won&#39;t go, where I&#39;m not wanted, and I&#39;m incredibly grateful to have the means to do this. I am quite aware that most of my peers do not have this choice, and it hurts my heart to know that they will spend their final years of employment, being treated in such a shoddy manner.But that won&#39;t stop me from working. I just had to set my own agenda. It&#39;s coming along nicely. I tend to develop rather ambitious stuff, and the last few years have been fun. I would not have done it, if I hadn&#39;t been pushed; so I guess it&#39;s all good."</p>

Not only is 1Password the best password manager I’ve used, but it makes it seamless to share stuff with my wife. I don’t care if 8 is an Electron app either, considering I usually interact with it via the browser anyway with their extension. (Also I know that the majority of what they wrote for it is Rust and fast, and I generally trust the engineers to do a good job since they’ve done a good job with it in the past) Also they make a CLI tool for accessing passwords allowing you to integrate password management there: https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/"</p>

They really didn&#39;t give regular users a &#34;choice&#34;- they dark-patterned them into thinking subscriptions were the only optionAs forthcoming / down-to-earth as these posts from the company seem- they are full of spin. Their impossible-to-find standalone license page is a topic they seem to be avoiding.Edit to add this small addendum: It just really bothers me on an emotional level to constantly run into this juxtaposition as a user of software/hardware: liking a product but being extremely disappointed in the company offering it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cannot find any source files for the FPGA code in the repository (no .v .vhd .vhdl files and I can&#39;t see anything by looking around manually). The FPGA directory [1] contains some binaries and some documents relating to commercial code from a Swiss firm [2].I&#39;ve seen plenty of projects described as open source when the firmware is open source and the hardware is closed but this is the first time I&#39;ve seen one where the schematics and board layout are open but the firmware is closed. Note that the hardware itself is quite simple, the smart stuff happens in three modules: GNSS receiver, precision clock and FPGA. To me, the contents of the FPGA source code are the only interesting part of this project. Additionally, you won&#39;t be able to meaningfully modify or reuse this project without editing the source code.The hardware module these FPGA binaries seem to be compiled for is described as an AC7100B, the source given for these is a defunct ebay link [3] [4] :-O This project uses two and half grand&#39;s worth of atomic clock and the heart of it runs on a module that fell off the back of a lorry!?[1] https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Time-Appliance-Project...

[3] https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Time-Appliance-Project...
[4] https://www.ebay.com/itm/XINLINX-A7-FPGA-Development-board-A...Edit: I realise this comes across as quite negative. This looks like a neat project, one I would actually use, but only if it were meaningfully open source."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s interesting to me is how the form factor of timing GPS modules has stayed constant over the years.  I started my GNSS timing journey with a used Trimble GPS from the 2000s, and it has the same form factor and pinout as the modern multi-constellation timing GPSes from uBlox.I&#39;ve had a GPS clock going for several years at this point, and without an atomic clock or really any fanciness (just LinuxPPS and Chrony), I see about +/- 380ns, which is pretty good.  NTP to the Internet gives me jitter in the range of about 20ms-70ms, about 5 orders of magnitude worse.(The version a few iterations ago looked like this: https://github.com/jrockway/beaglebone-gps-clock.  But I now have a uBlox multi-constellation GPS, which is much more accurate with my limited view of the sky from my Brooklyn apartment.  And I 3D printed the case, so it actually looks presentable instead of like some crazed madman that attacked a plastic case with a hacksaw -- which is exactly how I made the first case.  As for the DS3231 RTC that I added... that seems to be stable within about 1.5us, which is pretty impressive.  I tuned it a little bit with the trim register, though.)My takeaway from this article is that the project seems quite compelling, but a lot of cost is added to support PTP.  I see why Facebook needs that, but to sync time precisely throughout my lab, all I need is a coaxial cable with 10MHz on it.  I don&#39;t mind if my workstation is 20ms off UTC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man, tough crowd here. And someone who&#39;s been following precise timekeeping tech for 25 years now.. this is really cool! I think it&#39;s great some smart engineers have built a new reasonably compact and low cost very precise bit of timekeeping hardware. Thank you for sharing it open source!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since leaving Australia (and started living in Europe) I have come to the conclusion that Australia is not a &#34;real&#34; country - it is just a continent owned by corporate interests that happens to also have people living on it.Corporate interests own the media, politicians, food production, education etc. and no one cares, because Life Is Good. Why expect anything to change, or people to care about strong democratic institutions, when there is no incentive for them to care about abstract concepts such as privacy or governmental oversight.Decades of bull markets, house price increases, a decline in public education, torpedoed communication infrastructure and complicit &#34;independent&#34; media has resulted in a wealthy, ignorant and complacent society who allow their representatives full control over their lives. It is not that they don&#39;t care about these issues, they are not even aware they are issues at all.But who cares, when you can go to the beach?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since 2015 and the meta data laws it’s no wonder things have continued to get worse.There was practically no opposition to the meta data laws. No popular resistance. No protests. It’s a non-issue for the public or political class.The extent to which non-tech people in my social circles care is to switch to signal. Not that they’ve stopped using the other tools.There seems to be a “what else can we do” attitude.Unfortunately, there is also no other party to vote for, as both major parties (liberal and labour) hold the same policies on ‘national security’."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Australian tech workers, get out get out get out get out…I can’t stress this enough. The Australian tech industry is a failing joke. You are being grossly underpaid. The country _is_ an authoritarian surveillance state and has been for years and years. The frog boiled and died years ago. Peace out, and find somewhere that will treat you well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of the discussion here is treating impostor syndrome and qualifications as binary: You&#39;re either qualified or not. And your evaluation of your skills is either above your actual skills or not.But it&#39;s more nuanced than that.I&#39;m a Principal Engineer at a FAAMNG company. I have impostor syndrome all the time. Why? Because I measure myself against 1) role models that are ahead of me in many ways - I&#39;ve always done that, and it&#39;s how I grow, 2) against those with strengths in areas that I have weaknesses.I think my impostor syndrome is absolutely fact-based. I am not as good in the technical areas I care about as those I measure myself against.My fallacy is that there is a billion things that I am good at, but I don&#39;t consider them difficult (how could they be, if I am good at them), or I consider them insufficient to a fully rounded engineer, if I don&#39;t also have the skills that I know I&#39;m missing (but some of my peers are not).It doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m the epitome of a &#39;Generalist&#39; - I&#39;m good at a lot of things, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the BEST at anything.I get lots of positive reinforcement - from my management chain, and from those more junior than me. But it never resonates. I always think &#34;damn, I&#39;ve actually fooled them all&#34;. And then I feel guilty that the management is putting so much trust in me, and that the juniors actually look up to a fraud.The only feedback that resonates is from my technical peers. Luckily I get this just often enough that I don&#39;t fall into a catatonic mess of anxiety. And sometimes I believe it..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess I just don&#39;t really believe this. It sounds nice, and it might even be a good falsehood to tell yourself for personal motivation—but that doesn&#39;t make it true.Yes, of course if you&#39;re an actual fraudster intending to commit fraud, you&#39;re probably comfortable with committing fraud. But feeling &#34;impostor syndrome&#34; colloquially means  second-guessing whether you&#39;re good enough to deserve your position.There are absolutely lots of people who are better at their jobs than they think they are. But I have to imagine there are also lots of people who are just as bad as they think they are, if not worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title is somewhat misleading, because it&#39;s talking about two different types of imposter.The &#34;imposter&#34; of &#34;imposter syndrome&#34; believes others didn&#39;t figure what they really are, that they&#39;re flawed, underskilled, will fail, etc. ; and that makes you somewhat of a fraud, i.e. an imposter, because they&#39;re secretly not the skilled person that was hired.The &#34;actual imposter&#34; from the &#34;imposter syndrome&#34; would be someone who actually lied about their skills and flaws, or at the very least don&#39;t have these skills. I don&#39;t know if these &#34;imposters&#34; have the imposter syndrome or not - but for the sake of argument I would assume that they have the same doubts as everyone else and that they do have imposter syndrome.The &#34;actual imposter&#34; who the author is mentioning is a con, someone who was secretly malfeasant and there for their own benefit. What&#39;s more is that from what the author is saying, they seem pretty skilled, and confident. So of course they don&#39;t have imposter syndrome: they fixed an organization, bring in money, their plan is going well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s recent book The Ministry For the Future starts with a very disturbing scenario: A heatwave  with a &#34;web bulb&#34; temperature of 35 Celsius.It turns out, in those temperatures, even young and healthy people can&#39;t survive. Combined with power outages, as happens in the book, everyone living under such a heat wave will likely die.It&#39;s looking increasingly likely that such heatwaves are possible in the future, and possibly quite deadly. This could result in the mass deaths of many people, especially in poor tropical countries that don&#39;t have a stable infrastructure to cool most people during such a heatwave. I hope a mass death event from a &#34;web bulb&#34; 35C heatwave never happens, but I&#39;m losing hope, especially with the increasing global temperatures, and the very lackluster progress being made on carbon output."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two cities in India that are pretty close by where this difference is very clear. Chennai is on the coast, while Bangalore is inland at a higher altitude while they’re both pretty much the same latitude.The difference in perception even if the dry bulb temperature is the same is insane. In Bangalore I can always find shade and it’ll be cool instantly, but in Chennai my whole body is always soaking wet, my clothes are drenched with my own sweat and I still feel like always about to faint.I used to take long walks during the day when I lived in Bangalore (it has other man made problems like traffic which are still irritating) but here I Chennai I can’t walk or jog outside even if I wanted to. I step outside only to run to the car and turn the AC on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar question to this that I&#39;ve been wondering this wildfire season -- at what point is  AQI  (Air Quality Index) too severe for human tolerance? The scale tops out at 500, what happens to a person if the air is even worse than that?Some sensors near Medford, OR are reading in the upper 400&#39;s and even low 500&#39;s -- what happens if it hits what would be the  1000&#39;s if the scale went that high?I&#39;m mostly thinking of particulates, but AQI includes other gases like CO, SO2,  NO2 so maybe those would be more dangerous than particulates (and certainly harder to filter out)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s plenty wrong with Ethereum, but casting miners as &#39;the working class&#39; is a flawed analogy. The mercantile class would be closer to the mark. Notably, their hashing power is based in real world economic power and they extract an annuity from capital expenditure on mining operations and hardware.I also question whether miners are really providing the labour power, as you might expect the working class to do. They build the roads and keep the lights on but the means of production of value is (or ought to be) the services provided by those writing functionality that makes the network useful, i.e. the smart contract writers. Whether one thinks smart contracts on Ethereum have any value is another question but that was at least the vision.A move to proof-of-stake does not remove the role of miners/validators. Validators will still earn a reward from validating blocks. So it&#39;s not as if this &#39;class&#39; is being disenfranchised totally.Finally the social class analogy entails disjointness of classes, this is certainly not the case for miners, many of whom are major token holders, and some of whom are involved in governance (of course by miners we are taking about the humans controlling the mining rigs not the computers themselves)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Something here seems awfully similar to the system that crypto-currency was meant to fix. It was meant to eliminate rulers. It was meant to make everyone accountable for their actions. It was meant to reward the intelligent, the hard working and the capable, and not reward the incompetent, or the makers-yet-breakers of promises. However, this repeat of the broken old system seems to be playing out again.&#34;One response is that the promise was not well thought through. The idea was to replace &#34;rulers&#34; (human beings who make decisions to take care of a system) and &#34;law&#34; (written rules interpreted by humans) with code. But (a) code is written by humans who make mistakes; (b) the world changes, and systems need to update to respond to that; (c) somebody has to be responsible for dealing with a and b. As a result, currencies need central organizers to look after them. And those central organizers need to be motivated, i.e., paid. Old-fashioned currencies have sovereigns to back them, and the sovereigns are paid by the monopoly of taxation and/or the ability to issue money. Inefficient, but it works.From this perspective, bitcoin et al. look like technical solutions to social problems. In particular, bitcoin is designed to have nobody taking care of public goods problems on its behalf. That&#39;s a flaw![1][1] https://wyclif.substack.com/p/thought-bubble-defending-bitco..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like one of the core arguments of this is that the the core devs have pushed the difficulty bomb multiple times because they&#39;ve missed their original timelines for switching to PoS without any repercussions.It seems to me that this is actually the correct thing to do. I&#39;d rather the core devs take their time and iron out the issues instead of being incentivized to play fast and loose with a system that manages billions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The &#34;language models don&#39;t really understand anything&#34; corner is getting smaller and smaller. In the last few months we&#39;ve seen pretty definitive evidence that transformers can recombine concepts ([1], [2]) and do simple logical inference using contextual information ([3], &#34;make the score font color visible&#34;). I see no reason that this technology couldn&#39;t smoothly scale into human-level intelligence, yet lots of people seem to think it&#39;ll require a step change or is impossible.That being said, robust systematic generalization is still a hard problem. But &#34;achieve symbol grounding through tons of multimodal data&#34; is looking more and more like the answer.[1] https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A warning to devs building on OpenAI APIs:
We spent months developing a chatbot using GPT3 for our game and released a video showcasing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnuSQvoroJo&amp;t=264sAfterwards OpenAI then added GPT3 chatbot guidelines disallowing basically anything like this.
We were in communication with them beforehand, but they decided later that any sort of free form chatbot was dangerous.What they allow changes on a weekly basis, and is different for each customer. I don&#39;t understand how they expect companies to rely on them"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m still surprised by the approach. I mean, great that it works this well -- but program synthesis is one of those rare domains where you can observe exactly what the outcome is after you generate something. You can see execution traces, variable values, what the JIT produced, etc. And all of this is relatively cheap -- often executing a code snippet should be far cheaper than an extra pass through a giant DNN right? So it&#39;s fascinating to me that they train entirely from dealing with code as text.Imagine learning to develop recipes, not by ever cooking or eating or even seeing food, but only reading a giant library of cookbooks. Or learning to compose music but never hearing or playing anything -- only seeing scores."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge fan of TikTok because after years of content stagnation and dullness, the internet is fun again. Especially places like Twitter and Instagram are outrage and depression inducers for me, consumed together it feels like the society is collapsing but everyone is living a perfect life at the same time.The China thing is touchy but I want the west to beat them by being better, not by being dismissive and protectionist.I guess by now everyone has heard of their legendary discovery algorithm so I&#39;m not going there but recently I noticed that some of my favourite creators from the Youtube etc. are on TikTok and their material is much nicer to consume there. Why? I think this is because of the short and fast phased nature of the TikTok content. Instead of publishing 10 to 30 min videos(AFAIK Youtube encourages that, it is also good for the revenue), they put together a short video that shows the gist of the subject. They will also be much more responsive, quickly replying with short videos to the comments. It&#39;s a very dynamic place.One exception for me is Nile Red, I love watching his 40 min chemistry videos. Actually, there are a few more YouTubers who&#39;s content works best on YouTube but I&#39;m watching far less and I have more spare time now.Maybe the medium is the message still holds? Maybe people are now ready to hear the message of the TikTok?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to think of TikTok as the crack cocaine of addictive social media. I used to think my dopamine receptors were burned out by the constant barrage of memes I received from reddit, Facebook and Twitter but TikTok proves they can refine that product to make it even more potent.When I visit reddit now it feels behind in the same way Facebook used to feel behind. Facebook&#39;s video feature (which they shove into my feed as the third or fourth card during scrolling) is 90% stuff stolen from and that I already saw a few days ago on TikTok. But absent their algorithm it isn&#39;t nearly as effective.I often have to remind myself how good TikTok&#39;s algorithm is. After using it for just a couple of days I can tell it knows more about me than I am comfortable with, even though I just scroll the FYP (For You Page) without logging into an account. The unbelievably narrow category of content it serves me clearly panders to my personality in a way that almost lets me believe I have a majority opinion. It creates a nearly perfectly personally tailored media bubble.A lot of people from my generation (Gen X) and even from the older Millennial&#39;s don&#39;t use it, thinking it is just for the kids. That is probably for the best. If you are susceptible to media addiction I suggest never downloading it. TikTok: Not Even Once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of positivity in this thread, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s entirely a bad thing, but I think TikTok is the worst of the social media platforms in terms of addictiveness, based on my peers.As a recent grad, so many of my friends are heavily invested in TikTok and have been since quarantine began, some of them for a bit before. The amount of time they spend there is absurd. Consuming 30 second content for three hours can&#39;t be good for concentration, right? It helps add to the &#39;always online&#39; mindset that has grown more popular with social media and smart phones.Instead of going for a walk, some of my friends would opt to lie in bed and watch TikToks, creating empty, basically non-existent connections with people across the world. Connections with people across the world are awesome, and one of the best things about the internet, but TikTok connections are basically UDP.Most TikTok content I&#39;ve been shown is shallow, the same way so much social media content is shallow. My having to get to the point immediately, we leave out key details and we want to catch your attention before you scroll away. Of course there is the other end of the spectrum with YouTube where a 2 minute tutorial takes 15 minutes.I try not to use much social media, and honestly, I probably should limit my time on HN more as well. Doom scrolling is a real thing, and TikTok is not immune to that. I&#39;ve seen plenty of dread inducing content that comes from TikTok as well.TikTok keeps you logged on, as it&#39;s supposed it. I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good thing. If you can control and limit your usage to something that&#39;s healthy for you, then I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a problem. For me though, that healthy limit is 0, because I know myself and I have little self control with social media in the past."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Total Cookie Protection, built into Firefox, makes sure that facebook.com can’t use cookies to track you across websites. It does this by partitioning data storage into one cookie jar per website, rather than using one big jar for all of facebook.com’s storage. With Enhanced Cookie Clearing, if you clear site data for comfypants.com, the entire cookie jar is emptied, including any data facebook.com set while embedded in comfypants.com.This seems exactly right: now that we have partitioned cookies, cookie clearing should clear cookies for the whole partition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you disallow third party cookies, then there is no use for this per website cookie jar. I&#39;ve browsed the web like this for decades (since Opera 9, IIRC), and I had problems with at most 5 websites. YMMV, of course.In my opinion, the simplest way to deal with cookies is to disallow third party, and to keep a white list of authorized websites. Cookies outside this white list should be deleted manually or automatically after a few hours. Extensions for this probably exist, but I&#39;ve had bad experiences with extensions breaking or becoming intrusive, so I made my own where I hard coded the domains that I want to keep."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looking great, I&#39;ve been a long time Mac user and I think I actually like elementary&#39;s evolution of the UI styling (from when it started as a pretty direct clone) better than I like Apple&#39;s in Big Sur. Tried elementary before (Luna and Freya IIRC) and while it hasn&#39;t replaced my Mac for development or my Windows desktop for gaming, I&#39;m definitely keeping an eye on it.Can&#39;t help but notice that the Sound indicator&#39;s dropdown doesn&#39;t line up with the icon above it. But the fact that a single UI glitch is a notable item now says a lot about the overall quality. Very tidy, still customizable, and a suite of built-in software that ought to cover most users. Good stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised they spend so much (presumably) time and effort on applications, especially &#39;Web&#39; and &#39;Terminal&#39;. How many users are actually going to use &#39;Web&#39; as their browser?That said, I wish them all the best, because I use &#39;Files&#39; (but not the distro) since it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve found for the odd occasion where I think using a GUI file manager will be easier than the command line. I still wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s good, just the best I&#39;ve found. (Not opening everything on a single-click is a vast improvement!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a big update for a relatively small community distro.  Kudos to the team.A summary of some of the cooler features:Performance:  General performance improvements on all hardware resulting from optimizing for Pinebook Pro and Raspberry Pi - namely, reducing and asynchronizing inter-process communication between desktop components, removing unused code, and reducing disk I/O.Firmware:  Linux Vendor Firmware Service now built-in, enabling firmware updates from within the OS.Flatpak:  all-in on flatpak, all AppCenter apps are flatpaks, as well as some Elementary apps like Web.Portals:  apps must explicitly request permission to get access to files or interact with other apps.  Can tweak these permissions in System Settings.Mail:  The Mail app now sandboxes html emails.Multi-Touch:  Extended from supporting just desktop to various apps now too.Multi-Tasking:  Better hot corners + new window and workspace controls.CalDav:  Tasks and Calendar now designed around the CalDav format, making importing and sharing of tasks and calendar items with other CalDav apps easier.Dark Theme:  system-wide, applies to GTK apps too.Terminal:  smart-paste protection extended from sudo pastes to multi-line pastes.More OEM/Vendor friendly:- Installer is simplified and streamlined - network connectivity, user account creation, and updates moved out of the installer and into the installed OS.  Better for vendors &amp; OEMs.- Startup is intentionally non-Elementary-branded, better enabling OEM/Vendor branded startup splash screen — &#34;we don’t need to constantly advertise your operating system to you&#34;.There&#39;s a separate blog post on hardware-specific improvements here:  https://blog.elementary.io/hardware-improvements-coming-to-e..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But [Apple executives] said they expected any [implication by malicious actors] attacks to be very rare and that in any case a review would then look for other signs of criminal hacking.&#34;Oh, all right: Apple, already being in possession of hard evidence of a hideous crime and already being required by law to forward such evidence to proper authorities, will also - pro bono publico! - sacrifice significant amount of time of a significant number of their in-house computer forensics experts, each enjoying a significant billing rate, to relentlessly look for &#34;other signs of criminal hacking&#34;, until there is no significant doubt that the accused is, indeed, guilty.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I stopped using stock Android and went back to iPhones because I thought Apple cares more about privacy than Google does. Not exactly correct in all cases I know (ie. they both suck in terms of privacy), but it seemed like Apple users are buying in, so it might work.Now I think my next mobile OS is going to be GrapheneOS.Like others have mentioned, this is as big of a warning as anyone&#39;s going to get to get out of that locked-in ecosystem. On that note, the outrage is kind of useless if you don&#39;t skip buying the next iPhone. You should fully own what you fully pay for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of comments asking what is &#34;Soviet/Russian Math&#34; actually like, and how is it different.I was lucky to get an education in three systems (Soviet Math, Romanian Math School (influenced by both French and Soviet Math school), and finally in a world top 40 university in North America.I would summarize the Soviet/Russian Math/Physics approach like this:  - understanding of the mechanism/intuition behind the equations/methods is paramount
  - teachers are astute at spotting students who memorize blindly, and will intervene to correct that
  - while rigorous about notation, the mathematical representation always comes after understanding, not before
  - the progression of teaching (order how material is introduced) is very well thought out
  - the old soviet textbooks are generally less verbose than North American ones (less fancy), but high quality in their expression, typesetting, and ESPECIALLY (!!!) the quality of the exercises
  - the Soviet Math textbook exercises are something to behold: they have funny/memorable setting (like jokes), they are short and easy to express, the numbers are chosen in such a way that the result will be a nice whole number, or pi, etc. Basically as a kid you can read one of those problems, lay down, close your eyes, and work on it in your head.

That being said, I did like some of the aspects from the so called &#34;Western Math&#34; (in my case Canadian university):  - teachers are more approachable, more friendly
  - textbooks can be gorgeous (nice colorful plots, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through the Soviet/Russian school system with all the advanced topics being covered in high school as others described here. My moment of zen was on my third year in one of the top tech universities in Moscow. There were quite a few students coming from Novosibirsk University who were comfortably ahead of the curve when it came to math. When they showed their transcript (&#34;zachetka&#34;), they had ~3000 hours of Calculus in the first few years against our ~120... As they described it, each day after the usual roster of lectures and seminars, they would spend 4 hours in class in the evening solving math problems with a teacher. While we might have spent a few hours doing homework every now and then, it was nowhere near this. Not to mention doing it in class with a teacher who would likely also give them more challenging problems and valuable feedback. The sheer amount of time and mental effort was staggering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a weird article. I think this idea of &#39;Russian math&#39; is very nebulous, and is probably used as marketing tool nowadays by some schools abroad. I have graduated from one of the top physics/maths high schools in Russia, and yes we had great math education there, but that was an outlier. Outside a handful of schools the math education is pretty dismal.
And even in the good math schools there are different ways of teaching maths. I.e. there is a famous system of &#39;sheets&#39; where the actual teaching of formal theory is very limited, while most of learning is done by solving problems (given to you on a sheet) and then presenting solutions to the teacher. But it wasn&#39;t used in our school for example.What definitely exists in Russia (or at least some big cities) is a system of free after-school classes, where you can go and learn how to solve olympiad-type math problems and become more interested in maths. That is definitely extremely useful to identify a few people who are talented in maths."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I live in a master planned community (Daybreak, Utah), and while you can definitely scoff at the building quality (state of things everywhere right now, it&#39;s all done fast and with low quality materials), it&#39;s been fantastic, especially during the pandemic.The whole neighborhood is designed to be walkable, with parks, pools, trails, train stations, grocery stores and restaurants (added in the later phases, which are being developed right now) within 5 minutes of your doorstep.It gets a bad rap from locals on the outside, but talk to the people living here (mostly expats from out of state) and nearly all of them say the same thing:&gt; &#34;We love it here!&#34;and&gt; &#34;Why aren&#39;t more communities built this way?&#34;I will say though, the US is poorly equipped for bicycle commuting. Even our neighborhood doesn&#39;t have many dedicated bike paths, opting instead to share the road with cars. Most diehard cyclists I know will tell you it&#39;s a matter of &#34;when&#34; not &#34;if&#34; you have a scary encounter with a driver. And with the amount of gigantic trucks on the roads out here that people use as their commuter cars, you can imagine these encounters don&#39;t typically end well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately this project lacks two things which are essential to a long-lasting, sustainable, and human-friendly town.1) Architecture that inspires, elevates the soul, and will last the test of time. All I see is soulless pre-fabs. It looks like you&#39;re living in a shopping mall.2) The freedom to create buildings and institutions that are meaningful to the residents who reside there. Churches, schools, sporting clubs. Trusting the company behind this to provide for your every need is naive. Maybe it will work for some people. But will people want to move and raise children here?Creating one-off experiences is not the way to create the sustainable towns and cities of the future. This is like Airbnb taken to an obscene level. We should be designing car-free towns where people can buy property, design beautiful homes, participate in a small local economy, work locally and start small businesses, create the local institutions that their children and their children&#39;s children will participate in. I don&#39;t want to rent my space in a town I&#39;m only partially attached to. I want to put roots down, and build things that will last."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To the reader: if this is your first exposure to finding things that aren&#39;t supposed to be exposed to the internet and you&#39;re finding it interesting enough to want to learn more, there&#39;s a tool commonly used among security practitioners called Shodan that enables a much more tunable search for exposed assets.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shodan_(website) - deeper reading. I&#39;m not affiliated.---It&#39;s also a super basic intro to proper google-fu (which you can google to find others&#39; takes on how to become somewhat effective at, erm, googling). Back when I used to blog on Microsoft-related topics, it was common to construct extremely narrow queries to find exposed confidential documents in Skydrive accounts which we could then sift through to find bloggable material.e.g site:[skydrive domain] filetype:.pptx &#34;Microsoft Confidential&#34; etc.Or one which still works:https://www.google.com/search?q=&#34;Microsoft+Confidential&#34;+sit...lmao I&#39;m going to have some fun tonight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Folks - these routers are secure. There is nothing to see here, move along.Here&#39;s the user manual for the TP-Link AC2300 &#34;Archer C7&#34;, as found in the google results:https://static.tp-link.com/2019/201912/20191231/7106508598_A...Step 2 of first time setup forces a default password change. There is no way around this step.The defaults for the router also do not allow router access from the WAN port.This means:1) These routers all have secured passwords that are non-default.2) These routers were deliberately placed on the internet by people that knew enough about them to do so.Just because it&#39;s not how you would configure your router doesn&#39;t make it wrong. There are legit reasons to place a router on the internet, so long as it&#39;s secured properly... how else would you remotely manage a router at a different physical location, for instance.__Lastly__ click &#34;Next Page&#34; on the OP search results. The estimated 7,000+ results becomes 21. Many of which are HN aggregators reporting on this thread here.So... out of the possible millions of routers TP-Link has sold in this model line, less than 21 are on the public internet - many of which no longer load via IP address (indicating they are no longer publicly accessible), and the rest have professional CNAME&#39;s attached, indicating professional management.Nothing here..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just checked if my router&#39;s admin was open to public access by connecting with my public IP. It connected! Oh no! That&#39;s embarrassing, I thought.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Although NAFTA was heralded by the U.S. government for reducing barriers to trade, as The Counter previously reported, the pact devastated rural economies in Mexico, flooding the market with cheap, government-subsidized U.S. corn and gutting domestic corn prices by nearly 70 percent. This shift led an estimated 2 million farmworkers to abandon the countryside to seek work in big cities or across the border in the United States.&gt;On December 31, 2020, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador signed a decree that could enable Mexican farmers to reclaim their livelihoods within their home country. The order calls for the phase-out by 2024 of two pillars of American agribusiness: glyphosate and genetically engineered (GE) cornThe problem that US corn grown using high yielding strains is too cheap, so the solution is to ban growing high yielding strains domestically? I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s going to work.The actual text of the decree is here: https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5609365&amp;fecha...The google translated version says nothing about banning genetically engineered corn, just banning glyphosate? The second order effect is that nobody buys RR corn seed, since you wouldn&#39;t bother spending more for it if you can&#39;t then use glyphosate to knock down weeds. But that&#39;s only for corn grown in-country. All the media coverage seems to think it&#39;s banning corn imports, which I believe would require repealing NAFTA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought the main health problem with GMO crops (other than overzealous IP management and such) wasn’t even that they’re engineered - it’s that we engineer them to deal with heavy pesticide usage, proceed do so in a way that it’s impossible to clean out, and then consume that food.(and the insect apocalypse, but that’s an indirect effect on human health)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just my impression, so do tell me if I&#39;m incorrect, but I always got the impression that those North American countries like Mexico and USA rely a bit too much on corn, to the detriment of a more diverse set of crops. Renewable fuel? Corn. Cattle food? Corn. Staple carb? Corn. Sweetener? Corn.Aren&#39;t they putting too many eggs in the same basket?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One Google employee, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation, typically commutes to the Seattle office from a nearby county and would likely see their pay cut by about 10% by working from home full-time, according estimates by the company&#39;s Work Location Tool launched in June.&gt; The employee was considering remote work but decided to keep going to the office - despite the two-hour commute.This seems like a nice little meditation on the loss aversion heuristic. I doubt many people would accept a 25% increase in the amount of their time that&#39;s committed to work in exchange for a paltry 11% pay increase. But if you frame it as a 10% pay decrease in exchange for a 20% reduction in how much of your life is devoted to work, it suddenly becomes a lot less palatable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Class A office space in Manhattan is about $70/sqft, and the average office employee gets 150 sqft allocated (desk, hallway, conference room, supply closets...) Google is probably 170. That&#39;s $11900 annually that they save by not having an employee take up office space.No, it&#39;s not fungible on a small scale, but it&#39;s certainly fungible on a large scale: reduce your office needs by 100 people and you can rearrange desks and sublet that 17000 sqft.Google has other famous in-office benefits that cost per-person, so $12K per remote is a baseline savings. If Googlers had any collective bargaining power, they wouldn&#39;t be getting salary reductions: they would be getting extra expense money for desks, chairs, and ISP upgrades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cost of commuting on the environment is extremely high. We should be offering incentives to companies to switch to remote work. If 20% of jobs permanently switched to remote, the impact on carbon emissions would be immediate, and extremely positive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone actually believed it was &#34;code red for humanity&#34; they&#39;d be pushing nuclear power. There is zero chance of moving off carbon energy sources without causing catastrophic mayhem, unless we use massive amounts of nuclear.For instance, the last 4 years my state has averaged 37% production of total possible installed wind generation capacity. This is a very windy state which is in the top 2 for installed wind capacity and number one per capita. But throughout a day wind power can very from nearly zero to close to max capacity. Those periods of near zero production can last non-trivial amounts of time no realistic battery could provide for.The only solutions are continue with our gas turbine/wind power mix where we build enough gas turbines to handle 100% of the load for when the wind production is bottoming out, or replace everything with nuclear.Nuclear gets us to net carbon zero fastest and with technology easy to export to developing countries in desperate need of plentiful, reliable, cheap electricity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just. Tax. It.We have warmed the earth because we love comfort and money. We will never stop loving those things. So instead let&#39;s use the same systems to fix this (or at least slow things down).As an individual my largest carbon impact is air travel. I like to go places, it&#39;s one of the main things I work to afford. Every single plane ticket I take should have a tax which is used to offset or capture the carbon emissions of my flight. I will pay it. Anyone not willing to pay it will have to fly less. Any airlines that can&#39;t operate under the tax will not operate.Now do the same thing for corporate polluters, packaging waste, etc. If a country won&#39;t do this for domestic goods we can at least impose climate tariffs at borders.The only other thing that could work is some fantastic new technological solution, but let&#39;s not wait for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s just so hard to know what actions have what impact on CO2 production. Some are high-pain, low-gain (switching devices off instead of standby?), some are opposite (cycling instead of driving when possible etc).For that if for no other reason, I’d rather if consumer prices included an explicit CO2 tax. The here can be a rebate for poorer people, or personal allowance, whatever, but there would be a fixed yardstick for measuring your personal impact.Off the top of my head, I have no idea which if my activities generates the most CO2. My car? Energy use? Diet? Going skiing once a year? No idea.Newspaper articles only help a little, they usually present an incomplete picture, and optimising against an incorrect utility function is often counterproductive.I’m imagining something like VAT, where “value added/carbon” adds up over the lifetime of product/service production."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This invasive capability on the device level is a massive intrusion on everyone&#39;s privacy and there will be no limits for governments to expand it&#39;s reach once implemented. The scope will always broaden.From the article:Apple’s choices in this case, though, go in the opposite direction: instead of adding CSAM-scanning to iCloud Photos in the cloud that they own-and-operate, Apple is compromising the phone that you and I own-and-operate, without any of us having a say in the matter. Yes, you can turn off iCloud Photos to disable Apple’s scanning, but that is a policy decision; the capability to reach into a user’s phone now exists, and there is nothing an iPhone user can do to get rid of it.A far better solution to the “Flickr problem” I started with is to recognize that the proper point of comparison is not the iPhone and Facebook, but rather Facebook and iCloud. One’s device ought be one’s property, with all of the expectations of ownership and privacy that entails; cloud services, meanwhile, are the property of their owners as well, with all of the expectations of societal responsibility and law-abiding which that entails. It’s truly disappointing that Apple got so hung up on its particular vision of privacy that it ended up betraying the fulcrum of user control: being able to trust that your device is truly yours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; . Yes, you can turn off iCloud Photos to disable Apple’s scanning,so, Apple now has the ability to reach into every law abiding citizens personal phone - report them to the FBI when the algorithm makes mistakes (and it will - nothing is 100%, particular in image recognition), AND THEN THE PERPETRATORS CAN STILL GET AWAY BY JUST TURNING IT OFF??!??!?!My goodness, I couldn&#39;t imagine a stupider way to fight CSAM.&gt; Facebook made 20.3 million reports of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) in 2020.Were there 20.3 million arrests of offenders?  I don&#39;t think so. I doubt they caught 20 perps from that data.  While it may be a better algorithm, it should be a good warning of how often your&#39; very legitimate and non-CSAM data will be leaked to a &#34;verifier&#34;, and worse, to the authorities.Take a look at how often YouTube channels are taken down by &#34;auto triggers&#34; that are then &#34;reviewed&#34; and you will get a good idea of how often the government is going to screw law abiding citizens.  It&#39;s not zero, and imho, it will be well above a range of &#34;acceptable fallout&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These efforts will evolve and expand over time.I have no doubt they will. Pandora’s box has been opened, and okay, today the scanning is only for images uploaded to iCloud, and only for CSAM. But that is not auditable and subject to change at any time without notice.And today it is only looking at known hashes but the devices already have a capability to analyse images and even run OCR on them, this is not a matter of of these things will be weaponised but when.Can’t believe this is the same Apple that publicly defended the right to privacy for known terrorists by using the slippery slope argument themselves. The mind boggles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The scary thing about this is that many people have images that look like child porn at home: Family photos of naked grandchildren playing at the sea or in the mud, as well as sexting between consenting teenagers. There is no way automatic classification can distinguish these from real child porn, because they look almost identical and thus many private pictures will be shared with the government. This not only infringes the privacy of those people in the most drastic way possible, but might also lead to lawsuits that can tear families apart (think your father being accused of having CP only for it to turn out months later it was an old picture of yourself). The article mentions that 40% of CP investigations in Germany are started against minors (implied: through sexting), which shows that this concern is not purely theoretical at all.This was not an issue with the old approach of comparing checksums against public CP images, but it will increasingly be if we use more AI algorithms for this.EDIT: Probably Apples neural hashes that are currently in the news won&#39;t be vulnerable to this since they trained specifically to only detect changes in color/cropping/rotation. But we can&#39;t know for sure since the white paper is not that detailed and &#34;naked kid on beach&#34; photos all look really similar usually."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to cry if is see such dangerous things.  
Most European parties send unknown politicians to Strasbourg and let them vote on important topics with low media coverage. Later the local politicians - which act mostly in Bruessels - claim that they have no way but follow Strasbourgs/Bruessels decisions and write even worse state laws upon it.I think we need a new Europe state with a actual parliament in charge, which means the people there are accountable and in power. Without the Commission, Council and Presidency of Council[1]. Instead one actual parliament and one actual government. The Europeans state are integrated part of it, like elsewhere. Next the stuff can be fixed: We just need one army. And one social-security system with one economic policy. And one state department (foreign politics).Most politicians still think of Europe as a economy council but we people expect a sovereign country/state. The former &#34;economy council&#34; could solve economy related issues within Europe in the 1950s. But I think we have much bigger things to do.[1] I don&#39;t know how somebody can seriously use something like a rolling presidency. You can do that with a mediator position or referee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Privacy is something that people usually only care about on a theoretical level.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really hope there is enough momentum to stop this. It&#39;s definitely the last straw for me in terms of apple products. I haven&#39;t bought a new iphone for 4 years, I&#39;m slowly trying to switch to a lightphone (non smartphone). My mac needs a change but I will probably switch to linux.It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous what apple has become. The exact opposite of what they used to represent, when I loved them. God rest Steve Jobs soul, his 1984 ad is exactly what apple is now. Screwed devs on app store, strongarmed into compliance, cooperation with china, worse and worse UX on phones, and now this...Really disappointing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I was ignorant on the issue and completely against the approach of Apple.Then HN taught me that any company storing images on their infrastructure in the US must report pedophilic images to the US government.At this point, the approach taken by Apple seems like the best one to me, if you don&#39;t want to store pictures in clear on your servers.What other technical approach are people advocating for?Another point it is to try to change the law, but this is beyond the scope of the conversation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“other tech experts“ want to keep Apple from using End2End encryption so they have a reason why they don’t provide it to their customers. With Apple‘s approach Apple can only decrypt Data hosted with them if the (false) positives are over a threshold. It‘s a pretty neat way to implement a usecase so deeply wrong. All other companies protesting now want to keep access to userdata in the clear.Apple‘s approach is the only way to - at the same time - act lawfully regarding to EARN-IT act in the US and provide E2E in iCloud.I really hate these laws, but Apple is not the problem here. Read up on EARNIT and the EU laws currently in the works. All communication WILL HAVE TO BE SCANNED by the provider. Beating the drum against Apple will just lead to E2E encryption being forbidden. What needs to be forbidden instead is any access to communication.https://www.apple.com/child-safety/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting that they started with data. Some of the most interesting discoveries I&#39;ve made have started with me saying &#34;that&#39;s weird&#34; while looking at data. From the article:&#34;Graham&#39;s team was doing an unrelated project on plant genetics and noticed that the western false asphodel had a genetic deletion that&#39;s sometimes seen in carnivorous plants. The researchers started to think about the fact that this flower grew in the kind of environment that&#39;s home to various other insect-eating plants.&#34;And then they have these sticky stems,&#34; Graham says. &#34;So, you know, it was kind of like, hmm, I wonder if this could be a sign that this might be carnivorous.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the technique of testing if it was carnivorous. For the lazy people, they put a nitrogen isotope inside fruitflies and then tested the plant later to see if it was absorbing the nitrogen, and it was."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got a specimen of one of these preserved in a photoalbum from a school project from 10 years ago or so.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some have speculated that with the introduction of the PSI/CSAM system Apple will enable E2EE backups. Given the lack of an explicit statement on Apple&#39;s part and their history regarding E2EE backups (this article, and other statements). It seems really unlikely to me that Apple will enable E2EE backups.Under E2EE, assuming the device key is randomly generated, if you have one device (as many users do) and you lose that device you would lose all your data. The alternative is the key is derived from your iCloud password, in which case, if you forget your password, you lose all your data.Right now, you can browse your photos online. There&#39;s been no statement that this is going away. Implementing this functionality with E2EE backups seem highly problematic.These are huge changes to iCloud functionality that Apple would surely announce...There are many open questions. And given that there’s no clear statement from Apple, I’m inclined to believe that they retain the ability to decrypt all data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s likely true, but quite probably even worse.A friend here in NSW Australia told me some years ago, while working at one of the larger coal-fired power plants we have, that emissions are measured on only one of the four stacks, and the results are then extrapolated.Obviously this was ripe to be gamed, which is precisely what happened.   Good coal (black, low-emission, cleaner-burning) was used to power that turbine, the other three turbines got the low-quality / high-emissions brown coal.Either way, studies like TFA rely on the accuracy of the data that different nation states collect and publish, and I seriously doubt the accuracy of much of those data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I viscerally hate this title, because the top 5% of power plants probably also account for &gt;50% of electrical generation, and the entire exercise is dominated by how small of a plant counts for the statistics. If all the portable generators sitting unused in people&#39;s garages counted, I bet that 0.1% of &#34;power plants&#34; would be responsible for 99% of emissions, which would make a great headline but still wouldn&#39;t tell you anything meaningful about the world.I would love to know about how efficiency varies with plant size (are bigger plants more efficient?) but this study is _mostly_ just stating that bigger power plants produce more emissions in absolute terms, which should be obvious to pretty much anyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cheapest and most effective climate change intervention we could stage would be to get a few busses of activists and shut down the entry of workers and coal shipments into power plants, and to disable equipment.The EU has about 300 coal power plants.With 100 people at each, that&#39;s only 30,000 people.In 2019, 300,000 people joined the &#39;climate strike&#39; in the UK alone:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_climate_strikes....At this coal plant in Germany, just five people were able to shut it down for several hours, saving 26,000 tonnes of CO2:https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/no-regre...We could probably pull this off just with the backing and resources of a multi-millionaire, to pay someone to organise the activists, identify the locations and equipment, and to bail them out of jail and defend them in courts."</p>

The paper was not bad but the authors did not know English very well, so it was quite difficult to read.  That was its main problem.  However, when I received the revised submission, I noticed that the authors plagiarized my definition and explanation almost word for word (from my confidential review). I pointed this out to the editors and they said to just reject the paper with the stated reason being plagiarism, which I did.  The journal ended up rejecting the article, but I discovered it a few years later in a different journal.  The plagiarized section remained, but the authors swabbed out a lot my phrases for these kind of &#34;tortured phrases&#34;.That said, the authors did not fabricate their research (as far as I can tell).  They just did not know English well, so it was easier to just copy things that you know are phrased well than to learn to write English well.  As the saying goes, do not attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance or laziness. That does not excuse it but it makes it more understandable.I agree with the article that this is probably just the tip of the iceberg.  There are likely many more lesser evils being committed with similar tools that are just much more difficult to spot.  I would not have noticed my particular example if I were not a reviewer for the paper, for example.  It makes me wonder how big the problem really is."</p>

Of course, a popular well-designed device running linux instead of windows CE at the time was not in ms&#39; best interest. Tomtom stood by their position as much as they could and, as time passed, microsoft&#39;s bully behavior cooled out.Congrats for your courage Tomtom! If I ever plan to buy a GPS or navigation device, I&#39;ll certainly consider your history."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NCMEC has essentially shows that they have zero regard for privacy and called all privacy activists &#34;screeching voices of the minority&#34;. At the same time, they&#39;re at the center point of a highly opaque, entrenched (often legally mandated) censorhip infrastructure that can and will get accounts shut down irrecoverably and possibly people&#39;s homes raided, on questionable data:In one of the previous discussions, I&#39;ve seen claims about the NCMEC database containing a lot of harmless pictures misclassified as CSAM. This post confirms this again (ctrl-f &#34;macaque&#34;)It also seems like the PhotoDNA hash algorithm is problematic (to the point where it may be possible to trigger false matches).Now NCMEC seem to be pushing for the development of a technology that would implant an informant in every single of our devices (mandating the inclusion of this technology is the logical next step that seems inevitable if Apple launches this).I&#39;m surprised, and honestly disappointed, that the author seems to still play nice, instead of releasing the whitepaper. The NCMEC seems to have decided to position itself directly alongside other Enemies of the Internet, and while I can imagine that they&#39;re also doing a lot of important and good work, at this point, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re salvageable would like to see them disbanded.Really curious how this will play out. I expect attacks either sabotaging these scanning systems by flooding them with false positives, or exploiting them to get the accounts of your enemies shut down permanently by sending them a picture of a macaque."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, however-&#34;Due to how Apple handles cryptography (for your privacy), it is very hard (if not impossible) for them to access content in your iCloud account. Your content is encrypted in their cloud, and they don&#39;t have access. If Apple wants to crack down on CSAM, then they have to do it on your Apple device&#34;I do not believe this is true. Maybe one day it will be true and Apple is planning for it, but right now iCloud service data is encrypted in the sense that they are stored encrypted at rest and in transit, however Apple holds the keys. We know this given that iCloud backups have been surrendered to authorities, and of course you can log into the web variants to view your photos, calendar, etc. Not to mention that Apple has purportedly been doing the same hash checking on their side for a couple of years.Thus far there has been no compelling answer as to why Apple needs to do this on device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see many people pushing back on the child pornography laws themselves that are the cause of this. I&#39;m stepping into a hornets nest by even bringing this up, because any criticism of the laws on the books makes one look they&#39;re a pedo, so I&#39;ll preface by saying, child pornography (filmed with actual kids) is vile and disgusting, but it is the production of it that is evil to be fought and suppressed, not the possession of it. Remember in the 90s, we had to deal with the Communications Decency Act I &amp; II, because every time they want to crack down on the internet, the excuse is always &#34;it&#39;s for the children!&#34; And pedophilia is the go-to excuse in a lot of circumstances.The CPPA had bans on virtual child porn (e.g. using look-alike adult actresses or CGI), that was overturned by SCOTUS, and then Congress responded with the PROTECT act which tightened up those provisions. These laws on possession are practically unenforceable with modern technology, peer to peer file sharing, onion routing, and encrypted hard drives.Thus, in order to make them enforcement, the government has to put surveillance at all egress and ingress points of our private/secure enclaves, whether it&#39;s at the point of storing it locally, or the point of uploading it to the cloud.While I agree with the goal of eliminating child porn, should it come at the cost of an omnipresent government surveillance system everywhere? One that could be used for future laws that restrict other forms of content? How about anti-vax imagery? Anti-Semitic imagery? And with other governments of the world watching, especially authoritarian governments, how long until China, which had a similar system with Jingwang Weishi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingwang_Weishi) starts asking: hey, can you extend this to Falun Gong, Islamic, Hong Kong resistance, and Tiananmen square imagery? What if Thailand passes a law that requires Apple to scan for images insulting to the Thai Monarch, does Apple comply?This is a very bad precedent. I liked the Apple that said no to the FBI instead of installing backdoors. I&#39;d prefer if Apple get fined, and battle all the way to the Supreme Court to resist this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Slowly and almost imperceptibly if you look at it day-to-day, public research repositories like arxiv and biorxiv, along with public code repositories like github and gitlab, are becoming or maybe already are the world&#39;s most important academic &#34;journals.&#34;All research and code posted on them gets a quick once-over; good work gets the attention it deserves; bad work is quickly ignored. Reviews take place over the Internet via both public and private forums.Gatekeeping power lies more and more in the hands of a global, distributed scientific community open to anyone willing and capable of doing and reviewing the work. It&#39;s fabulous IMHO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reed Elsevier and the other rent seekers got no reason to live.That said: in the legal world, where PACER extracts $0.10 per &#34;page&#34; even now that you get things electronically and the cost is near zero:There&#39;s a service RECAP (PACER spelled backwards), where you can install a browser extension which automatically copies anything you download from PACER to a free archive. So one person pays, and the rest get it free.It is amazingly complete, much more than you would think. For instance, here&#39;s the entry for the Elizabeth Holmes (Theranos) trial:https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/7185174/united-states-v..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good development - depositing papers in OA journals is extremely expensive and internationally, most funding bodies requiring OA don&#39;t give you money to publish OA. For example, Nature Communications charges around $5,000 for a single paper; I can send a student to an overseas conference for that kind of money!Public repositories like arxiv or biorxiv are free."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The worst offender recently in my opinion is Spotify on desktop.It used to be that when you clicked on an artists page you would see all the music tracks listed. Now it&#39;s all buried deep in and you have to search through the individual albums. Even the list of albums itself is not shown on the main artist page, you have to click &#34;See Discography&#34; first.The &#34;Home&#34; page is even worse. Where is my discover weekly playlist? Sometimes it&#39;s near the top, sometimes it&#39;s in this &#34;Made for you&#34; section. Sometimes you have to click &#34;See All&#34; next to that to find it.I mean moving shit around when you update your software is bad enough. Spotify moves shit around every time you boot the app!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It’s obvious. Every high-tech company has people called “Product Managers” (PMs) whose job it is to work with customers and management and engineers to define what products should do. No PM in history has ever said “This seems to be working pretty well, let’s leave it the way it is.” Because that’s not bold. That’s not visionary. That doesn’t get you promotedThis mentality isn&#39;t unique to product managers. Mobile developers and front-end developers increasingly don&#39;t want to work on technologies that are perceived as outdated, or even to work on someone else&#39;s code. Everyone wants to list new technologies and greenfield projects on their resumes.This was one of the biggest hiring challenges at my most recent large project: iOS developers wanted to rewrite everything in Swift. Android developers wanted to rewrite everything in Kotlin. Our web app was already written in React, but the web developers constantly wanted to refactor it to use the latest state management trend. When Hooks were introduced in React, we spent far too long arguing with developers who wanted to refactor all of the working code to use hooks instead.The bigger problem is that nobody wanted to work on someone else&#39;s codebase. Everyone wanted to work on greenfield projects and technologies that would look good on their resume going into the next job. Some of the most talented developers we hired were obviously only interested in using our company as a stepping stone to FAANG jobs (which didn&#39;t actually pay much more, but they were more prestigious on a resume so they wanted to switch).Blaming product managers is an easy out and will likely match popular opinion among people who aren&#39;t product managers, but the problem extends to development teams as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ecosystem has also lost its mojo, and Apple is the one that killed it.The good old days of really good, dedicated mac software studios are over. Made by Sofa, Delicious Monster, SubEthaEdit, TextMate, Panic Inc, Rogue Amoeba, Strange Flavour. These were really great software studios that really upheld a standard of excellence for Mac software.But how are you supposed to keep that up when apple forces you into a marketplace that basically relies on customer handouts, where your only way to make profit on your 99ct app is to hit it so big, that your have several million customers.It&#39;s no wonder that there are no good apps anymore, we&#39;ve swamped the market with cheap cheap stuff, and nobody wants to pay for quality anymore.I&#39;ve recently switched from VSCode to Panics Nova, and for a very brief moment I felt like I was back in the old days of Mac Os X where things just worked, and where I felt at home with my OS, without constantly waiting for a better alternative to come along."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a giant variety of &#39;Pachyrhizus erosus&#39; or Jicama, which is also a street snack widely sold in Mexico. I&#39;v never seen ones as large as the one in the article, but the watery texture and how it&#39;s condimented (lemon, sugar, salt, chili powder) is exactly like Jicama. Seems wikipedia has a reference to ones as large as 2 meters and 20 kg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachyrhizus_erosus so it may be like those tree trunk sizes in the article.It&#39;s not Agave. Agave roots are very fibery and dry, there&#39;s almost no moisture in them and you wouldn&#39;t be able to cut such thin slices like the article points out, agave roots are mashed up to start the Tequila process, here are some pics http://www.todomezcal.com/Elaboracion/molienda.htmlSource: I&#39;ve cut open both Agave and Jicama plants, I grew up in Mexico. You can find Jicama/(fruit) street vendors in most Mexican cities main streets or outside Mexico a mexican market is also a safe bet. They have rough peel,  like a potato but rougher, and they&#39;re about 90% water."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have eaten it many times, vendors say it&#39;s a root.  But the last time I ate it, it was little more fibrous and hard and I ate little more than the usual.  For the next couple of days my tongue was itching and I had little difficulty speaking. Then I googled it and read somewhere that it&#39;s not edible.It&#39;s surprising experts don&#39;t know what the thing is given it&#39;s so commonly available."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s something… different about how people (techie people are most of my sample) would write before the 00’s. I’m not sure if it has to do with the medium, or the constraints of the time, but reading it always fills me with something I can best describe as peace/nostalgia. The belief that technology honestly can change the world for the better and that the most influential people driving it have good motives instead of profit motives. And they were real visionaries most of the time. By contrast, anything seemingly after the dot com boom (I can’t draw a clear line, this is just throwing a dart) seems, I don’t know how to describe it. Too self-aware, too clever? It’s similar to the contrast between HN and other forums/social media out there. I’m not sure, but whenever an older article or something shows up, I usually enjoy it. Perhaps it’s that only the best have survived till now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From an old comment of mine on the topic:https://youtu.be/sKOk4Y4inVY?t=518 [1]1. &#34;In 1995, there was a debate at Harvard Law School – four of us discussing the future of public key encryption and its control. I was on the side, I suppose, of freedom. It’s where I try to be. With me at that debate was a man called Daniel Weitzner who now works in the White House making Internet policy for the Obama administration.On the other side was the then Deputy Attorney General of the United States and a lawyer in private practice named Stewart Baker who had been chief council to the National Security Agency, our listeners, and who was then in private life helping businesses to deal with the listeners. He then became, later on, the deputy for policy planning in the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and has much to do with what happened in our network after 2001.At any rate, the four of us spent two pleasant hours debating the right to encrypt and at the end there was a little dinner party at the Harvard faculty club, and at the end, after all the food had been taken away and just the port and the walnuts were left on the table, Stuart said, “All right, among us now that we are all in private, just us girls, I’ll let our hair down.”He didn’t have much hair even then, but he let it down.“We are not going to prosecute your client, Mr. Zimmermann,&#34; he said. “Public key encryption will become available. We fought a long, losing battle against it, but it was just a delaying tactic.” And then he looked around the room and he said, ”But nobody cares about anonymity, do they?&#34;And a cold chill went up my spine and I thought, all right, Stuart, and now I know you’re going to spend the next twenty years trying to eliminate anonymity in human society and I am going to try to stop you and we’ll see how it goes.And it’s going badly. We didn’t build the net with anonymity built in. That was a mistake. Now we are paying for it.&#34; -Eben Moglen"</p>

Am I really in the minority if this kind of thing couldn&#39;t even cross my mind or feels like written by someone living in a parallel universe?A few poorly shot street photos are &#34;unbearably depressing&#34;? And there&#39;s even a detailed explanation breaking it down into points, each one feeling more alien than the last. They&#39;re just pictures from the street! Just how? How does a person come up with a whole emotional essay for this?I am failing to understand the author to the degree I feel like there&#39;s something wrong with this person&#39;s psyche or something is wrong with mine. Am I having a stroke and words are no longer making sense? Am I too young, or am I too old at 26 to &#34;get it&#34;? Is it because I live in a third world country and lack perspective or have &#34;too much&#34; of it? Is this homework for an English class and it&#39;s just trying to talk about literally anything for a given arbitrary word count? I almost feel like I&#39;m dissociating from reality by an article talking about a freaking captcha."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NASA&#39;s response, printed as an addendum, contains the sort of non-sequiturs that, contrary to the presumed intention, can only suggest that NASA is doing exactly what is alleged here: hoping a serious issue will go away.&#34;As shared by NASA&#39;s Kathy Lueders and Joel Montalbano in the media telecon following the event, Roscosmos regularly updated NASA and the rest of the international partners on MLM&#39;s progress during the approach to station...&#34;As far as we know, nothing untoward happened during the approach to station. Restricting this comment to this period renders it irrelevant and signals that NASA is trying to avoid the issue.&#34;When the unexpected thruster firings occurred, flight control teams were able to enact contingency procedures and return the station to normal operations within an hour...&#34;So there&#39;s no need to be concerned over why it happened, how long it took to discover the problem, or the inability of those at NASA who discovered it to counteract it until the ISS was in a position where Roscosmos could intervene? As the article author points out, this &#34;all&#39;s well that ends well&#34; attitude is what led to the Challenger and Columbia crashes.&#34;We would point you to Roscosmos for any specifics on Russian systems/performance/procedures.&#34;So, NASA seems to be saying, it is not our problem - but, of course, anything that threatens the integrity of the ISS most definitely is.That covers the whole of NASA&#39;s response so far to IEEE Spectrum, other than the utterly anodyne &#34;We continue to have confidence in our partnership with Roscosmos to operate the International Space Station.&#34;What I would like to know is why public relations spokespersons think it is in the interests of their organizations to make those organizations look clueless, while simultaneously insulting our intelligence by implying we will fall for this nonsense?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a piece of commentary from a Russian insider covering the launch of Nauka, but not the docking, in Russian [1]. There was a litany of smaller issues with the launch, probably stemming from the fact that the module has been tossed around for 25+ years.I generally don&#39;t expect Roskosmos to make any comments regarding Nauka unless it blows up or something. Part of the reason, apparently, is that Roskosmos is being assessed for new funding (from the blog post, Google translate edited for clarity):&#34;&#34;&#34;Docking is scheduled for July 29. The future of Russian manned astronautics depends on its success. With Nauka, the Russian segment will be able to operate for another 10 years, and be more effective as a research platform.The future of the independent Russian Orbital Service Station (ROSS) is also indirectly related to the success of Nauka. With Nauka, Roskosmos gets a chance to show that it has the ability to create and launch manned space stations. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of obtaining the funding for ROSS.Probably, this is the reason that Roscosmos has been reluctant to voice any of the problems with Nauka. When half a trillion rubles is at stake, you will inevitably lose your voice.&#34;&#34;&#34;Half a trillion rubles is about $7bn American. I&#39;ve been hearing about plans for this new station for a few years now. I don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s real. Involvement with the ISS, where Americans shouldered 80% of the financial burden, is really what kept the Russian space program relevant. So I don&#39;t expect us to pull out of the ISS voluntarily. If the ISS ends up being decommissioned this decade, hopefully we can piggy back with the Chinese on their new projects or something. That&#39;s assuming we have anything they want, which is a big question mark come year 2030.[1] https://zelenyikot.livejournal.com/158629.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In principle I agree, but there&#39;s a lot riding against a proper, non-nasa investigation.1. No one died, unlike Columbia, there won&#39;t be a Congressional committee put together on this.2. Even if there was a congress committee/investigation done, what changes can actually be instituted? Block any more Russian modules?That&#39;s requiring putting pressure on a foreign country to make changes where the relationship runs a knife edge balancing act of frenemy.The Russian space program is a shell of its former self since ~2010.The most realistic course of action (at this moment) of any corrective recommendation is to remove them from the ISS. They&#39;ve been threatening pulling out for a few years now, so let them?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No, the space being shown here remains entirely flat.  There is length contraction and time dilation at play, but that’s a uniform effect.  The reason the image appears distorted is because we have more time to catch up to light rays emitted from farther away.  This visual phenomenon is called Terrell rotation.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotationIt’s based entirely on special relativity—not to be confused with general relativity, which deals with curved spacetime in the presence of gravitational fields."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also check out the game &#34;A Slower Speed of Light&#34; [0] if you are interested in visualization of relativistic effects. It includes effects like Doppler shifting of colors, perceived warping of space and time dilation. Good luck at not getting nauseous.[0] http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I found very interesting when I learned about it several years ago: it&#39;s possible to formulate SR and GR with the Euclidean (++++) metric instead of the Minkowski (+---) or (-+++) metric. Such a formulation (there is a variety of them) is sometimes called Euclidean Relativity (ER).See: https://www.euclideanrelativity.com/Some ER research is particularly fascinating to me, e.g. Montanus&#39; work on Flat Space Gravitation:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-005-6482-0   A new description of gravitational motion will be proposed. It is part of the proper time formulation of physics as presented on the IARD 2000 conference. According to this formulation the proper time of an object is taken as its fourth coordinate. As a consequence, one obtains a circular space–time diagram where distances are measured with the Euclidean metric. The relativistic factor turns out to be of simple goniometric origin. It further follows that the Lagrangian for gravitational dynamics does not require an interpretation in terms of curvature of space–time. The flat space model for gravitational dynamics leads to the correct predictions for the bending of light, the perihelion shift of Mercury and gravitational red-shift. The new theory is free of singularities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think back to how we have responded to this pandemic.  We were in denial until the pandemic was spreading unchecked wildly through the population, and even a good chunk of the population is still in denial after 100,000s of dead.We are a hopeless species when it comes to organizing effective collective action ahead of known disaster.  We seem to only respond collectively once disaster has struck, and even then it takes time.I read a book in 1997 that was about this.  Can not remember the name or author of it for the life of me.  It was about climate change and the risk that North Atlantic currents would shift causing a state change that would be hard to reverse.  24 years later we think it is getting closer, but we still do not act swiftly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often hear that as individuals we can&#39;t really be held responsible for climate change and that instead we should look to our government to impose laws that restrict carbon output.This made me curious: what is the &#34;fair&#34; amount of carbon dioxide that the average individual can emit? According to this article[1][2] published in Nature it looks like the answer is 1.61 metric tons of CO2/year.That strikes me as close-to-impossible for industrialized nations to achieve. A round-trip flight from NYC to SF emits 1.5 metric tons per passenger. In order to reach 1.61 metric tons an individual would not be able to own a gas-powered car, could not regularly consume meat, could not live in remote areas only visitable by plane etc. Many things people don&#39;t even consider &#34;luxuries&#34; (like visiting family overseas) would be a non-starter.In France they implemented a modest fuel tax and they got the Yellow Vest Protests[3] in response. I can&#39;t see the average individual ever voting for a party that wouldn&#39;t let them visit family and nearly eliminate meat consumption.As China, India and Indonesia have industrialized their per-capita emissions have shot up well above these levels as well. I imagine the same thing will happen with African nations over the next 25-50 years.I don&#39;t really see any way out of this other than some miraculous technological breakthroughs like solar powered planes which I understand to be near-impossible with today&#39;s technology.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0021-4[2] https://sci-hub.se/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-01...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_protests"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The last line in this article is the most insane one of them all.&gt; ... Bento, who did not respond to a request for comment, said officials in that office had instructed him not to hand over any documents related to Castleberry’s 2006 drug case, including all records filed after May 2017 that actually pertained to Spriestersbach.&gt; Spriestersbach was not entitled to the documents, officials said.&gt; The reason: He was not the defendant in that case. He was not Thomas Castleberry.They are saying he is not allowed to get the documents for the case which he was the main suspect and subsequently hospitalized for since the documents for the case is for the other person. Even though it happened to him and not the other person. I&#39;m dumbfounded."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nevertheless, the officer insisted that Spriestersbach was actually Castleberry and took him to jail. He was fingerprinted and had his photo taken, generating records that could have been used to prove he wasn’t Castleberry, the Innocence Project asserts.It&#39;s beyond me how anyone has one iota of faith in the US judicial system anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to take away qualified immunity (which incorrectly protects the police officer involved from any kind of prosecution).Next, the police officer needs to face charges for his role in this.  He failed in his duty to the community.Finally, the police department needs to be held accountable for their role and pay damages to this man."</p>
