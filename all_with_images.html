								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m usually a defender of the single screen on the Model 3/Y, but on this, the author is right: the new UI (v11) is terrible compared to the previous one (v10).Not only does it hide commonly-used safety-relevant functions behind extra taps in sub-menus (as detailed), it was apparently done to free up space to offer a &#39;dock&#39; of app buttons - three permanant and three &#39;recently used&#39;.  I struggled to choose three apps I needed enough to fill the permanant spaces - and certainly don&#39;t need quick access (when I&#39;m driving!) to Netflix, or games, or whatever is popping up in &#39;recently used&#39; today.  I would like the driver profile menu to be quickly available, but alas that&#39;s been hidden too.It&#39;s a total cluster-f*ck that makes no logical sense when considering the need of drivers, and I hope they listen and revert at least this aspect of the UI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The problem isn’t really that complicated: originally the defroster icon was visible on the bottom. With the latest December 2021 update it is now hidden behind the temperature indicator. Tapping the temperature brings up a sub-window with the defroster icon.&#34;Even after reading that, I had to look at the pictures again, and read the paragraph again to find where you are supposed to tap. When they simplified the UI, they also removed the degrees symbol and the fan.Seeing as how 60-70 are both reasonable temperatures in Fahrenheit and speeds in miles per hour, it is not at all clear at a glance what that number means.(Disclosure, I work for GM)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The manufacturer changing the UI of a car after you bought it should be illegal or at least highly restricted.I think many of us have been incensed by UI changes in software we use for our daily work, and that&#39;s already bad enough; but IMHO this really crosses a line.There were jokes when Apple changed the scroll direction, comparing it to the steering wheel of a car suddenly working opposite to what everyone is used to; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible to do that with a Tesla or other modern car, but it&#39;s disturbing that we seem to be headed down that path. What an absurd reality.The icons-only UI is also a huge regression; would it really take much extra effort to add a text label? I know people often mention localisation when it&#39;s brought up, but much of the world knows English, this is an American car sold in English-speaking regions, and changing the text in software is much easier than a separate part with different printing.(I drive a 50-year-old land yacht that&#39;s received many upgrades, but all under my control; so my perspective may be slightly biased...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case you’re wondering what happened, from the thread:He sent ETH to the WETH contract, received WETH as expected.Then he wanted to do the reverse and sent WETH, but will not receive anything, because you&#39;re supposed to swap your WETH to ETH in exchanges like Uniswap, or call the &#34;withdraw&#34; function in the contract.For contracts that want to only work with ERC-20 tokens, you use WETH, which comes from a contract that takes 1 eth and gives you 1 WETH.A known problem with ERC-20 tokens is that transferring them to a contract that isn&#39;t made to access them is equivalent to burning them. You should almost never transfer ERC-20 to a smart contract. You instead use approve to give the smart contract permission to withdraw, then call the function you want to receive and tell it to make the withdraw (the contract will internally call transferFrom)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since no one seems to think about how this could have prevented, here is a simple way, which I&#39;ve applied to lots of things in life, not just cryptocurrency transfers:- If you&#39;re making a transfer somewhere with a large amount, do a small transfer first and verify it&#39;s working. Confirm at the receiving end before moving big sums.- If you&#39;re calling a contract, try it with a small amount first. Verify the parameters multiple times, and verify the return values multiple times.- If you&#39;re doing something with a huge sum of money, do it in steps instead of all-at-once. Fees won&#39;t be as big since you&#39;re already dealing with a huge sum of money anyways- Verify verify and verify that everything went alright with the small sum before trying to do something with a big sum- If you&#39;re tired, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you got some sleep- If you&#39;re rushed, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you&#39;re not rushed, have a tea and think about it- When in doubt, verify it and don&#39;t be tired- If you&#39;re not an expert, have someone who is do verification above for you"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just throwing my 2c into the well, as someone who used to be highly &#34;pro-science&#34; but lost confidence in much of academia and the validity of scientific research in general after starting a PhD and seeing how the sausage is made.The biggest problem science is facing is not an external threat from a rabble of ignorant science deniers, but the complete degradation of quality within the scientific institutions themselves.Most research is flawed or useless, but published anyway because it&#39;s expedient for the authors to do so.  Plenty of useful or interesting angles are not investigated at all because doing so would risk invalidating the expert status of the incumbents.  Of the science that is communicated to the public (much of which is complete horseshit), the scientists themselves are often complicit in the misrepresentation of their own research as it means more of those sweet, sweet grants.  The net result is the polished turd that is scientific research in the 21st century.&#34;Educated&#34; people can say what they want about how important it is to believe in the science and have faith in our researchers and the institutions they work for.The fact remains that if one were to assume that every single scientific discovery of the last 25 years was complete bullshit, they&#39;d be right more often than they were wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue that plagues us is a lack of trust in long-standing societal authorities.We can&#39;t follow the entire scientific proof chain for every piece of information we encounter, because we don&#39;t have time.So we rely on authority to some extent, whether that be peer review, government, independent bodies, etc.We need to be able to trust that these bodies are telling us the truth and aren&#39;t seeking to mislead us. Because when we start to doubt them, we then inevitably elect alternative bodies, simply due to limited thinking capacity/time - as explained above it&#39;s impossible to do otherwise, no-one derives from first principles every opinion they hold.The best way, _overall_, to convince someone to do something, is by clearly explaining to them the positives and negatives and letting them come to their own conclusion.It doesn&#39;t always work, and there are specific situations (e.g. someone is holding a gun to your face) in which the cost/benefit analysis is very different - in such a situation, the short term is all that exists, the long term effect of misplaced trust is irrelevant - you simply have to neutralize them.But in general, I&#39;m absolutely sure that education over coercion is the correct approach for society.Because if you force them, sure, you&#39;ve got a short term win, at the long term cost of trust. What is the long term cost of lost trust?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Based. Nullius in verba [1]. The whitewashing of censorship is accelerating the erosion of trust in the institutions, and it&#39;s refreshing to see a long-standing institution take a bold stance.[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullius_in_verba"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is handy, but the good news is that if you&#39;re dealing with anything made in the last 30-40 years, it&#39;s all but guaranteed to have the ETRTO measurements marked on it somewhere.Practically speaking there are two rim diameters you&#39;ll likely come across on all but old, &#34;unusual&#34; or high end bikes:559mm: the ubiquitous &#34;26 inch&#34; mountain bike tire. Has largely fallen out of favor on high end mountain bikes, but there are zillions of bikes with 559mm wheels and frames sized for them out there. On high end mountain bikes, largely displaced by 29&#34; or 27.5&#34; setups.622mm: &#34;700c&#34; road rims or &#34;29 inch&#34; mountain bike rims. Nearly universal on modern road bikes. If you have something else on a new road bike, you probably already know it.Other sizes you might find in the wild:630mm: The largely obsolete &#34;27 inch&#34; road rims. uncommon on new bikes, but you&#39;ll still find plenty of them on older bikes. Not even the slightest bit interchangeable with 622mm. Usually, you can&#39;t even switch to 622mm rims on frame built for 630mm because the brakes won&#39;t reach 4mm closer to the axle. Easily mistaken for 622mm if you aren&#39;t paying attention.584mm is the &#34;27.5 inch&#34; mountain bike standard that splits the difference between 26&#34; and 29&#34;. If you have this, you probably know already.Once you&#39;ve got the rim diameter right, the tire width is pretty straightforward: if it looks right, it is right. It&#39;ll be pretty obvious that a &#34;29 inch&#34; mountain bike tire doesn&#39;t go on a road rim, even if the diameter on both is 622mm. If you have needs under which that doesn&#39;t apply, you&#39;re probably already aware of them.You can put hooked tires on straight sided rims safely (I have), but likely not the other way even if you could find dedicated straight sided tires.Tubulars are a while &#39;nother animal, about which I know nothing :-)ETRTO made it much, much simpler to get the rim size right when all of the various standards had different names to different people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html  has (i think all?) of the edge cases you&#39;re going to encounter in any bike made after about 1925."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh. I thought the C in 700C indicated that the tire was a clincher as opposed to tubular but that seems to be wrong.You tool says:&gt; Reifenhöhe C: ca. 39 mm (French designation)but it says that for 700x19C as well as for 700x40C which seems odd?The wikipedia page for Bicycle wheel [1] says:&gt; The ISO 5775-2 standard defines designations for bicycle rims. It distinguishes between 1. Straight-side (SS) rims 2. Crochet-type (C) rims (...)and also&gt; Road wheels may be designed for tubular or clincher tires, commonly referred to as &#34;700C&#34; tires.but it doesn&#39;t explain the B in 650B.Sheldon Brown [2] says (emphasis added)&gt; A second number or letter code would indicate the *width* of the tire. (26 x 1.75, 27 x 1 1/4...650B, 700C...)The wikipedia page does mention both 650B and 650C and that the ISO diameter differs by a few mm. So if I understand right, these codes (650B and 700C) specify the full-wheel diameter (650/700) and the letter indicates how much of that diameter the tire needs to make up, i.e. a 650B rim is slightly smaller (571mm) than a 650C (584mm) and the tire needs to make up that differencxe to get to 650?[EDITED] 700C rims are ISO diameter 622mm, which matches with 2x 39mm tire width: 622 + 78 = 700mm. So I guess the intended tire height at time of standard-invention was 39mm?But in practice a 700x19C rim-tire combo will be smaller in diameter than a 700x40C so I guess they&#39;re not fully &#34;700C&#34; standard compliant?[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_wheel#650B_gravel_bicy...[2] https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is extremely common. In their 30s, people get married, have kids, and move to the suburbs. Finding and keeping friends in your 30s is quite a challenge.Some tips:- move to a city - things are much much easier in a city as people are more transient, groups aren&#39;t as established, and new people arrive all the time- it sounds like you have some friends - ask them if they have any friends in your area you should meet platonically- the easiest way to make friends is an activity: you mentioned a hobby, but it can be anything - a running group, the gym, board games, etc. The more non-nerdy, the more likely you are to find non-nerdy people- if you&#39;re like me, you struggle to make friends because it&#39;s not &#34;easy&#34; like it was in college. Friends in your 30s take work: reaching out, texting, scheduling, planning, etc.- it sounds like you&#39;re not in therapy. So let me be the first to tell you that you&#39;re depressed (that &#34;apathy&#34; you&#39;re feeling is depression). Which is fine, it happens us all. But go to therapy because that&#39;s how you solve that. Just try it for a month, no pressure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;they&#39;re all full of lonely developers and other socially awkward people - short guys looking for girlfriends, unattractive/aging women looking for husbands, etc.&#34;So...people like you?
you sound really judgemental man.Since you have no friends(so nothing to hold you where you are, right?), and apparently a good source of income, I&#39;d advise you to go remote, travel, try digital nomadism, go to meetups, meet other travelers, maybe try coworking spaces? hacker houses/airbnbs with people from lots of different places?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have often been told im good at making friends and I think you can make them anytime, anywhere, anyhow, the first thing to focus on is your personal mindset and build from there:  1. Just say yes. When someone asks for anything, say yes, no matter how big or small (help them move out, look after their dog) This will put you into novel situations.
  2. Show genuine interest in things. Ask why, learn more, dig deeper, keep conversations going by trying to share anything you think is slightly relevant.
  3. Dress up. Wear things that stick out, even just a bit, a funky shirt, a nice bright pair of socks, use these to add flare to a standard dark blue and grey world, people will reflect back and be interested in you.
  4. Pick one new thing you want to master (not online) my advice here for all round great friend activities - Rockclimbing, Pub Quizes, Boardgame nights, Cycling, Pottery. Each of these almost always need another person to make them work and that helps you grow your confidence.
  5. Don&#39;t work so hard. Tell your boss you wanna slow it down, try and do 4 day weeks, give back some commitments, take a pay cut. Don&#39;t quit just slow it down and give your head some space.

I&#39;m 35, I just quit my /Director of Product role at a successful startup because I wasn&#39;t happy. I&#39;m about to go to Thailand to learn how to become a yoga teacher, not for a career but for a disciplined adventure that will deeply enrich me and is nowhere near a computer! You can do it! Put a plan in motion.HN Believes in you! :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the comments here are focused on the question of why you would prefer an app to calling. The author&#39;s point is a great one though, and something I&#39;ve wondered a lot. Why should I create an account to order a pizza? The app should reduce friction even from the very first order. Instead it adds, and adds for every order... Got to go look up coupon codes! On the phone I just ask the guy what their best deal is in a large cheese and garlic knots and he gives it to me. The app or website should make my life better but instead it&#39;s harder.Worse, the app pretends to be an unrelated party when something goes wrong. &#34;Sorry, you need to call the store. Look up their number, it&#39;s on the website.&#34; For me it doesn&#39;t add anything to the transaction, it only takes away.The literal only reason I use the pizza app at all is for chains where I have no idea which store delivers to me. Rest of the time I&#39;ve gone back to calling. Much faster that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My local pizza place in Seattle has moved the technology the other way. Here’s the dialog when I call.  “Pagliacci Pizza, how can I help you?”
“I’d like to order a pizza”
“Sure thing. Is this John Smith?”
“Yes”
“Do you still live at 1234 Main Street”
“Yes”
“Would you like to order the same thing you did last time?”
“Yes”
“Ok, it’ll be there in 20 minutes”Even better, while you talk to the store you called, the order goes into some sort of pizza load balancer and gives the order to the least busy store with a good drive time to your house.I’d seriously like to buy/have a beer for/with whoever designed it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is the happy path. It has a lot more possible sources of error/time consumption than the app and there are many benefits to the app.1. The line is busy. The app is next to never busy.2. The line has static and you are not heard correctly. Especially problematic for delivery or complicated orders. Or they may get your name wrong. My first name is common and my last isn&#39;t great over the telephone.3. You have to remember what you ordered each time. Apps let me quickly re-order.4. You cannot easily pre-pay (irrelevant if you have cash, but if you are like me and wish to never use cash again, having to pull out the card is annoying rather than just grabbing the pizza).5. Most places now seem to be on DoorDash, so you can just order from there and avoid the additional friction. You also know you can get excellent customer service from DoorDash while a new restaurant is an unknown."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with your general point that the search quality has gone down, quotes doesn&#39;t even always work anymore to get exact results.Looking into your suggested example: That turned out to be interesting and unexpected.So, the exact string you put here was &#34;David, we have been expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place, David, is where dreams are born&#34;, which is what you get when you copy the text from the website. It&#39;s correct that it doesn&#39;t work on Google searching for verbatim.The actual DOM of the snippet looks like this:    “David, we have been &lt;br&gt;expecting you - this is what you have
                           been searching for - this place, &lt;br&gt;David, is where dreams are born.”

If you take any snippet of text that doesn&#39;t do a line-break, it seems exact searches do work, like &#34;expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place&#34; or &#34;deep and melodious when it spoke&#34;.If you do take a snippet that does a line-break, then it cannot find anything, like &#34;David, we have been expecting you&#34; or &#34;this place, David, is where &#34;It seems that Google as unlearned how to treat different type of whitespaces, especially when the author/software has introduced manual line-breaks via the &lt;br/&gt; HTML tag.I&#39;m sure they have at one point introduced some &#34;quality filter&#34; that gives higher score based on how well the markup is made by the websites, for one reason or another, and eventually it got so &#34;improved&#34; or established that even if it&#39;s the only relevant hit for a human, the computer simply ignores the result for low scoring, since the markup is not 100% correct."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an Intel Realsense camera, which sometimes reports the error &#34;Failed to recconect&#34; (there being a typo in the drivers) [1] - that&#39;s a pretty unique error, so in combination with the product name that should be a very easy keyword search, right? Especially if I throw in some quotation marks, to make it clear I want a literal match?Yet when I search for realsense &#34;failed to recconect&#34; Google, in its infinite wisdom, returns pages that contain neither realsense nor recconect [2]. They offer me a supreme court opinion, a review of a car dealership, and a facebook church service.Correcting the spelling of a query is one thing - but also completely ignoring other keywords? Even when there are pages available that match the query? [1][1] https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/5ff27fca... [2] https://imgur.com/a/okYV5V2"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was looking for a specific person recently and searched:
&lt;name of person&gt; CanadaI guess they were pretty obscure so Google in all their wisdom displayed the results for Canada, with the entire name struck through. Fantastic. Defaulting to the most generic term in a query to the point of absolute uselessness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the past maintainers of minikube here. Minikube, while targeted towards Kubernetes developers, also provides all the features you&#39;d want here. It also takes away most of the pain from virtual machine management w/ native hypervisors.If you&#39;re looking for customizability (boot image, docker version, container runtime), minikube is probably your best bet. It even comes with some rudimentary file-sharing and port-forwarding primitives, but it isn&#39;t as batteries-included as Docker desktop. On the other hand, you have full ssh access to the VM to do whatever you want (+startup scripts, etc.)Awhile back, I wrote up a comparison of all the Docker Desktop Alternatives. [1][1] https://matt-rickard.com/docker-desktop-alternatives/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know people doing docker dev are generally targeting a Linux of some sort, but why the heck doesn&#39;t the macOS kernel support native containerization?Come on Apple. Microsoft can do it.edit: this seems like a new development since my last whine/complaint on this topic:https://macoscontainers.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The favorite replacement that I have found for docker desktop is to run docker-ce in lima vm [1]. It’s only a couple of commands to get up and running with their docker example [2]. Basically:brew install limalimactl start docker.yamllima is built on qemu, which is always a solid choice for virtualization. It also supports M1 Macs, and even Intel on Arm emulation (at a pretty hefty performance cost).One of nice features of lima is that it automatically forwards ports from the host vm to guest, so when you start up a container listening on port 5432, for example, you can access it at localhost:5432. This works nicely in particular for local development while using a VPN client, which I have found has a tendency to interfere with local network traffic (if split tunneling is disabled).lima is used under the hood in rancher desktop, which is another great option if you would prefer to have a gui. But I have settled on lima as I prefer the CLI for scripted installations, and also find it to be more customizable.I have also seen colima mentioned in the comments, which appears to wrap lima with some prebuilt configurations. I don’t really think this is necessary, and seems like something that could just as easily be done with a gist, but if you are looking for the absolute quickest way to get up and running with docker (and optionally kubernetes) on lima, then this could be it.[1] https://github.com/lima-vm/lima[2] https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/examples/docker...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is strange, in a way, since the series does not present an obviously alluring portrait of creative collaboration. Its principal locations are drab and unglamorous: a vast and featureless film studio, followed by a messy, windowless basement. The catering consists of flaccid toast, mugs of tea, biscuits and cigarettes. The participants, pale and scruffy, seem bored, tired, and unhappy much of the time. None of them seem to know why they are there, what they are working on, or whether they have anything worth working on. As we watch them hack away at the same songs over and over again, we can start to feel a little dispirited too.Are you kidding me?? This is probably the most inspiring part of the whole show! This is how you create things. It&#39;s a long, &#34;unglamorous&#34; slog full of dead ends, muck &amp; mire, and discovery. This is what gets an artist excited - the oeuvre in gestation, the birthing pains, the grim determination depsite not knowing whether you&#39;re pursuing genius or madness! Gets me fired up every time.The completed creation is usually a bit of a downer, like when you finish a good book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you ever played in a band, even if it&#39;s a middle-aged-friends-with-minimal-talent one, you&#39;ll enjoy Get Back immensely. It looks so real. Even if you weren&#39;t in a band, but in some other kind of a team of peers, you&#39;ll enjoy how group dynamics plays out. I still didn&#39;t manage to watch part 3, but first two are pure gold."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beatles fan since 1963 here. Easily the best thing I&#39;ve ever read about them. All the mind-reading, which I generally hate in profiles like this, is pretty well justified by context. For anyone creative, Peter Jackson&#39;s &#34;Get Back&#34; can be both heartening and devastating: the former because it reminds you that a lot of creativity is sweat equity, and the latter because holy shit, they just had it like no one else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an observation that goes back to at least Cicero.[1]Cicero on the primary goal of oratory:&#34;As, therefore, the two principal qualities required in an Orator, are to be neat and clear in stating the nature of his subject, and warm and forcible in moving the passions; and as he who fires and inflames his audience, will always effect more than he who can barely inform and amuse them...&#34;Cicero describes the problem the OP reports:&#34;But let us return to Calvus whom we have just mentioned,—an Orator who had received more literary improvements than Curio, and had a more accurate and delicate manner of speaking, which he conducted with great taste and elegance; but, (by being too minute and nice a critic upon himself,) while he was labouring to correct and refine his language, he suffered all the force and spirit of it to evaporate. In short, it was so exquisitely polished, as to charm the eye of every skilful observer; but it was little noticed by the common people in a crowded Forum, which is the proper theatre of Eloquence.&#34;Nuanced communication not working at scale, 2100 years ago.[1] https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9776/pg9776-images.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever articles like this about communication crop up, I like to remind people of Wiio&#39;s Laws[0] - from 1978:    1. Communication usually fails, except by accident.
    2. If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage.
    3. There is always someone who knows better than you what you meant with your message.
    4. The more we communicate, the worse communication succeeds.
    5. In mass communication, the important thing is not how things are but how they seem to be.
    6. The importance of a news item is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
    7. The more important the situation is, the more probable you had forgotten an essential thing that you remembered a moment ago.


Just to reiterate, these laws are over 40 years old, predating any kind of social media or internet-based communication - and they&#39;re still 100% valid.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As another example, Amazon teams communicate product launch requirements via a future press releases including a FAQ (per description in the book &#34;Working Backwards&#34;). Its a communication intended for the masses with a built-in disambiguation addendum.Our natural languages uses incremental inquiry to disambiguate context as opposed to using strong protocol. In &#34;Working Backwards&#34;, it&#39;s the communicator&#39;s job to solicit questions from co-workers via pain-staking detailed reviews in meetings (&#34;Bezos scrutinizes every single sentence&#34;). I think of it like constructing a representative survey of ambiguity, and then putting answers in the FAQ that help increase clarity. The more detailed and representative your survey, the more helpful your questions/answers will be to communicate nuance.With regard to disambiguating through protocol, Organizations evolve jargon to increment protocol, which probably increases semantic alignment somewhat as group size scales. If you read about the history of language, the Rebus principle created protocols of formal alphabets; protocols like grammar gave us formal writing rules. Protocols like TCPIP let our computers talk. Protocol creates more rigid commitments for communication, but also increases potential semantic alignment. As a thought experiment, if we learned to dynamically and deliberately develop jargons en masse, it might create the channels to disambiguate context and communicate nuance at scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been reading some variant of this, for many years.One of the reasons that I hated being a manager, was because the job involved a lot of sitting around, waiting for stuff to happen.I couldn’t work on my own projects (because I was on paid work time), and it would have been irresponsible, in the extreme, to put myself into the critical path (because it was no guarantee that I would be able to reliably work). I sometimes tasked myself with projects for work, but they were almost always ignored by my company, and that hurt.I’ve heard that being a soldier in a combat zone is long hours of idleness, punctuated by short periods of terror and stress.That pretty much describes my time as a manager, without the “terror” part (and the bullets and explosions).It sucked.I now work at home, on my own technical tasks. I get a lot done. My personal productivity is through the roof.I take a lot of breaks. Sometimes, I even nap.But I don’t have a time clock. I will often start coding, at 6AM (sometimes, before I even get in the shower, after my morning exercise), and will continue to code, until I hit the sack. I often test my software, while I’m sitting in bed, and will enter issues, from my iPad.When I have a problem that I’m chasing, or I am in the middle of a big implementation phase, I can work for many hours, straight. I will barely come up for air, and I feel absolutely exhausted, when I finally step back (nap time!).I’m not particularly concerned about a measured life. I get a lot done; far more than I ever did, when I was being paid.And I’m having a blast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Valuable prospective, but (as is the gist of half my comments here): People are even more different than you think.RescueTime wrote a similar post, but +100 data:https://rescuetime.wpengine.com/work-life-balance-study-2019...Look at the second histogram. The average is roughly aligned with OP’s summary, but there is huge variance. These comments have already devolved into people telling each other they are lying, or about to burn out - all I ask is humility in the face of our messy shared reality.Thank you for listening to my TED Talk, I guess"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article resonated with my experience as as software developer.At my first place, a small outsourcing shop, employees were required to log daily activities so hours per day roughly fit to 8 and 40 per week. From the beginning and unlike most of coworkers, I measured my time precisely with https://github.com/Klaster1/timer-5 and soon understood that doing 8 hours per day doesn&#39;t happen much and often involves staying late, so instead I simply adjusted the reported numbers to look plausible. In four years, I only received positive feedback on my productivity. What was the management thinking, I have no idea, just like the article says, this was a farce all around.When I changed the company, the habit to measure productivity stuck. Nowadays, I start working somewhere at 9 and finish at 18, and result is still the same - honest 8 hours of work activity per day happen at best once a month, the average week sums to 30-34 hours. Code-related activities never take more than 3-4 hours per day, that includes both coding and reviews. I get the impression that some of my colleagues might spend more time on the job, but low productivity was never a topic of my performance reviews, management seems content with what they get."</p>

This allows us to evolve Black&#39;s style without too much disruption to users that want consistency. The default style is updated yearly.Thanks to our maintainers for orchestrating the efforts, especially to our most recent reinforcement Batuhan (@isidentical) who was responsible for our match statement support!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So True !
After 25+ years of coding, I know one thing. I STILL don&#39;t know how to &#34;code correctly&#34;.And apart from a few gifted individuals (Rob Pike, Fabrice Bellard Bobby Bingham [ffMpeg team] etc) I&#39;m HIGHLY suspicious of ppl and programmers who claim &#34;they can program correctly&#34; and that &#34;this xyz is the correct way/stack/method/arch&#34;.Background:CS grad, start coding at around 13 (thank you dad !) I am well versed in C,C++,PHP,Go,TypeScript and to a lesser degree Java and a few bits and bobs in between F#,Haskell,LISP...The above is not to brag (not that it&#39;s brag worthy after 25 years you bound to pick up a few tools) just to put it in perspective.On Code quality:
I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s easy to agree/identify the &#34;extreme cases&#34; the VERY VERY BAD CODING and the very very GOOD CODING. But most of the coders and codebases falls somewhere in between where the code-quality-water quickly gets murky.PS2. Oh and on &#39;code reviews&#39;: It would be cool if code-reviews were done &#34;anonymously&#34; i.e I should not know until the very end WHO wrote the code. Helps to keep any personal biases at bay - my 2cents.The best thus far advise I&#39;ve seen on code-quality guidelines is from a comment on HN:&gt;I try to optimize my code around reducing state, coupling, complexity and code, in that order. I&#39;m willing to add increased coupling if it makes my code more stateless. I&#39;m willing to make it more complex if it reduces coupling. And I&#39;m willing to duplicate code if it makes the code less complex. Only if it doesn&#39;t increase state, coupling or complexity do I dedup code.Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11042400Sure I might just be a dumb idiot or completely not gifted in the &#34;art or science&#34; of coding. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coding is a highly subjective and creative endeavor. &#34;Clean code&#34; is akin to &#34;well written&#34; for writers. Sure, you can analyze and even be able to define some good practices, but because we are always creating something new that has never done before, and the field is infinitely complex, no rules can be set in stone and applied across everything.In my opinion there&#39;s nothing wrong with calling code clean, we don&#39;t have to analyze every line of code we write. There&#39;s just too many things to consider and viewpoints to take, we&#39;d be trapped in analysis paralysis forever, as you can continue it to no end. There&#39;s never a point where the analysis will be &#34;done&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Commenters in this thread are making a lot of generalizations about tax structures and so on, but it important to keep in mind this is a special case at a number of levels.  Pittsburgh has an unusually large number of bridges.  These bridges were built during times of relative wealth when the local steel and related industries were doing well.  Since the decline of American industry Pittsburgh has scaled way back and had to rebuild itself as a medical and technology center.  This recovery is mostly a success story, but the infrastructure cannot be maintained.  For example, the greater Pittsburgh area has some of the first suburban areas to be completely abandoned with services withdrawn, Penn Hills being a poignant example of this.  Obviously no bridges should be coming down, but there is a real problem here of how to build and maintain a modern city that is smaller than the older one that it replaces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its stuff like this that scares me. Pittsburgh claims to have more bridges than any other city in the world.[0] You&#39;re driving around here, and you cross little ones without noticing. I hope I&#39;m not ever near (or using) a collapsing one. The rivers are big here.[0] https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-30187252Edit: not bridge related, but a sinkhole opened downtown over 2 years ago, also swallowing a bus: https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2019/10/28/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lot of talk about the Federal government need to step into a city and manage the bridges.Cities have (often highly) paid inspectors to do just that, inspect bridges and make recommendations, and issue warnings.  As noted by PascLeRasc et al. the degradation of the bridge has been reported to the city.As for funding through Federal government, my experience has always been:The resident pays their Federal tax.  The Fed takes their administrative cut.Fed allocates remaining funds to the State. The State takes their administrative cut.State allocates remaining funds to the City (or county).  The city takes their administrative cut.City allocates remaining funds to contractors to fix the bridges.Put it in an other way, humans value things exponentially more when their own sweat went into the things, than if it was just given to them.  By coming at State level, residents have a closer connection and understanding where the money came from, and would demand higher accountability.Just my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is nice initiative and any attempt to make mathematics more accessible is a  value added to society in my book. However, saying you will learn &#34;mathematical thinking&#34; by watching 1.5 hours of passively watching, even Professor Tao, is quite an overpromise. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a subject that requires more hands on practice and thinking than math, especially higher level math, so this is more along the lines of edutainment. So in my mind, how valuable this course is depends on what this content replaces for you. If watching this series replaces something distracting then its great, but if it replaces actually doing problems and working out proofs, then it&#39;s not worth it.Finally there&#39;s a celebrity aspect to Masterclass that&#39;s a bit strange. Like these guys are famous, and because they&#39;re famous, they are the most worthy to teach you something.Some series you should check out that are free and IMO provide much better value for time:Academy of Achievement: https://achievement.org/
* Some good lessons with Eric Lander, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Demis Hassabis3B1B: https://www.3blue1brown.com/Numberphile: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching the trailer, makes me think that people who may enjoy this series will also enjoy a book called &#34;Aha&#34; by Martin Gardner (from probably 40 years ago)[0].It has a lot of amusingly illustrated insight problems that show you how thinking about a problem differently simplifies getting to the answer a lot.  It&#39;s probably aimed at advanced teenagers, but in fact the lessons there are some that even many adults probably have not come across before.  I mean, I haven&#39;t watched the Masterclass, but I imagine Terrence Tao isn&#39;t teaching multimanifold group theory or something anyway, so this is the kind of insightful more daily-math problems he&#39;s helping people to understand how to think about.[0] search your favorite, ahem, LIBrary GENeric source of books to find it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first reaction to this blog post was kind of negative because Master Class is not free. I watched the teaser video and it&#39;s actually pretty inspiring. As someone who has done undergraduate Computer Science level Math, but completely forgotten most things about Math except for simple Algebra, I am going to try this.The cost is €16/month which is cheaper than Netflix. I just cancelled my Spotify recently so this is affordable for me right now.EDIT: The problem I see with Master Class as a subcription service is... if you watch Master classes on everything you are getting a broad education rather than a deep dive. I guess it&#39;s more for entertainment though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Unfortunately twitter is going the direction of quora, pinterest, facebook, and mediumDon’t forget Reddit. Reddit’s login pop-ups are more aggressive than Twitter’s for me.&gt; Now you can perhaps read ten tweets or replies to a linked tweet without an account before the same thing occursPerhaps an unpopular opinion, but I don’t think any company is obligated to provide unlimited access for free without an account. If you’re trying to scroll deep into conversations or someone’s Tweets, it’s reasonable to expect that you’d need to become a user of the website.The only login-wall that doesn’t make sense to me is Medium’s, as the site is primarily designed as a publishing platform rather than a community platform. Forcing users to create an account to read a blog post isn’t a great way to generate wide viewership of your blog posts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently quit Twitter (almost[0]) and have been much happier ever since.It seems (to me) that the way Twitter increases &#34;engagement&#34; is to show you the tweets that will upset you the most, so that you can either reply with an angry thing of your own, or furiously &#34;like&#34; other angry responses.I tried to unfollow a lot of people who tend to post about controversial topics but Twitter keeps showing me their tweets or similar ones from other people. It also insists on showing me things that are popular but that don&#39;t concern me (such as sports).There doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to see only the tweets of the people you follow. And even if there was... random thoughts and bits from people I don&#39;t know are seldom interesting, and very unnecessary.At some point I thought I was addicted to Twitter; but it turned out it&#39;s the easiest addiction to get rid of.[0] &#34;Almost&#34;: I didn&#39;t delete the account: I just logged out and stopped using Twitter completely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember walking around a trade show in the early 80&#39;s and doing something similar.  It was a &#34;HP Microwave Symposium&#34; and aside from lots of good talks and papers, the exhibit hall had lots of high dollar HP (later Agilent/Keysight) RF test equipment.  One of the items on display was a HP8566 spectrum analyzer which had a (primitive by today&#39;s standards, but) &#34;smart&#34; display capable of drawing vector graphics, time-linear graphs, and text.  After using one on my own for a while, I had become curious about the display so I had learned everything that I could about it.  So down on the exhibit hall floor, I walked up to the instrument while the sales guy was proclaiming how great it was (which was true) and I entered eight lines of code (about 30 keystrokes).  Then I pressed the button to view trace C (which most people still don&#39;t know about) and up popped a rolling blinking text display of my name.  Most of the people nearby were impressed, but since the instrument was no longer displaying the RF spectrum that the sales guy was talking about, he said; &#34;I know how to fix that.&#34; Then he walked over and pressed the green &#34;Instrument Preset&#34; button, which the HP documentation said would always restore the instrument to a known starting point.  When the display did not change, the sales guy yelled at me; &#34;WHAT DID YOU DO?!?!?&#34;  (My program was in Trace C of display memory, which is not initialized by the Instrument Preset function.)  So after watching him panic for a moment, I walked over and swapped traces B&amp;C (shift-key followed by the swap A&amp;B button).  Now my program was in trace B (and blanked) so the screen returned to normal.  Everyone was relieved!  So just before walking away, I swapped my program back into trace C, viewed trace C, and hit the green preset button again.  As I walked to the next exhibit, I saw him cycle the AC power to the instrument in frustration."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My FBI file was for hacking into my school district&#39;s AS/400 that handled my school&#39;s attendance and grading system.  Somehow using a public IP address with no access restrictions allowed a clear telnet path in from home.  Compounding username and passwords that were all the same for every employee.  I didn&#39;t change a thing, just LOLed and told someone.  Bad mistake. 
This was the late 90s.Oh well, 2 week suspension and kicked off the computers for less than a year.  A nice conference with FBI, police, my parents, IT and school administration.  Fun times.I learned my lesson to not talk about such things because their egoes were too fragile.When they decided to give students in their website design class ftp accounts on the district wide web/email server running an ancient version of Debian, they didn&#39;t disable the shell, just added a login script to a menu for pine, etc. for people who telnetted in, which I&#39;m sure the sysadmin was proud of.  However, a few fast CTRL-C&#39;s broke out of his script menu loop and got me a shell, and they didn&#39;t shadow protect their password files.  Ran it through john the ripper and had half the district&#39;s e-mail passwords in a default dictionary file including the root pw in a few minutes.  LOLed and never told anyone about that.Good times, the 90s...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A person I know studied in East Germany in the early 80s via a very limited exchange program. After the wall came down, she requested her Stasi file.It was fascinating what was in the file - lots of misunderstandings and misinterpretations. For example, she was upset when the Challenger exploded, and this mystified the Stasi informers who had previously identified her as a pacifist (in their minds, the Shuttle was 100% military).Similarly, she was trying to research what happened to a relative who had remained in Germany in the late 30s, and whether she had died of natural causes or been sent to the camps. The Stasi file was filled with speculations on the details of this &#34;sleeper agent&#34; with whom she was trying to establish contact.All this to say that from the mindset of a spy, everything is spy-craft. Everyone&#39;s world-view shapes their interpretation of events and reality itself. Was the shuttle a military venture? Partly. Was it also a tool for science? Yup. But the functionaries who looked at her data in the heat of the cold war certainly couldn&#39;t see those distinctions.For what it&#39;s worth, she was able to get her Stasi file, but has never been able to get a copy of her FBI file."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have over 20 years of Linux/FreeBSD sysadmin experience ranging from universities to major silicon valley companies in both cloud and on-prem.When it comes to companies I mostly support cloud these days but when it comes to me and my family I accept every downside and host as almost all of our digital lives in a 42u rack in a gutted closet in our house with static IPs and business fiber.I know where our data lives and no one can access it without a warrant and my explicit knowledge. I also save myself several hundred a month in third party cloud provider fees to host the same services and can reboot upgrade or repair anything whenever I want, but in general no more maintenance than cloud servers . I also never end up with exciting bills when experiments are forgotten about.You pretty much get all the pros and cons of home ownership. For me it is mostly pros. Also keeps me dogfooding all the same practices I recommend to my clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A very weird thread that degenerated into: &#34;PaaS vs self-hosted/self-owned hardware&#34;.I&#39;m pretty sure most people sysadmin&#39;ing their Linux servers are actually doing it with rented dedicated servers.  TFA btw specifically mentions: &#34;don&#39;t manage physical hardware&#34;.  Big companies like Hetzner and OVH have hundreds of thousands of servers and they&#39;re not the only players in that space.They don&#39;t take care of &#34;everything&#34; but they take care of hardware failure, redundant power sources, Internet connectivity, etc.Just to give an idea: 200 EUR / month gets you an EPYC 3rd gen (Milan) with shitloads of cores and shitloads of ECC RAM and a fat bandwith.And even then, it&#39;s not &#34;dedicated server vs the cloud&#34;: you can have very well have a dedicated server and slap a CDN like CloudFlare on your webapp.  It&#39;s not as if CloudFlare was somehow only available to people using an &#34;entire cloud stack&#34; (whatever that means).  It&#39;s the same for cloud storage / cloud backups etc.I guess my point is: being a sysadmin for your own server(s) doesn&#39;t imply owning your own hardware and it doesn&#39;t imply either &#34;using zero cloud services&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When my SaaS app started scaling, I saw how badly cloud can be priced if you have even slightly unusual use-cases. It occurred to me that instead of spending ~$600/mo on GCP, I can invest in a $3000 PowerEdge server with much better hardware, run it out of my home office, and it pays for itself in less than a year.Running your own server is an investment that doesn&#39;t make sense for everyone. If you can get it, it is better than you might imagine. Being in full control--the master of your own destiny--is so liberating and empowering. It feels the difference between constantly ordering Lyft/Uber/riding with friends, vs. owning your own car.Not to mention, again, my hardware resources are so much better. This one server can run multiple profitable SaaS apps / businesses and still have room for experimental projects and market tests. Couldn&#39;t be happier with my decision to get off the cloud."</p>

It&#39;s like being told your gonna learn how to draw an owl you start with some ovals and then you have a completed owl.Low level stuff has always been interesting to me, I just have no clue how one would even get started with it, or who would even pay me to work on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is it that closed source drivers are the norm rather than the exception for hardware companies?People need to buy your hardware to use your drivers.Meaning driver development is a cost.  The revenue comes from hardware sales.  You&#39;re usually offering the driver to the public for free on your website anyway.  Why not simply open source it?If you open source your driver, community developers could potentially give you free help -- e.g. porting to Linux, getting into the mainline kernel, fixing bugs."</p>

It can be used in native OpenGL apps too. It&#39;s an immediate-mode UI, so it&#39;s very easy to build and update even complex windows.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a lot of fancier note taking tools but I keep going back to Zim. Been using it for years for private offline note-taking for work. I use quick notes and journal shortcuts many times a day to quickly jot down a followup note/idea/question in meetings. It&#39;s also my GTD system with tasks plugin. Love that it&#39;s just text files so I can manually edit them, version control, sync in private cloud service, etc. Never worry about losing my data.There are a few quirks I&#39;ve gotten used to over the years though:- Pasting code will be garbled or auto-create tags unless you use the source view plugin or paste verbatim.- Takes a little configuration out of the box to get just right, system dependencies, links opening in right browser, plugins, shortcuts, fonts. But once you get streamlined it just works.- The syntax feels a little strange to me but I rarely need to edit raw files. I could also export to Markdown if I ever wanted to migrate.My last tip, templates are awesome. I have ones for all kinds of things, like interviewing, 1-1s, and architecture design outline."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is time to give a shout out to my favorite note taking app: Trilium https://github.com/zadam/triliumPros:  1. Data is saved in SQlite. I am at 33k notes and it springs open instantaneously.    
  2. Notes can be arranged into arbitrarily deep tree. Single note can be placed into multiple places in the tree. (Think soft-links)     
  3. WYSIWYG support (CKEditor)   
  4. Tags, advanced scripting features    
  5. Other ususal wiki stuff like backlinks, note-map etc

Cons:  1. Electron.    
  2. Data is saved in SQlite, not plain text."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me add something here; Zim feels the most personally extensible (except for, of course, org-mode, I must admit)I see a bunch of people here with laundry lists of requirements, and when I see them, I&#39;m like -- yes, a lot of those seem reasonable, but I&#39;ve also had the same, and I&#39;ve just built them myself, with some very hacky Bash. But any language will work.Examples..lets see.  I add todo items from anywhere (including phone) with email. I use Blitzmail on the phone and an IMAP script on the computer to send myself a tagged email, then I have another script to check and parse and add them to Zims &#34;Journal&#34;My personal website is in Zim. I have a short one-liner to update it to my server; but I also teach at a college. I learned just enough of the Canvas API to also update certain pages of it to my class webpages. Also another one to update the Slides I make in Zim as well.Etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dislike this kind of consensus-building rhetoric and I don&#39;t like seeing it on the front page of HN. By all means present critiques of crypto/web3, but don&#39;t make false claims along the lines of &#34;all right-thinking people agree that X is a scourge upon the earth&#34;.It&#39;s equivalent to starting a conversation off with a loaded question - a useful tactic if you&#39;re trying to score points, but not likely to lead to anyone learning anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like many people back then, I also found the whole proof-of-work / blockchain concept to be interesting from a theoretical computer science / distributed systems perspective.But these days, I can&#39;t help but think that we&#39;ve inadvertently created a paperclip maximizer without even bothering to create an AGI first. Humans are the AGI, and we&#39;re going to happily use more and more energy to play this stupid game for as long as it looks like there&#39;s a profit to be made, even if the global outcome is to our own detriment.If we want this mess to go away, we need to find a way to change the incentives globally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it strange that people keep promoting that YouTube documentary. Ignoring tone issues, there is a lot of cherry picking and other logical fallacies. For example, he talks about how terrible Tether is and then completely ignores USDC. He also claims that none of the popular blockchains can scale, but Solana is frequently in the top 5 most popular cryptocurrencies.It seems to me that people that do an hour of research are polarized hard. Either love it or hate it. The more time you spend understanding the space the more nuanced it becomes. Many are using the technology to facilitate scams and overpromising, but that doesn&#39;t make the technology fundamentally useless or bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also read Florian Mueller’s excellent analysis here: http://www.fosspatents.com/2022/01/35-us-states-and-microsof...&gt; Epic&#39;s appeal is very much alive. Apple will use its market power and money to get support from all sorts of &#34;friends of the court&#34; as well, possibly even ridiculous astroturfing organizations. But it won&#39;t be able to counterbalance the support Epic received from 35 states, Microsoft, the EFF, and America&#39;s most cited and most authoritative antitrust law professor. It will probably be easy to see for the Ninth Circuit that those who support Epic do so because it&#39;s the right and necessary thing to do, while those who will support Apple are just going to have reasons to do Apple a favor.Update: The U.S. federal government has now filed a brief as well:&gt; The United States enforces the federal antitrust laws and has a strong interest in their correct interpretation. The United States files this brief, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 29(a)(2), to address errors in the district court’s analysis of the Sherman Act, which, if uncorrected, could significantly harm antitrust enforcement. The United States takes no position on the merits of the parties’ claims.Further analysis on the government’s brief specifically: http://www.fosspatents.com/2022/01/biden-administration-back..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really care about Epic (because they are far from being a dream company you are likely to sympathize today - they hardly care about anybody&#39;s rights actually, just about their own revenue) but once I have an iPad/iPhone I want alternative browser engines, terminals, emulators/VMs and being able to write and run an app of my own without having to even inform (let alone pay) Apple about this. I also believe 30% is too much for an app developer to pay the device manufacturer anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple&#39;s 30% revenue cut is absurd rent seeking behavior. Good on these states. Let&#39;s keep it going and continue to dismantle similar systems at other companies.Apple can continue to mandate Apple payment options are as an option in every app, but let&#39;s watch as that 30% drops to nothingness once they face real competition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes company legal teams can be the most accessible way to draw attention to something like this, and I don&#39;t mean in a combative way. They&#39;re very risk conscious, they see a &#39;10+ years of building a heavy metal community, gone like a puff of smoke&#39; in terms of risks, both of bad publicity but also if you were to somehow litigate because of the damage to your business or project. Often they have an email address that is manned because they have to respond to legal requests of various types.You can potentially request all your data (and data about the hack) and let them know why, maybe reach out asking how you can get law enforcement involved and who you should contact after you&#39;ve made a police report. It&#39;s not a threat, but it get it on somebodies radar. If you express how devastated you are there is potential for them to help. They also have a lot more latitude than any kind of helpdesk (especially at the scale of Facebook, and the users/customers facebook has).They&#39;re also well connected with-in an organization because they have to sign-off on all kinds of projects and risks.I think `patio11` has amazing advice is a similar vein[1].[1]: https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768?lang=... (I think he has a longer version/reference, but I can&#39;t find it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Probably not the advice you&#39;re looking for, but looks like you have a blog also and am assuming that some/many of your subscribers also look at your blog. So, you may want to use your blog to spread the word about losing your page so that your subscribers know what&#39;s happening and you don&#39;t lose many of them.In addition, while you should keep looking at ways to recover your FB page, but you may want to take this opportunity to create a more traditional forum of your own.You may want to look at AVSForum.com, Home-Barista.com and others for ideas on how to structure very successful traditional review/forum sites and while it may be more effort initially as you&#39;ll have to build it yourself, in the long run it may be more fruitful for you.Either ways, Good Luck!!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty incredible. These aren&#39;t just good practices, they&#39;re the fairly bleeding edge best practices.1. No more SMS and TOTP. FIDO2 tokens only.2. No more unencrypted network traffic - including DNS, which is such a recent development and they&#39;re mandating it. Incredible.3. Context aware authorization. So not just &#34;can this user access this?&#34; but attestation about device state! That&#39;s extremely cutting edge - almost no one does that today.My hope is that this makes things more accessible. We do all of this today at my company, except where we can&#39;t - for example, a lot of our vendors don&#39;t offer FIDO2 2FA or webauthn, so we&#39;re stuck with TOTP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real crux of the issue is the long-tail of applications which were never conceived with anything but network-based trust. I&#39;m certain the DoD is absolutely packed with these, probably for nearly every workflow.The reason this was so &#34;easy&#34; for Google (and some other companies, like GitLab[1]) to realize most of these goals is that they are a web-based technology company - fundamentally the tooling and scalable systems needed to get started were web so the transition were &#34;free&#34;. Meaning, most of the internal apps were HTTP apps, built on internal systems, and the initial investment was just to make an existing proxied internal service, external and behind a context aware proxy [1].The hard part for most other companies (and the DoD) is figuring out what to do with protocols and workflows that aren&#39;t http or otherwise proxyable.[1] https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/cloud-iap-context-aware-ac...[2] https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/10/02/zero-trust-at-gitla..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our corporate IT folks have a Zero Trust Manifesto in which there are enrolled devices (laptops that remote SREs can carry around), there are enterprise applications, and there&#39;s connectivity between these (e.g., tunnel pairs). SREs often need to write scripts that operate on sensitive production data from the enterprise applications, but must do this work directly on an enrolled device.Pre-Zero-Trust days seemed safer. Copying production data to a laptop wasn&#39;t allowed. Instead, each SRE had their own Linux VM in the data center, accessible from home and able to run the scripts (with connectivity to the enterprise application). This prevented a whole class of realistic attacks in which a laptop (while unlocked/decrypted) is taken by an adversary. Admittedly, in return, we&#39;re protected from a possible, but less likely, attack in which a Linux VM is compromised and used for lateral movement within one segment of the enterprise network. (An enrolled device has to be in the user&#39;s possession; it can&#39;t be any machine, Linux or Windows, in the data center or office.)The only people who love this are our enterprise application vendors. Our bosses are paying them a TON more money to implement new requirements where, in theory, all possible types of data analysis can be done directly within the enterprise application. No more scripts, no more copying of data. No more use of Open Source. And, of course, people from these same enterprise application vendors advise the government that Zero Trust must be a top priority mandate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Naomi Wu seems to upset a lot of people. She makes things, and was accused by the publisher of &#34;Make&#34; magazine of being a fake, with some guy doing the actual work. She replied by posting long, detailed videos of her making stuff. An hour of cutting aluminum extrusions with a chop saw and putting together a frame. Soldering PC boards. Eventually, the guy apologized.One of the useful things she&#39;s done is to put up lots of videos of her running around Shenzhen. There aren&#39;t enough ground-level videos of the working parts of Chinese cities. There&#39;s extensive coverage of Tokyo, by comparison. It&#39;s interesting to see the high-density housing blocks and street-level activity. (The &#34;let&#39;s increase housing density&#34; crowd from Strong Towns should watch those videos.) People who&#39;ve met her report that she knows Shenzhen very well, down to the back alley level, where some unmarked door leads to an important factory. She&#39;s toured the electronics markets of Huaqiangbei. (I miss the days when Silicon Valley had electronics parts stores.)She&#39;s done some nice technical work. Her main thing is 3D printing, and she came up with the first angled 3D printer that worked reliably. The print head moves in a plane 45 degrees from vertical, and the base surface is a belt, which advances the workpiece one layer at a time. So it can produce objects continuously, or very long objects if you add support rollers. Others had made prototypes of such machines, but the properties of the belt and print head are touchy to make that work right. She got it all working, and it&#39;s now a product, with her picture on the box.At various times she&#39;s pushed on GPL compliance, mask quality, and other issues of interest to the tech community.She wears skimpy outfits sometimes. So what? That&#39;s most of Instagram. Unlike most Instagrammers, Wu has something original to say. Sometimes with a biting wit. I gather that it&#39;s more biting in Cantonese."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For any Westerners here who seem to have a hard time understanding why this is wrong:Look at an even more women-oppressing culture such as that of Afghanistan under the Taliban. Women are required to cover their faces in public. Why? For &#34;modesty.&#34; What it boils down to is that if women show their faces it could have a negative effect on men (sexual attraction).A lot of people where are shaming her for being essentially immodest in her quest for female empowerment. A face is not immodest. A boob is not immodest. It is not sexualized because it is just a body part. It takes a man to do the sexualization, so the sexualization isn&#39;t the boob, but a man&#39;s who is doing the sexualization. A baby does not sexualize the boob (it&#39;s food). They get conditioned to it by society and culture as they grow older (a culture that sexualizes it).Sub out face in Afghanistan with boob in America and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s the same picture. While we should pat ourselves on the back for being so progressive as to allow women to show their faces in public, we haven&#39;t quite gotten to the point where it&#39;s ok to show boobs in public. And yes, some women prefer to wear burkas, just as some women prefer to hide their boobs in public.The point is that those restrictions on women shouldn&#39;t be dictated by the actions or effects they have on men. Instead, men should either change their viewpoints or control their own sexualization so that women don&#39;t have to accommodate. These immodest views come from those who sexualize women, and because that&#39;s out of the control of women so they should not be forced to accommodate something out of their control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh... while talented, she is constantly pushing the boundaries of taste and the YouTube TOS to gain subscribers.She pretends to be some women&#39;s rights activist when she&#39;s really just a purveyor of some weird type of titillation. Yes the algorithm is capricious, yes its arbitrary, and yes YouTube is evil. But she&#39;s clearly making a bust of herself naked. I&#39;m sure if I put my balls on YouTube they&#39;d be more than demonetized.I have no problem with her personally, I also don&#39;t find her interesting at all... but it is what it is. YouTube probably needs to classify videos more finely grained so that we can distinguish between types of videos and match tolerances for blue content to advertisers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first job out of school was at a dot-com in Vegas in the year 2000 initially as the network administrator. Susan was the Director of Marketing. My first interaction with her was typical assisting someone with some issue or another, but I noticed her book shelf was full of very technical books, and it turned out she was a Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert and I was just a simple MCP (I was new to Windows NT, my background was in Netware). I was about 22 and she was about 40, and it was very intimidating at the time, especially after I learned she was Susan Thunder.While the company was downsizing (dot-com bust) the CTO told me to batten down the hatches while Susan was being laid off. I told him that I&#39;m fairly confident she knows more about NT than I do and that I didn&#39;t think I could do enough to secure things, so we more or less shut things down for the night.I sort of remember the whole company being scared of her in general. I don&#39;t know why though, she was always very nice to me and seemed pleasant in general. It was an overreaction to shut down the network that night, Susan never attempted revenge. In hindsight, she was probably an adult that understood that companies fail and it wasn&#39;t personal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;&#34;&#34;
One could imagine a very imperative “cluster operating system,” like the above, which exposed primitives like “allocate 5 CPUs worth of compute” or “create a new virtual network,” which in turn backed onto configuration changes either in the system’s internal abstractions or into calls into the EC2 API (or other underlying cloud provider).
&#34;&#34;&#34;There is a name for this: Single System Image. There is no need to write the operating system layer - Linux works well.I built a SSI. Each grid can host several apps, &#39;gridapps&#39;. As priorities change during the day, an operator can rebalance resources using a bash-like shell. Each gridapp has (1) core nodes, which need to keep running, and (2) scale nodes which can be started and stopped. Nodes can be configured so they are taskset-bound to an individual processor, or sharing a processor between several nodes. There are equivalent primitives for memory and persistent storage. Commercial, 1000 cores.The author contrasts this with K8s by saying that K8s is declarative. This is not the important distinction. My system had declarative configuration, and did a fitting at startup.The key difference is motive. The design above is the natural choice when you build a grid computer from first-principles.K8s is designed to solve a different problem: scaling up the traditional model of programming. Here, a developer writes an algorithm on their workstation. The deployment circumstances and interactions with other systems are an afterthought. Often this developer does not deploy the code themselves, this is done by another team who don&#39;t understand the internals of the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Disclaimer: I have never used k8s, so cannot assess the factual accuracy of this piece.)If Kubernetes hasn’t yet incorporated this article into their documentation somewhere prominent, they should. This is an excellent, and crucial, piece of documentation: providing a mental model and explaining key design decisions. All complex systems should have a document like this one. As a newcomer, this is what I want to read first.Bravo, author. I hope you get rewarded."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not mentioned in this writeup, is the added complexity of not using IPv6 inside.IPv6 has an on-demand, probabalistic-unique unroutable address assignment model called ULA and it was made for something like this. Instead of NAT and the like, this framework could have been using semantic address models in the bits of the IPv6 address space, and delivered V6 to the edge.But they went v4 only, and acquired all the growing pains of making that work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I generally enjoy my AirPods. They are occasionally quirky, but most of the time they really do “just work” for me. The annoyances are annoying when they happen, though.The strangest part is that the annoyances aren’t getting any better over time. At first I assumed that they were growing pains of an early product launch. Yet now we’re years into the AirPods experience and they continue to be just as quirky as when I first got them.Apple seems so hot or cold on fixing their own bugs. Certain bugs get rapidly patched in the next iOS or Mac software release. Other bugs languish for what feels like forever. Do Apple execs just not use AirPods? Are they using a different configuration or hardware combination that doesn’t have these bugs? Have they just trained themselves to overlook the bugs because the workarounds have become a reflex? I can’t imagine working at any tech company where one of the flagship products had such a high rate of annoyances without having a lot of engineers diverted to replicating, diagnosing, and fixing it ASAP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s weird to me how many people are like &#34;yeah but every other bluetooth is worse&#34;. I have Airpod Pros and experienced every one of these issues and many more on the regular with them, but my several years old now Bose QC 35II never have any of these problems, still last like 5 times as long on battery after years of recharge cycles, interact better with two simultaneously connected devices, have better signal range before dropping out, and I can control the damned volume without trying a dozen times to get Siri to wake the fuck up because airpods have no built-in volume controls and Siri&#39;s voice activation is worse than terrible.The Airpods are set to connect automatically to my macbook when I wear them AND THEY DON&#39;T. EVER. And then calls on my iPhone will stupidly decide to connect and route audio to airpods that I&#39;m not even wearing while they are just sitting on my desk when the phone was literally moments before using the handset speaker for a video. Know what bluetooth device does not have these problems? You guessed it, the one not made by Apple. Like...come on.I really want to like airpods, but they&#39;re just not good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a few more:- Airpods sometimes do not charge when in the case. Usually need to pull it out and put back in again.- Knowing what airpod(s) and case are charging. The UI on the phone, the open the case sliding window, the widgets, and the case light itself are not very useful.- Spatial audio working on some apps but you&#39;re not usually aware if it&#39;s on until you tilt an ear one way to confirm.- Out of ear detection sometimes doesn&#39;t work well and will drain the respective airpod.- No preference list of what devices should have precedence over others. Especially when working on 2+ devices.- Hand-off calls is a weird UX. Why would I answer a phone on my iPhone by default when it&#39;s clear I have airpods connected and being used?- The transparency / noise cancelling dance. Not sure if there&#39;s a preference, but it feels random which one is on by default. Always do a double check at the gym or when running as outside noise sounds loud.Still the best headphones and experience in my opinion and have enabled me to achieve a hell of a lot more because of them. Easily worth the price for how much I use them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It costs $10,000 USD to build one of these&gt; The ten thousandth one costs $15As a software engineer, I&#39;m used to being able to build essentially whatever I want, with the only cost being my time. I&#39;m often unpleasantly reminded that software is an outlier in that regard and as soon as physical items are concerned, especially hardware, it turns out that manufacturing even a simple thing is prohibitively expensive if it&#39;s done at a small scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nice. This is a simple, straightforward design, and a reasonably convenient form factor.Two biggest limitations are RAM and wireless interfaces, or rather lack thereof. This thing has less RAM than my router (admittedly a $70 box), and has neither WiFi nor BT. It does not seem to have many GPIO pins, too.With the amount of RAM installed, it&#39;s mostly a handheld terminal, and maybe a handheld console with emulators for old games.While this is admirable as a proof of concept, I suspect that moving the price point up to, say, $30 could give a much more useful and hacker-friendly device.I greatly appreciate the split keyboard and the replaceable NiMH batteries, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In China we buy second-hand Redmi 2 for 60RMB each (roughly $9.5). Can be bought in quantities. Fully functional with 2GB RAM+16GB eMMC, and battery, touchscreen, WiFi, Bluetooth, camera, and even 4G support. It&#39;s not built from scratch like this one, but if you are just looking for something cheap, then this price is insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have never understood people who mourn the death of the &#34;old&#34; internet because I do not feel I have lost it. Particular communities come and go, as they always have, but I have found that the I can find the same sorts of gathering places for the same kinds of people I always have - in about the same numbers too.The thing that has changed is that a huge swath of new people have come online and, though some of what brought them online is wider access to connectivity, a lot of what brought them online are new kinds of communities. They showed up for social media and most of them just aren&#39;t that interested in the things that made up the &#34;old&#34; internet.I put &#34;old&#34; in quotes because people have kept and maintained the parts they love. You can still play MUDs, you can still visit BBSes, people still run Hotline servers[1]! Many of these communities have changed because the world has changed: lots of people who played MUDs in 1990 have moved on to other online games, but lots have not! Critically - tools have continued to be developed. You can use IRCCloud (and be told it makes you a bad IRC&#39;er), you can play MUDs on your phone, etc. These communities have changed with the times and improved for it.My sense is that the absolute number of people who are involved in these communities has dropped, but not actually by that much? Maybe half as many people play MUDs now as they did at the peak - but it&#39;s a steady half. I think of it like the communities around vinyl or around film photography: less central than they once were, but healthy and vital.I am really glad that people who were not online at all during their peak are discovering these older forms. We have kept them for good reasons. But don&#39;t call it a comeback, they have been here for years.[1] https://hotline.fandom.com/wiki/Clients"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sure hope that&#39;s right. It was the best feeling in the world to stand up an Apache server on my Amiga, and later my little FreeBSD server, and see my friends viewing the website I was hosting on my dialup connection. It wasn&#39;t pretty, it wasn&#39;t elegant, and it certainly wasn&#39;t fast, but it was mine. I made that. From installing the server to writing the HTML, I owned that service from end to end and had completely freedom to do whatever I wanted with it.That&#39;s what I want the Internet to look like for my younger family and friends. It&#39;ll probably never happen exactly this way, but I can picture someone running an IPv6-only service on their phone to impress their friends. I know what their smile would look like because that was once my smile, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this article doesn&#39;t address the reason why people moved away from the &#34;old&#34; Internet --- most people only care about their _content_ not the particular technology that backs it.In the old times, you could only host content if you were really good with the technology. The people who had websites were people who knew how to set up and run a web server, and to compose the HTML content that was being served. Similarly, communities who ran BBS forums, mailing lists, IRC, etc. all needed at least some people who could set up and manage the technology for them.Centralized services (Web 2.0) changed that. Now all of a sudden you didn&#39;t need to run your server --- you could just type some text and click some buttons to put up a blog on a shared service (myspace? blogger? wordpress.com?). You didn&#39;t need to run your own forum or mailing list or chat rooms, you could just put your community on an existing service that provided that (Google groups, FB/Whatsapp/&lt;insert your IM&gt; Chat). Need a forum? You have reddit. What is Twitter if not just a collection of mailing lists that you can openly subscribe to but not post on? Centralization allowed the vast majority of people to do what they wanted to do while &#34;outsourcing&#34; the technology part to somebody else, because most people don&#39;t care about the technology they care about their content.The problem with the modern decentralized web (3.0?) is that we haven&#39;t focused on solving the real problem --- making it easy to manipulate _content_. If anything, setting up a Web 3.0 presence is _harder_ than it was on a centralized service, and as long as it remains harder, the new &#34;old&#34; Internet will always be a niche."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I feel like I&#39;m encountering more and more sites and articles where I can&#39;t seem to find the date.It seems to me that its become standard practice on marketing type blogs for corporate websites to remove the date from their posts. I think its because (from personal experience) the company will go though a burst of &#34;blog productivity&#34; create a load of content but then not touch it for years, they don&#39;t want that content to look out of date or their website to look stagnant.Removing the date from their posts, or any other content, hides how old it is and therefore obscures how active they are at crating new content.Most companies try to use their blogs to attract new customers, a new customer may visit their website once or twice and will never see the blog again, it&#39;s not important that they do. They don&#39;t want it to look stale.As a counter example, an interesting thread from yesterday [0] was about how CloudFlare use their blog not as a marketing tool but for technical content and attracting employees. They very regulally use their blog, and so keep the date on it showing how fresh it is.0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30070422"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: On of the best friends of my oldest daughter moved to a new rented flat recently. When I saw the address for a playdate, I recognised it and said to my daughter &#34;I think you went to a birthday party at this address when you were 3-5 years old when another of your friends must have lived here&#34;. To corroborate this, I looked up the calendar on my phone, where I&#39;m pretty organised about putting dates and locations of events. However, at that point I discovered that Google Calendar only keeps 2 years of history!So modern technology is literally erasing our pasts. Not just calendar entries, but messaging systems (people used to keep handwritten letters for decades), and possibly even photos (if we&#39;re not careful about preserving them).Edit: See my clarification of the 2 years in comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30084620 below. I still think the point remains - we do not own or value our digital data in the same way as physical objects, and there is a much heightened risk of that data disappearing as a result, either by the owners of the platforms the data is stored on archiving the data or by us not valuing it enough to preserve exports and backups through long periods of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s search quality has taken a serious nosedive in the last couple of years - the last 6 months in particular.I think they implemented some new form of search term widening which is far too strong, so the results you want are often buried among pages and pages of results for the general category of things that you searched for rather than close matches for your keywords. Combined with the recency bias that other people have talked about and you end up with a lot less useful search for precise searching.This coincides with a large increase in the number of surveys that my partner has been getting through the Google Rewards program that ask whether or not a recently used search term gave relevant results. Obviously that&#39;s just anecdotal, but it does feel like there are substantial changes in the algorithm, and not necessarily for the better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Many site owners find that the titles they carefully craft almost all get rewritten.Yeah, I&#39;m with Google on this one. I don&#39;t see many reasons why a site owner would spend extraordinary amounts of time to &#34;carefully craft&#34; page titles other than SEO and optimizing for clickbaitness. As a user, I&#39;m fine with Google counteracting this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google has a guide on this :)https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearanc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Takeaway: to dramatically decrease the chance of Google rewriting your title, matching the H1 to the title tag seems to be an effective strategy.Of course it should be mentioned this wont last if it becomes popular. Historically every time an SEO trick gets popular, the rules are adjusted. Even having this article on the front page of HN might be enough to see Google react by rethinking how (or whether) tags in titles affect the title rewrites."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a different conclusion. The article mentions that the car would have cost her 3 months of income. That doesn&#39;t sound too much and is roughly about the same what people pay for cars today, maybe even more.The reason she thought about the car as a luxury and not a necessity is that then the society wasn&#39;t dependent on cars like we do today. They travelled less, worked closer to home, milkman brought milk to home and grocery shopping could be done closer to home as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting that he compares everything that is hard to compare but ignores one thing that would be very easy - rental pricing. You had to pay it then and you have to pay it now.&#34;four bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and a “nice outlook on green.” The rent was £90 for a year.&#34;According to one CPI calculator (https://www.in2013dollars.com) &#34;£90 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £4,951.54 today&#34; and &#34;£700 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;.Google search also reveals that average yearly wage in London in 1920 was £205 and average wage in London in 2021 was £53,700 so £700 income in 1919 was 3.5 times the average which in 2021 would be £187,950 (quite a bit more than &#34;equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;).A quick web search for 4 bedroom apartment (not sure about sitting rooms) in London shows that rent is between £2,000 and £8,000 per month - let&#39;s say £5,000 for a nice one like what Christie&#39;s sounds like which is £60,000 per year.
They paid £90/£700 = 13% of their (3.5 the average) annual income for rent and now the equivalent rent would be £60,000/£187,950 = 32% of the 3.5 the average annual income.Even just comparing the plain average income, person in 1919 could rent the same apartment and still have £205 - £90 = £115 to live on for the year (which seems possible considering maid lived on £36 per year but in 2021 the average income leaves you £53,700 - £60,000 = £6,300 short on the rent alone.So ignoring the tvs, computers, holidays, cars, healthcare and all the things that we cannot compare and comparing what we can, it is obvious that just to live in 2021 we need more money that what we are making and so it is easy to see how most people feel that the living standards have gone down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly enough, I&#39;m typing this in Singapore, where in 2022 it&#39;s quite common to have a &#34;maid&#34; (helper/domestic worker, in the current local lingo), but no car.Singapore imports domestic workers for poor neighbouring countries like the Philippines and Myanmar, which keeps wages very low, on the order of US$450/month, not too far off Christie&#39;s inflation-adjusted US$220/month.  Even the fully loaded cost with government levies, insurance, food &amp; board etc is on the order of $1000/month, considerably cheaper than most other childcare options, particularly if like most Singaporeans both parents work longer hours.By comparison, Singapore strictly limits the number of cars on the road, auctioning permits called &#34;Certificates of Entitlement&#34; to the highest bidder and imposing around 100% taxes on the cars themselves.  As a result, a plain vanilla Toyota Corolla costs US$120,000 all in.  What&#39;s more, half of that is the COE cost, which is valid for only 10 years, meaning the value of the car depreciates by around $10,000 every year.  Add in petrol, servicing, parking etc, and having a live-in helper to run errands and drop off kids etc starts to look quite affordable in comparison."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing everyone is getting hung up on is the fact that Amazon isn&#39;t wholesaling the dongle. The contract isn&#39;t a wholesale deal, meaning if your widget doesn&#39;t sell, it&#39;s sitting on your balance sheet, not on Amazon&#39;s balance sheet. It would be like if Costco instead of buying 1000 legos, just stocked legos in it&#39;s warehouse, then paid Lego company everytime a single unit sold. 
Then they figured out how to make their own legos through a different supplier, they fixed the original Lego price $5 more expensive then the store brand legos. Now Legos sell for $30 a box and Kirkland Legos sell for $25 a box, same exact product, just a few bucks cheaper. Oh and lego couldn&#39;t drop the price from 30 to 20 to compete....That&#39;s what Amazon has done. Price fixing and control of the competitors inventory. Damn bastards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case others were as confused as i was about this&#34;While they’re often confused, Sold by Amazon and Fulfilled by Amazon are two different things.    With SBA, Amazon prices your products and owns any transactions that take place. When an item sells, they pass the proceeds on to you for allowing them to sell your product.

    With FBA, you price your products and own the transactions. It is a service where Amazon handles the order fulfillment process for your products.&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the author of esbuild. I think this is a very smart, practical choice and is one of the approaches that has the best chance of succeeding (the other being a semi-automated porting tool instead of a purely manual port). I&#39;m very excited to see someone take this approach. This is how I would do it if I were to do it. Web developers around the world are hoping this works out :)The hard part about this project isn&#39;t doing the port but keeping up with the constant changes from the TypeScript team, especially if the TypeScript team isn&#39;t invested in helping you out. Staying as close as possible to the source language like this will be a big win there.One of the big benefits of a native language like Go aside from lack of a JIT is the ability to easily add shared-memory parallelism. I haven&#39;t studied the TypeScript compiler internals so I&#39;m not sure how easy it is to parallelize their type checker. However, I assume that it would be relatively straightforward to parallelize the parsing of JavaScript files, so I&#39;d hope for at least be a big speedup there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when people try to make a new Ruby implementation. They get the basics down and think &#34;this isn&#39;t so bad! I can do this!&#34;. Fast forward a few months and they&#39;re stuck on some nasty little edge case around eval and method_missing that they need to run Rails. Or some weird aspect of C extensions.TypeScript&#39;s compiler is an unholy, unsound mess, because JavaScript is an unholy, unsound mess. Sure the basics of type checking structs and variables is somewhat easy. But what about conditional types? What about weird generic constraints? What about indexing types? There&#39;s some really confusing stuff going on underneath the hood.It&#39;s also a mess that *does not have a spec*. Even if you somehow manage to  make a type checker that implements most of the features, there&#39;s no way to ensure it has 1 to 1 parity with TypeScript. Plus that parity can be broken at any point.The only way I could see this happening is if the author somehow convinced Anders Hejlsberg or a significant portion of the TypeScript team to work on this new implementation. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s gonna happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; tsc depends on shared mutability and has a cyclical mutable reference.
 Rust is designed to prevent this behavior.
Having two references to the same data (shared mutability)
 is undefined behavior in Rust.This problem has numerous solutions in Rust - (A)Rc, RefCell etc. I don&#39;t understand how this caused the author of the article to stop considering Rust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something from the NYT mailing list yesterday:&gt; The Covid vaccines are remarkably effective at preventing serious illness. If you’re vaccinated, your chances of getting severely sick are extremely low. Even among people 65 and older, the combination of the vaccines’ effectiveness and the Omicron variant’s relative mildness means that Covid now appears to present less danger than a normal flu.&gt; For the unvaccinated, however, Covid is worse than any other common virus. It has killed more than 865,000 Americans, the vast majority unvaccinated. In the weeks before vaccines became widely available, Covid was the country’s No. 1 cause of death, above even cancer and heart disease.At this point if an adult in the US is unvaccinated it is (1) almost certainly by choice (there are some people who cannot get it for medical reasons but they make up only a very tiny fraction of the unvaccinated), and (2) it is very unlikely that any evidence or logical arguments will chance their minds.With COVID becoming endemic everyone is going to get antibodies, with the only choice being whether you get your first antibodies by vaccination or by getting COVID.The only question really then is how fast do we want the unvaccinated to do the getting antibodies by getting COVID thing. The faster they get it, the faster we can be as done with COVID as we are ever going to be.I&#39;d say the answer to that should be determined by the hospital capacity. If a region has sufficient hospital capacity that it would not be overwhelmed by the increase in COVID cases among the unvaccinated go ahead and lift most restrictions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The media&#39;s binary separation of populations into vax and unvax is a false dichotomy. More causal factors would be represented by:  1. Covid-recovered 
  2. Vaccinated
  3. Partly-vaccinated (&lt; 14 days after 2nd shot)
  4. Covid-naive + Unvaccinated

CDC reporting bundles #3 and #4.  UK reports all 4 categories separately.#1 was already a high percentage in 2021 and is now higher due to Omicron.Edit: CDC estimated pre-Omicron #1 as 146 million people (as of Oct 2021), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burd..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m vaccinated and boostered by my own choice. My problem with mandates is where does it end? Why this mandate and not other mandates? Who gets to decide that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a NVidia shareholder I&#39;m relieved at this.  ARM is clearly less valuable as part of NVidia with all the conflicts of interest that entails than as an independent company.  NVidia talked about synergies but they could pursue all of those with an architectural license for far less money.  It&#39;s actually something of a pattern that most mergers fail to provide synergy and destroy value, it&#39;s just that they enlarge the empire of the CEO and so seem attractive from that standpoint."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only two weeks ago SoftBank / Arm / Nvidia made a submission to the UK competition authorities with a singularly pessimistic view of Arm’s prospects as a stand-alone company [1]. I wonder if this was wise given the where the deal seems to be now.Whilst this is a bit overdone, it does highlight the challenges that Arm faces. If the Nvidia deal is dead - which seems likely - then floating clearly seems unlikely to offer the prospect of the return that SoftBank was expecting when it paid a premium for Arm.The key question from an Arm user / customer’s perspective seems to be ‘Can Arm as a stand-alone company finance the investment it meets to stay competitive?’[1] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61d81a458fa8f..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wrote a thread[0] on Pixel 3 (trying to convince Google to extend the support) a few months before it went EoL[3] (Oct &#39;21). Here&#39;s the important bits:- 10M+ Pixel 3 devices that were sold worldwide- 72% of Pixel 3&#39;s estimated lifecycle emissions are from its manufacturing[1]. Using your phone is _not the source of most of the emissions during a phone&#39;s lifecycle_.- It has gotten worse over time, but Google hasn&#39;t offered better guaranttes. Pixel 5&#39;s emissions-over-lifetime are 30% higher than that of Pixel 3.The alleged reason Google can&#39;t offer support beyond 3 years is because of Google&#39;s dependence on Qualcomm for the support[2]. Apparently Qualcomm asks for a ridiculous amount of money to support any chip beyond a measly 2-3 years. Apple gets away with it by building their own chips, and Pixel 6 is guaranteed to be supported for 5 years as a result.However, the fact that Google - one of the world&#39;s richest corporation can&#39;t convince or pay Qualcomm to support a perfectly functional device in 2022 is astonishing.[0]: https://twitter.com/captn3m0/status/1427908406086553601[1]: https://storage.googleapis.com/mannequin/sustainability/repo...[2]: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/the-fairphone-2-hits...[3]: https://endoflife.date/pixel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I had a Nexus 6P and after that experience I promised myself that I will never buy a Google hardware device ever again. The company has the wrong mentality regarding its handsets and how to take care of the customers who buy them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, Google needs really needs to do better.  Samsung has raised the bar by supporting its devices with 4 years of patches: https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-d....  And frankly, how hard/expensive would it be to support these devices for far longer? Google is a massive company, and I see little reason why that can&#39;t employ a team of devs backporting patches to older phones. Current versions of Windows and Linux run happily on decades-old hardware, so a phone should at least be able to get patches for known security issues for a decade.  Dev resources would be far better spent on this than yet another hamfisted attempt to build a messenger app that they&#39;ll kill in a couple years anyway."</p>

I&#39;ve only seen pictures of satellites being worked on so I expected something more human sized?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Destin of the Smarter Every Day YT channel had an interview a couple years ago with Dr. John Mather, the senior project scientist of the JWST, where he asked something like &#34;will you be nervous during the launch and deployments&#34;, and Dr. Mather replied &#34; I don&#39;t get anxious about stuff I can&#39;t deal with&#34;, and that they&#39;ve tested everything they thought of to test.I was super impressed with Dr. Mather, not only that he seemed so wise, but also that this super busy man took the time to do an hour long interview with a random You-Tuber. I think the JWST project is in good hands.Edit:
I guess Destin is not a &#39;random&#39; You-tuber, but someone that was well-placed to connect with Dr. Mather. Still, he&#39;s not CNN or BBC - he&#39;s a guy with a handheld camera that doesn&#39;t ask fluff question, but questions intended to help inform himself and his audience. Still think Dr. Mather thinking it was important to spend so much of his schedule with Destin was impressive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seeing Night Watch at the Rijksmuseum a decade or so ago totally changed my view of seeing things in a museum vs. seeing them online. I&#39;m a child of the internet and had this view that seeing it on my screen was good enough, but wow is Night Watch incredible up close and in person. Overwhelming, almost. A totally different experience.That said, this image is amazing, and lets you see a lot more detail than you can easily manage at the museum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me and the wife visited the RM in Nov 2019.  The painting is rather large, so 717 Giga pixels doesn&#39;t go as far as you would think but you get quite close to the textures that you would see close up.Whilst you are there, please note there is rather a lot more to see than the one picture.  The architecture is worth noting too.  My overriding impression of the piccies on display is: &#34;sumptuous&#34;.  That&#39;s probably not in the fine arts&#39;s lexicon of superlatives but my personal experience.The model boaty exhibition is not as jarring as it might sound, alongside some very serious artwork exhibitions and is great fun.  It doesn&#39;t seem to really belong there at first blush but I do understand that naval prowess is rather important to the Netherlander psyche, so perhaps that legitimises it.  It does give you a bit of relief after having rather a lot of important art thrown at you.All in all, I cannot recommend the Rijks&#39; highly enough.  If you go anywhere near the Low Countries, then slap it on your itinerary.  The coffee is quite reasonable in the entrance cafe, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently at some point in the past three pieces were removed from the sides of the painting.&gt; That’s why we’ve had so-called artificial neural networks working overtime on reconstructing the original appearance of the painting. Hour upon hour, the computers have been whirring away, recreating these missing pieces on the basis of a 17th-century copy.Interactive comparison of the missing pieces:https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/...Zoomable image with the missing pieces added back in:https://i.micr.io/jfYIf/en/nw-met-missende-stukken-clean"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The malware is a cherry on top, but the story before that is pretty awful already, and unfortunately seems to be representative of specialized software like that: proprietary (with constant risk of malware, indeed), awkward, poorly (if at all) documented, likely the protocols to speak to the hardware without it are kept in secret, and occasional shipment of Windows machines where just software would do (but probably it&#39;s written to just barely work on a given system, and won&#39;t run on others easily).I think the main and annoying problem is those general practices, not just a single instance of malware.Edit: Apparently some focus on the &#34;Chinese&#34; part, but I suspect that hardware being specialized and software being shipped by the hardware manufacturer are larger factors here: at least all the awkwardness before the malware part I&#39;ve observed to be approximately similar with hardware+software produced by Chinese, European, and US companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given that Windows 7 _Ultimate_ was installed on what is essentially an OEM machine, it&#39;s very likely that it&#39;s a pirated copy with a &#34;home brewed&#34; license key.I think the most reasonable explanation is that either the OS was sourced already infected, or the crack tool they used was infected."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The story here is not the fact of the malware - it is the purpose of the malware: industrial espionage. China is well-known in industry for its sheer volume and brazenness of industrial espionage. A pick-and-place machine is especially well placed for this since it will, by necessity, have access to PCB designs and BOMs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m good at working on a team and looping in others. I also find it to be one of the most exhausting parts of software development. It&#39;s so difficult to constantly need to get feedback and buy-in from other people, and takes away a lot of the creativity and joy in programming (for me).Which isn&#39;t to say you shouldn&#39;t do it, just that it&#39;s one of the things that makes me dislike working on a team. I actually think this may be one of the factors in burnout for a lot of developers. Writing code as a team is almost like writing a novel with a few dozen other people, all of which have differing ideas on how the book should be written, or even what it should be about. It&#39;s hard to feel the joy in creating something when you&#39;re only a small cog in the development machine, and every decision needs a dozen voices of input.It&#39;s disempowering to feel like you&#39;re never able to make a decision yourself, despite supposedly being hired for your expertise in the field.&gt; Always encourage engineers to show their work as quickly as possible – an engineer on a project should never go more than a week without showing something, and usually it should be more like a day.&#34;usually it should be more like a day&#34; is bad advice in my opinion, and a likely source of micro management. Let professionals do their work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;the biggest mistake I see engineers make is doing too much work on their own before looping in others&#34;&gt; &#34;For more senior engineers, it can happen because they like to work on their own and may be overconfident in finding solutions.  It can also happen if the team culture is toxic and engineers fear getting criticism early in the design process.&#34;Not saying the above statement is incorrect but here is an alternative explanation that is also viable: Senior Engineers are often hired into large large projects so that the company has the capability to address emergencies or modify the existing system accurately as it is often more difficult to work on a large complex code base than to build a new one from scratch. Those engineers sometimes never get to work on greenfield projects and &#34;doing too much work on their own before looping in others&#34; is a way to scratch this itch without the opportunity being taken away prematurely. It also offers chance to produce memorable work as nobody remembers the set of 3 point tasks you completed ten sprints ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At least two things happened here:- The pandemic gave most people an unusually-long period of time at home to help them realize all the things they could have been doing (e.g. spending more time with family, not being stuck in a commute), if only their work had not been sucking up all their time and energy.- Income vs. expenses changed to the point where people couldn’t hope to pay off their debts even if they worked.  Work has not been paying anywhere near enough.  At that point, what is there to lose: if you will be swamped and in debt with work, and you will also be swamped and in debt without work, at least the 2nd option means finally not having to put up with the crap from many workplaces.Also, it has just become clearer and clearer where all the lies were told.  Society did not treat “essential” workers that way at all.  There was all kinds of prioritization of bottom line over employee health, especially early on.  We all assumed that governments could/would do a lot more to help.  Heap on all the unfilled promises for promotions, raises, etc. and many workers just have no reason at all to give a crap anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is the central bank inflation target typically 2%?Well if you target 0% and any actual result below 0% happens, that&#39;s deflation which is a disaster for economies.If inflation is say 10%. Maximum employment is near certainly impossible. Debt will be expensive and the economy crawls to a halt. Who wants to pay 10% interest on their student debt?So where in between do you have a good price stability? It tends to be around 2%. It allows for error in measurement, it provides safe cushion.The USA is at 7% inflation. This means the central bank is not doing their job. They by mandate should have drastically increased interest rates. Inflation almost certainly is out of control now. Looking at central bank balance sheets that are very far from balance, and looking at money supply M2. There&#39;s a solid 40% inflation coming. Lets say it sticks to 7%, this inflation will last probably 4 years.When inflation is so high and interest rates are not. The people winning are those in debt. Which is the government and youngins. However, it also means you cant save money. You must spend money as soon as possible. Tourism is dead for many years.Flipside, what does this also do? It pressures salaries. You are making 7% less this year but you&#39;re making 115% less the next year. So anyone in demand will be in demand and be able to buck the inflation curve.The people most hurt by high inflation are those who just retired. They no longer can demand more $ for their productivity. Their &#39;safe&#39; investments are way below inflation. They don&#39;t realize yet they cant afford to be retired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Great Renegotiation is also a byproduct of inflation. Workers are seeking better pay to keep up with the rising cost of living.Keeping in mind small business is collectively the largest employer and contributor to US output... let&#39;s remember the coming rate hikes will greatly reduce available cash to small businesses that operate with credit lines, credit card debt or via home equity lines. That is a LOT of US businesses. Now add to this increased input costs due to inflation. Now add increased tax rates. You can also expect lending requirements will tighten.So, it&#39;s worth considering the odds of worker prosperity (vs) the odds of a wave of business failures and associated unemployment/underemployment in many (but by no means all) sectors.Personally, I think the Fed &amp; Treasury will continue fiscal stimulus and capitulate hard in the face of a deep recession. More of the same can kicking, and we&#39;ll see what seems like prosperity. In reality, it&#39;s a delay of an inevitable downturn unless some magical productivity innovation or goods/services advance emerges to rescue the US economy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes. In the EU product &#34;denatured alcohol&#34; for most purposes is likewise treated with the same agent. This replaces the widespread use of methanol and similar products which are poisonous (yes even if you call the product &#34;meths&#34; it probably isn&#39;t methanol in the EU today). The rationale is that poisoning people is not an appropriate reaction to attempted tax avoidance. Alcohol is only &#34;denatured&#34; because booze is taxed, there&#39;s no technical reason to use poison, and so the EU took the poison out, for the same reason it doesn&#39;t execute or torture criminals."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I had Covid in December, I briefly lost my sense of smell and taste (only for a few days, thankfully). I decided I would see if the Switch cartridges tasted as bad as I remembered - purely in the interests of science, of course.I couldn&#39;t taste it at first, but then the wave of toxic unpleasantness slowly built up, even after I had moved the cartridge away from my tongue. It was different than I remembered it being, but then again it had been a few years since I tried it (probably spurred by this same headline). Really horrible. Good to know that this bitterant it still is a deterrent if you have anosmia!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah the old cloud provider switcheroo. Yip this is the way they make money. They make it easy to setup some gigantic hugely scalable website then hit you with a gigantic scaled up bill. AWS would do this as well.Team I&#39;m in at the moment is in the early stages of cloud adoption but the company in total has fell hook line and sinker for AWS. When I mentioned the cost there is always an excuse.The main one being that you don&#39;t have to hire sysadmins anymore as that&#39;s taken care now by AWS. Ah yes but they have actually been replaced with a &#34;DevOps&#34; team plus just our department now spend &gt; £1 million per year to AWS in hosting costs. A 20% reduction in those fees could pay for a few sysadmin(s).The next one is that no other vendor would be able to supply the kit. You know StackOverflow is able to run on a single webserver (https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-ar...). Plus many of the other providers have loads of instances available.I mean I&#39;m not against cloud it&#39;s just not the cheapest option if you choose one of the big 3 providers. I use a company called scaleway (https://www.scaleway.com/en/) they have all the essential cloud services you need and everything else you can run yourself in docker or k8s."</p>

I had a large file with sequences of 9 digit numbers specific to our use-case, all tied to names of people (employees). Whelp, at one point the tool I was working on stopped working, and it was flagged as apparently containing social security numbers (which I suppose matched the character length).Whelp, on the admin panel, you can get a report of those files, and then mark it as a false positive. Which I did. But then nothing happened, and nothing changed. It was no use.The hilarious bit: It did, of course, allow me to make a copy of the file in question, and then just point the resource I was building to the new file, which was exactly the same. Weeks later... so far, so good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Nix and NixOS for a while and I&#39;ve seen four core advantages:1. Nix store: what the article covers: multiple versions of the same package, &#34;virtualenv for everything&#34;... etc2. Reproducibility: because package definitions are self-contained, I can pin and reliably reproduce everything for my packages. And I do mean everything.3. Flexibility: Nix works for system packages on NixOS as well as user packages on any Linux or macOS. I&#39;ve been sharing like 70% of my system config between Linux and macOS, and I don&#39;t know of any other tool that can do that.4. Programmability: package definitions and config are extensible and composable. Yes, learning an ad hoc language to do this is a pain, but once I learned it I got a higher-level and better-abstracted way to define and combine packages than any other tool I&#39;ve used. It&#39;s like going from C to OCaml. At this point I&#39;ve started hating Dockerfiles because they can&#39;t easily be composed and don&#39;t provide any real facilities for abstraction.Ultimately, Nix took system management from feeling like an operational activity—maintaining and changing a bunch of mutable state to run the system—to declarative programming. Learning curve aside, making system management a reproducible programming activity with no system state to worry about has been a massive improvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried using NixOS on a laptop for a month and switched back to Arch a couple of months ago. It was an interesting experience - I never used functional programming language before, but nix was pretty ok as a configuration language. It looks like funny version of JSON with functions.Debugging it was a real pain though - I was trying to write (or copy from someone else config) a function to recursively import all modules from a folder and the error messages were hard to understand with stacktraces ending somewhere deep in standard library.The other problem was with nixpkgs, i.e. I haven&#39;t found a clear list of packages that were going to be updated. Jetbrains IDEA was updating very slowly and when I wanted to pin a version of it simply overriding version variable in the overlay was not enough - there were also some other linked variables. Emacs package from custom overlay constantly tried to compile itself, requiring me to check build status on hydra build system.In the end I decided that it&#39;s not really worth it. I don&#39;t have many systems and services to manage and for a raspberry pi and a vps multiple docker-compose.yaml files in git repo is enough. 
I think Henrik Lissner (author of Doom Emacs) wrote a really good piece about why someone should choose to use NixOS - https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles#frequently-asked-questi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;&#34;&#34;The first is relatively simple: they developed their own programming language to do configuration, which is not very good and is extremely difficult to learn. The vast majority of people using NixOS do not understand the language, and simply copy/paste example configurations, which mostly works until you need to do something complicated, at which point you&#39;re completely high and dry.&#34;&#34;&#34;Maybe this is nitpicking, but: the Nix language is about as straightforward as &#34;JSON plus functions&#34;. Maybe that is difficult for people who haven&#39;t had an experience with pure/functional programming?Though, yes, the way Nix is used can be quite complicated/sophisticated. -- Even if all of Nixpkgs were translated to JavaScript, I think it&#39;d still be complicated to understand. (Though I suspect using a more general purpose language would allow for more footguns).+1 to the sentiment that most of the time you can get by just fine, but when you can&#39;t, NixOS is more difficult to make progress with compared to other Linux distributions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like it, it&#39;s readable, unlike some SQL alternatives I&#39;ve seen it doesn&#39;t make me feel like I&#39;m dumb and don&#39;t understand what a query even is.I can&#39;t decide if it would be better or worse if it stuck more closely to SQL keywords. You use &#34;from&#34; and &#34;select&#34;, but not &#34;where&#34;, &#34;order by&#34;, &#34;group by&#34;. There&#39;s some danger of it being in an uncanny valley of SQLish, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d prefer just using those terms verbatim (including the space in &#34;order by&#34;... that style is less common in modern languages but it&#39;s not really that much harder to parse).I&#39;d like to see more examples of joins and composing SQL. Does this language make it easier to make more general SQL queries? Can I take two queries and squash them together in a reliable way? I feel like I end up with a lot of theme and variation in my queries, often involving optional filters.I might even like a notion of encapsulation that could help this query language when it&#39;s embedded in other languages. Like if I could say, in the language itself, that a query has certain unbound variables (and not just ? or other placeholders). This language seems like it would be better for generating than SQL, and sometimes generation is just necessary (like in any application that supports data exploration), but for most common cases I&#39;d hope to avoid that. Defining inputs and then making whole filter sections or other statements conditional on those inputs would help here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the flow direction compared to standard SQL.  SQL is supposed to read like a sentence I suppose but I have many times looked at it and really wanted things to be in a more logical order.My main suggestion would be to be a bit less terse and introduce a bit more firm formatting.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of the term &#34;split&#34; and feel like jazzing that up to &#34;split over&#34; or even just reviving &#34;group by&#34; would improve readability.  Additionally the aliasing could use work, I&#39;d suggest reversing the assignment to be something closer to `use salary + payroll_tax as gross salary`.  In terms of firm formatting, unless I&#39;m missing something there isn&#39;t any reason to allow a filter statement before any aliases - so you can force two fixed positions for filter clauses which would make it always legal to reference aliases in filters.On the brief topic of form vs. flexibility.  SQL is a thing that, when complex, is written by many people over the course of its lifetime - removing the ability to make bad decisions is better than enabling the ability to write simple things even simpler - those silly do nothing queries like &#34;SELECT * FROM customer WHERE deleted=&#39;f&#39;` are written once[1] in a moments time and never inspected again.  The complex queries are what you want to optimize for.1. If they even are - with ORMs available a lot of those dead simple queries just end up being done through an ORM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now this is actually nice, unlike the other suggestion posted today[1].Maybe I&#39;m just too used to non-standard extensions of our database but the SQL example could, at least for our db, be rewritten as    SELECT TOP 20

        AVG(salary) AS average_salary,

    ) emp
    WHERE gross_cost &gt; 0
    GROUP BY title, country
    ORDER BY sum_gross_cost

This cuts down the repetition a lot, and can also help the optimizer in certain cases. Could do another nesting to get rid of the HAVING if needed.Still, think the PRQL looks very nice, especially with a &#34;let&#34; keyword as mentioned in another thread here.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30053860"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"His claims about HN are false. Short version: his post was 2+ hours later than Stripe&#39;s, not an hour earlier, and fell in rank because users flagged it, not because moderators did anything (which I suppose is what his mafia/mob language was intended to imply).The longer version is going to involve a tedious barrage of links, but I want this to be something that people can check for themselves if they care to.Quoting from https://twitter.com/theryanking/status/1485784877060349953 and https://twitter.com/theryanking/status/1485784882173255680:&gt; Both had organically made it up to #1 on Hacker News with 100s of upvotesTheir first post, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16215092, made it to #2 (http://hnrankings.info/16215092/) and got 171 upvotes. The second, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16870692, made it to #4 (http://hnrankings.info/16870692/) and got 70 upvotes.&gt; On April 18, 2018, we posted this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16870692 [...] An ~hour later, this showed up: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16869290. Ours disappeared.Stripe&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16869290) was submitted at 17:41 UTC, and Bolt&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16870692) was submitted over 2 hours later, at 20:08 UTC. If you want external evidence for that, look at the hnrankings.info pages for the two posts (Stripe: http://hnrankings.info/16869290/, Bolt: http://hnrankings.info/16870692/). You&#39;ll see that they first pick up Stripe&#39;s post on the front page at 17:45 and Bolt&#39;s at 20:30. You&#39;ll also see that Stripe&#39;s post made it to #2, not #1 as he claims.Here&#39;s the HN front page at 19:09 that day: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418190904/https://news.ycom.... Stripe&#39;s post is already at #2. Bolt&#39;s hasn&#39;t been submitted yet. The first snapshot with Bolt on the front page is at 20:35: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418203508/https://news.ycom.... By 21:21, Bolt&#39;s briefly makes it higher than Stripe&#39;s: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418212112/https://news.ycom....&gt; Ours disappearedBolt&#39;s post fell in rank because it was flagged by users—that is the drop you can see in http://hnrankings.info/16870692/ and in this snapshot by 21:21: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418222105/https://news.ycom....I don&#39;t know why users flagged it. (Edit: generally, though, if you want to figure this out, the best place to look is in the comments. The top subthread in the Bolt thread is users complaining about non-transparent, enterprise-style pricing, which is a classic HN complaint. The same complaints had appeared in their earlier thread, for example https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16215604 and
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16215578. We actually downweighted both of those complaints. That&#39;s standard HN moderation when indignant comments are stuck at the top of a thread.)None of the flags came from YC founders or staff. (Edit: I looked into whether it might have been Stripe people doing the flagging here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30070445.) HN moderators did not make the post fall in rank, or moderate the post at all. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever heard of Bolt before today.The article no longer exists on bolt.com, but if you want to compare it to
the stripe.com article, the articles are here:https://web.archive.org/web/20180418201841/https://blog.bolt...https://web.archive.org/web/20180418171628/https://stripe.co...His insinuations about HN are false too. He&#39;s clearly insinuating that we use insider powers to favor stripe.com submissions with special treatment on HN. That&#39;s precisely what we don&#39;t do.Stripe succeeded on HN because they were favored by the community for many years. They are one of a small number of startups who have reached what you could call &#39;community darling&#39; status on HN. It&#39;s true that this is incredibly hard to do. Another startup that managed it, around the same time, was Cloudflare (not a YC startup). Startups achieve this by doing three things: producing products that the community considers good, producing articles that the community finds interesting, and mastering the art of interacting with the community. You need all three.I wish more startups would achieve this, YC or not. Whenever I run across one that&#39;s trying to succeed on HN, I try to help them do so (YC or not)—why? because it makes HN better if the community finds things it loves here. Among the startups of today, I can think of only two offhand who are showing signs of maybe reaching darling status—fly.io (YC), and Tailscale (not YC).All 4 of the startups I&#39;ve mentioned have the advantage that they were|are targeting programmers, which gives them a cultural fast track to developing rapport with this community—sort of a ladder in the snakes-and-ladders game. However, that&#39;s not a sufficient condition for getting a satisfying click with the community, and it isn&#39;t a necessary one either. The real problem is that so much of the content that startups produce to try to interest this community just isn&#39;t interesting enough (to this community), and often it gives off inadvertent signals of being uninteresting—things like seeming too enterprisey, or too slick in the marketing department.If the bolt.com people had asked us for help, I would have been just as happy to help them as anybody else. I would have told them that the opening of their article (https://web.archive.org/web/20180418201841/https://blog.bolt...) was too enterprisey to appeal to HN. The language is drawn from ecommerce retailing, which makes sense given the little bit we&#39;ve all learned about Bolt today, but is the kind of thing that comes across as boring on HN. The references to Gartner and Experian feel like reading an enterprise whitepaper, which actually detracts from credibility with the HN audience.This is the sort of thing I&#39;ve told countless startups over the years. It&#39;s dismayingly difficult to express this information in a way that people can actually absorb, but I have a set of notes that I&#39;ve sent to many startups in this position, which I plan to turn into an essay about how to write for HN. if anyone wants a copy, email hn@ycombinator.com and I&#39;ll be happy to send it to you.I had a bunch of other things I wanted to say here, but mercifully, I&#39;ve forgotten them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think if you get over the drama here and implied &#34;dirtiness&#34;, the main result is still a bit interesting.Even if you exclude the implied carteling and take everything he said with a grain of salt, the outcomes of this incentive structure are clear: once SV (i.e. the YC centered VC machine) gets into a space and has a main horse, SV can no longer incubate new innovation/competition in the space. It can also very likely become predatory to the potential innovators that SV is supposed to support.At a more macro scale, this means that YC will fade in the same way as everything else does because it won&#39;t be able to entertain a wave of innovators, and they will, as he did, seek and build the next SV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Public fights can occasionally be net positive for one of the participants, but your arguments will be publicly scrutinized and they better be watertight. If the logic you presented is your best work, then I can easily see why you&#39;ve experienced some trouble in getting people to support you.Let&#39;s start with the very first argument you presented: getting rejected by YC is a clear proof of collusion.Getting rejected by YC happens to tens of thousands of applicants each batch. Your chances of getting accepted increase disproportionally if you can show progress since the rejection. To react the way you did is a contrarian move. And it kind of fits the pattern - to publicly insult every VC on Stripe&#39;s cap table is also a contrarian move. Not to mention that you also made it clear to all your future potential talent that there&#39;s this thing about you not being liked by the VC community in Silicon Valley.I will skip all the little jumps to conclusions that you also presented throughout your thread, and will instead focus on the big picture here. The whole time I was reading your thread, I was waiting for the triumphant finish (eg: today we&#39;re announcing that we stole Stripe&#39;s biggest customer). Instead, all I heard was that Stripe is unbeatable, which sounded quite depressing from your company&#39;s point of view. I wonder how this will make future fundraising or deal closing any easier. Another contrarian move.I am not in a position to criticize you because clearly you&#39;ve gotten very far and something that you&#39;re doing must be working. But whatever it is, it&#39;s super contrarian. So rather than presenting the Stripe-Bolt competition in the light of a mobster movie, I think a Rambo analogy would be more appropriate - a traumatized but highly skilled fighter declaring war on everyone and their grandmother."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny enough, I decided to play with FreeBSD for personal projects in 2020. I gave up and I am reverting all my servers to Linux in 2022, for the opposite of the reasons mentioned in this article.* Lack of systemd. Managing services through shell scripts is outdated to me. It feels very hacky, there is no way to specify dependencies, and auto-restarts in case of crashes. Many FreeBSD devs praise launchd, well... systemd is a clone of launchd.* FreeBSD jail are sub-optimal compared to systemd-nspawn. There are tons of tools to create freebsd jails (manually, ezjail, bastillebsd, etc…) half of them are deprecated. At the end all of your jails end up on the same loopback interface, making it hard to firewall. I couldn&#39;t find a way to have one network interface per jail. With Linux, debootstrap + machinectl and you&#39;re good to go.* Lack of security modules (such as SELinux) -- Edit: I should have written &#34;Lack of good security module&#34;* nftables is way easier to grasp than pf, and as fast as pf, and has atomic reloads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reasons are, for a large part, not on the technical side. I was surprised, because this this a lot of work for little visible gain. Here are the reasons, slightly abbreviated:&gt; The whole system is managed by the same teamMostly philosophical.&gt; FreeBSD development is less driven by commercial interests.Mostly philosophical.&gt; Linux has Docker but FreeBSD has jails!IMO, this comparison is a mistake. In the Linux world, systemd&#39;s nspawn is very similar to Jails. It&#39;s a glorified chroot, with security and resource management. All the systemd tools work seemlessly with nspawn machines (e.g. `systemctl status`). Containers à la Docker are a different thing.BTW, I thought the last sentence about security issues with Docker images was strange. If you care about unmaintained images, build them yourself. On the other side, the FreeBSD official documentation about Jails has a big warning that starts with &#34;Important: the official Jails are a powerful tool, but they are not a security panacea.&#34;&gt; Linux has no official support for zfs and suchFair point, though I&#39;ve heard about production systems with zfs on Linux.&gt; The FreeBSD boot procedure is better than grub.YMMV&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s network is more performant.Is there some conclusive recent benchmark about this. The post uses a 2014 post about ipv6 at Facebook, which I think is far from definitive today. Especially more since it &#34;forgot&#34; to mention that Facebook intended to enhance the &#34;Linux kernel network stack to rival or exceed that of FreeBSD.&#34; Did they succeed over these 8 years ?&gt; Straightforward system performance analysisThe point is not about the quality of the tools, but the way each distribution packages them. Seems very very low impact to me.&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s Bhyve against Linux&#39;s KVMThe author reluctantly admits that KVM is more mature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Some time ago we started a complex, continuous and not always linear operation, that is to migrate, where possible, most of the servers (ours and of our customers) from Linux to FreeBSD.&#34;I don&#39;t really disagree with any of the stated reasons, but I also didn&#39;t see a reason that would make me even consider making the move with our servers, or even bother with some small number of servers. At least for me, I&#39;d need a bunch of REALLY GOOD reasons to consider a move like that. A huge cost savings AND some huge time savings in the future might do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GitHub Actions with act to test stuff locally is actually pretty usable. We use on-prem k8s-hosted runners to get access to servers/clusters with limited internet access, works great.But as always with “”gitops”” themed tools I think it’s pretty awkward to handle rollbacks. Either you take the stance that master is the source of truth and let the CI/CD tooling revert commits if deployment fails, or you store that state elsewhere and allow e.g manifests to diverge from git.I would be curious to hear how other people do it"</p>

I&#39;m not gonna indent&#34;)- still no support for datetime as a first class citizen- strings usually don&#39;t need quotes, until they do (I prefer to always quote)Note that two of the above points are about allowing inconsistent styles, which is a thing I hate.Love:- it supports comments whereas JSON does not. If the IETF ever officially updated JSON to support C-style inline (and maybe block) comments, I would absolutely ditch YAML."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once upon a time I worked at Google.I returned to Austin to visit old friends and took the opportunity to visit the Google office there. The Googlers sitting around me were primarily corporate sales.They weren&#39;t getting any corporate sales calls at all as far as I could tell, but there was one extremely irate user who was locked out of their GMail account and was repeatedly calling them because they were the only human beings at Google the user was able to get in touch with, via something like &#34;Press 3 for Corporate Sales.&#34; Of course these poor Google corporate sales people had absolutely no way to help this user even if they wanted to. Google literally did not have any GMail account phone support (at least at the time).I could hear the poor guy screaming through their headsets about how he paid Google something for some service and was entitled to phone support and he demanded someone help him, but they just kept saying, &#34;This is corporate sales. We do not offer consumer account support. If you want support, please visit the Google Support Forums at www dot...&#34;After they hung up on him 3 or 4 times, eventually a manager got on the phone and told him (between his screams), &#34;Look, you&#39;re not getting any phone support because it doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s nowhere for us to transfer you. There&#39;s nobody who can call you back about this. Your only option is to search the forums for an answer to your problem. I am going to terminate this call now. Sir, I&#39;m going to terminate this call. No, we can&#39;t help you. Nobody at Google can help you. I am terminating this call now. We asked you to stop calling this number. Do not call us again. &lt;click&gt;&#34;I&#39;d frequently tell my co-workers, &#34;If you&#39;re not paying for it, you&#39;re the product.&#34; That experience underscored that notion for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They also do this thing now where they block [1] smaller browsers (even ones using the latest version of chromium) under the guise of security. According to their docs they&#39;re fighting MITMs by generally disallowing any browser they can&#39;t identify (so the big few).If you&#39;re not on a whitelisted browser by Google, you can&#39;t log in (effectively, use) any of their properties.This feels very anti-competitive to me. Notably all the whitelisted browsers are either theirs (Chrome) or sell them their search traffic. I&#39;m building a browser for research [2]  and have to frequently find workarounds. I&#39;m not quite sure who I&#39;d contact to get on said whitelist either...[1] https://imgur.com/a/DASVkhl (here is the issue in the Vim browser and Min browser)[2] https://synth.app"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had this. It was telling me to try again &#39;later&#39;. Ok, i did &#39;try later&#39; every day for three weeks, and they didn&#39;t let me in. Using the very same IP address as I used to always access it, no less.Then, I gave up, moved all my services to another email account, and after 2 or 3 months tried logging in, and it suddenly allowed me to log in.Needless to say, I will never again use gmail for critically important things."</p>

They also have usable solutions for auth and storage, which like, if you&#39;re thinking of writing something like this are the first things you&#39;d start reaching for. They also work hard to enable you to run all your own services, so you don&#39;t rely on the Charm cloud for everything.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"TUIs over ssh/telnet can be a lot of fun. Especially in cases where multiple people can interact with each other on the server. It simplifies the programming model as you only have one state on the backend that you render to multiple connections. Syncing up everyone becomes trivial. You can also use some React concepts, like rendering a virtual TUI and sending just the right set of minimal escape sequences back to the user to bring their display up to date.A few months ago I implemented a telnet chat server[0] for fun and it was surprisingly easy to do so. Even by using a wasm vm that I was still working on at the same time.[0]: https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/chat"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked for a large e-commerce company.  I wanted to investigate putting all our support data into Watson and see what sort of recommendations it could provide, maybe a sort of auto-suggestion to help our customers.  Three really funny points stand out from the experience:1) To apply for Watson access you needed to show C-level approval, so our CEO put his name and phone number on the application (trying Watson was somewhat his idea).  A few months later, an IBM marketing team called HIS CELL and asked for ME.  Imagine how it felt to have the CEO walk up to me, deadpan hand me his personal iphone and say &#34;It&#39;s for you.&#34;..2) They told me they&#39;d help me with the support data idea, and every meeting we set up they tried to pitch &#34;what if we put Watson on all of your customer&#39;s storefronts, we could add a &#39;powered by watson&#39; banner on every page, and you give us a cut of GMV?&#34;.  I pivoted them to our plugin framework and told them to build it themselves.3) To demo the technology, the first step was to buy a $250k server from IBM.  To demo it.Big LOLs all around, never trust big blue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at IBM Watson as one of the early engineers when they first started commercializing the product. It was a fucking joke - Ginni Rometty would go up on stage and said that Watson can help diagnose cancer from CT scans and we would just look at each other and be like &#34;Dude, Watson is just a glorified Lucene index, wtf is she talking about.&#34; They started selling Watson as the end-all for everything from cancer diagnosis to customer service chat - they even had a stupid Watson Chef thing at SXSW one year - but none of that used the original Watson codebase - it was all built from the ground up and lots of it was just simple logistic regression"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone doing a CS degree now, I seem to be the only one who doesn&#39;t want to have anything on my resume to do with &#34;AI&#34;, blockchain, ML, NFT, chatbots, etc... all I see is overhyped product after product, one-size-fits all solutions that frustrate customers and create problems for humans to clean up, hugely valued companies that have very little real improvement over conventional technology, etc.An &#34;AI chatbot&#34; is far inferior to a real user interface. A real user interface allows discoverability (looking through menus to notice functions that may be useful later), experimentation, and puts the user in control of the program.For example, my bank apparently only supports viewing the reason for card declines through the chatbot--something I never knew, because I took the time to go through the menus when I first got the app and learn what functions existed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m more interested how he managed to master the knowledge of chip manufacturing plus a ton of electronics repairs (see his microscope and other equipment) at such an early age. Very admirable.Look at what he did:&gt; Photolithography machines are expensive—up to $150 million—and so Zeloof made his own by bolting a modified conference room projector bought on Amazon onto a microscope. It projects his designs at tiny scale onto silicon wafers that Zeloof coats in material sensitive to ultraviolet light.&gt; One of Zeloof’s best finds was a broken electron microscope that cost $250,000 in the early ’90s; he bought it for $1,000 and repaired it. He uses it to inspect his chips for flaws, as well as the nanostructures on butterfly wings.Damn this guy is good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing!&#34;Zeloof says he doesn’t know for sure what he wants to do after graduating this spring&#34; - I hope we don&#39;t hear later that he went to work for FAANG. One the saddest things about Big Tech is how they take young talent away from innovative, potentially competing enterprises and into busy work internal projects just because they can."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since most people don&#39;t seem to be aware: you can use Wordpress as a mostly-static website generator.Use WP Super Cache, and most of your pages are static anyway. A small PHP stub will be hit still, but if you don&#39;t even want that, you can just serve the generated static pages without it.It&#39;s well documented, you just edit your httpd.conf/.htaccess or your nginx config to serve the static files generated by the plugins.Only logged-in users (in most personal Wordpress installations: &#34;just me&#34;) or recent commenters, depending on configuration, hit any PHP code at all.Oh, and commenting works, unless with SSGs out of the box.Keep the number of plugins small, use a static plugin and security is mostly a non-issue for a personal weblog (it&#39;s different for a &#34;real&#34; media operation with all kinds of complicated workflows, of course)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s clear that the fewer plugins one installs (ideally none) the better, though it&#39;s difficult to follow this rule in practice. I recently had to set up a WP website from scratch, and plugins are a very common way for people to solve their problems (especially non-technical users). Plugins are even used for basic ops work like rewrite rules, backups, log parsing, caching—and I get it, for most people if they didn&#39;t exist they wouldn&#39;t have done the ops stuff, or solve many of the other types of problems, so it&#39;s kind of a blessing and a curse given your attack surface increases with each plugin and WP feature. I&#39;ve learned that Wordpress really is what you make of it, directly proportional to the engineering effort you put in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This idea really resonates with me. I started out life pretty poor, and am fortunate enough now to be able to purchase most anything I want. What I no longer have however, is time. I found myself purchasing things I want to have time for, but in all reality don&#39;t. Thinking about the second cost before hitting that buy button may be a good way for me to stop cluttering my life up with stuff I don&#39;t need, and the associated stress of knowing it&#39;s sitting there waiting to eat up time I don&#39;t have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually tend to see anything I buy as a black hole that will suck more money into it.A good example is when you get a bicycle, you do the equation and realize that within two years you will have saved in on the cost of public transportation. But it&#39;s when you start using it you realize that suddenly you always end up sweaty arriving to work so you need to buy good ventilated outdoor clothes and then a little bit later the winter arrives and you realize you need the same type of winter clothes, and then your first tier brakes and you realize you don&#39;t have any tools, so not only do you need to buy a new tier but also the tools. And here the initial smart calculation has fallen apart long time ago.Don&#39;t get me wrong. There&#39;s a lot of benefits riding a bike to work so it may still be very much worth it. But once you have this realization you can apply the same logic to anything you buy or thinking of buying which may helps prioritizing because there&#39;s just so many black holes you can have in your life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes sense for some things, but the examples the author uses don&#39;t make sense to me.Take the Moby Dick example... the author says you don&#39;t get the return on it until you have paid the 16 hour price of reading it... but isn&#39;t those sixteen hours the actual reward? You don&#39;t read a book to be finished with it, you read it because you like the reading process. The reward starts the first minute you start reading the book.Not only that, but you don&#39;t have to finish the book to get something out of reading it. If you enjoyed the time you spent reading, that is enough.This attitude seems very &#34;completionist&#34;, where you only get value after you finish something. That isn&#39;t how I view things.Also, why does he think mindless apps and games are the same as doing nothing? The idea is you enjoy the time spent playing the game. Sure, you don&#39;t end up with anything after, but you enjoyed the time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"John Deere will just claim they never sold him a tractor, but rather signed a custom contract with him that gives him access and custody of one in return of some constraints he agreed upon.If the government intervenes, it would undermine the free market. But you could argue it&#39;s already undermined, both by the government itself and the fact that somehow John Deere managed to achieve a monopoly in a sector critical to national security."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I being overly cynical in concluding that a growing % of companies will screw over their customers for their own gain. Doesn&#39;t this myopic &#34;screw the customer&#34; mentality damage brand reputation? Sure does for me. The growing discontent amongst a companies customer base is creating a new market opportunity for a competitor. When I feel screwed by a company like this, I find a good alternative, then jump ship and NEVER go back (even if they course correct some years later). From that point on I&#39;m a vocal detractor of the brand. If no quality alternative exists it&#39;s even worse because you know the company is screwing you knowing you have no good alternatives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the best definition of engineering is that it&#39;s a process of optimization within a solution space bounded by constraints. If you pile up some mud and let it dry, you have made a dwelling but you are not an engineer. If you calculate the load requirements for a series of I-beams given a certain budget and build a skyscraper, you are an engineer.As the author correctly notes, there aren&#39;t necessarily hard boundaries on what qualifies as engineering, but I think there clearly are axes on which something is &#34;more engineer-y&#34; vs &#34;less engineer-y&#34;, and as the constraints of the solution space go from physical (tension, voltage, pressure) to non-physical (interpersonal relations, public perception, aesthetic judgment), the activity goes from more engineer-y to less engineer-y.In software, we&#39;re always optimizing on cost / developer time, but that&#39;s closer to the non-physical side of the constraint physicality axis. As you optimize for things like memory usage, execution time, binary size, then you get closer to the physical end of the constraint-type axis, and are thus more engineer-y."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I come from an aerospace engineering background (did structural engineering on commercial aircraft that were in the design and approval stages) and am in software now (games). I&#39;ve had two different takes on this. Neither is perfect. Would appreciate comments on them.(a) If it&#39;s regularly expected that you ship bugs, you might be in a discipline that is distinct from engineering.[0](b) If you can usually reach for an abstraction to save you, you might be working in something that isn&#39;t engineering.[1][0] If software is engineering, then it&#39;s the only engineering discipline I&#39;m aware of in which the participants are regularly expected to produce deliverables they don&#39;t fully understand. What do I mean by that? Well, if we software peeps fully understood our deliverables, we wouldn&#39;t have bugs, or at least, we&#39;d always know what bugs are there. If as a structural engineer I had delivered a final draft of an analysis document which showed that I didn&#39;t fully understand the part and how it would perform, my boss would not have been pleased. Most software bugs are treated more casually than that, so we clearly have a tolerance for delivering work that we don&#39;t fully understand.You might take issue with the idea that I &#34;fully understood&#34; a structural part. Fair. When I calculated the strength of a beam in a thrust reverser I didn&#39;t understand the individual molecular interactions, I didn&#39;t need to know if the metal was of a body-centered cubic crystal structure, etc. But this is because I was able to apply well-understood and rigorously accepted simplifying assumptions that were conservative (from the point of view of a factor of safety), and fully encapsulated all the understanding I needed to produce a part fit for use.[1] This feels like the more flawed of the two proposals, because I expect EEs can do this. Control systems folks can definitely do this, and I would absolutely call them engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, I am a real engineer, and designing gearboxes for airplanes is quite real. So are programmers engineers or not?Consider real engineering at Boeing. There are engineers and technicians (aka draftsmen) working side by side. They are often doing the same work. The difference, as far as Boeing is concerned, is the engineers have a degree in engineering and the technicians do not.But if they are often doing exactly the same thing, what&#39;s the real difference?Think of it another way. Think of an auto mechanic. He can fix your car. He can take your car apart and put it back together. He can customize it. But is he an auto engineer (who often does those tasks, too)?Nope.A programmer, technician, mechanic plugs numbers into formulas, follows instructions and procedures and practices laid out by an engineer.An engineer derives the formulas, writes the instructions, develops the procedures, and refines the practices.For example, a technician builds a band pass filter by using a circuit he&#39;s already used before and knows works. Maybe he&#39;ll tweak the RC values. An engineer will drive the RC values needed by understanding the calculation. The technician may use calculation (though they rarely do), but they don&#39;t understand where the formula comes from. An engineer does.In software, a programmer calls a sort function from the supplied library. An engineer writes the sort function, and can tell you its complexity and why the algorithm he chose (or invented) is the most appropriate one for the particular sorting task, and what the cases are where the sort will perform poorly, and why."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"American here&#34;perhaps better known as the online identity verification service that many states now use to help staunch the loss of billions of dollars in unemployment insurance and pandemic assistance stolen each year by identity thieves&#34;In the great State of California, billions in unemployment benefits were sent to the wrong people.. because their internal systems were designed to delay, deny and deprive, I say. Actual people with real jobs were repeatedly refused, while insiders who knew how to fill out paperwork, and apparently knew where the blind spots were, filed hundreds of claims in the early pandemic days. A newly appointed Director (young, tech savvy woman) soon stopped making public statements, and the situation nearly two years later, is not resolved.  This is at a time when California has record income to the State.Now, some people may jump on this and say &#34;well, you see how photo ID would have helped that&#34; and, with incomplete knowledge and personal opinion, I say no, it would not solve it. You see, people with real jobs, with every real paper filed, were denied benefits, while insiders were pulling checks with both hands, using certain kinds of identities that would slip through. How would ever more restriction, requirement and verification, have helped here?I am deeply against the collective government making ever more demands on citizens for &#34;papers, please&#34; enrollment to massive money social services (edit e.g. govt unemployment benefits). It is not going to have the desired effect, despite superficial evidence otherwise. Additionally this represents a slippery slope where the ability to interact as an individual will be eroded, and opportunity for insider graft will increase."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Repo owner here, I just created this account, I&#39;m a long time HN lurker.I was surprised to find this on Hacker News, I wanted to wait until the stable release before posting on HN, but thank you for posting :)This project is still in alpha stage, but please feel free to critique; I&#39;d appreciate it.Edit 1: After reading some of the comments, I want to clarify a few things:- Because it is currently in the alpha stage, I do not host anything important on it.- This is also my learning environment, I use Kubernetes in my day job.- Yes it is overkill ;)Edit 2: Wording"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To everyone saying that Kubernetes is unnecessary, try implementing autoscaling, service discovery, secrets management, and autohealing in a vendor independent way without it.Of course none of that is necessary for a self hosted home lab, but neither is gitops.This is a very nice example of how to set stuff up properly.OP, I would love to see Robusta (https://robusta.dev) as part of this too. It&#39;s definitely in line with your vision of automating everything, as it let&#39;s you automate the response to alerts and other events in your cluster. (Disclaimer: I&#39;m one of the maintainers)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very cool!Have you considered something like Tailscale so you can securely access it from outside your home? I&#39;ve been thinking about spinning up my own home server that way, seeing as Tailscale makes it easy to securely access it from my phone when I&#39;m out and about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;A common question I get is about work/life balance. And I view it a little different too now. At Facebook I could get by barely working a few hours a day. But the job was so unsatisfying that it spilled the frustration in the “life” part&#34;This is the golden piece for me. I too recently left a big corp to a smaller place, expecting to sacrifice WLB and my free time - yet I ended up feeling happier and spending less time consuming short-form online contents, to the point that I even have more free time now! It never occurred to me that my self-indulging online addiction is actually a coping mechanism towards the unsatisfying and meaningless daily job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At Facebook I could get by barely working a few hours a day.A note of caution that this is not the common Facebook experience. I joined being fully aware of their reputation for poor work life balance, but even then it was soul-crushing. The pressure to perform is near constant, consequences of not performing are real, and the bar for meeting expectations is very high to start with, such that externally hired senior engineers are frequently overwhelmed by the sheer amount of expectations.I was a manager there and got the distinct impression that the expectations bar was also rising over time. FB/Meta tends to hire the overperforming types, who put extra pressure on themselves to get those Exceeds and Greatly Exceeds ratings that come with real monetary rewards. The problem is you can&#39;t have everyone exceeding, not at the macro level anyways. So there&#39;s a real pressure on the managers with too many of those Exceeds ratings. The goal is to prevent a manager that misunderstands the expectations from giving everyone Exceeds, but the side effect is that over time there is a drift of expectations from Exceeds to Meets side. Having been with the company for so many years, the author likely did not notice this drift and was able to adjust over time naturally. Newer hires (which, given FB&#39;s rate of growth, is the large majority) aren&#39;t so lucky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It always blows my mind how most interview in our field. When I first started in tech I was afraid to talk about not knowing leetcode to my peers. 15 years in and I now can confidently say I’ve yet to meet someone who thinks these are a valid metric.Why do we make this the gate keeper to our industry when we know (except for the very specific roles) we will rarely need leet code type problems. When we do we just google them.So silly to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve noticed in the past 2-3 months that results from StackOverflow, Wikipedia, and official programming language documentation sites seem to have been abruptly downranked. They used to typically be in the top 3 results for me for appropriate queries, but now they frequently aren&#39;t even on the first page."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the utility of generic search engines is coming to an end. Services like Google, Bing and DDG are numbered in usefulness.Instead, I am guessing (maybe hoping) that we see a return of the moderated directories, like Yahoo or DMOZ of old. A 2.0 spin on these directories, with lessons learned from all the years.Imagine that you just go to StackOverflow and search there directly for your answer. Want a funny laugh, go to your favorite comedy website (like facebook.com) and search directly. Want some news, go to CNN or Fox (depending on your persuasion) and fill your echo chamber.Not kidding. I think search as we know it is dead. And there is a new paradigm just sitting out there ready for the next generation to make.A directory of well known lists of websites with specialty search engines available on each."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a rather standard tech company model: you build a product so good it becomes indispensable, then you stick the customers in a vice and squeeze until all the money comes out. &#34;Produce the best search results&#34; hasn&#39;t been the guiding principle for a good decade now.&#34;Not growing is failing&#34; is the most toxic principle of modern business. There is a finite amount of people, of money to be made. Ever-increasing income is fundamentally impossible. When you can&#39;t increase revenue by further improving your product, you increase revenue by making the same product more profitable, which generally means a worse product. In the eyes of the business major, the ideal business is one in which all of your customers hate you not quite enough to stop using you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 2FA tokens for all users worldwide were subsequently revoked to ensure the new infrastructure was in effect. We have mandatory 2FA policies on both the frontend and backend to protect users during this revocation phase, as outflows such as withdrawals have a requirement to setup and use 2FA in order to withdraw.How is this supposed to work? They revoked all of their 2FA for all accounts? Doesn&#39;t this just open them up to credential stuffing attacks? This is a really, really odd response to me. I can understand migrating to a new 2FA system, but they&#39;d have to re-establish the chain-of-trust somehow. Are they just hoping that users don&#39;t have compromised email/SMS accounts in order to enable the new 2FA system?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Boy this whole thing just reeks.&gt; No customers experienced a loss of funds. In the majority of cases we prevented the unauthorized withdrawal, and in all other cases customers were fully reimbursed.so which is it? no one lost funds or everyone that lost funds got paid back? where did that money come from?&gt; transactions were being approved without the 2FA authentication control being inputted by the user.the withdrawal system allows for non-2fa when its enabled, but informs the risk system when it happens? what kind of feature is that?&gt; While Crypto.com already performs internal and external penetration tests, Crypto.com has immediately engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checksah yes. the &#34;we already had 7 double checkers, better add an 8th&#34; solution. sounds like maybe the problem is not with the testing and auditing suite.&gt; releasing additional end-user security features as we move away from 2-Factor Authentication and to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)2fa isnt true MFA? did we evolve some new jargon im not aware of?&gt; WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user’s permission. WAPP restores fundswait i thought they said they already did this? are they gonna start charging for it now because they lost money?&gt; To qualify for the WAPP program, users must: Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transactionwtf is that? a PSK? a TOTP?&gt; File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; andhello, local police department? i need to file a report - my cryptocurrency wallet just had an unauthorized funds withdrawal. no, i dont have a suspect, or evidence, or any action for you to take. just come down here and write down that i said this happened please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Worldwide Account Protection Program seems to be a way for Crypto.com to limit their exposure, while marketing it as &#34;protection&#34; for the customers.Around $34million stolen, 483 users affected. If the funds were spread evenly, then each user would have lost about $71k. But the funds won&#39;t be evenly spread (average). It&#39;s likely some users will have lost much more, and some much less.From the announcement, it looks like Crypto.com is making the users whole again;&gt; No customers experienced a loss of funds.This means that (in some cases) Crypto.com was on the hook for much more than $71k / user. The WAPP appears to put a series of conditions on the user, and introduce an upper limit to the amount that Crypto.com will return in the future.&gt; WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms &amp; conditions apply.&gt;     Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available,&gt;    Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,&gt;    Not be using jailbroken devices,&gt;    File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and&gt;    Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.This looks more like a mechanism to limit Crypto.com&#39;s exposure to future events than it does a policy to protect users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dislike Google and their products pretty much universally, but having this sort of thing done by a competitor is not just distasteful, I see it as verging on corporatism.Make a better product and beat them, don&#39;t use the fact that a government is banning them to upsell your own tracking software.All tracking is bad, from Google or not. I understand the &#34;companies need to make informed decisions&#34; argument but I disagree with it, mainly because tracking software is involuntary and it&#39;s in the interest of the tracking software maker and the company using it to make it as stealthy as possible.PS: What adds salt to injury is that you&#39;re using Google Fonts on this website. If you were privacy-conscious, you&#39;d self-host at least. Read here: https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?hl=en#what_does_usin..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This message is brought to you by&gt; PostHog is the only open source product analytics platform where customer data never leaves your infrastructure.Hosting my own Matomo installation I beg to differ. Matomo is open source and my visitors data never leaves my own server.Except they only do backend tracking and see https traffic from website frontend tracking reaching my analytics server as it &#34;leaves your infrastructure&#34;.But they at least made one thing obviously clear to me. I would never consider using them in the future.Also they are wrong factually. Google Analytics is not illegal in Austria. The court made this clear. Transmitting the IP without anonymizeIp is. Also transmitting PII data unencrypted to GA us (but GA does forbid that in their TOS as well).So not caring about the law when implementing GA and doing it just wrong is forbidden in Austria. Who would have thought. Using it correctly and adhering to data privacy best practices is just fine with GA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WASM being the “new k8s” is only one small fragment of where it is going to go. I think there is a good chance it’s going to become the defacto deployment target for a lot of software, so in addition to browser and server:- Plugins for desktop/mobile apps, wasm provides a nicely sandboxed environment for them.- Gaming, the combination of WASM and WebGPU will be the perfect platform for cross platform game development. I could see Steam, for example, creating their own runtime.- Embedded electronics, simplifying the development and deployment of IoT devices.When it comes to wasm on the server, it’s often talked about as targeting the “edge”. I believe this the next area of massive growth, however the part that I don’t think is fully solved yet is on the database side. If your server app is making multiple database calls from the edge to a central db there is a good chance that it will slower than a traditional (single location) deployment.What’s needed is a edge first database, we need at least read replicas to be at the edge with your app. Fly.io have something like this with their Postgres’s product. The alternative is to use an eventually consistent db such as CouchBD, but that causes other problems. I’m interested to see if CloudFlare do anything in this area as it’s the part of their stack that’s missing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think he understands what K8s is. WASM is the new Docker, but you still need something to manage/orchestrate/schedule all those WASM instances. What if your WASM process goes down, who will restart it? What if you need 10 extra instances to handle a traffic burst? How do you isolate associated WASM instances from the rest of the environment, and manage their access to/from the outside world? How do you provide them with configuration or credentials?You still need something like K8s, even if you&#39;re not using docker underneath . Indeed you can already use other runtimes under K8s, so what he is proposing is nothing new anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So be it!Until XyZ is the new WebAssembly and @!# is the new XyZ!As long as my Django backend works and browsers support my HTML/CSS/JS frontend, I am fine.I have the same LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, Python) SAAS project running for decades now, paying all my bills, letting me live a free life.As long as nobody touches that, you can do all you want. Invent new fancy stacks every other year, make courses for it, migrations to it, a religion of it - I don&#39;t mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m making Windows/.Net based app for managing queues - QueueExplorer.
Started with MSMQ support back in 2005, now it supports Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ. It&#39;s old fashioned perpetual licensing, so revenue is a rollercoaster. Because of that, it&#39;s emotional rollercoaster as well. Good thing is you get paid for full license at the time of purchase instead of collecting it in 10-20 months. Bad thing is every month starts at zero.Although .Net went multiplatform years ago, my app relies on WinForms a lot so it&#39;s Win only, except through Wine. I would love to support Mac as well but the only realistic option looks to be Electron based, and it would be a significant step back for my Windows users. Maintaining two different GUIs looks like a problem for micro company.The best thing about desktop software is it can&#39;t break for all the users at once like server-based app can. That gives some piece of mind when you&#39;re micropreneur. Sure, there are bugs, but they affect only users who downloaded buggy version. You can&#39;t crash all installed instances just like that.The worst thing is, it&#39;s hard to ask for a subscription. Yes, I hate it as a user, but would love it as a business owner :)https://www.cogin.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our company sells HW and SW for the dental sector.We have a desktop app that processes DICOM data to do implant treatment planning (where to place an implant in the patient jaw). Output is a STL file to print a drill guide for the oral surgeon to perform a guided surgery.Our desktop scanners for dental labs and our intra-oral scanners for dentists generate 3D meshes of the patients oral situation.Those meshes are the input data for the CAD/CAM Software my team builds. It is a desktop app for the digital design of dental restorations. The GUI is in javaFX and 3D visualization is done with OpenGL 4.5.Once the restorative Design is done, that app can generate many different output formats. Labs will feed the design files their local milling machine or 3D printer. Dentists can send it to centralized milling facilities of their choice to produce the crown or bridge or what have you.Some impressions can be seen here:https://youtu.be/5THQMr5SAH0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my 3rd (or is it 4th?) year of developing and selling Label LIVE, an electron app for designing and printing labels. Originally it only worked with USB thermal printers, but over the last few years it&#39;s grown into a multi-function image-rendering pipeline that integrates data import (via spreadsheet, CSV or API) with barcodes, text, image output. My app revenue eclipsed my iOS/NodeJS consulting in 2021 and I hope to double revenue in 2022. Read more at https://label.live/features.The tech stack for this app is really interesting (to me at least, natch). Lots of native node modules that need finesse on both macOS and Windows. I don&#39;t yet support Linux because out of thousands of users, only 2 people have emailed about Linux support (probably both from HN!).I really love building Electron apps. It&#39;s a total joy bringing something (albeit &#34;inefficiently&#34; wrt memory and &#34;native&#34; qualities) like this to market for a niche that&#39;s otherwise a dumpster fire of old and clunky 1980s-era Windows-only software.As for licensing, Label LIVE is licensed per computer. I wrote a custom license implementation leveraging JWT. The JWT is signed by my license server and the app verifies the signature and that the contents match the &#34;fingerprint&#34; of the computer being licensed, expiration, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the Subaru BRAT in the early &#39;80s. There was a 25% tarrif on imported pickups. So Subaru added two plastic jump seats in the back of the BRAT, even making them face backwards. No seat belts as I recall just handles. They weren&#39;t even really intended to be used. They were just cheap plastic. But they served the purpose of making the vehicle a four-seater car instead of a pickup, with only a 2.5% tarrif.Tarrif averted, thousands sold!https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_BRAT"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I checked the keyboard debouncing logic [0] and it was fine. Some keyboards from other manufacturers, notably Lenovo Thinkpads, have absurd debouncing algorithms that scramble keys or add delays, so it&#39;s good to see Framework has a correct solution.[0]: https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/EmbeddedController/blob..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been so happy to see what Framework has been doing lately, and really want to support them, but I already have a desktop as my primary computer and two Thinkpads that are already set up nicely, but that I rarely use. I moved from 15&#34; laptops to 14&#34; when Lenovo added the numpad on the larger variant, and 14&#34; is about as small as I want to go.I kind of want to buy a framework though, just to support them? But I have no use for another laptop, let alone a small 12&#34; one! Should I get one anyway because, what the hell, why not? Should I wait and then jump on one if/when they release a larger model?Anybody else have similar feelings?Edit to add:I also have one of the last Thinkpad models that support S3 sleep (T480 -- within a model or two, I think?), which is currently super critical for Linux... I need to be able to close the lid and come back after a week.It&#39;s easy to blame the manufacturers for this, but the consistent answer seems to be &#34;Intel&#39;s Tiger Lake platform does not support S3 sleep,&#34; and all of the system builders base their work on what Intel&#39;s reference platform does. So short of going to extreme effort to hack it together themselves (something that is likely not their specialty), reasonable sleep behavior is not going to be an option unless Intel brings S3 back, or does work to improve the S0ix states.I absolutely do not want to support the no-more-S3 clusterfuck right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running NixOS on my Framework for the last few months, and I&#39;ve been really happy with it. I initially got it so I&#39;d have viable hardware to do osdev on, so learning that they are going to open-source its firmware makes me even more happy."</p>

Turns out they wanted them to be mailed to you, which wasn&#39;t going to work because I do paperless billing for everything.

I import the PDF into Krita, use the ballpoint pen brush, and sign.  I export to PNG, then use an imagemagick script to rotate it some random number between 1-3 degrees, and add noise onto it to look like a scan.It&#39;s a pain, but it&#39;s still less annoying than dealing with a printer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so glad Fly exists. Every other edge focused thing out there I&#39;m aware of are &#34;serverless&#34; which these days basically means they charge per request.That&#39;s fine for a lot of use cases, but the unit economics of the per request pricing model means it&#39;s really hard to operate a predictably sustainable (i.e. profitable) business without also charging our customers on a usage basis, or enforcing limits on usage, neither of which is ideal for maximizing engagement as incentives are no longer aligned.Fly just gives us compute at the edge for a predictable price per unit of actual compute resources as opposed to requests, and gives us freedom to serve as much traffic as we can min-max onto those resources, like we could with traditional cloud compute.This provides much better unit economics for many kinds of applications, at the cost of having to manage the scaling ourselves. But because the option exists, we can make this tradeoff on a case-by-case basis, which is so much better than if all we had was &#34;serverless&#34; stuff at the edge and had to choose between just low latency across the globe vs good unit economics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fly is great.They’ve got Chris McCord there, who has already improved their Elixir deployment story. I tweeted a few weeks ago about improving the default Rails deployment experience to not require DB provisioning and configuration of env vars like SECRET_BASE_KEY and they said it would likely ship within the next 3 months.My hot take is they’re setting themselves up to ride the server-side rendered HTML renaissance we are experiencing with LiveView and Hotwire. It will become much more important to deploy applications geographically closer to customers to lower latency, which Fly makes sane for the rest of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We&#39;ve had a free tier since we launched ten years ago (in 2020).I’m not a Fly.io customer (although more and more I am thinking I should be), but I eagerly read every new blog post because I’m so entertained by their tone. These people are clearly having fun at work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually a brilliant location for them. One of those places that has much more going for it than people not from the region would realize.International airport, large rail depot, extremely low cost of living and a city/region that has more good restaurants and activities than might be expected. Ohio State University is in the city and is a huge school that is rapidly growing in academic standing. Road transit in the area is also very good allowing access to any part of the city from any other part in rapid fashion. Good schools, relatively low crime, etc. Probably the only drawback, from a lifestyle point of view, would be the winter and that&#39;s not even that bad, compared to other winter regions."</p>

There is a biotech research campus, Bath &amp; Bodyworks main research lab, and the main operations center for AEP (a midwest electric company).  If you travel about 2-3 miles orthogonal to that street we have a big data center for Nationwide Insurance, a campus for Discover (credit cards), and a State Farm insurance facility.It is literally across street from one of the Ohio East-2 availability zones.  If they were making rack-mounted server boards, they could just walk them across the street and plug them into the cloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, cool! The model is specified as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem for which a solution is found using high-quality proprietary numerical solvers.[a] All partial differential equations specifying the model have a basis in economic theory or in heuristics and approximations shown to be consistent with reality. Parameters come directly from (what I assume is a large amount of) economic data collected by the Danish government.The authors working for the Danish government deserve an A+ for making their code and assumptions public, along with comprehensive high-quality documentation.[b] It was a delightful surprise to click on the link and find... a carefully curated repo.I have only one nitpicking: This looks like the kind of project that should have been -- and in fact probably should be -- implemented in Julia, instead of in a proprietary language. I suspect many heuristics and approximations could be more accurately modeled by ML components, interspersed between equations, as has long been proposed by Julia folks like Chris Rackauckas.--[a] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30028188[b] https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/DREAM-DK/MAKRO/mai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Economics is not a science like physics. We can&#39;t do controlled experiments, we can&#39;t falsify hypothesis. This leads to very muddy waters and what you are left with are two kinds of economists: Those who tell people what they want to hear and those nobody listens to.Econometrics gives people everything they want to hear, and with a scientific veneer as a bonus. The HN crowd should however appreciate how susceptible this is to the tyranny of metrics. Claude-Frédéric Bastiat warned of this over a century ago with his parable of the broken window: Think not only of what you can see (the glazier who is employed to repair the window), but also of what you cannot see (the alternative purchase of a suit) had the window not been broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that the model is implemented in GAMS[1], a proprietary language focused at constrained optimization problems (think Matlab, but more niche).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the article and the study are light on the details of &#34;persistent&#34; Here&#39;s the supporting data&#39;s in a bit more detail[0].Overall this makes sense to me as an individually who personally enjoys it. The whole point of getting high is to be impaired (for me). So it&#39;s not really telling me anything new. Like drinking, I can&#39;t expect myself to be 100% functioning the next day so plan accordingly.The question is how long is that persistence and how much does it affect? Permanent? Doesn&#39;t really seem to be answered in a way that I was hoping.[0] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?do..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve known many people in silicon valley who smoke cannabis regularly (several times a week if not daily). They all seemed to be cognitively normal. Some of them function on a level I only wish I could attain.I think regular cannabis use attracts a certain type of person. That type of person can vary in their ability and intelligence, just like any type of person. This is also true of say, hardcore fans of fantasy fiction. They all have certain things in common, but you couldn&#39;t paint all of them as &#34;creative&#34; or any other trait.I&#39;m hesitant when hearing about long term effects, even on developing brains. Both Barack Obama and Carl Sagan smoked a ton of cannabis when they were younger. And they and others really turned out fine.This paper seems to be a meta study that combines the results from other studies. Since there were multiple methodologies it&#39;s hard to get a sense of exactly what questions they were answering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before anyone freaks out too much:&#34;Persistent&#34; means up to one week. From the actual paper: &#34;However, results were not significant for an abstinence period of more than 7 days.&#34;Basically, science has proved that stoners behave like stoners. And if you stop it takes a few days for everything to wear off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The strange trend of &#34;authoritarian minimalism&#34; design that seems to be working its way through the majority of newer software is very strange. I wonder who actually wants this stuff, and is not content to merely make it a default, but instead forces it to be the one and only way.Monitors are bigger than ever with huge resolutions, and yet UIs are being dumbed down to uselessness and alienating an increasing number of users.A recent related article https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29954266 seems to indicate that not even people inside Microsoft --- who are being forced to use Win11, because MS --- have any say in the matter. It&#39;s almost like some tiny extremist faction has gained control of Windows and is determined to show everyone else how much power they have by making these changes and gloating sadistically at seeing everyone object, but still end up using Windows.I wonder how much damage they will inflict before people start turning to WINE and a saner Linux distro, just to run their Windows applications."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My #1 issue with Windows 11 is not being able to un-group my taskbar items.I found having multiple instances of apps open across multiple monitors was extremely painful after using it ungrouped for so many years. And the little dot provided to indicate an open app is worthless. I resorted to StartAllBack to fix it. Everything else has been generally fine for me. So disappointed.There are several highly voted feedback posts and comments about the taskbar but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anyone at MS acknowledge any of it.(Main suggestion is currently at 11k votes. https://aka.ms/AAeyt69)And as if that wasn&#39;t enough, sometimes just clicking the taskbar item does nothing. It can sometimes take several clicks to get it to re-open an app.https://twitter.com/vyrotek/status/1461748895906553856"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am mad about how slow the search is now. I used to press window button, start typing first few letters of app of choice hit enter and it would open. Now it takes like 3 seconds for the search to start and by muscle memory I&#39;ve hit enter now before its even warmed up and for whatever reason ends up doing a web search..That alone Makes me want to quit Windows."</p>

I felt completely disoriented at the time, uncovering the many delusions of money, tech and fame as the final life answers, alongside broken relationships and friendships and nowhere to turn. The monks and nuns took me in in a way that I will be forever grateful for and Thich Nhat Hanh&#39;s teaching was the beginning on a long journey of self-discovery, healing, relaxation and coming to terms with reality as it is, right now.Thich Nhat Hanh taught me something very ordinary: That it is important to pause often, to reflect, to sit still or walk in silence and to observe and acknowledge what is happening around you, inside and out. And to then act from that place of stillness and quiet with calm and kindness to the people around you. And to keep practicing this over and over again, without fail or getting tired from it.I feel tremendous gratitude to him and his teaching, as well as the monks and nuns that dedicate themselves to his many practices and insights.May he rest in peace and may his intentions and practices live on for a long time!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. I used to go to the mindfulness retreats at his affiliated monastery in San Diego. You left your phone in your car, and had 3-5 days (or more sometimes) of meditation, fresh cooked meals, and nature. It was really peaceful, and so different from what I had expected (something like a cult, being plied for donations etc. there was none of that). I stopped going when I left California, but it&#39;s hard to feel much more free than that these days. You&#39;re on a schedule for sleep, meals and events, basically making no decisions, and without internet pulling your attention, you feel like your mind is coming back to yourself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thich Nhat Hanh taught that just like a cloud seems to disappear from the sky, it&#39;s not really, it has simply changed form. The appearance of vanishing is just that: an appearance. Really nothing is created or destroyed. In this way, there is no loss here, Thầy has transitioned into another phase of life. A beauty worth celebrating"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is no reason to autocorrect a QR code scan. QR codes come with built-in error correction, so there’s a vanishingly small chance of a successfully-scanned QR code containing an error. It seems like Camera here might be treating QR code URLs as manually entered URLs or OCRed URLs and applying autocorrection logic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So far, I&#39;ve been able to reproduce a few transformations:* www[0-9].example.tld -&gt; [0-9].example.tld,
e.g. www1.nyc.gov -&gt; 1.nyc.gov* example[ac|co|gov|edu].tld -&gt; example.[ac|co|gov|edu].tld
e.g. exampleac.uk -&gt; example.ac.ukMy guess, as someone else further down the comments mentioned, is that some URL handling library is doing more than expected to its input. I filed an internal bug report referencing some of the public reports from a dev build of Android 12, so hopefully this will get triaged soon if someone hasn&#39;t already done a similar reproduction.(I work at Google, but on nothing remotely related to Android.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh. There is literally nothing I like about the changes in Android 12 versus 11.  This seems like yet another shoe-horning in of &#34;cleverness&#34; when it wasn&#39;t invited and in this case appears to be outright broken.After disabling every single assistant or enrichment option I could find, Android is still putting auto-reply prompts into any notification that has a reply button. GO AWAY!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I switched to this font a couple of years ago and I&#39;ve been unable to find anything that even comes close! At this point I would consider JetBrains Mono to be my forever font."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After playing the CodingFont that others commented (https://www.codingfont.com/), I ended up with this list of winners:* Cousine* JetBrains Mono* Roboto Mono* Source Code ProHowever, when actually testing, they all have a something that doesn&#39;t click as good as the Ubuntu Mono in terms of horizontal spacing.All these fonts are too wide, and the step from 10pt to 11pt causes a huge increment on horizontal space usage. Whereas Ubuntu Mono stays in a perfect sweet spot when set at 13pt.Anyone finding the same?EDIT: I made a quick visual comparison (mind that all of the fonts listed above have practically the same width):https://pasteboard.co/qZ8rvfV4aEHf.png"</p>
