								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in a post-Thanksgiving charitable mood, so thank you, Jack. The execution hasn&#39;t been perfect (as has been commented on ad nauseam), but Twitter is the closest to a worldwide-accessible [1] Speaker&#39;s Corner [2] I know of, and that - despite all the completely valid criticism - is a valuable public service: mediating access to information has been the defining tool of control for those in power pretty much since civilization began, and I, for one, will always pick an imperfectly moderated cesspool over the prior status quo where a church or a government told me what&#39;s true and what to think. FWIW, you&#39;ve also championed transparency and decentralization for your platform more than any other SV social media titan [3].[1] If you have access to the Internet, that is.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few reflections on this announcement.1) Remember that CEOs of public companies are essentially unable to say what they think or want. The cost of doing it is being sued for damages, having to spend countless hours with lawyers, etc. Jack might think X, but he&#39;s only allowed to say Y, and he doesn&#39;t want to go beyond that because he doesn&#39;t want to fight that fight.Only people in a close circle really know what&#39;s going on, and it&#39;s most certainly not random people on the Internet (or HN).2) Also, consider that Twitter, and perhaps Facebook (sorry but I don&#39;t give a sh*t that its new name is Meta), are really difficult companies to run, especially if you&#39;d like to do some public good, as opposed to just maximizing returns.There are so many things that can go wrong, so many other things that will set your company on fire without warnings, and that doesn&#39;t give people the time to think strategically on how to tackle certain difficult scenarios.Twitter and Facebook essentially control most of the public discourse these days; never seen such amount of power in the hands of a few companies.3) Despite common opinion, I actually think that Twitter (unlike Facebook) has done more good than harm. Why? Because it has essentially enabled an incredible explosion of &#34;voices&#34; that can be heard (err, read) all over the world.4) Yes, we can think of countless ways to make Twitter better, but remember that Twitter is not run by Jack Dorsey, nor that other companies are run by their CEOs. Companies are run by boards, which means, by large funds with controlling interest in these companies. Even a well-intentioned CEO has to fight against many things his/her board want. And unlike enlightened CEOs, enlightened boards are essentially a very rare creature, almost never seen on planet Earth (IMHO).5) You might think I&#39;m defending Jack, perhaps I am, but it might be because hatred is really easy to dispense, while trying to be balanced in your judgement is really hard, and perhaps the conversation about Twitter should benefit from cooler heads, as opposed to quick slogans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s zero explanation in the email for why he resigned. He&#39;s re-iterating the point that the company is fine moving forward with the rest of the board, the new CEO and the existing team, but no actual reason as to why he left."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been meaning to write almost exactly this blog post for a while now, glad that someone else did it.Two things that I think are worth calling out:1. In many ways Apple&#39;s anti-competitive behaviour on iOS/iPadOS is a blessing. It&#39;s one of the few things that keep Chromium&#39;s dominance in check. Of course, it&#39;s not great that Apple are stifling innovation like this, but consider the alternative: Chromium dominance on all platforms.2. Why it&#39;s worth caring about this at all? So what if Chromium is the only engine, it would make things easier for developers after all. To this I say, go read some of the discussions in standard bodies(for example about FLoC). Engineers from Apple and Mozilla are largely our bastion against Google&#39;s harmful proposals for the web. Pushback from Apple and Mozilla are only relevant as long as they have market share to speak of. The recent lawsuit against Google(summary[0]) by many US states should be extremely worrying to anyone that cares about the open web and it should make handing over any more control to Google a terrifying prospect.Mozilla maintains a list[1] of their positions on various standard suggestions that is also a useful resource.0: https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/145205393819534131...1: https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a depressing situation, particularly knowing that Firefox is pretty much kept alive at Google&#39;s whim. It makes one seriously wonder whether it is feasible at all to maintain an independent open-source web browser in 2021. People tend to blame Mozilla&#39;s management and I&#39;m sure there have been management failures but I&#39;m not sure what they could do to make Firefox a thriving, independent, sustainable browser. It seems that the market niche of tech-capable people who value privacy and customisation over a simplified UX is not capable of sustaining Firefox on its own. So Mozilla tries to move in Chrome&#39;s direction, removing configuration options and &#34;dumbing down&#34; the UI, which frustrates its existing user base (including me) while apparently also failing to eat into Chrome&#39;s market share.So what to do? Go back to being the quirky, heavily configurable browser we all know and love? That would be great for me, but even assuming Mozilla can afford to do that now (greater configurability leads to greater code complexity and therefore greater maintenance costs), experience seems to suggest it won&#39;t be enough to allow Mozilla grow its market share to a sustainable level.Finally, and this is a bit of a tangent, but I&#39;ve never quite understood why Mozilla got such a hard time from users about telemetry. I understand that telemetry is in general something to be suspicious of, but we&#39;re not talking about handing your data over to Google so they can target you with ads; we&#39;re talking about sharing technical data with a non-profit organisation to help them maintain and improve the browser you rely on. Mozilla are removing a feature you use daily? Okay, did you enable the telemetry that lets them know you use it? Receiving and analysing user data is increasingly important to delivering a good user experience. If open-source projects can&#39;t access the same data as proprietary ones do, we can&#39;t expect them to be able to react to user demands in the same way, and so we can&#39;t expect them to be able to compete in today&#39;s market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think part of this discussion needs to be that Firefox, while open source, doesn&#39;t provide footing for the community to build browser forks the way Chromium does. This sort of open usage, ironically, feels very fitting to the spirit of Firefox, but they&#39;re not even close to Chrom(e|ium).I&#39;ve been building a browser full time the past year+ (synth.app) and FF core wasn&#39;t really even an option. They&#39;ve done very little to make the engine usable outside of Firefox.Now I&#39;m sure there are a variety of savory and unsavory things that led here, but building that stuff out seems like a good way to grow the ecosystem. At least they would&#39;ve had a chance at capturing the Brave/Opera/Edge/etc market and those seats at the committees.This isn&#39;t to say that I&#39;m not worried about these standards merging like this. I&#39;ve spent many hours working out weird chromium only behaviors that websites rely on these days to do things (and egregiously so if they detect an agent remotely resembling chrome)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Whenever I try to use something other than IntelliJ (generally VS Code) I&#39;m always struck by how awful the code completion and auto-imports are. I really hope we can get a lightweight editor with those two functions working properly.However, I don&#39;t see how you can do either of those features well without a lot of indexing of the codebase. And indexing is a major reason why IntelliJ so so clunky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s a real opportunity here for JB.If they’re prepared to give this away for free, and make money off of upselling folk on hosted remote dev envs (or licensing the server side to cloud providers) then this could actually compete with vscode.They basically don’t have any other product that is competitive with vscode.…but, I’m skeptical they’re willing to make the jump to freemium based on their other SAS product offerings which have… hm… not been hugely lucrative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just hope the remote development features will actually work adequately in this.They tried to get that stuff working with existing IDEs multiple times [0][1][2][3], but they are all broken in their unique ways.Whenever I see them announce something new in the remote development space I always jump in right away and try it out, discover it is broken too, and then go back to using VS Code remote dev features.For local dev I still use JB stuff, but it is simply too broken and awkward for remote.[0] https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-remote-in...[1] https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/[2] https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/11/29/introducing-remot...[3] https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who have worked around and at Stripe for the past decade, this is not a surprise. Stripe, and especially the founders, have a quite a poor reputation for screwing over people in and around their orbit.Almost every fintech startup has the story of Patrick reaching out about an acquisition, mining them for information playing along and then ghosting - same thing for candidates. They leadership team, specifically Patrick and Will Gaybrick are extremely smart but have screwed over a ton of people - be very careful about trusting.You don&#39;t hear anything about this online, they&#39;re incredibly effective at squashing hit pieces and have a huge amount of reporters and power brokers under their control. On HN and silicon valley Stripe and Patrick are a PR machine. Patrick has almost direct control over YC and HN, you&#39;ll notice that every single Stripe post automatically has pc as the first comment, regardless of anything else. Everything negative gets buried.With Patrick now living in Woodside, Will on permanent vacation in Malibu and John permanently in Ireland the company is definitely a bit in chaos mode internally. Their entire people team has turned over and they&#39;re having major retention issues - so I&#39;m not super surprised that stuff like this is starting to leak out.I run a $XB fintech, and am afraid to use my name given the backlash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had the opposite experience recently as an EM. Spent a few months trying to find a staff-level engineer. Found a great candidate who worked for a FAANG, worked to get our budget up to his expectations, sold him on the team, and he accepted our offer with a start date 6 weeks in the future so he could have time to wrap up his work. Fine, I&#39;m just happy to have filled the role after an arduous search. A few weeks go by, and he hasn&#39;t responded to my &#34;we&#39;re excited to have you join the team, etc&#34; email or any HR emails about filling out his paperwork. I call and email, the recruiter calls and emails, nothing. We never hear from him again..He&#39;s been active on social media so we know he&#39;s alive, and assume he parlayed our offer into a raise somewhere else. Ok, that happens, but to accept an offer and totally ghost? Jeez. I could have used those intervening weeks to interview more candidates had he just sent me a quick note, now I&#39;ve got to backfill his position while also trying to fill the new ones that just opened... I guess hiring is a shitshow from both sides sometimes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m posting this from a throwaway and not my regular account so not to incriminate myself. But my experience outlined below is 100% truthful.Stripe is arrogant. I have many years of solid and proven experience. They called me out of the blue and I accepted to speak to the hiring manager. The recruiter sounded very arrogant in first conversation. She rushed me to schedule an interview but inexplicably postponed the interview with hiring manager by four weeks once I accepted.When I reached out to an acquaintance of mine who had worked in Stripe in the interim, she said that they are simply in search of marquee brand names in your resume and it is a mess inside. As per her, the people who work there are simply too egotistic. Even people who just happened to have won the &#34;lucky sperm/egg&#34; lottery by joining a rocket ship early on considered themselves as geniuses.In my experience in interviewing with them I felt the same. I sensed an undercurrent of arrogance, feeling of superiority, etc. They deserve praise for what they have accomplished so far and their valuation but it feels like it has gone to their head for many employees who work there now.Needless to say, I didn&#39;t get the job. I&#39;m not bitter but felt that they didn&#39;t treat me well in the process...If you are interviewing there, beware....."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly enough, there has been a community project dedicated to keeping the last Winamp version alive (last version from the original creators), and it really great to use.https://getwacup.com/It includes a skin that allows it to work on modern display resolutions. It&#39;s really interesting to see just how low-res screens were when it was in it&#39;s hey-day, given that they are nearly unusable on a 4k monitor.Edit: I was too young to remember the releases, but replies are indicating that version 5 was in fact, not the most popular :P"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just can’t understand the point of the DMCA takedown here. This software is very dead and abandoned at this point, and the only thing bearing its name is vaporware that appears to be so distant from the original as to effectively not even compete with it.Of course, the copyright holders have every legal right to do so. But doesn’t it seem pointless? This codebase probably has more historical interest than commercial by now. Am I missing something?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question, as someone who actually used Winamp back in ~2004: why would you want to use it now?I have some nostalgia for it, sure, but what exactly does it actually offer you that something like VLC doesn&#39;t? It seems like it plays my music and videos competently enough, and I don&#39;t know anyone who actually uses Shoutcast anymore.This isn&#39;t a passive aggressive dig or anything, I would actually like to know."</p>

(On the other hand, 1080p projectors look great in my opinion.)* Most big brands such as LG, Samsung, etc. have &#34;commercial displays&#34; or &#34;digital signage&#34; that are dumb or at least have fewer problematic features. One kind you&#39;ll see is marketed for putting in hotel or hospital rooms. Another kind is marketed for displaying at e.g. a bar/restaurant, building lobby, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I get a horrible feeling in my stomach when I see these &#34;remote&#34; IDE options. I am very sure that they have their benefits, coding from a thin-client machine and having an &#34;always on&#34; session in the cloud ...But it feels like a slow errosion of our control and ownership of our tools. Where everything is becoming a rent-seeking opportunity and good tools are made available for a monthly rent.Personally I like having my whole build system, IDE, CI/CD on a machine I work at. I get this might not be for everyone, but I think we need to be careful what we give up long-term for these conveniences.Granted, I could just use VI and a terminal and nobody is forcing anyone to use anything ... but like many things, they are not like-choices.I depend on my tools, and the fewer dependencies to paid-montly SaaS features the better."</p>

When compared to VS Code and its remote editing over SSH, IntelliJ was really lacking. I know of a couple of people who went away from PyCharm just because of this.Related reports: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-19752, https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-226455I tried Code With Me but this seems limited to 10 minutes in the free version or so, and also not really intended for remote editing but more for pair programming.&gt; hosted in SpaceWhat does this mean? I have not really explored this so far. Can I host private own Space instances? I can imagine this would be a requirement in many environments.Is Space an alternative to GitHub or other hosting solutions? We would not want to move our code, issues and internal project management over to some other platform. We just want good remote editing support.Will there be a free community version of Fleet?Anyway, I applied for an invitation to Fleet Preview. Maybe I can get a chance soon to try it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile IntelliJ is rotting with months-old bugs that render entire features useless, with no fixes and no ETAs in sight. The only product that I pay money for that constantly, on almost every release, pains me with new bugs, a good portion of which are never fixed. I thought about using other Jetbrains products like DataGrip (and now this Fleet), but I&#39;m not going to invest even more into a company that simply refuses to fix bugs and regressions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the cool thing about this demo was that I remember when it was first submitted many years ago and thought it a cool demo that demonstrated the viability of WebGL which I expected to take off a lot quicker than it has.But I also recently came across madebyevan.com again by accident after researching the backing of different npm projects to assess which ones had good momentum or commercial backing behind them to assess their long-term viability, and noticed a lot of npm projects (~2M weekly) relying on esbuild [1] as a fundamental part of their build system due to its amazing performance [1].All good except that the foundational part of many npm projects feature is mostly being maintained by a single developer [2], a @evanw who was also prolific in responding to esbuild&#39;s issue catering for different peoples issues &amp; feature requests. I didn&#39;t think this level of investment in a popular OSS project was sustainable and hoped they had good sponsorship behind them, but was surprised that @evanw [3] didn&#39;t have sponsorships enabled which I thought strange as most authors of popular npm projects have good sponsorship, but upon further research it&#39;s because Evan Wallace&#39;s day job is as the CTO and cofounder of Figma - a popular company with ~10B valuation.Which is great in that esbuild isn&#39;t at risk of being sporadically abandoned from its lead developer joining a new/demanding startup, on the other hand a foundational project in npm&#39;s ecosystem is being developed in the spare time of a Co-founder &amp; CTO of a ~10B Co - who also creates great demos :)[1] https://github.com/evanw/esbuild[2] https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/graphs/contributors[3] https://github.com/evanw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Different cultures have different unwritten behaviours on roads.In the mountains of Italy, drivers give a short honk before entering a turn on a serpentine road, which usually can&#39;t be seen around. If there is no responding honk, they will take the full width of the road (making the very tight turn easier and faster). Tourist drivers have to pick up on this :)In much of Europe oncoming cars flash their lights to warn others about dangers and (especially) speed traps or police checks, so they can slow down in time.Here in Lithuania, flashing your warning lights (the four orange ones on the corners of the car) means thanks, for example if you let someone merge from one of the very short onramps. I&#39;ve never seen this in Germany, where onramps are however much longer.And amongst truck drivers it&#39;s pretty wide-spread to blink right to tell a following car you think it&#39;s safe for them to overtake you and blink left when you think it no longer is. At least on long roads where there are no obvious right turns. I flash them a grateful hand sign when passing their mirror."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, time to throw in the explanation I grew up with. I always thought it was definitive, but turns out its not. Unfortunately I have already passed on this urban legend :P.On foggy roads in north India, it is difficult to see vehicles on the road. So lights were used to indicate the status of big vehicles like trucks. Two lit bulbs on left and right corners (illuminating Horn Please) meant honk to get a pass. And to indicate you can overtake, the driver could light one bulb in the middle (illuminating a OK) to indicate its ok to take over. Eventually this system was scrapped but the tradition to paint &#34;Horn OK please&#34; remained.(my god the theory is falling apart in my own head as I retell it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A reminder that pretty much no lorry driver in india knows English. Vehicles here have inane phrases like this and it’s for the most part almost protocol to paint them when you get a vehicle of that class. The guy who paints Lorry backs with the company name probably asks “you want the horn ok please phrase right” and the drivers probably like yeah whatever.Not like the drivers here expect courtesy from anyone around them. If anything they expect (and return in kind) douchebaggery. It’s like playing gta. Of course you expect every passerby to steal your car and you act accordingly.Similarly auto rickshaws all over Tamil Nadu used to ubiquitously have the phrase “the age for a woman to get married is 21”. Similar bullshit reason (though in this case the govt might have mandated it at some point, memory unclear). Thankfully it’s disappeared nowadays."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(my day job is developer on Proof-of-Stake Algorand block chain, I&#39;m a developer, this may not be polished official PR)
Article&#39;s theory about malicious old blocks doesn&#39;t hold up. Let&#39;s say I start a new node and verify history since the beginning. Somewhere along the line I&#39;m connected to a malicious node which hands me a fictionalized block. It would need to have been signed by not just one but about 30-45 accounts _which had stake at that time_. Proof-of-Stake attacks aren&#39;t about having 51% of the CPU that overwhelms a Proof-of-Work system, but about having 60-70% of the _value_ in the network. So, if Warren Buffet comes along and wants to spam our network, I guess he could, but that would destroy the network and destroy his value that he sunk into the network. _That_ is a guardrail for PoS systems as much as any crypto or consensus-protocol element (and the algorithms are right, original article misunderstands them)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PoW systems rely on the &#34;phone a friend method&#34; as well. When you download a Bitcoin client from a &#34;friend&#34;, you are trusting them to honestly introduce you to the network. If you fall asleep for a period of years, you have to trust your friends to honestly inform you of all of the PoW forks and policy changes that have occurred over that interval. The only difference is that PoS blockchain clients must be bundled with a modestly-recent block hash along with the thousands of lines of code that you have no practical way to audit.The problem eventually reduces to Ken Thompson&#39;s &#34;Trusting Trust&#34; [1] problem. There&#39;s no way to externally validate the honesty of any system (cryptocurrency, or otherwise).[1] https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_Ref..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proof of work has always had an economic flaw that you could theoretically temporarily rent enough mining power to perform double spends of more value than the cost of renting those devices.But this attack has never been performed because the reality of all these cryptocurrencies is that the security depends only relatively weakly on proof of work. Instead it relies on trust between the main stakeholders: miners, big nodes and developers. This is just like any other human organisation. That trust is only reinforced by proof of work, making it easier for new parties to become trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The one thing that I find is not helpful, is the “litmus test” approach.i.e. “You are a bad programmer/engineer/scientist/person, because you did not read this book, or know this technique.” Thing.I see this frequently. As a [mostly] self-taught software developer, I’ve been on the receiving end of a lot of this behavior.In my case, I have a real “Oh yeah? I’ll show you!” streak. I became expert at stuff, simply because some e-bully told me I was bad at it (because they were the only ones fit to judge others).Not everyone has that kind of stubbornness. I suspect that a hell of a lot of truly gifted folks never realized their passions, and that our industry has been robbed of significant talent, as a result.Maybe I’m looking at the past with rose-colored glasses, or I was fortunate to run into the people I did, but I don’t recall encountering a lot of this behavior, when I was getting started. I needed a lot of help and nurturing, when I was younger, until I reached the confidence level required to have an “Oh yeah?” response. I’m grateful that I got it.&#34;A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a joke or worried to death by a frown on the right person&#39;s brow.&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me or do other people struggle to read these kinds of very technical books?It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t comprehend, it&#39;s that my brain finds it boring and hard to focus. I think I have trained my brain so much on rapid skimming of websites for useful info, while throwing away most of the content, that I tend to do the same with books, which really doesn&#39;t work well.Has anyone found alternative ways to consume this information for brains that work like mine?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that changed my career as a software engineer, in terms of seniority &amp; remuneration by time and effort, was by changing my efforts from learning arbitrary tech to learning the domain I worked in. Asking useful domain-related questions gets you noticed in stand ups and helps you write the right code. I work in fintech so the best bang for my buck I’ve had was reading an entry level cert in investment finance.I think the generic bit of this advice is to excel as an engineer is to focus on the business, not the tech."</p>

But it&#39;s a major in modern public discourse, and one for once that I&#39;m quite willing to lay heavily at the feet of the public education system. Easily one of the most valuable classes I took in my entire time K-12 was AP Probability &amp; Stats as a sophomore, but that was an entirely optional class with restricted openings anyway (a single teacher in a school of 1200+) which the vast majority never took even where it was offered. Yet interpreting the deluge of data in the modern world requires some level of being able to reason about things probabilisticly and have a sense of what actually goes into a measure of &#34;significance&#34;, null hypothesis and the danger of result-driven analysis finding links that don&#39;t exist and/or cannot possibly be causitive, how sampling a population works and what the error bars look like at different sizes, random vs biased distributions, the underlying distributions, confounding factors etc. I really wish in general kids got started on some light probability thinking as early as possible, in elementary school even, without any real math (let alone calc and such) yet, but just some initial stuff to start to illustrate the mindset. Lots of very fun games and hands-on exercises with dice and so on use or could be made to use important aspects of probability and its misuse.At any rate, I&#39;m certainly not an expert.

SQLite will expand it to a double, and it can&#39;t store NaNs. And probably more overhead to be able to support storing strings in my REAL column.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In every big transaction,” said Leech, “there is a magic moment during which a man has surrendered a treasure, and during which the man who is due to receive it has not yet done so. An alert lawyer will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on. If the man who is to receive the treasure is unused to wealth, has an inferiority complex and shapeless feelings of guilt, as most people do, the lawyer can often take as much as half the bundle, and still receive the recipient’s blubbering thanks.”- Kurt Vonnegut, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My guess - DocuSign has a hard to penetrate moat: It&#39;s known and accepted in courts. Everything else doesn&#39;t really matter.Imagine you&#39;re a legal department. You have to choose between DocuSign, which you know the court will accept, or a competitor. DocuSign costs 10x as much as the competitor. But that&#39;s nothing compared to the cost of litigation, or worse, the cost of losing litigation. So you will likely choose DocuSign anyways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; legally binding way to put signatures and timestamps on a PDF.IANAL, but the idea that a signature is what makes a contract legally binding is not exactly true. It is a symbol of the acceptance of the contract, but legal acceptance can take many forms - so whether you use a service to signify acceptance, or just sign it using acrobat or Adobe&#39;s site, or even just a verbal agreement... those are all valid acceptance, legally speaking.DocuSign&#39;s use case is not the signing, but the management of those documents and signatures - tracking which documents are sent, which have been read (yes, the doc owner can get notified when you even look at a Docusign document), which have been signed, and being able to store copies of signed docs. It is mostly for the companies sending you contracts, not for you as the signer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a self-taught programmer and I&#39;ve been looking at this curriculum longingly for a while now. I&#39;ve been working up the courage to quit a cushy but unfulfilling job to study CS full-time (also math and physics, but that&#39;s just for fun).I fell in love with programming after I started working, and have spent the last 7 years automating everything I can in my job. I&#39;m confident in my ability to solve problems, but I&#39;m missing a solid understanding of the fundamentals.I already have a BS in Materials Engineering, and I have mixed feelings about returning to university. Tuition has doubled since I graduated, and I&#39;m perfectly capable of teaching myself. The authors of teachyourselfcs.com have some strong opinions on CS masters degrees, though I would consider it if I found a topic that really called out to me AFTER I had built those fundamentals.I have plenty of savings, but I&#39;m worried that my effort will be wasted if it doesn&#39;t come with an exclusive piece of paper at the end. Will it be an obstacle, or am I worried over nothing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; They thought they needed to build a machine learning model when they really needed to build an entirely new organization, one that possessed the technical and cultural mindset necessary to succeed in this space.I totally agree.  It&#39;s not impossible to imagine their model working: why couldn&#39;t you serve as a market-maker for homes at a large scale, especially with the unique insights Zillow could have based on their datasets.However I think where the hubris lay is in how they thought they could leapfrog all the way to an automated solution before building a competency as a house-flipping company.From what I understand, where they failed was partly in building a rich enough model to properly account for the less easily quantifiable elements which ultimately account for a property&#39;s value.  I.e. the price per square foot might make a property look like a steal, while something like a sewer main nearby, or problematic neighbor could radically change the value proposition to anyone standing at the site.  That&#39;s a non-trivial problem to solve for even the best ML and it&#39;s not clear how you would automate this.If you ask me, instead of focusing on building an automated price discovery system, they should have started by trying to build a quality home-flipping organization, and figuring out how to super-charge manual work using their datasets.  Over time you might find ways to optimize the process and increase the level of automation to scale output relative to head-count."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good riddance. If large-scale house flipping took off, we might actually end up in a scenario where housing was treated as a speculative asset, with empty houses getting flipped between investors looking to make a quick buck, further lowering the supply of actual places to live (because housing units remain empty while being flipped), driving up the cost for families who just want a place to live. Oh wait..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;data is fungible?&#34; i think the author does not understand what fungibility means. if something is fungible, that means that any unit of it is exactly the same as any other unit of it. fungible data would be random data, which wouldn&#39;t help you predict or model anything.i think zillow also did not understand what fungibility means. real estate is not fungible. in fact, it&#39;s anti-fungible- that&#39;s why there are huge diligence processes that exist around most real estate transactions. maybe floors in an office building may be fungible, but residences are definitely not- with all their quirks, customizations and problems.this whole argument that they failed because the ceo of zillow didn&#39;t have big balls is pretty putrid. pair this with the word salad of misused words and twisting of quotes and i&#39;d say this is probably one of the worst pieces i&#39;ve ever seen posted here. i feel worse for having given it any time at all.the simple fact is that the ceo of zillow didn&#39;t know what they were doing, had a team that (supposedly) applied facebook&#39;s infrastructure scaling prediction library to house prices and then attempted to apply a market making mindset to the real estate market at scale. not only is this probably something nobody should try to do, considering we contribute so much in tax dollars to first time homebuying incentives as it&#39;s recognized that the housing market is where j q public can start to build wealth, it&#39;s also probably something that nobody could do (well, at scale, with machines) given that housing is not fungible.sure, financial instruments are fungible, maybe even late model cars, but definitely not houses. doesn&#39;t take a scientist to spot that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One example of quality design which I gleaned from reading Don Norman&#39;s &#34;The Design Of Everyday Things&#34; is the metal plate I&#39;ve frequently seen on doors which are meant to be pushed.The only affordance of such a plate is its push-ability, and the fact that someone actively installed a metal plate (instead of just relying on the door&#39;s natural flatness), as well as its location at the point of maximum leverage (all the way to the right of the door, in the door&#39;s vertical center), is a clear signifier for such push-ability.Not only that, but it does its job without offering any other confusing affordances (such as a vertical handle which is also technically pushable, but which many would interpret as being meant to be pulled).Whenever I need a relatable, succinct example of affordances and signifiers for my engineering comrades, I turn to this one.  Anyone interested in design is doing themselves a dis-service by not reading Don Norman&#39;s classic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BitTorrent is amazing. It just works. Anyone anywhere can create a torrent of their files, dump the magnet link somewhere, and everyone else can reliably retrieve it. It is self-reinforcing; the more people using a torrent, the better the robustness, redundancy and download speeds. You can often get better speeds from downloading something via torrent than from a web server. It&#39;s an open protocol that is relatively easy to implement, it has a diversity of lightweight clients for all OSes and is fairly resistant to censorship. To me it&#39;s pretty much perfect tech that solves a real problem. I hope Bram Cohen got rich off of it somehow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is factually incorrect when it talks about &#34;SEPA payments&#34;, claiming they are a &#34;pull&#34; mechanism. What it probably meant to talk about, is SEPA Direct Debits -- where the counterpart charges your account, as opposed to you paying the counterpart. Given that these direct debit agreements are revokable at any point in time, I doubt the claims of very high fraud rate.A normal SEPA payment, is a &#34;push&#34; affair. These have (for all intents and purposes, though not technically) been a thing ever since the euro was introduced, whereas SEPA Direct Debit is more recent, replacing many of the existing domestic direct debit schemes.Then there&#39;s the Instant Payments bit: these are a thing but they&#39;re not used all that often (yet?). Most banks charge a hefty fee for an instant payment (mine charges €1.25). Some banks don&#39;t offer them at all. Adoption will grow and costs will decrease over time.In most countries, payments within the same bank have been instant (and free) for a very long time. This is one of the reasons why many companies have accounts with multiple banks.I&#39;m sure some &#34;weaker&#34; european countries may have laxer fraud controls, but that&#39;s a temporary problem. ECB reporting is quite strict, and most banks do take fraud detection very seriously. Reputation is important for a bank, and if you&#39;re a truly disreputable bank you&#39;ll soon find yourself without friendly correspondent banks. Then you&#39;ll have a choice: fix your fraud problems, or become a useless island."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Odd not to touch on Open Banking and PSD2 in Europe; as that is basically the future he is talking about.In essence; financial institutions are legislated to add customer friendly UX and fraud prevention on top of standard bank to bank transfers. It&#39;s effectively a set of APIs that orchestrate it all, with things like dynamic linking to the payment and secure authentication rules for anti fraud.The idea is for commercial offerings to build on top of the standard APIs (for example, to offer bank transfers in checkouts). In practice it&#39;s taking a bit to get off the ground - but providers like Tink (sold to Visa for a lot of money) and Truelayer and starting to get traction.Australia and MENA region are heading down the same route.https://www.openbanking.org.uk/Edit; for clarity, SEPA was the early moves to normalise what the European banks were doing from around 2008 onwards - and ended up with PSD1 rationalising it. As others have said this blog mostly only actually focuses on the direct debit element of SEPA not the credit payment side."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When discussing Europe, you can&#39;t leave out the rise of mobile payments that work similar to India&#39;s UPI.For instance, in Sweden, &#34;Swish&#34;[0] has quickly taken over the market for casual payments, with free, instant, irreversible bank transfers between individuals using only the recipients phone number (or a QR code).They are a bunch of these systems, but currently they are all fractured into national systems, although work has started on adding interoperability[1][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swish_(payment)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Mobile_Payment_System..."</p>

I don’t know where in EU you are, but most of FANG has roles in EU and some even do remote as well.Smaller companies tend to want principal engineers in theory, but as you are finding they can often struggle with how to utilize them properly.  Often you see them playing a Chief Architect role or something similar which is more hybrid with PM than pure tech.  So getting PM skills could help set you up for this direction as well.Finally, you have said you did management for a bit before, so you should know if this is an interesting path or not.  This is a very different role, so I would recommend you do this only if you have the passion and desire to do this full time.  Most principal engineers I know have done management for a bit and gained a lot of skills related to it, but ultimately wasn’t what they wanted to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I turned 40 recently and have gone the route of very flexible employment (~16 hrs per week remote) at Sr software engineer salary. This gives me the freedom to do basically anything I want for more than half the day with very low stress. For the past decade nobody at my several places of employment has had reason to know how few hours I work because I’m always the top performer.I’m intending now to build software outside of the day job until I’m bootstrapped into doing that full time. I feel this is a setup which absorbs risk while giving both future opportunity and a high quality of life in the meanwhile.I’m tempted at times to go for some super high paid position which I’m very qualified for, but it always comes back to a preference for near total freedom to live my life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cannot stand how everything with internet access is just becoming a vehicle to shove ads down everyone’s throat. This web browser wants to sell me credit deals. My expensive TV has banner ads in the menus (well, it did until I blocked about two dozen domains). An increasing amount of apps are sending “offers” I never requested via push notifications on my phone.My belongings are not a fucking corporate billboard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It allows any purchase between $35 and $1,000 made through Microsoft Edge to be split into four payments over a six-week period.&gt; While the service is being promoted as ‘interest-free’, some were quick to point out that all transactions are subject to a “$4 flat fee”.$4 in fees on $1000 over 6 weeks is an effective APR of around 4% - pretty good. $4 in fees on $35 over 6 weeks is an outrageous APR of around 123%. I&#39;m guessing Zip is hoping most people are closer to the latter than the former. I wonder what kind of cut Microsoft is getting.[1] https://www.calculator.net/apr-calculator.html?cloanamount=3..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these discussion about APR and napkin math and installment is missing the point a bit, in my opinion.My problem is not even that Edge collects unnecessary and allows what could be called a most intrusive third party add into its browser per se, I am mostly amazed by how incredibly tacky this looks and feels from Microsoft&#39;s side.Like, imagine buying a Lexus and discovering they are advertisements for a cheap off-brand energy drink plastered on the interior.I find it straight up incredible that Microsoft somewhat achieved to overcome the meme status of its browser after what, fifteen years, and now this? Passing on the the crown of being the lowest common denominator tech joke to someone else, gaining a little bit of market share and even one or two positive reviews in respected outlets...only to risk it all in this weird move of behaving like a shady car salesman for what must a be a double digit million deal at most, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are incredibly reluctant to believe that ailments might actually be partly or mainly psychological. Chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, chronic lyme disease, back pain, are all things that sincere people truly are suffering from...that may be mainly psychological/psychosomatic but lots of people refuse to consider it. Probably due to the general dismissal of mental illnesses and being told for years &#34;it&#39;s all in your head&#34;. I think partly, people with these conditions are sometimes accused (or think they&#39;re being accused) of malingering; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case very often, I think they legitimately feel the symptoms they report, but the root cause may be in the mind/brain rather than the rest of the body.Yes, some back pain is due to repetitive stress injuries or physical structures out of place or whatever. But as this study shows, looks like it has a strong psychological component as well. I suspect we&#39;ll (some day) get better treatments for all the things I mention, if mental illness stigma ends and they can be honestly considered from all possible causes.Edit: to be clear, I&#39;m not saying that all cases of back pain or CFS or whatever are psychosomatic - just that it shouldn&#39;t be dismissed, especially when the treatments are relatively low-risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometime in 1990 I injured my back. I still remember the details. The injury was caused by a strong sneeze while I was bent over picking up a briefcase. In a single second, I couldn&#39;t stand, I couldn&#39;t get up off of my knees. It was really quite bad. I went to a few doctors and got advice, but it was more along the lines of it looks like degenerative disk disease. In a few weeks the pain went away and my back felt completely normal.I am posting this in the hope that some HN reader will find it useful.Since that original &#34;injury&#34; other seemly small stresses on my back, especially when leaning over or twisted to one side can trigger this sharp sudden onset persistent back pain. Even sleeping in the wrong bed while traveling can cause me problems. The strange thing is, it goes away on its own after a few weeks and then I feel fine. If I was a yoga practitioner I would believe that yoga was curing it, if I went to a chiropractor then I would believe that  chiropractic was curing my back, and if I was a meditator then I would believe that meditation was curing my back. Back issues like mine get better on their own after a few weeks, this explains why there is such a wide range of &#34;cures&#34; for back problems in general despite the wide variety of causes, some of which won&#39;t &#34;get better&#34; on their own.Of course I&#39;ve been to doctors, and the radiological diagnosis is degenerative disk disease, but I think this is common for any person with back pain and no obvious physical cause. Everyone thinks they know what is wrong. And I think that some of them are right and some of them are wrong.I don&#39;t believe that it has anything to do with my psychological state. I&#39;ve been through many stressful events in my life and had to work and live under high levels of mental pressure, I&#39;ve been happy, sad, frustrated on and off over the years--most people have. These states are not correlated in the least with the onset of my back pain. On the other hand, recovery could be affected by one&#39;s psychological state, being able to relax the back muscles so that back can heal requires some ability to deal with the mind-body issues and the anxiety causes by pain.I had a trainer that was always stressing functional fitness. This definitely didn&#39;t seem to be useful and was sometime injurious. Throwing medicine balls again a wall and doing every exercise one handed while balancing on one leg weren&#39;t helpful. The issue for me was the twisting that was encouraged by this training philosophy. Simply keeping fit and keeping my weight down were much more helpful.The best advice I got was from a consultation with a neurosurgeon. This physician was trained to do back surgery but uniquely also treated patients with alternative therapies when surgery wasn&#39;t clearly indicated. She encouraged me to take vitamin D, omega-3 supplements, and curcumin to reduce inflammation. This has been helpful to me, reducing the frequency, severity, and duration of my back problems. Consulting with her also reduced my anxiety over pain and this might be mitigating the severity of the episodes.Golf -- the was very bad for me, an hour at the driving range could produce debilitating pain that made walking even with a cane almost impossible. I was just learning--maybe I was doing it wrong.Running and jogging -- these didn&#39;t seem to bother my back at the time I was doing it. I was able to train for and run marathons and even a wild cross country obstacle course race. I&#39;m not a great runner, but I was able to place well in my age group. What I found was that marathon training is time consuming and leads to some muscle imbalances. My lower back (and upper body too) got weaker because my exercise was just running. The tightness in my lower back from hours of running also gave me concern and occasional, brief, but significant discomfort in my lower back. Overall though, I didn&#39;t feel that my back bothered me any more than the typical running overuse injuries, like planter fasciitis, knee pain, or IT band pain afflicting my fellow runners. I was able to finish all of the marathons I started training for (training takes around 7 months if you already do a bit of jogging). I hope this encourages people to remain active if their back pain is like mine (I understand that there are many types). I do wonder if so much running could be hard on the disks, does anyone know?Brazilian Jujitsu -- I had to give it up. I never got hurt, but I felt it was the sort of thing that a senior citizen with back problems should not be doing.Sitting and sleeping -- surprising to me was that thick memory foam mattresses that was supposed to be good for backs (Tempur-Pedic back in the 90s) bothered my back while a very firm mattress on top of a solid platform didn&#39;t. For the sake of my spouse, I found that one of the Casper mattresses works for both of us.Some chairs are great, and some end up causing me back issues. The Zero Gravity Recliner is great, but now they seem very pricey. I got my unmotorized one years ago. When I have a bad episode of pain, sitting in it is one of the only ways I can get relief.I use an adjustable height standing/sitting desk with a Motion Stool by UPLIFT. The adjustable desk helps me be things just right, and I&#39;ve discovered that chairs like the Motion Stool, while requiring some getting use to, allow me to work for hours at my desk without discomfort.It&#39;s really terrible to be in bad back pain, but for me, I&#39;ve found some adjustments to my lifestyle have allowed me to be very happy and to hold off on employing more drastic measures for thirty year so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This treatment is based on the work of Dr John Sarno - who I first heard of here on HN almost 10 years ago. And of all the wonderful things I’ve discovered on HN, Dr Sarno’s work is probably the one that’s had the biggest positive impact on my life.When I first heard about his approach to chronic pain, I was pretty skeptical. But I’d tried everything else to solve my debilitating RSI, and nothing else had worked despite only being in my early 20s, so I was willing to give it a try. 6 months later, I was back working pain-free after being out of action for 2 years.As patmcc mentions, people can be incredibly reluctant to believe that physical pain can have psychological causes. And in many cases, there are underlying physical issues, so this should certainly not be your first approach to treatment. But if you’ve tried everything and nothing works, I encourage you to take a look at Sarno’s work. It made a world of difference for me and for many others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am confused, this seems more like a general math cheatsheet. The only thing that truly has anything to do with theoretical CS are the definitions for the O-notation on the first page (and most CS students don&#39;t need a cheat-sheet for that) and the master theorem. Nothing on P, NP, NP-hardness or completeness, formal languages (Chomsky hierarchy?), finite automata, Turing machines, halting problem, decision problem, reduction proofs, Pumping lemma, Gödels incompleteness theorem, etc. This sheet would have been of very little help in any theoretical computer science exam I ever took. The only cheat sheet I ever needed in theoretical CS was Schönings book &#34;Theoretische Informatik - kurz gefasst&#34; (&#34;A short overview of theoretical CS&#34;, well, it has ~180 pages...), which is pretty standard in German universities. It was completely worn out after my first semester + exam of theoretical CS... here is a TOC: http://www.gbv.de/dms/hebis-mainz/toc/094349797.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s just me, but when a cheatsheet reaches 10 pages and includes multiple areas like this one I&#39;d just split it up into multiple ones. It almost feels like this needs a table of contents.And I think a bit more theoretical CS stuff, maybe a few diagrams, would be more helpful than e.g. the Pythagorean theorem or the powers of 2 which shouldn&#39;t be a problem to just memorize at that level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is only a showcase of TeX, the actual value of this cheat-sheet seems pretty low.I used to know most of this when I was in uni, including how to derive it when I needed it. Back then this kind of cheat-sheet would not have helped me apply my knowledge. The actual knowledge was very clear in my head from solving problems, or I remembered some key idea used during derivation and from there could work out the rest.If you need this kind of cheat-sheet you don&#39;t understand the concepts deep enough.Unfortunately most of this knowledge is now 15 years later either very fuzzy or completely lost from my mind. I guess that happens when it is not being refreshed/applied during the career I chose.This cheat-sheet serves a reminder of how much knowledge I have lost ;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey!We wondered what to do to make building layouts even faster while adding more fun elements to our daily work. After a while, the inspiration came! Why not randomize the components while having fun, like at a slot machine in a casino?The idea generator combines available UI components into finished layouts. You choose the technology, the library, click &#34;Shuffle!&#34; and boom, ready-made layout. Click again, and you have a new layout.Based on our No AI®, and No Blockchain®, and Pure Random® technology. ;)What do you think?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wonderful idea, great implementation!Would love to see you guys partnering with TailwindUI somehow. That&#39;s my default go-to ui widgets library (it&#39;s not open source, so it might be challenging to find a proper partnership model with them).Just bought a lifetime subscription. And as I already do have subscription - my last recommendation is to switch to monthly subscription model as soon as you can. Monthly subscriptions is just so much more profitable pricing model:)Congrats again on shipping great product!Edit: typos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is neat! I’ll add it to my box of no/low-code tools.I do feel like not letting the homepage itself shuffle its layout is a missed opportunity for showcasing the product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Around 6 or 7 years ago, I went to a quantum computing conference and presented about a then newly developed quantum programming language that could run on a real quantum computer, showing a 1/2 decent simulation of dihydrogen energy in terms of bond length.I authored a paper about this quantum programming language but had no way to post it to the arXiv. I&#39;m not a traditional academic, but I had posted on the arXiv before, long ago, at a previous job. Problem was that my arXiv credentials were associated with that job&#39;s long lost email.I gave the presentation in a giant ballroom, and afterward, sat down at my assigned spot at one of these large circular tables. Next to me, during a brief coffee break, an old man I didn&#39;t recognize told me my talk was very interesting, and asked me if my paper was published yet. &#34;Not yet; we haven&#39;t chosen a journal. And posting to the arXiv is delayed, because my account is locked, so a colleague is planning to post on my behalf.&#34;The man responds, &#34;Oh, it should be possible to fix that.&#34; I said that I figured as much and have just procrastinated contacting the admins. &#34;They&#39;re at Cornell right?&#34;He said, &#34;No, I mean, I can fix that. You said your name was Reikon Musha right?&#34;He opens his clunky laptop and continues, &#34;I&#39;m not supposed to do this. But I&#39;m certain that if you gave an invited talk here, you&#39;re definitely not spoofing your name. Maybe you can show me your ID? No, no, just kidding.&#34;He continues clicking around. &#34;Was xyz@example.com your old address? What&#39;s your new one?&#34; I answered yes, and gave him my new address. He typed it in and said, &#34;straight into the database it goes; just go and reset your password now.&#34;I was absolutely puzzled. I said, &#34;Thanks?? Who are you?&#34;He says, as a matter of fact, &#34;I&#39;m Paul, I invented the arXiv.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago (think: 1994) scientists (mainly CS folks) published papers on the web as postscript files.  Actually, they were usually on FTP sites, not the web, as almost nobody used the web at the time.  I developed a huge aversion to postscript (it was clunky and the renderers weren&#39;t great) but the idea that every bit of published science would be freely available on the web seemed completely and totally obvious to me.When I later became an academic, I learned that when you write a paper and submit it, conditions for publication typically include signing away the copyright to the journal, possibly with a license to distribute a few preprints offline.My advisor at the time pointed out that he actually modified the contract (changing the terms to retain copyright), signed it and sent it back (no journal ever complained, and all his papers are available as PDFs online).arxiv is the closest thing to what I dreamt of some decades ago and I&#39;m thrilled that Paul is receiving recognition.  Personally, I think arxiv is a better path forward than scihub, entirely due to its &#34;legitimacy&#34;.  In the future, I will always work to &#34;publish&#34; on arxiv and not put my work in journals (fortunately, I am not in a publish or perish situation).My only complaint is that I don&#39;t particularly like PDF and wish there was an HTML-zip format that could be sent around and the browser did all the rendering work, while the udnerlying data tables are stored in well-defined formats so they can be programatically extracted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Nobel Prize in Physics often goes to &#34;tooling&#34; experimental work.  Think: blue LEDs, CCDs, fiber optics, optical tweezers, things like that.  Not that anybody asks me, but I would advocate a similar tooling award split between Berners-Lee (www), Knuth (TeX), and Ginsparg (arXiv).  I can think of no people who had a more profound change in how physics is actually practiced."</p>

The original painting[2] has a gem[3] in the corner of it (that&#39;s not visible in[1]): where death is wreaking havoc, and a pair of lovers, oblivious to it, are playing guitar and singing.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever you hear news about mutated COVID and how fast it spreads there are a few important things to remember.1. Viruses are constantly mutating, its kind of their thing.2. Most mutations do absolutely nothing or are actually harmful to the virus.3. When a new mutation is noted to be spreading fast its usually because of the nature of super spreader events and not because the new mutation is more or less transmissible.4. Scientist and health officials should absolutely be keeping an eye on these things.[0] Vincent Racaniello - SARS-CoV-2 UK variant: Does it matter

For one thing, it wouldn&#39;t work without endless other streams or authoritarian security theater measures (that in any case themselves don&#39;t really work most of the time) And for another thing, &#34;stop the spread&#34; is an idiotic notion without heavy qualification. Stop death? Sure, Stop large quantities of hospitalizations? That too, albeit with cost/benefit calculations applied to all measures, but stopping spread itself for its own sake? Absurd paranoia that has no merit the moment the thing spreading stops being a truly widespread threat. We have lived with colds and flus for all our history without obsessing over their spread. COVID among those who are already immunized or vaccinated is comparably dangerous to common flu strains."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using PHP since 5.x. Often had to work on older 4.x web apps. I find it interesting when I read people saying &#34;PHP has come a long way. It&#39;s a proper language now, etc.&#34;If you work long enough with a language and figure out most its quirks, it&#39;s a breeze. It&#39;s nice that they are adding all these new features, but they are hardly what makes it or break it for me.Here is the one features that is taken for granted in &#34;modern stacks&#34;:Edit file -&gt; Alt+tab ctrl+R. Oops, Alt+tab fix -&gt; Alt+tab ctrl+R.When debugging I can do that 50 times a minute. With my react app, I can do it maybe 5 times a minute. With my golang app I&#39;m lucky if I can do it twice a minute."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone laughing at PHP hasn&#39;t tried it for years, I&#39;d bet.
It started clumsy, true, but it became a solid and quite elegant way of doing things.And by things I don&#39;t mean just web development.The current limitations I see in PHP is that there is not an official multi-core coroutines solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use C#, Javascript and PHP a lot.PHP always wins when it comes to deployment and productivity. In my opinion that&#39;s the power of PHP.It&#39;s also versatile. I used it for small projects, multi-million € projects, COM-port communication, API communication, prototyping and what not.The syntax is not great, but to me PHP is this multi-tool that just gets the job done and will run reliable for years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They bury the lede in the last fucking paragraph.  The reason this toaster is immensely better than the toaster you have at home is very, very simple: this toaster&#39;s 1949 price would be hundreds of dollars in 2021 terms.You can still buy really, truly excellent toasters made for industrial/commercial use, or for the homes of the very rich, and they&#39;re quite a lot better than the trash people keep in their houses.  And they cost a lot more, too.  Last time I checked, a commercial 2-slice toaster was in the $300-$400 range.This is true for lots of home appliances.  My favorite example is the Kitchenaid mixer.  The modern mixers are very thoroughly &#34;value engineered&#34; to keep the price down.   If you want to buy an original &#34;Kitchenaid,&#34; like they made in the 1930s, you can call up Hobart and buy a miniature mixer.  And it will cost you ~$2,000 in 2021, just as it did in 1935.You can have the good toaster, the good mixer, etc, but it sure looks like people don&#39;t actually want that.  The pattern of product offerings in your average store suggests people want something affordable, and it doesn&#39;t particularly matter whether it is good at its job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since everyone is mentioning Technology Connections (he deserves it, great channel), I want to bring up this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiS27feX8o0To me, this really shows the sad direction smart appliances have gone in. I would love to see that smart appliances would have continued to evolve in this direction. I don&#39;t like the current state of smart appliances, but going back to the absolute basic seems like an over-reaction to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As Java is generally the fastest GC&#39;d language, what&#39;s the current state of Java gamedev?Once upon a time, this indie Java game called Minecraft became the most successful game of all time.But from the few minutes of research I just did, Java cannot be deployed to many commercially important systems  - Nintendo Switch
  - PlayStation
  - iOS

It appears Java is only still viable for Windows and Android, and the 1% Linux desktop market.There used to be the GCJ project which would in theory let you run Java anywhere you had a C/C++ compiler, but Oracle&#39;s litigiousness killed that because the Java[TM] &#34;platform&#34; must run the official Java[TM] bytecode.It appears C# via Monogame lets you deploy to all desktops (Win/Mac/Linux), mobiles (iOS/Android), and consoles (PS/Switch/Xbox). So ironically C# seems to now be the &#34;write once, run anywhere&#34; fulfillment of the original Java promise.[EDIT: grammar.]"</p>

CMS was the go-to option for low-latency collection for a long time, so it would be good to see how it compares to the modern options.It would be particularly interesting from the perspective of someone working in a shop which still has lots of latency-sensitive-ish workloads running on JDK 8 with CMS!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all — I wrote these notes with my colleagues at PSL while trying to wrap our heads around the madness that is Web3/Crypto. I’m an engineer by background and sort of a skeptic by nature; I think of this piece as a collection of loosely connected, hopefully pragmatic opinions from a builder’s perspective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for the great article! I wished the section on DeFi addressed the biggest elephant in the room, overcollateralization. A DeFi borrower always needs to lock in more assets as collateral than what they are borrowing, thus defeating the whole purpose for taking a loan aside from financial speculation. And there&#39;s no real way to solve it: all mechanisms I&#39;ve heard of either try to replicate some form of background checks on borrowers (not decentralised, and uses the real world), or claim to use real-world assets as NFT collateral (once again, uses the real world). Thus I can&#39;t see a way for DeFi loans to ever be used for mortgages and other loans regular people actually need.Of course DeFi is more than just loans and borrowing, but that&#39;s an aspect that&#39;s constantly promoted by evangelists so I think it&#39;s an important point to mention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Web3 requires retrofitting the web to use blockchain technologies to do what the web can mostly do already.In &#34;Blockchains Are a Bad Idea&#34;, James Mickens gives several arguments against blockchain-based systems like Bitcoin:See his presentation here: https://youtu.be/15RTC22Z2xI1. People have out-of-band trust relationships in real life which reduce the likelihood of malice. Bitcoin-style anonymous identities undermine trust relationships and are not needed for legitimate (not illegal) transactions.2. Real life legal systems encourage good behaviors. If you have a dispute with someone, you can sue them. Bitcoin and related systems lack these protections.3. Existing tools such as public-key cryptography and digital signatures can provide most of the functionality that applications need without the problems that blockchain-based systems have."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a coder I don&#39;t think I can do anything without the internet. Even if one specific site (maybe there are two actually, SO and GH) were down, it would wreck my day and many of yours.My style of coding is very intimately connected to having access to online resources. I regularly search for things like how to concatenate strings or the syntax of a for loop in some language. I also use the internet for higher level things like how memory management works on some system, or how something like an ECS architecture works. I also spend a lot of time looking for the right components to put into my own systems, so if GitHub were down it would bother me.Basically I&#39;d be useless without the internet. The coding tools themselves, all the examples of how to use them, and all the actual knowledge about how everything works is on there.Perhaps the only thing that&#39;s actually my own input is the judgement about what things are important, which sources are reliable, and which people are authorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I&#39;m starting to identify a lot of cases where looking things up in an external resource is a deeper mental disruption than remembering it, even if the lookup is just as fast or even faster.  (Or, it&#39;s possible that the external lookup only seems faster because the several mechanical steps compress my perception of time, like keyboard navigation can seem faster than the mouse, even when it isn&#39;t.)For example, I find that when I&#39;m working with an API enough that I am frequently looking up the same operations, investing twenty minutes in identifying and reviewing the important operations, as if I were preparing for an exam where I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to consult external resources, pays off in fluency and immersion.Another example is that when I am reading a history book, before I start, I review relevant names and contemporary dates.  Then when I find myself thinking, &#34;Wait, at this time, how long ago was X?  Has Y happened yet?&#34; I can answer from memory.  This gives me a richer reading experience than if I needed to remove myself from the context of the book to look up those dates.I know memorization is seen negatively from a pedagogical standpoint, and schoolchildren find it alienating and discouraging, but I think when you have enough experience to understand the value of it, so that the work to achieve it isn&#39;t such a negative experience in itself, judicious application of it has a lot of power to make your work easier and your learning experiences richer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started developing software in the days before the Internet. It was indeed very different. My choices about what to remember and how I remember things have changed significantly since the ubiquitous availability of searchable information. I no longer have tomes of K&amp;R, processor manuals, Inside Macintosh or Java books on my desk. The only technical book which happens to be on my desk at the moment is &#34;Anti-patterns&#34;.I have been &#34;weeding&#34; my paper books, especially technical books over the last couple of years and gotten rid of an entire bookshelf of books. I still have an entire bookshelf with Knuth TAoCP, math books, type theory, graphics, graph theory, control theory, physics and some nostalgic books like my original Motorola 68000 processor guide, Rodney Zaks Z80 book, &#34;Adventure game programming in BASIC&#34;, Commodore 64 Innerspace Compendium, etc.When a puppy chewed up my copy of &#34;Linux in a Nutshell&#34; I was tempted to buy the new edition but decided to try it online for a month with O&#39;Reilly Safari through work and have not bothered to replace the paper copy for more than 2 years.I would categorize the main change in style of memory as a shift from focus on remembering details and facts, which I can look up, to using memory for decision trees, processes and methodologies which either can&#39;t be looked up or are significantly personally customized. I consciously &#34;outsource&#34; the simpler and to me, less valuable, aspects of memory. Some of this is handled automatically by the IDE I use and the rest is done with mostly Google searches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In that same time period, my &#34;plant light&#34; timer, a $15 mechanical item of a design unmodified since the 1970s, has worked flawlessly, requiring attention only when the clocks change or my schedule does. It has not informed Google, Amazon, or anyone else about its job or anything else in my home. It has generated no royalties nor invoked any support or ongoing maintenance costs. It has never needed a software upgrade.&#34;Smart Home&#34; stuff even since the &#34;x10&#34; standards has been a solution looking for a problem to solve. A hobby for the homeowner who wants to ride the high side of the Laffer curve in effort and expense. It could be argued that quiet, flawless functioning of these products would be exactly what the customer doesn&#39;t want in this product space.Compare it to model trains: is that hobby focused around having a lovely little table set up and watching the trains run? Or is the actual focus the torn up mess that&#39;s under construction and &#34;we can&#39;t play with it right now but i can get it assembled to show the kids by Tuesday&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did my whole house in Lutron’s smart switches (close to 50 of them), and I think it’s good? It’s been about 2 years now and I really haven’t had any issues.The switches aren’t Wi-Fi connected, because Wi-Fi would be an awful choice for 50 devices that you only communicate with a few times a day. They use their own wireless frequency and communicate in a really simple/reliable way to the bridge, which is wired to my router and doesn’t need an internet connection to work.There’s no always-running cloud service, the light switches work even when the internet is down (and I can still use the home app too in such an event, just no voice control.)Siri is finicky sometimes, but I’d wager a 97% success rate in saying things like “set the scene Evening Downstairs” and “turn off all the lights except in the bedroom.”My favorite aspect is that the pico switches can be programmed to switch whole rooms of lights on and off, which makes it so much nicer in the basement where I have 18 different lights to turn on and I can just hit one switch on my way downstairs and it’s fully illuminated (no voice command necessary) and I don’t have to visit 18 light switches to turn them off again.Home automation tech must be invisible and fall back gracefully, and must always be interact-able in a “dumb” way, or else it’s just playing games IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think any software engineer with some industry experience will absolutely NOT install a device in his home that receives automatic updates over the internet and is critical for performing some task or using some basic functionality of the house; especially one that has a well known, highly stable and ergonomic traditional mode of interaction - controlling the lights and water, opening the windows and shades etc.We know from experience that a nebulous interface that can change without notice and provides no clear contract is a asking for trouble and will break your house &#34;build&#34;, so to speak, or worse, it will bork at the worst possible moment, when you have &#34;clients&#34; over.In the early years of home electricity, there was a much higher chance of getting electrocuted or burning to a crisp, outlets had no grounding, insulation and conductors were of a bad quality etc. Similarly, the whole field of home automation is in its infancy, in a few decades most major mistakes will be made and early adopters will work out the kinks out of the technology (and find out why it&#39;s a bad idea to have an internet connected microphone listening in your home at all times)."</p>

But all this time, HN has always been my most visited month after month.I can always count on this place to keep me up to date with the latest tech trends and read discussions between reasonable people. Thank you all and especially dang for keeping discussions high quality. Especially as the quality of content on the rest of the internet deteriorates in the pursuit of virility.It&#39;s a testament to you all that place feels the same as it did 10+ years ago."</p>

I feel like I’ve grown up on this site in so many ways.I am continually humbled by not just the consistent quality of content but also the comments. It’s a testament to the moderators that this site has maintained this level of quality for so long.I am thankful and happy to use thanksgiving as an excuse to express that notion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was recently in a meeting with a colleague about some recent craziness that just finished. A lot of hard work, not fun, but ended up just fine. Then a few minutes later, I find out her daughter is in the hospital, so she&#39;s been back-and-forth there a lot, and her life is exponentially more crazy than my own. I felt terrible for complaining about my dumb issues. Work&#39;s hard sometimes, but it&#39;s so small in comparison.The upside of the conversation is that I&#39;ve felt extra thankful this year- I have friends/family/coworkers going through sickness, abuse, divorce, coming out of the closet, and more, and it puts my concerns in perspective. My life is far from perfect, but I&#39;m grateful for what I do have.I know very little about any of you personally, but I hope you continue to share your knowledge, wisdom, dumb anecdotes, and opinions both great and terrible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Im thankful to have a job and a roof over my head and a little bit of savings. Not having to really worry about money still blows my mind now and then.Looking across the street every day in California and seeing the homelessness crisis in full swing is an ever present reminder of what this economy and this society can do to you if you slip up for even a second and / or have even a minor run of bad luck.Working in software isn&#39;t always easy or fun or fulfilling but its still an incredible privilege to be working in this industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m thankful for yeast. It’s so, so convenient that we have a non-pathogenic bacteria which will eat pretty much any simple sugar, can be found on the surfaces of most fruits, and is essentially effortless to cultivate, which also does a bunch of useful things like leaven bread and make a bunch of delicious short chain fatty acids (both in bread and on their own, like in marmite) and make alcohol (although that one maybe does more harm than good)!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s the automation that worries me. I&#39;m not too concerned about proper companies using CCTV to record, as it&#39;s well managed and gets deleted unseen, unless something happens. I&#39;m not too concerned about the police pulling those CCTV pictures to investigate a crime either.Things like ring doorbells on the other hand should be cracked down - the number of times I see people in the UK posting pictures of public areas on facebook is shocking, but if they&#39;re just sat there, being deleted unless pulled for a proper reason, that&#39;s fine too.What really does concern me is when things like image recognition come into the picture. A corporation can&#39;t montior me by paying someone to sift through CCTV pictures. They can montior me by using automation to process everything though.This is a good thing, how successful it is remains to be seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a lawyer here but it seems that there are exceptions carved out:In particular, we ask the Commission to prohibit, in law and in practice, indiscriminate or arbitrarily-targeted uses of biometrics which can lead to unlawful mass surveillance.-So long as it is discriminate and non-arbitrary that can be ok then?We have seen so many legal justifications and equivocations to laws from the surveillance state that I now assume legal counsel will always find a way to break the prima facie law.German intelligence broke many German laws with the NSA, while Merkel virtue signaled and decried the NSA (comparing them to the Stasi) and Obama spying on her.https://www.dw.com/en/edward-snowden-germany-a-primary-examp...https://www.dw.com/en/danish-secret-service-helped-us-spy-on...https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/merkel-compare..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m generally positively surprised by the coalition-agenda (Koalitionsvertrag) that was presented by the upcoming German government yesterday. Fairly centrist policies and a focus on modernization. There&#39;s a separate question about how much of it will actually be implemented, but the uncommon mix of three fairly different parties seems to have created a sensible equilibrium."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made https://github.com/msloth/lgtv.js which can control a webos LGTV on your local network. It was in my js beginnings so pretty sketchy and not at all clean. Once I was able to control it I kind of lost interest in making it more tweakable, cleaner interface etc, but there are others that did.At home I now run a small rpi0 with a telegram bot that, among other things, acts as a LGTV command proxy. So on my phone, I now tell my telegram bot eg &#34;movie&#34; which then puts the tv on the right input, sets volume, dims some hue lights and shows a nice float on the TV with a welcoming message.It&#39;s also useful when I can&#39;t find the physical remote, or to send messages like &#34;dinner in 10&#34; (that shows on the TV screen in a float) to a gaming child with selective hearing enabled :)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It has been interesting watching the concept of Black Friday (and cyber monday) evolve over the past 20 or so years from being mostly an &#34;American big box retailer dumping excess stock&#34; thing to &#34;oh boy its black Friday, time to go buy stuff!&#34; thing. The entire event has basically been undeservingly co-opted by everyone looking to cash in on hype over an event that basically doesn&#39;t even resemble what made it a thing in the first place.Just like how for singles day in Asia, retailers shamelessly just jack prices up beforehand to make their sale prices look like discounts. These events seem more about whipping the naive mainstream consumer into a consumption frenzy than having real deals to be excited about. While those deals still exist, they are like nuggets of gold that you have to sift through the noise to find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who use Amazon and want cost perspective on particular items, Camelcamelcamel is a superpower (https://camelcamelcamel.com/)I’m sure one day I’ll find out they make money in all sorts of sketchy ways, but in the mean time it’s a great free website, and I’m continually astounded to see how often retailers play around with the prices they post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This have been a joke for a few years here in Brazil, we call the day &#34;Black Fraud&#34;  (sounds a little better in Portuguese)The relevant point is that Black Friday is an &#34;artificial&#34; event here: we do not celebrate Thanksgiving Day so there is no need for a the stores to get rid of unsold inventory. It started just ~10 years ago when marketers began advertising it as a sales day."</p>

I&#39;m saving the file for a later review and this name will guarantee I either completely lose the file or will spend more time than necessary to locate it. The other option is to rename the file on saving, which is some work which needs to be performed by each user, instead of being done just once on the source. I think this is just impolite.Here&#39;s a proper name you can copy-paste:Mike_Rosulek_-_The_Joy_Of_Cryptography_(draft_2021-01-03).pdfPS: The short-link-for-verbal-sharing problem is solved via a symbolic link."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Myself going from &#34;web designer&#34; to a &#34;zero-knowledge proof cryptographer&#34; (I&#39;m a coauthor of Dalek Bulletproofs implementation, the cleanest API, documentation and fastest ZKP system ever) I&#39;m sad to see crypto textbooks spending most of the time on symmetric ciphers, going through the same nonsense like ECB and then touching asymmetric only with RSA and annoying GCD stuff when everyone moved onto elliptic curves already.I&#39;d like to see material around modern stuff (Keccak and ECC) with only a cursory discussion of pitfalls of the past standards in contrast with the current stuff. And more time on asymmetric, discrete log and fiat-shamir protocols that are so much fun and require really a 7th grade algebra to grasp.I&#39;ve also made a couple of videos on ECC basics with that approach: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0r9S76wngNPJb_GlhJYdwEDIT: what i mean, is focus first on how to use primitives and what they promise, rather than how they actually work. Once you feel like you can play with these legos, it&#39;s more fun to dig deeper and see why ECDLP is hard and how ciphers are made. But please don&#39;t start from within - it&#39;s an annoying boring mess that distracts from the true beauty: the cool things you can build with these tools."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, no shit, Sherlock!!Everybody who has been renting or has been buying a home in the last 10 years knows this...All the cash that&#39;s been &#34;pumped into the economy&#34; has only fueled inequalities. It&#39;s gone in the pockets of those who were already wealthy enough to secure a loan. And yes, they did buy houses, and bitcoins, and stocks. Oh and then that caused the prices to go up, so whoever forgot to invest started doing it, pumping the early birds&#39; wealth up, allowing them to borrow even more. The whole economical landscape is bubbles everywhere.And now the FED can&#39;t really reverse it. If you start raising rates, and stopping QE, you&#39;re not actually getting the money back from the people you gave it to, you&#39;ll just get a lot of businesses to close.We need to erode all that capital concentration, and the only way to do it without hurting the regular guy is through heavy taxation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this is the single biggest malaise in society. “Investing” (speculating) in real estate creates nothing of value to society and instead serves only to artificially drive up the cost of shelter, a basic necessity. It also directs capital away from investing in technology and businesses.Due to the zero-sum nature of real estate, it fundamentally breaks the positive sum theory of capitalism. Adam Smith even called landlord’s right “theft”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think you can diagnose over-engineering after the fact. Unless you were in the room, or have access to written specs from a meticulously documented team, you don&#39;t understand the conditions under which the code was written.Maybe the company was betting at the time on an integrations marketplace, or a lot of partnerships, so a robust integration platform was built. Then the company moved on to another bet after only writing one or two integrations on the new platform. Nobody over-engineered here. Everything was built to spec. But three years down the line the new dev is going to get assigned a bug in one of the integrations and lament how the code was over-engineered. Hindsight is 20/20.Lots of stories from the trenches including many in this thread make this mistake. The same goes for &#39;tech debt&#39;. If you weren&#39;t there, you don&#39;t know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that bugs me is the notion that &#34;Software rewrites are something you should never do&#34;, which is a mantra so often repeated that it has acquired the status of self-evident truth, despite the only evidence being (usually) presented is an example of a web browser from 20 years ago! (Which incidentally spawned Mozilla, so not exactly a complete loss; especially from the POV of society rather than shareholders, but I digress).Having rewritten a bunch of systems (sometimes several times) I can attest that it will not always lead to the death of the company. The trick is of course having modular enough systems that they can be rewritten from scratch in a reasonable amount of time.It can also be a great way to increase the simplicity of the system as typically the old version was designed with a very imperfect understanding of the problem and no operational experience servicing it; further learning were usually crudely patched on top and you often end up in a conceptual hodge-podge where words mean subtly different things depending on the context and translation layers need to be inserted between the contexts etc.Often a (good) rewrite starts by clarifying the conceptual model. I like the saying &#34;clear writing reflects clear thinking&#34;, and in programming there is a lemma &#34;clear thinking produces clear code&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Complexity kills your product - Overengineering is just one instance of complexity - Technical Debt like having state and data all over the place is another one - I quit my last job and I happily blame this article for convincing me to quit: https://itnext.io/the-origin-of-complexity-8ecb39130fc - coordination causes complexity and this killed me - we had everything not once but twice or more in different places - just one example - it&#39;s much more complex but me and my colleagues were grinded between an old codebase that nobody understood anymore and kubernetes, ci, etc.pp on the other side because management sold this without understanding that you need a process and time for digesting and applying the concepts in the team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, I never really had that much love for Emacs until relatively recently.  I&#39;ve always dabbled due to it generally having good support for most languages (including esoteric ones) but recently I got into it a lot more due to the fact that many of the new-ish OSS editors but Emacs has always been there and likely will always be there.A few years back I got into Atom quite a bit since it checked all the boxes: extensible, open source, and it was very nice.  Then VSCode killed it.  And it seems more and more that VSCode is taking over, all the while inserting more proprietary code to the point where half the &#39;big&#39; plugins don&#39;t work on Codium, only the proprietary MS distribution.So I got back into Emacs but really worked on my environment.  Stopped dabbling and started just forcing myself to use it.  And it&#39;s honestly amazing.  It checks off every box available in VSCode and more.  And it&#39;s nice knowing that it&#39;ll always be there.  I&#39;m not against proprietary software per-se, but I definitely don&#39;t have a lot of trust in Microsoft."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For people who ask, &#34;why use text-only editors like vim or Emacs, when I can use a full GUI IDE?&#34;:One of the reasons I haven&#39;t seen mentioned much is: I&#39;m a touch typist, and I hate having to switch between mouse and keyboard! I have to take my attention off the screen. Slows me down. Disturbs my concentration.With Emacs, I can work for hours without ever having to hunt for the mouse, or without even having a mouse plugged in. That&#39;s particularly nice for using my Ubuntu laptop on a lap desk, leaning back in my armchair. The best mouse is no mouse at all.Yes, I know many IDEs have shortcut keys for some commands, but the basic assumption with GUI applications is that you have a mouse. Even if you learn the shortcuts, somehow you always end up having to use the mouse for some common task, e.g., to select a paragraph. That&#39;s why I never got to like a GUI IDE, despite having had to use Eclipse for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see lists like these. I’m a long time Emacs user and recently learned to use neovim. I made the same mistake many new Emacs users make in that I installed a lot of plugins at once and lost control of the editor. Only by installing packages incrementally after you have discovered a real need, can you keep mentally on top of what your editor is capable of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very nice.Regarding the comments about complexity of existing formats - I agree, with the exception of PNG. In terms of complexity, QOI is very similar to PNG filtering phases, i.e. when you strip primary compression phase (Huffman coding) from PNG.Also, I admire how the author combined a lot of common and cool tricks into QOI:- Block tags form a sort of a prefix code, making it easy to differentiate block types with differing sizes- Look-back array is used (common trick from LZW family)- Delta-coding is used when storing pixel diffs- In the end, if nothing else works, full pixel value is writtenAlso, the fact that everything is byte aligned is very appreciated.This is a breath of fresh air and really impressive how good performance (both processing and size reduction) this gets with so little (very readable!)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know you don&#39;t like &#34;design by committee&#34; and overly complex formats. Also, the compression algorithm itself is somewhat independent of the &#34;container format&#34; that it&#39;s used with.However, if I may make a suggestion: If you do end up rolling your own container format for any reason, always include a way to store the colour space of the image!Treating RGB images as arrays of bytes without further tags is like treating char* as &#34;text&#34; without specifying the code page. It could be UTF8. Or Latin-1. Or something else. You don&#39;t know. Other people don&#39;t know. There&#39;s often no way to tell.Similarly with colour spaces: sRGB, Display P3, and Adobe RGB are just close enough to be easily confused, but end up looking subtly wrong if mixed up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To keep things O(n) when encoding, there&#39;s only one lookup into this array. The lookup position is determined by a “hash” of the rgba value (really just r^g^b^a).Is a bit imprecise.
The algorithm would still be O(n) even with a linear search through the &#34;seen pixel array&#34;, as it is bounded by 64 length and therefore a constant factor that gets eaten by the Big-O notation.Because of this hash the algorythm seems to do something else than first described though.
Instead of &#34;a running array of the 64 pixels it previously encountered&#34;, it&#39;s actually the previous 64 pixel _values_ previously encountered, which allows for much bigger jumpback.By deterministically computing this array during execution it itself seems to act as a kind of compressed jumpback table, allowing for approximated arbitrary jumpback with just 6 bit.Quite impressive!Edit:
I think there might be an interesting tweak that could increase the effectiveness of the hashing technique used.If one were to walk and store the pixels in a Z-Curve order, the runtime would stay the same but the locality of the color value pool, might be increased."</p>

Used to work in the Austin fab, and the amount of money lost per minute in a power failure is mind boggling.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [10] Make your project robust to re-orgs. A company management hierarchy is inherently fragile (a tree is a 1-connected graph, after all); socialize the project continuously with managers who might take over in the future. Do whatever it takes to make sure that manager churn does not result in unfair career outcomes for ICs.&gt; [17] For storage systems, bias heavily in the beginning towards consistency and durability rather than availability; these are harder to measure and harder to fix if broken. Because availability is easier to measure, there will be external pressure to prioritize it first; push back.It&#39;s kind of crazy how well the author is able to move from the very top to the very bottom of the technical project management stack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think this is a great list however I think one of the major factors why this project succeeded isn&#39;t listed but is mentioned in the intro.&gt; We hit production with a 3-person team in less than a year; and subsequently scaled the team to 30+ engineers spanning multiple sub-teamsStarting with a small skilled team to build the core and actively plan for a larger team at some point is absolutely critical for project success in my experience, especially with complex projects like this. That small team can have a much tighter communication loop and all keep a single unified picture of what the end goal is. When the team grows this single unified picture is no longer feasible so it has to be broken down into sections, which is a good thing, but if the core isn&#39;t setup so that the sections are sufficiently decoupled things fall apart quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lot of good, actionable learnings there. I liked this one in particular.&gt; [26] In a transparent codebase with quick review cycles, APIs will leak implementation details unless you gate-keep.It&#39;s tempting to make quick fixes to APIs but please take it slow. Think through existing customers as well as how could new ones will use it.Also, something I learned while building/maintaining public APIs was to always clearly document (along with examples) the context in which an API should (ideally) be used and how it combines with other APIs to enable common use cases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anything, I think stablecoins are way more dangerous than the author indicates.People talk about things like Bitcoin as a threat to sovereign currencies, and they are, as competitors, of sorts. But stablecoins are another matter entirely. One huge aspect of the value of sovereign currencies is that they are instruments of law -- courts will settle in them as a lowest common denominator, and it is safe to use them in all sorts of settings as a result.When dollar-denominated assets appear, they always run the risk of being considered a dollar-equivalent. For example, bank deposits are dollar-denominated, and are considered dollar-equivalent (even dollar-superior, in the sense that there are transactions that you can&#39;t legally do with specie, only with bank deposits, like buy stocks). That means that if banks (which are businesses) are not good at doing business, the government is essentially forced to treat them as dollar-equivalents by making them whole. See Savings &amp; Loan Crisis, the GFC, LTCG, etc., etc.Stablecoins piggyback on the legal aspects of dollars, and as long as you treat them as dollar-denominated assets, you&#39;re fine. The second you treat them as dollar-equivalents, you run the risk of a change in the value of that asset being something that the government is forced into supporting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of the Crypto hype is because the US banking system still lives in the 1980s or thereabouts.If everybody in the US had access to bank accounts with easy electronic transfers within 5 seconds for no charge, no chargebacks and so on, as people are used to in the EU, would people still be excited about Bitcoin?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people on HN are rational people who look at the world in a rational way. Bitcoin and friends are not operating in a rational market, therefore we don&#39;t understand them, and most of us would probably be pretty lousy investors since we would try to make decisions rationally instead of memeing and YOLOing.But, and this is a key point, that doesn&#39;t make us right and them wrong. It&#39;s just a different kind of market, one that I am not very good at, but it is for sure possible to make money in it. You just need to be a different kind of person. We can say our way is &#34;better&#34;, but who are we to decide that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The assumption that the content of the video had something do do with why it was broadcast may not be reasonable. Someone wanting to play the technical prank might well find some of the most random shit available to broadcast, hoping (perhaps mistakenly) that the point would be clear anyway.I think its also possible that the the technically equipped people who did this were perhaps not thinking as clearly as usual that evening. Intoxicants may have been involved. There were some gifted organic chemists working out in the suburbs then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before life got in the way, I wanted a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Resource Management as a foundation for a Master&#39;s in Urban Planning. I currently run r/UrbanForestry for the same reason:I don&#39;t think it makes sense to see human settlements as separate from nature. I think of nature as the fabric within which such configurations occur.It isn&#39;t inevitable that human development must be a concrete jungle. You can include plants, permeable surfaces, etc in your plans so people can live more lightly and less intrusively on the land.I also think America has a lot of room for adding back walkable mixed-use neighborhoods where at least some people can live, work and shop in the same neighborhood. Or at least live and shop if they are retirees, teens, or similar groups who aren&#39;t seeking a job or who already work at home or from home in some capacity.Studies suggest this leads to greater wealth in such neighborhoods (such as more sales) and we know vehicle traffic is a significant burden wrt human-caused climate change. Making it possible to skip the long commute makes for a better quality of life and less pollution adding to this issue.We currently frame this issue as a painful choice between short-term gratification and current high quality of life with a long-term cost of global disaster versus short-term sacrifice for slim hope of assuaging our guilt with no guarantee of real improvement in the future. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary.I&#39;ve lived without a car in the US for more than a decade. I think you can live that way and live well. I think we can design and build a world that provides a high quality of life for people and doesn&#39;t destroy the environment in the process."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m perpetually perplexed at why some people seem to think that lowering the standards is going to help anyone. Do they not realise the source of all scientific and technical advancement is really the result of a minority of high achievers, and that by trying to &#34;flatten&#34; this inequality and effectively make everyone equally stupid, they are also going to be affected negatively?applies social justice principles to math lessonsThe inmates aren&#39;t running the asylum anymore; they&#39;re running the government. All I hope is that this cancerous ideology (I&#39;ll resist the prop65 joke...)  doesn&#39;t grow any further than it already has. The decline is certainly sad to see and already rather visible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m Danish and not at all interested in the politics of it, but there can be a case for teaching algebra late. We do it in Denmark, because it’s the subject children have the hardest time learning, and having too many of them fail too early kills their interest in math. We still teach algebra in grade 7-9, but we’ve gone through the social experiments of teaching it at different ages, and have lost entire generations because it was taught too soon.I don’t think social justice or equality should play a part of the argument, but it’s always hard to tell where the legislation ends and the propaganda begins these days, and I’m honestly no interested enough to read the 800 page document this article is about.I will say, however, that I think we’re going to have problems teaching math until we reform the school system to be suited for the modern world instead of the early 1900’s “assembly line” society. It makes no sense to place children in classes based on their age, and certainly not for all subjects.The result is always going to be that both slow and brilliant students get fucked over, in a myriad of ways, especially if they are a mix of good and bad at different subjects.Why exactly is it that you aren’t taught courses like math, or history or language according to your ability instead of your age?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of those issues that I can&#39;t understand the opposing argument. It&#39;s just an issue I find so objectionable that I cannot understand why anyone would be imposing this. Literally holding kids back.The only defense I hear is that kids don&#39;t really benefit from advanced classes and they&#39;ll be fine anyway. But gifted children will not necessarily be fine. Most of the smartest people I know struggled in school just, but most were fortunately saved by advanced placement classes that put them in classes where they can learn at a faster pace than the rest of the children. Were they forced to stay in what to them amounted to remedial classes, they would grow to resent education and actually underperform.The utter disregard the people pushing these policies have for children is appalling. Hopefully this is just a weird time in our countries history where that we&#39;ll look back on and think how absurd the policies were."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing many of these designs don&#39;t bring up is long-term growth. Is the plan to build it once and that&#39;s it? Boring, and too prone to failure if the project runs into trouble at any point in time.What I&#39;d prefer to see is a space construction that is continuous. Imagine a ring station, but one that is cellular in nature- lots of smaller modules that together form the huge station. This allows one to construct and add further modules over time, growing as needed.The beauty of this design principle is that we could start today. Design the first iteration of these modules, with the intent to fit them into SpaceX&#39;s Starship (or whatever heavy rockets come next). Launch 10 or 20 of them, connect them, and spin them up to 1/5th gravity, something not too hard to do. Add modules in the centre of the ring that are zero-G, where zero-G things can be done- but allowing those who live on station to live in mild gravity at least.All the while, you can dream big. You can plan for how this station goes from 10 or 20 small modules to thousands."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These pictures always make me smile for several reasons.One, they had a significant impact on the science fiction that came after them. We see recapitulation of this imagery in a lot of &#39;70s-&#39;90s anime (less often in live action, which I attribute to cost to film it).Two, I believe when we get anywhere near a technology level to try something like this, the result will look radically different. I&#39;m reminded of the way that old depictions of the Earth from space rarely included the clouds, which are omnipresent and unavoidable when actually looking at the planet. Some things, a person just can&#39;t imagine until they&#39;re there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember seeing some of these actual pictures in the late 70s, early 80s, they were very striking and mindblowing to me as a child, the idea of huge pieces of structure with lush green parks and farmland in space.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is great to see this happen.It&#39;s also fascinating that the crux of the Apple&#39;s case against NSO hinges on NSO engineers that accepted iCloud&#39;s terms and conditions.From related NYT article:&gt;The sample of Pegasus gave Apple a forensic understanding of how Pegasus worked. The company found that NSO’s engineers had created more than 100 fake Apple IDs to carry out their attacks. In the process of creating those accounts, NSO’s engineers would have had to agree to Apple’s iCloud Terms and Conditions, which expressly require that iCloud users’ engagement with Apple “be governed by the laws of the state of California.”The clause helped Apple bring its lawsuit against NSO in the Northern District of California.https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/apple-nso-grou..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always thought stuff like this happened to OTHER founders, but would never happen to me. But my board fired me six months after closing our series A.The advice in this article is 100% spot on. I didn&#39;t know any of this. I was totally focused on building my company. But if you raise money you can&#39;t do that anymore. 50% of your time will always be occupied with working on your next round of funding or managing your board of directors.I noticed super early that VCs were not &#34;helpful&#34; at all like they had claimed during the fundraising process.So I got fired, and I thought, &#34;well, at least I still have my founders stock!&#34;Then a year after I got fired the series A investor led the next round of funding and decided to value the company at $0, so I got diluted by 99.99%. Sounds illegal, right? Well, it probably was, but what am I going to do about it? They have billions of dollars and I had no money.I just let it go and started something new - bootstrapping of course. On the bright side, the new CEO ran the company into the ground. Meanwhile my new company is doing well and I love my job.Anyway, do what this guy says to manage your board and just plan on being fired at some point if you raise VC money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is something you should really understand if you&#39;re starting a company. The board isn&#39;t your &#34;friend&#34; while individual board members may be, as an entity it probably isn&#39;t. The understanding that individuals can be &#34;good&#34; and the composite can be &#34;bad&#34; is usually encountered by most people when some government is doing something &#34;bad&#34; but the people who live where that government is in power are known to be &#34;good.&#34; We see a lot of companies that have &#34;good&#34; employees but act in a &#34;bad&#34; way as a company.So with that in mind, you have to understand that none of your &#34;friends&#34; would fire you, but the &#34;board of directors&#34; (even if composed of people you consider friends) could easily decide to do that.Tom Lyon used to joke that it was only on your third startup that you funded yourself that you are really in control. The wisdom of that took a while to sink in for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It may be gauche to express this opinion on HN of all places and I hope it doesn&#39;t come off as tonedeaf disrespect, but does anybody notice VC is falling out of favor unless absolutely necessary?I am noticing a lot of bootstrappers that are emerging with the ethos that VC isn&#39;t what it used to be for some markets, and often a poor choice of the right VC can be a detriment to a project&#39;s longevity, with some teams choosing to avoid it at all costs."</p>

And ignored that advice like I did for many years?After all, the fish seems to defrost just fine in its original vacuum-sealed packaging, whether you defrost it in the refrigerator or in a cold water bath. And it is so convenient to leave it in the pouch while defrosting.Well, there is a reason to take those instructions seriously.

In small doses, the same nerve damage that causes fatal paralysis in poisoning cases, helps to remove forehead creases and crow’s feet, with the only side effects being an inability to express emotion using your face,…ironic that many celebrities who publicly advocated a clean living, chemical-free lifestyle, were also early adopters of a treatment that involves injecting the deadliest substance on earth into your face (looking at you, Paltrow). If any of them were surprised at this seeming paradox, they certainly didn’t show it.Loved the subtle irony here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The lethal dose when consumed orally is around 30 billionths of a gram, which if you want a relatable comparison, is about the same as if you cut a single poppy seed into ten thousand equal pieces and ate one of them. It is an amount so tiny, it really doesn’t make sense.That&#39;s right - it makes no sense. How could such a small amount of anything do enough damage to shut down your entire body? According to wikipedia, it works by &#34;cleaving key proteins required for nerve activation&#34;. Unless there&#39;s some self-replication mechanism, how does that even work?edit: I went and did the math. At an LD of 30 nanograms, that&#39;s about 1.2 billion actual molecules of this stuff to die. I guess that&#39;s enough to shut down a sufficient number of nerves that you just can&#39;t function anymore.The math: lethal dose / per molecule weight (molar mass / avogadro)(3.0e-10) / (149323.05 / 6.0221409e+23) = 1209888406.377984"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can someone genuinely explain to the the desire/interest to use HTMX/Hotwire/LiveView etc?I was writing web apps when rendering templated HTML views on your server was standard, and you had controller endpoints that returned HTML content, or things like Rails &#34;Unobtrusive Javascript&#34; where you had code like:  $(‘#user-list’).html(“&lt;%= j render(‘index’, users: @users) %&gt;”)

As an automatic callback to some action.Whether or not you love or hate this model of development is irrelevant, because if at some point you need to render on a client other than a browser -- you have to start from the beginning and write an API now.IE, so that your Android/iOS app in Java/Swift or whatnot, can ask your backend for data and render it using the tools available on that platform.When we turned apps into pure API&#39;s and just exchanged data with them, it opened up the ability to be platform-agnostic.I guess I don&#39;t understand why someone would choose to build an app that sends HTML over the wire instead of JSON/XML/whatever, that any client can render. All it means is that you have to write this functionality later when you want it, in addition to now having this HTML stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading some HTMX criticism, there&#39;s one point people seem to miss. Making HTML your application interface does *not* prevent you from having a JSON (or something else) API. If anything, it probably forces you to split your functions better. e.g:  def get_user_data(user_id: int) -&gt; Dict (JSON-looking data):
      ...

  def render_user_view(user_id: int) -&gt; HTML:
      user_data = get_user_data(user_id)
      render_template(&#34;user_detail_view.html&#34;, context=user_data)

If you need the user data in a JSON API, nothing prevents you from exposing `get_user_data` as a JSON endpoint. You can also use WebViews in a mobile app.People tend to overestimate the &#34;interactivity&#34; needs of their apps and underestimate what they can achieve by just swapping HTML. HTMX also lets you swap &#34;Out of Band&#34; [0]. This makes it easy to model more complex interactions (like &#34;reactions&#34;), for example, updating a counter somewhere else in the app when a form is submitted. Reactive frameworks can also become a Rube Goldberg machine if an app is not properly designed from the beginning. Then you start fighting rendering loops, build dependencies, components&#39; side effects, etc.Personally speaking, HTML-driven apps are not just about easy vs. hard development, it&#39;s also about your users [1]. Maybe a big React app runs fine on 8 CPU cores and 32 GB of RAM, but very often, your users just want to read some content, maybe submit a few forms, and leave. They may not want to download 2 MB of JS so that the page can render boxes with text, even more if your browser can already do that if you give it some HTML.[0] https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap-oob/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been moving from Django to Elixir/Phoenix/LiveView and loving it so far. I hated the Angular/React era of the web and mostly moved to doing backend development, but the Live App era has reinvigorated my interest in web development as a whole. I&#39;ll miss Python a lot and hope they can come up with something that solves the concurrency issues, but Elixir is really pretty good in its own right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be fair, as a daily user and (to some extent) app developer, in my experience Flatpaks have solved the problem of library fragmentation and app distribution on Linux.While my experience on Snaps was mostly negative (due to bugs, virtual &#34;loop disks&#34; per every app affecting the system performance, etc.), I found that Flatpak finally lets me install essentially any app on any distro.For example, the Elementary OS &#34;AppCenter&#34; apps are now available in any other distribution, thanks to the Flatpak remote. Testing daily GNOME apps has become as easy as installing their Flatpak reference, and letting them update automatically.Regarding memory, storage and power consumption:- The base runtimes (which are the heaviest bit) are downloaded only once per system, e.g., one for the KDE Plasma ecosystem, one for Elementary, and so on. The first app you install will pull them, so I do not see it as much more bloaty than having an enormous bundle of system-wide dependencies (e.g. if you install a KDE app in a primarily GNOME environment) as would happen otherwise.- Memory and CPU-wise, Flatpaks are very light containers (which do not require loop disks, or anything else) which should have almost no overhead. I never witnessed any loss of performance, at least.- Bug and crash-wise, I experienced a tremendously stable and &#34;flat&#34; experience on Flatpaks. That is, if there is a bug in one app on one distribution, the bug will exist on all, or vice versa. This is not as common as it should be in containerized app install tools, and makes debugging overall much easier.The only drawback are updates taking longer than on other platforms, probably because compressed deltas are not yet available unlike in other major package managers.With this, I don&#39;t want to describe Flatpak as a panacea in everything, but at least for GUI apps, it solved a lot of distribution fragmentation issues in my case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with all of this and... I just don&#39;t care.I download a Flatpak from the Pop OS store and it works. It installs only in my profile, so another user on the same machine doesn&#39;t have access.  You can&#39;t do that with a .deb!I&#39;ve never got into dependency hell where I need to apt-get a specific version of a library from a dodgy PPA.If I uninstall it, Flatpak doesn&#39;t leave acres of cruft strewn around my disk.I don&#39;t see how randomly installing a Flatpak is any worse for security than compiling the source myself. The permission model on Linux is far worse than Android - so I just hope for the best anyway.Snaps never worked right for me - and seemed to frequently break. But all my Flatpaks have run fine and at full speed.Does it take up more disk space? Sure. But that&#39;s a trade-off I&#39;m willing to make in order to just download and run with no extra work.Sure, there are some efficiency and security gains to be made. But I&#39;m much happier with a Flatpak world than the alternative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a deep trend happening in software development.As the number of dependencies for building an application grows, it becomes exponentially harder to shake the tree. This used to be the role of Linux distributions, they were acting as a push-back force, asking projects to support multiple versions of C libraries. This was acceptable because there is not C package manager.Now that each language has their own package manager, the role of distributions have faded. They are even viewed as a form of nuisance by some developers. It&#39;s easier to support one fixed set of dependencies and not have to worry about backward-compatibility. This is something all distributions have been struggling with for a while now, especially with NodeJS.This trend is happening on all platforms, but is more pronounced in Linux because of the diversity of the system libraries ecosystem. On Windows and macOS, there are some SDKs the application can lean on. On Linux, the only stable &#34;SDK&#34; is the Linux kernel API."</p>

Bought one that was very close to being on the first page of Google results for a keyword related to personal finance.Did a bit of sprucing up the page, dropped a few links, and it did get on the front page for a few months, with AdSense paying me several thousands dollars a month while it lasted.  The page itself wasn&#39;t a scam per se, but it was roughly 1000 medium-effort words on the topic I wrote in a day, along with a few original photos that took another day, and a couple of inline AdSense ads.It didn&#39;t deserve to be on the first page of results.

I experimented with a few different strategies - quick reactions to big accounts I agreed with or disagreed with, saying what I thought people wanted to hear, saying what I thought would be controversial hot takes, tweeting about everything trending, etc.  I basically got no traction.  I was getting low tens of thousands of impressions a month according to the twitter analytics tool and maybe 1 or 2 new followers a month - and, to be honest, those new followers were probably bots.Eventually, I hit on a new strategy.  Instead of trying to generate good tweets I just followed people at random.  I forget the exact number, but somewhere between 15-30% of the people I followed at random would follow me back.  I realized I could probably get an arbitrary number of followers this way but it would be a pretty stupid and meaningless achievement so I quit doing it.The &#34;viral post&#34; strategy of the article, asking things like &#34;Who the heck sleeps with the fan on?&#34; maybe similar as a kind of brainless strategy to get followers.  I guess some people like responding to these prompts.  I suspect it has the same weakness as the &#34;follow back&#34; strategy though.  Nobody really cares about the account or connects with it or even understands what you&#39;re trying to do.  These people aren&#39;t your followers so much as they are people who like small talk and coalesced around you for a time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently read Enough: True Measures of Money, Business, and Life, by Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard. Written during the 2008 recession, it&#39;s so much more than a business book. It highlights in detail how the financial industry at large leeches so much wealth for itself while creating so little, and offers insights from someone truly introspective of life, business, finance, and the future of the country. Highly recommend a read/listen.https://amazon.com/John-C-Bogle/e/B001H6NWEM"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh hi! Author here. Fun thing to wake up to.I wanted to point something out that the series doesn&#39;t do a good job of highlighting:You can use Nix alongside your existing package manager.They won&#39;t conflict. You can set up dev environments with Nix without drinking the kool-aid. I still have Homebrew installed, and I still occasionally reach for it in the rare cases where Nix is missing some package I want to try. But I am sad every time I do: I never really realized how unbelievably slow Homebrew is until I tried Nix.So if you&#39;re Nix-curious, you can try it out without committing to anything upfront. I didn&#39;t make the switch until part 19:https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/switching-fro...Nix is weird and hard to learn, but it&#39;s a lot like git in that respect. Yes, the UI is terrible. You have to learn the difference between `reset --hard` and `reset --mixed` and it&#39;s weird and unintuitive but you eventually get over it.And people are using it despite how unintuitive it is, because of how valuable it is to them. No one is arguing that `nix-env -qaP package` is a reasonable command to ask a fellow human being to type, but people are willing to type it anyway because the benefits are worth it. As a fun example, a few weeks ago I wrote up a little hack that I would not have even attempted before spending the time to learn Nix:https://ianthehenry.com/posts/janet-game/how-to-patch-emacs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve bounced off Nix a couple of times and figured that the problem is that it was too different. A lot of Linux distros (especially post-systemd) have a fair number of similarities and it&#39;s pretty easy to translate knowledge between them. NixOS _probably_ works very similarly, but it&#39;s also got this additional declarative configuration layer on top, which is the point of using NixOS, and it&#39;s got its own special way of doing things.You can&#39;t translate Linux knowledge to a NixOS config directly, you need NixOS&#39; documentation to understand the &#34;NixOS Way&#34; of doing things, and the NixOS way of doing things does not translate into other distros. And the documentation is difficult to understand and at times seemingly arbitrary.You have to commit to learning NixOS and understand that you are only learning NixOS, it won&#39;t help you use anything else. Other Linux distros help you learn Linux in general and inform your understanding of Linux system construction, but NixOS is its own thing. Plenty of people learn NixOS anyway, and more power to them, but it&#39;s definitely pushed me away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We know documentation is too scattered and incomplete.I&#39;ve started https://nix.dev about a year ago to provide a resource for newcomers.I&#39;m working on comprehensive language tutorial next, but I&#39;m mostly interested what you&#39;d like to learn when getting started."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two statements here regarding things that have happened:&gt; the Core Team placing themselves unaccountable to anyone but
themselves&gt; we have been unable to enforce the Rust Code of Conduct to the standards the community expects of us and to the standards we hold ourselves toIt&#39;s possible that there were CoC violations that they were not able to moderate, that the actions available to them were limited (e.g., they would have initiated a ban but they were not able to ban a core team member), that a core team member intervened to prevent effective moderation, or that the core team prevented the mod team from being able to access official core team channels in order to moderate.Seems to be a wide variety of possibilities and leaving the nature of the situation ambiguous* will likely make it difficult for a new mod team. I hope the now-former mod team are open and direct with new or potential mod team members about the environment they&#39;re entering.* I do think it&#39;s right for the mod team to not reveal the specifics in public; that would likely provoke targeted harassment and make the situation much worse"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any good way to craft a message like this?If they outlined specific issues then it would invariably devolve into armchair quarterbacking of those issues rather than the the underlying question of what kinds of checks-and-balances should exist for the Core Team -- gossip, accusations, and political discussions are a lot more fun than debating governance structures.On the other hand, if no specific issues are raised then people are frustrated by having only a partial understanding. Because it&#39;s a lot simpler to evaluate an argument if you already know whose side you&#39;re on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have used Rust for years, but I never bothered with looking into the governance structure.How are team members selected? Who has authority to kick someone off a team? How are team leads selected? Who can remove team leads?Is it the core team? If so, who picks the core team?I can&#39;t find anything online, except this very bare-bones WIP stub. [1]This seems to be a glaring and surprising oversight.Especially at this point, with Rust becoming more and more popular, the foundation in place for almost a year, and corporate interest flooding into the project, I would have expected proper procedures to already be in place for quite some time.There certainly seem to be other cracks in the system. See for example &#34;I refuse to let Amazon define Rust&#34; by core team member Steve Klabnik, extensively discussed here on HN.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Think this is still overestimating the threat.  It&#39;s kinda like saying you can hack someone&#39;s password by watching video of them typing.  True, but also non-trivial.If you&#39;re already being personally targeted by an organization professional enough to follow you around, take a photo of your fingerprint on something you touched, then painstakingly reproduce said fingerprint through highly technical means and then gain physical access to your personal device that uses a fingerprint reader to use said fingerprint, you should be aware of your position and have multi-factor authentication set up for everything anyway.For your average everyday person fingerprint security is fine.  The thief who snatches your phone when you step away from your table in the mall food court isn&#39;t going to be able to crack it via this method."</p>

Anything that is done that reduces the speed and efficiency of a road devalues that road. If we want to maximize the value of a road, we eliminate anything that reduces the speed and efficiency of travel.&gt; The value of a street comes from its ability to support land use patterns that create capturable value. The street with the highest value is the one that creates the greatest amount of tax revenue with the least amount of public expense over multiple life cycles. If we want to maximize the value of a street, we design it in such a way that it supports an adjacent development pattern that is financially resilient, architecturally timeless and socially enduring.[...]&gt; In the United States, we’ve built a 45 mile per hour world for ourselves.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this article is making the point veey clearly, but it is a very important point: roads are for long distance connections at speed, streets are for local traffic: reaching houses, shops, people. These stroads try to do both and fail at both because the goals are contradictory; you can&#39;t have high speed traffic with lots of side streets and crossing traffic, bikes and pedestrians. It will be too slow for a road or too dangerous for a street, and probably both.Separate traffic that requires different speeds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Extracts from the LSE report summary:Recommendations relating to specific commercial practices- Declawing. We have high confidence that declawing (removing one or both of the claws from a crab before returning it back to the water) causes suffering in crabs.- Nicking. We also have high confidence that the practice of nicking (cutting the tendon of a crab’s claw) causes suffering and is a health risk to the animals.- Wholesale and retail. We recommend a ban on the sale of live decapod crustaceans to untrained, non-expert handlers.- Stunning. Current evidence indicates that electrical stunning with appropriate parameters for the species can induce a seizure-like state in relatively large decapods, and that stunning diminishes, without wholly abolishing, the nervous system’s response to boiling water. We interpret this as evidence that electrical stunning is better than nothing.- Slaughter (decapods). We recommend that the following slaughter methods are banned in all cases in which a more humane slaughter method is available, unless preceded by effective electrical stunning: boiling alive, slowly raising the temperature of water, tailing (separation of the abdomen from the thorax, or separation of the head from the thorax), any other form of live dismemberment, and freshwater immersion (osmotic shock). On current evidence, the most reasonable slaughter methods are double spiking (crabs), whole-body splitting (lobsters), and electrocution using a specialist device on a setting that is designed and validated to kill the animal quickly after initially stunning it.- Slaughter (cephalopods). Various different slaughter methods are currently used on fishing vessels in European waters, including clubbing, slicing the brain, reversing the mantle and asphyxiation in a suspended net bag. We are not able to recommend any of these methods as humane. On current evidence, there is no slaughter method for cephalopods that is both humane and commercially viable on a large scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I usually have deep hatred towards scroll-jacking but this was actually quite well done.Not because of the pizzazz but because it essentially put only one thing to learn on the screen at once. It was like a &#34;getting started&#34; section that might be slower to go through but feels like it&#39;s faster to understand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, after looking over the docs, here&#39;s my comparison list between Remix (which I haven&#39;t used) and other things that I&#39;ve used.- Forms seem better in Remix. Remix seems focused on progressive enhancement here, rather than fetch. Imagine if Next supported POST endpoints, and the idiomatic way of making your site was to use that instead of API endpoints. I hope that we soon see a Remix-compatible form validation library (e.g. something that takes a zod schema, validates it on the server, and handles client-side validation and state tracking).- The nested routes feature sounds interesting, but the docs for it are completely devoid of actual code, so I have no idea how ergonomic it will feel compared to something like Relay (requires complete buy-in to the ecosystem) or Suspense (extremely ergonomic black magic).- The error boundary feature is a very nice touch. I guess it depends on their nested routes feature to function. I haven&#39;t explored React&#39;s own error boundaries, so I can&#39;t comment on how ergonomic it is to add these to other components (in Next or in Remix).- I don&#39;t see anything in Remix about exporting the site statically, so it looks like you&#39;ll want to stick with Next if you are actually building a static web site.- CSS modules are not supported. It appears to be possible to add support to esbuild for CSS modules via a plugin, but there&#39;s no escape hatch to be able to do this in Remix.- There doesn&#39;t seem to be an easy way to create auxiliary server-side scripts in Remix. Looks like you could hack it by manually setting up a separate TypeScript build step to emit your auxiliary script, but it would be nice to see this built into Remix properly. I accomplish this in Next by using the webpack escape hatch to add a custom server-side entry point that handles my auxiliary scripts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sounds more like &#34;socially awkward but want to talk to lots of people&#34; than strictly introverted (which itself generally gets used to mean many things). I have some &#34;introvert&#34; traits: talking to people tires me out, I have no interest in low quality conversations - I dont like chit-chatting with strangers. If this is what&#39;s going to happen at an event I&#39;d rather avoid it altogether than have a pretext for people to come talk to me.But I&#39;m not socially awkward really (imo) more just conserving my energy because I do find talking tiring.So all that to say I&#39;d rather focus on high quality interaction - smaller groups with mutual interests, vs make bulk unsolicited networking easier for me. I can see the article makes sense for the author and would work for people who for some reason want to have idle banter with others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest challenge is getting people to read what you wrote, and care enough to respond.I started a blog recently where I want to write notes for my writing practice and explore different subjects I&#39;m interested in. Of course it&#39;d be nice if someone had actually read it, for my personal vanity, and all those conversations and opportunities people claim blogging leads to.But it&#39;s not the kind of project it would make sense to drive ads to, or even to niche down and grow an audience around a specific topic, since the whole point is to write whatever &#34;gratifies my intellectual curiosity&#34;. But you can&#39;t really submit this kind of thing to reddit or to forums, they ban &#34;blogspam&#34; for very good reasons. There&#39;s no obvious way to promote it and put it in front of people.Instead of blogging I could try engaging in conversations here and on reddit (and maybe on discord or twitter), and that, at least HN and reddit, works amazingly well for having good discussions (if not for making personal connections).But the biggest problem with engaging in social media is that it quickly becomes extremely unhealthy and addictive (in the way that blogging doesn&#39;t). I want to write, and I want to talk to people, but I don&#39;t want to get addicted to refreshing my profile page to look for upvotes and comment notifications (I do have a big problem with the internet addiction).I&#39;m not sure what the right solution to that would be. Does anyone have good ideas? How do you make actual human connection over the internet and engage in intelligent conversations, without getting your dopamine hijacked and skinnerboxed by the social media algorithms?Maybe there&#39;s a space for a platform that would encourage thoughtful discussion somehow, and limit the immediate rewards that make social media so addictive. But then nobody would use that platform, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first software dev job was in the 90&#39;s writing PHP for a mom and pop ISP that was trying to get into app development. It was originally supposed to be Perl, the job interview was something like:Me: demos CRUD app for keeping track of my record collection, hosted on a free siteOwner: You wrote this?Me: Yeah.Owner: This is in Perl?Me: Yeah.So I got hired. The day I got there, he told me they were going to use PHP instead of Perl. Sure, cool, whatever. He told me that I had to start being productive in the first couple weeks or he would have to let me go, couldn&#39;t afford to keep people that weren&#39;t working out. I was down with that. He had some HTML pages that he had created in a WYSIWYG editor, I think it was Dreamweaver, and I was going to add some PHP scripting to those pages.How hard could that be?So I get to work and open these HTML files and I don&#39;t even remember exactly, I think like the login page HTML was 20 pages of code long, maybe I&#39;m exaggerating, I&#39;ve blocked most of it out of my memory but I seem to remember nested tables inside of nested tables inside of nested tables with spacer GIFs and &amp;nbsp;s all over the place and I remember looking at it and thinking: What. The. Actual. Fuck.But I did it! I managed to get the guy to take a look at what the editor he was using actually created and get him to simplify some things, I fixed a few bugs and was working on features and he came in around noon and told me you know what I said about being productive in the first few weeks? Forget about that, we&#39;re good.The week before I was doing manual labor in a factory. It was like going from the 1800s to the 2000s over a weekend. I made $9 an hour, less than I was making stacking boxes on pallets, but of course totally worth it in the long run. Good times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I miss the good ol’ days. Today we have abstractions on top of abstractions on top of JavaScript, of all thingsIt seems I learnt HTML just between these two eras. After the &amp;nbsp;, 1px spacers and tables, and before the piles of abstractions.People cared about doing well formed XHTML and having those W3C Valid XHTML badges, and also those &#34;install Firefox&#34; buttons.This was short so today everything looks ugly to me, old and new, in different ways.I still use (polyglot) XHTML5 (HTML5 if I don&#39;t control everything being input) and avoid frontend frameworks and web fonts when I get to decide. This is a world where implementing a search bar for people who haven&#39;t discovered CTRL+F yet takes 30 lines of dumb Javascript and filters 200 items in 1 second on a slow computer without any caching trick and that does not require minifiers and bundlers. Which does not actually sound impressive, or shouldn&#39;t anyway. A world where when you disable Javascript, the page is still perfectly readable. A world where a silly mistake in the HTML markup is noticed.To build an actual web application where it does not makes much sense to have the content as a web page, I started liking Svelte but I&#39;ll still at least consider doing things by manipulating the DOM directly before deciding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. That took me back. All those things, every day. And table layouts of course. And let&#39;s not forget slicing images, and slapping those into tables too. If I remember rightly, Photoshop had an &#34;export to slices&#34; thing built in. Amazing. Loved it.And of course one of the biggest issues with today&#39;s web: you can&#39;t just view source and copy paste. You&#39;re in the land of chasing back up CSS files, js libraries, or finding yourself unable to steal an image because it&#39;s not just an image you can right click on any more.Golden times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny I just saw this thread, today I learned that my integrated (not removeable) XPS 15 9570 laptop battery just died just a few months after my warranty expired on my Dell XPS laptop... The Internet is littered with complaints about dell PCs failing after warranty, and how recalls are covered up on them frequently.And my XPS desktop had faulty connections on it&#39;s mother board (That were known by Dell even before I bought it) for the Hard Drive controller that I discovered just after the warranty replacement expired on it... 2 problems that lead to costly repair and buying expensive replacement parts.... I have a 10 year old Dell XPS 16 that still runs (granted only windows7), but I never had any problems with it.... XPS quality has declined greatly since my first one.The standard 1 year warranty isn&#39;t enough for the way Dell computers have become shoddy, I&#39;m deeply disappointed in Dell, and will not be buying any more of them... I don&#39;t have time to build my own, does anyone know a rock solid/powerful brand I can buy instead of Dell? I kind of miss Micron PCs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am reminded of an organization I read about years ago with the tag line &#34;Seeing like a mountain.&#34; It was founded by someone who noticed that excess deer were stripping the mountain of vegetation and they concluded that reintroducing wolves was important for creating a sustainable environment.In the US, deer-vehicle collisions make deer the deadliest animal for people that we have in this country.https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-deadliest-animals-in-...In the US: Deer–vehicle collisions lead to about 200 human deaths and $1.1 billion in property damage every year.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer%E2%80%93vehicle_collisi...Part of my incomplete BS in Environmental Studies was a class in quantifying the economic value of natural resources. I did a case study on wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Area that are currently quietly being threatened by the county rail plan.The US used to pay people to fill in swamps and create &#34;productive&#34; land and then learned that swamps do useful and valuable things of various sorts. We updated the name from swamp to wetlands, overhauled their public image and reversed policy. We now protect and restore such areas.Quantifying the economic value to humans of a natural resource is a good means to convince people it needs protecting and it is in your best interest to protect it. This is not &#34;charity&#34; and shouldn&#39;t be viewed as a sacrifice.We are cutting our own throats when we ruin the world because of fixation on some overly simplified idea that it needs to put money directly into our pockets for humans to care about it. One of the best ways to fight such entrenched ideas is to quantify just how much it costs us to think that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool article. They show that Wolves create a “landscape of fear” which reduces deer engagement with roads. So wolves do what hunters can’t; not just reducing populations but also changing behavior. Kind of creepy, if you are a deer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hitting the deer is just the beginning.We were driving on a semi-wilderness highway when a medium-sized deer staggered up from a deep drainage ditch on the same side of the road, about 50 yards ahead. Managed to slow from 65-70 to 50 mph before hitting the animal, which slid along the highway and into the deep ditch on the other side.The slowdown helped limit the van&#39;s damage to $10,000, but it was undriveable. Even if we somehow removed the hood (bent in two over the unbroken windshield), all the fluid had ran out of the crushed radiator and into the semi-wilderness ditch.Luckily it was a hot July afternoon, and a truck going the opposite way came along in 15 minutes. The driver put the deer out of its misery. Had it been in the winter, after sundown, it might have taken hours just to be found.Happened in the 1990s (no mobiles), so we waited for a vehicle heading toward the nearest little town to find a tow -truck. With the van towed to that town (no repair shop), it was another hour before relatives arrived from the bigger town (that tow-truck had a repair shop).The insurance company paid for the repair, then dropped the policy. I never drove that route after noon again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that most of the performance improvements come from PGO, which is enabled with following environment variables. PGO is not enabled in .NET 6 by default, but will be in .NET 7 IIRC.  set DOTNET_ReadyToRun=0 
  set DOTNET_TieredPGO=1 
  set DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops=1

Here are my own benchmarks from a CPU intensive application without any IO and already optimized for allocations. Application runs a task graph either serially or in parallel.  .NET 5
  --------------------------
  |      Method |     Mean |
  |------------ |---------:|
  | RunParallel | 473.4 us |
  |         Run | 513.5 us |

  .NET 6
  --------------------------
  |      Method |     Mean |
  |------------ |---------:|
  | RunParallel | 452.5 us |
  |         Run | 499.8 us |

  .NET 6 PGO
  --------------------------
  |      Method |     Mean |
  |------------ |---------:|
  | RunParallel | 381.8 us |
  |         Run | 412.2 us |

  .NET 5 - .NET 6     -&gt; ~5%
  .NET 5 - .NET 6 PGO -&gt; ~20%

Here is what I learned from micro-optimizing a .NET application:- Use BenchmarkDotNet[0] for general measurements and Visual Studio profiler tools for detailed inspection. They help a lot.- Memory allocations matter. Using capturing lambdas, LINQ, even foreach on interfaces introduce allocations and slows down the application. You can use ClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer[1] to find these hidden allocations.- Using abstractions with interfaces and casting back to concrete types cause some overhead, though PGO will probably eliminate most of these.- Use LINQ cautiously as its variants are mostly slower than explicit coding. E.g. .Any() vs .Count == 0- Checking Logger.IsEnabled() before calling Logger.Debug() etc. helps a lot. You can even automate this with Fody [2], but it breaks Edit&amp;Continue and possibly .NET Hot Reload too, so it may hinder your productivity.[0] https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet[1] https://github.com/microsoft/RoslynClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer[2] https://github.com/jorisdebock/LoggerIsEnabled.Fody"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the same vein as what Linus is trying to do now at LTT, it would be useful if there was a &#34;programming journalism&#34; lab which builds &#34;test benches&#34; to create canonical benchmarks and verify the claims made on tech blogs (etc.).Eg., highly standardised docker builds, on highly standardised hardware, running popular tasks using popular libraries for each &#34;programming tech&#34; (eg., website, stat modelling, event system, ...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen the posts about all the speedups each new version of .NET gets and I&#39;m just wondering, was .NET just alright in performance before all this? Is that the reason they can get all these speedups? :PI&#39;d be interested in some JVM vs .NET 6 benchmarks too, which platform to chose when.EDIT: I know about the benchmarks and I also feel like sometimes these benchmarks are really optimized in a non-idiomatic way. I would love to know how performance idiomatic Java/.NET code is and if one is to start a new project today why one would choose the JVM over .NET or when someone would chose .NET over JVM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, this study has a few &#34;smells&#34; that makes it dubious:&gt; We collected cross-sectional data between November 2019 and July 2020 from
self-selected respondents recruited via media related to psychedelic use such as podcasts and online psychedelic
research conference presentations.This is already a significant bias in participants.&gt; Mental health was assessed with the questions “Do you currently have any psychological, mental health or
addiction concerns?” Participants who endorsed concerns identified specific mental health and substance use
categories from a drop down menu, and were allowed to select more than one categorySo mental health is not actually accessed medically and simply self-reported.To be clear I lack an informed opinion on microdosing psychedelics, but any study that picks its participant from a community engaging in X to study X but then uses the same community to sample their control group (for lack of a better expression) is questionable.EDIT: Page 6 has a table that compare microdosers/non-microdosers and the latter was actually less likely to self-report *any* mental health or substance use problem by 5%. It&#39;s only when using the DASS-21 subscales that they can draw the conclusion that non-microdosers are more anxious, depressed or stressed. Their microdosers/non-microdosers ratio is also almost 1:1."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This study is non-blinded, non-RCT based on individuals who self-selected through social media, self reporting symptoms through an app.While I&#39;m hopeful that psychedelics may prove to be a treatment for some mental health issues, but this study doesn&#39;t tell us much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I replied something similar elsewhere, but I think the real story here is about using tech to administer large scale studies and what that could mean for future research.A lot of people here are discounting the fact that this study would typically be very hard (or impossible) to administer at such a large scale, especially in such a short amount of time.In my mind, the important questions here are:Are the benefits of massive scale studies worth the trade-offs of self-reporting?What can we do to reduce or eliminate those trade-offs?Imagine the scientific value of having easily created, easily administered, massive studies be easily accessible to any research group. If the research data can be made even a little bit more reliable (direct mobile health-kit measurements for example), that&#39;s hugely valuable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For over 25 years I wondered why social events drained me and what neurological phenomenon the metaphor &#34;energy&#34; stood for (which this article and many others like it don&#39;t seem to bother investigating). I&#39;ve recently come to realize that it&#39;s the extent to which you see other human beings as a threat, which causes your brain to keep its &#34;shields up&#34;, which can feel exhausting. After a observing myself a lot during social interactions, I&#39;ve noticed that I feel drained to the extent I think the people around me can potentially judge me: I feel highly drained during extended family events, class reunions or ceremonies, but I feel perfectly fine amongst a small group of friends who have a don&#39;t-give a-sh*t attitude toward social propriety. I&#39;ve also noticed that alcohol (a disinhibitor) can dramatically reduce the drain. It&#39;s also significantly reduced if I find a table with a few people I like, and get engrossed in a deep discussion and end up forgetting that I&#39;m surrounded by other tables.Perhaps this energy we speak of is the energy the brain expends to continuously compute the requirements of the social contract in members of our species who don&#39;t have it sufficiently hardwired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who typically gets their energy depleted around people, there are certain people that increase my energy. There are also times where I almost need to interact with people on a biological level.Listening to my body is the thing that weirdly, used to take up a lot of energy because I wasn’t used to/ allowed to as a child. So I was constantly making difficult real-time decisions.As an adult, I’ve learned how to listen to my body and crucially adhering to it’s signals. As someone who like to think, perhaps too much, its the best investment I’ve ever made."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Parties also generally drain my energy. But I&#39;ve found out something interesting. If people start playing games at a party (like card games), or if there is a discussion of a topic that really interests me, then my energy is magically replenished. Weird."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You know what Amazon did to me? They delisted my product claiming it was counterfeit. Then they started to directly promote and sell my own inventory.I know it was mine because I contacted the brand to check if Amazon had bought from them. They hadn&#39;t. Also, I was the only one selling this item on Amazon so they couldn&#39;t have stolen from someone else. What&#39;s more, I was the only one importing it to the US. I know because I&#39;m acquainted with the brand owners.When I finally managed to get my stuff out of their warehouses, which took almost a year, they admitted that some of the inventory had been &#34;lost&#34; and compensated me pennies on the dollar.It was a surreal, Kafkaesque, experience that still brings back painful memories. I avoid thinking about it but I hope that one day Amazon will crash, burn, and hopefully never recover."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can tell you a more likely story than &#34;big conspiracy on Amazon&#39;s part&#34;.Amazon has systems in place to say &#34;We cannot ship from X to Y anymore&#34;, but they require manual intervention and maybe those tools don&#39;t get used very much. Until someone finds the right button and presses it, orders are dropping into the warehouse to be fulfilled. Ship this sprocket from Vancouver to Calgary since Calgary&#39;s site has none.But the truck didn&#39;t show up, or maybe it did but now it&#39;s got nowhere to go.Now the dock has one section slowly filling up with packages. It&#39;s been days. Dock doors are a limited resource, and here&#39;s a bunch of them with a mountain of packages blocking them. And the site leadership, well, they have metrics to hit. Just like every other cog in the machine, they will be fired if they don&#39;t make rate. What, you thought it was just the lowly associates who are running with dogs nipping at their heels?What&#39;s a site leader to do? Well, there&#39;s a returns department right here. They&#39;ve got tools that can handle the package being returned, allowing them to restock those items, refund the customers, clear the dock, and make everything go back to normal for the site.Sounds like good &#39;Customer Obsession&#39; to get those orders refunded as quickly as possible.Sellers? Those aren&#39;t customers. Those metrics are not something the leadership needs to worry about, so they won&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"MAMEdev hit this problem a few years back as well. Thankfully, the end result of code that needed to be ripped out and rewritten ended up being pretty small comparative to the whole project. A lot of that came down to there being no corporate interests involved, so no corp VS author arguments-- the worst ones to deal with were contributors who were adamant about keeping the original non-commercial license on their contributions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, going with Apache 2.0 is/was a mistake.There is a clause in the license which implies that almost everybody who uses GitHub/GitLab/etc. to work on an Apache 2.0 project in the common workflows is in breech of the license.Specifically, the license says that every file with modifications has to include a corresponding notice that the file was changed. Nobody does this in practice.Unfortunately the license is simply badly written.Licenses like the GPL don&#39;t have this problem because they only require that a modified version of the software is clearly marked as such without stating how that marking should be done. So the metadata contained in the Git history should be enough to satisfy those superior licenses."</p>

I feel like if we could really ingrain those 6 words that it would go a long way to blocking these types of phishing scams.Number one thing I tell folks in my security training is to never respond or click a link on an inbound message. Instead, look up your bank or service provider and make an outbound call (or direct URL navigation) to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s so strange to read this is still happening in US. I live in Europe - 95% of such attacks are prevented by something called Strong Customer Authentication, which anybody  serving or providing access to an account (cards including) must implement. Basically, that&#39;s 2FA implemented in myriad different ways. So, this Zelle thing wouldn&#39;t be possible at all: Zelle would have to ask for a SCA verification from the customer, just to connect/use his/her account in the first place. That would eliminate ground for such scamming messages ever appearing (if the customers knew and were accustomed to SCA).Though to be fair, scamming is still present here, typically involving calling older people and trying to persuade them to reveal bank access codes during a phone call. There two differences with US banks here:
- banks are required never to ask for access credentials over insecure channel (phone/email) (though SMS is also not perfect in this regard);
- banks are required to educate customers that they never ask for such credentials, educate about fraud scenarios, etc. And they do (at least the reputable ones)Seems that the PSD2 regulation (including SCA) are really making payments much safer in Europe when you compare to rest of the world.Also, to admit: I&#39;m a head of financial institution here, quite knowledgeable of the field, both on regulatory and on technical level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fell for this, and I have never fallen for a computer scam in my life, nor even had so much as a virus in the last two decades.However, it is very sophisticated.  They somehow managed to actually get a fraudulent charge on my card.  When I got the spoofed message from &#34;my bank&#34;, the first thing I did was log onto my legitimate account.  Sure enough, there was a charge I did not recognize.The rest was just a series of unfortunate &#34;rookie&#34; mistakes  on my part.  But the person who called me was highly professional, easily could have been a real customer support representative and spoke English perfectly with no accent.They took the max, $5,000.  My bank thankfully refunded it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminded me of a tight-packed binary format we used in the trading systems domain almost 20 years ago. Instead of including metadata/field names in each message, it had a central message dictionary that every client/server would first download a copy from. Messages had only type IDs, followed by binary packed data in the correct field order. Because of microsecond latency requirements, we even avoided the serialization/deserialization process by making the memory format of the message and the wire format one and the same. The message class contained the same buffer that you would send/store. The GetInt(fieldID) method of the class simply points to the right place in the buffer and does a cast to int. Application logs contained these messages, rather than plain text. There was a special reader to read logs. Messages were exchanged over raw TCP. They contained their own application layer sequence number so that streams could resume after disconnection.In that world, lantencies were so low that the response to your order submission would land in your front-end before you&#39;ve had time to lift your finger off the enter key. I now work with web based systems. On days like this, I miss the old ways."</p>

Apart from that, while you can always sort of fake it with a bunch of optional fields I believe that you kind of need a native encoding to a tagged union if you want to avoid bloating your messages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “Don’t buy stocks when the P/E ratio is over 20” was a good lesson to learn from the 1970s when interest rates were 7%, the Fed hadn’t yet learned what it’s capable of, and most businesses were cyclical manufacturing companies vs. asset-light digital services. Is it relevant today? At a broad, philosophical level, yes. In practical terms, probably not. In the same sense, buying stocks at all seemed like nothing but speculation in the 1920s because corporate disclosures were so opaque. By the 1970s that had changed, and you could begin to make rational, calculated long-term decisions that put the odds in your favor.The funny thing is that exactly this kind of talk was all the rage leading up to both the 2000 and 2008 crashes. The boom makes it impossible to imagine what the bust will look like, and vice versa. Most people are utterly incapable of seeing 180 degrees through the business cycle. They simply can&#39;t do it and rather extrapolate current conditions to infinity.This is a big part of boom/bust cycles. They are spaced out by just enough to entice a new group of greenhorns who ever more loudly beat the new paradigm drum. Then this new class learns that the business cycle is in fact immortal. But for many, it&#39;s a short-lived lesson.And that part about making &#34;rational, calculated long-term decisions&#34; is amusing. Because it&#39;s during the boom that companies start to engage in accounting shenanigans. The book-cooking will all come out in the next bust, just like it always has. 100x + price-to-earnings multiples will cover a multitude of sins.As Warren Buffet allegedly said, it&#39;s only when the tide goes out that you find out who&#39;s been swimming naked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to assume that experts&#39; advice can only be valued (or not) as an appeal to authority. But that would ignore that experts can also provide _explanations_: &#34;This won&#39;t work because this subsystem would violate the laws of physics&#34; e.g. -- and that explanation might then spur someone to find an equivalent subsystem without that flaw, or perhaps one would find a flaw in the initial reasoning, or whatever.Similarly, seeing a list of past failures may inspire variations that seek to overcome the shortcoming without having to waste time first reproducing the same failure. One can try to learn _why_ it failed and use that to guide future attempts.The advice to be wary of experts reminds me of the advice to avoid criticism while brainstorming, the idea in common being that criticism and negativity supposedly stifles creativity. However, it turns out that criticism _enhances_ the brainstorming process https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/should-we-allo... It seems that criticism from expertise could similarly be a boon to future advances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I found interesting is that the period for reappearance of “failed ideas” is roughly the length of a career. Coincidence or due to any real effect I don’t know. I wrote a little about it here:“Don’t be discouraged by the failure of technology or approaches of the past. If the problem is still important after all this time then it’s a problem worth solving. Don’t avoid unsuccessful solutions. Avoid insignificant problems. Success this time around could be unlocked by advances in any number of unrelated disciplines.”https://blog.eutopian.io/the-next-big-thing-go-back-to-the-f..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Marriott decided to avoid poking the bear by stepping on the proverbial mouse.From a business perspective, it makes perfect sense, but moralistically, it does not.It is very disappointing that even I, as an Asian individual living in Canada, am disincentivized from expressing even my own opinion on China and HK/Taiwan, etc. due to the perceived threat of &#34;consequences&#34; from a government whose reach I cannot easily quantify."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actively refusing is the least passive/neutral thing they could have done.Now they’ve obligated themselves (morally) to refuse Chinese political meeting bookings as well, but we won’t see that happenOpinion: Due to Chinese human rights abuses AND the threats against American business, the US should not attend the upcoming Beijing Olympics"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More evidence that China&#39;s arm reaches quite far, including inside the West.Because China is willing to play dirty. If they hosted it, they would see Marriot executives arrested for &#34;corruption&#34;, or Marriot hotels closed for &#34;environmental damage&#34; or similar things, like how they arrested two innocent Canadians as retaliation for the Canadian arrest of the Huawei executive.This is why Nike, NBA, Hollywood, ... bow down to China, including inside the US, they know they will be crushed if they don&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is truly amazing that one person can bring up a 386DX board system. It is true that there are tons of docs available, but still to bring everything together and to get it running is truly amazing.
The team size at any of the PC OEMs doing a 386DX design when it was the state of the art would be at least 25 engineers and managers, easily.Congrats to Alexandru for hitting this out of the park."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although this seems to be a 33MHz CPU, the 386DX40 was the first &#34;decent&#34; processor I had access to when growing up so was quite memorable for me.In my teenage years the PCs my brothers and I had access to were two 386DX40s each with 8MB of RAM and several hundred MBs of hard disk space (can&#39;t remember exactly, but pretty sure less than a GB).We really loved Blizzard&#39;s Warcraft II, which despite having a minimum requirement of 486 CPU, was able to run on the 386DX40s, albeit a bit slower than intended.Since we had two PCs we wanted to play together, but only had a parallel cable. I don&#39;t know why it was so hard for us to get hold of a serial cable, but the point is we only had the parallel one and Warcraft II would only be able to run over serial cables, not parallel ones.I eventually worked out a way though. The 386DX40s were actually also capable of running Windows 95 which had a feature where you could &#34;network&#34; two PCs over a parallel cable. I then ran IPX/SPX over that network which allowed us to play Warcraft II over it.The gameplay was pretty slow, but as I recall it was very reliable and we played quite a bit on this setup. Eventually we got a couple of BNC network cards and cables for a much more conventional setup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These things remind me of one of my first jobs as a bench engineer &#39;trying&#39; to fix PCsthe vast majority of problems back then was the power supply and the vast majority of the issues with power supplies was burned out capacitors - easily fixable.for some bizaar reason one memory that also sticks out was the painful compatibility issues of putting seagate hard disks together with conner hard disks (IDE cables) also SCSI was a pita with terminators not working (resistors at the end of the scsi cable).I built my first PC 386SX (I think it was only a 33MHz - complete with a TURBO button!! :o) ) with bits that other engineers had thrown away - literally, outside they had a skip(dumpster)  with 386 motherboards and other stuff they deemed unfixable that I had to keep going through.everyone was scared of opening monitors - using long screw drivers to ground the tube made them (mostly) safe. I also had to fix a b/w (or technically black/ orange) CGA monitor to go with it. i still managed to get windows running on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this is a joke, there are some contexts in which it does make sense to ask whether the computer is on. For instance, most laptops have an embedded controller which runs all the time, even when the laptop is powered off, and manages things like battery charging and the power state. Within that embedded controller, an is_computer_on() function could legitimately return &#34;false&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool. I’ve used a number of languages and dabbled in a few frameworks but nothing I’ve used brings me joy like ruby does.I approach programming creatively. I think in large systems and architecture. Ruby allows me to skip worrying about the details. Code blocks abstract away thinking about loops and just focus on data. Just about every array operation I could want is there, waiting for a code block. In other languages, things don’t flow like that.I’ve tried purely function languages and I just can’t wrap my head around them because they abstract too much.I’ve tried python, but I end up having to deal with the mess of importing modules and having to set up loops when all I want to do is map data.Node.js comes so close but anemic standard library and absolute mess of explicit async everywhere just gets in the way. I want to love JavaScript. :(Then there is Rails. Nothing even comes close. The attempts to replicate it in other languages ends up missing part of what makes it so great. I’m sad about the move to mounds of JavaScript. Nothing can match the productivity of simple_form and bootstrap.My entire career has been in Ruby on Rails. I hope improvements to Ruby can keep it relevant. If not, I suppose JavaScript will do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d like to use this to voice my appreciation for Ruby. Its ergonomics, flexibility, elegance and power continue to bring me joy and make me smarter every day.It is incredibly malleable and yet pure. It carries a certain warmth and kindness that permeate its community.It becomes faster every couple of years :)I feel so grateful to work with a language that makes me feel like a wizard and look forward to writing code.The community is so incredibly creative, smart and generous that I feel humbled every day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I don&#39;t get why some people want to move to static types.  Ruby is a dynamic language, that&#39;s the point of it...  Giant orgs can just use Java or something.  We need some languages to stay productive for those of us who work solo or in small groups.  If I wanted static types I&#39;d use Java, Go or something (probably Haskell)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Advent of Code. If you like programming, Advent of Code probably has something for you. It&#39;s a great source of practice problems for learning a new language or style. There&#39;s a &#34;competitive&#34; aspect for people who like programming competitions, and you can even make private leaderboards so you can compete against your friends even if you can&#39;t make it on to the global leaderboard.Last year I was earnestly trying to compete on the global leaderboard, and scored points a few times, ending up 103rd overall (slightly frustrating as the displayed leaderboard only goes down to 100th place!), but it&#39;s too stressful for me to want to do that again, and in my timezone it requires getting awake in time for the puzzles to be released at 5am.This year I&#39;ve been building a homebrew 16-bit CPU from 74xx logic, and have written an operating system and development environment for it, and I plan to do as much as possible of Advent of Code 2021 on my homemade computer.There are 2 big hurdles to this. The first is that my computer is very slow. It takes over a minute to compile a typical program, which makes for a very long edit-compile-test cycle, and I don&#39;t have any hardware multiplication etc., so even integer arithmetic can be quite expensive.The other hurdle is that it only has 64K words of memory, and IIRC some Advent of Code problems in the past have required keeping track of state for dozens of thousands of separate things. In those cases I&#39;d either fail, or come up with a way to use the disk for extra storage. I look forward to trying, regardless.As it happens, just this morning I did kind of a &#34;dry run&#34; on problem 1 from 2016 on my homemade computer, and recorded my attempt, which you can watch if you want: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOizI9qi6FU"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the FAQ:&gt;I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you?&gt;Please don&#39;t. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don&#39;t accept puzzle ideas, and I won&#39;t even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.It&#39;s sad that we live in a world where code snippets sent by others can result in legal issues down the line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The best thing about Advent of Code is how you can adjust it to anyone&#39;s skills and interests - you can do it for time, you can take ages, you can use any language you want or multiple languages, you can get help from other people online, you can go down various CS rabbit holes, you can make more elaborate solutions and/or extensions (some people were doing really cool visualisation of the game of life variations last year) etc.It&#39;s very easy to recommend to it anyone who does any amount of programming at any level, from complete beginners to very experienced.Other people in this thread are talking about learning new languages and I found that a bit distracting. I think I&#39;d rather focus on the puzzles themselves and there&#39;s also something very satisfying about writing a clean and concise solution in a few lines which you can&#39;t always do when you&#39;re picking up a new language. I like using Python for it because I can just translate what I&#39;m thinking to a solution without worrying about the language itself. Also, even if I didn&#39;t mind doing it in a new language, I don&#39;t think that AoC gives you large enough problems that can really explore a new language and all of its features. And you can always mix the languages if there&#39;s a language that&#39;s really suitable for a given problem. You don&#39;t have to stick to the same language for all problems.I really enjoyed last year&#39;s, I&#39;m looking forward to this one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Guix System is an advanced distribution of the GNU operating system. It uses the Linux-libre kernelIt&#39;s worth pointing out that the linux-libre kernel is developed under the FSF doctrine that &#34;binary blobs are bad unless you can&#39;t see them&#34;. This has been taken to its logical extreme here, where this Linux fork actively removes security warnings informing users that they need to update their CPU microcode, because microcode in ROM is fine but dynamically loaded microcode updates are not, in this school of thought.https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2018-04/msg00002...I have no interest in software that uses arbitrary religious dogma (that doesn&#39;t help users&#39; freedom, as those users&#39; CPUs have proprietary microcode whether they know about it or not) to justify censoring critical security vulnerability notifications for users. I regard this as actively evil anti-user behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hello, author here, happy to answer questions and discuss!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a reason neither Guix nor Nix have made an LTS-type repo?A rolling release seems at odds with the stability granted by reproducible builds.Maybe I have a miopic view, but what&#39;s nice with Ubuntu LTS is you know everyone and their mothers has built and tested their packages/libraries/executable against the lib versions provided by Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 or whatever. You also know those libs, at their given versions, will get patched as issues come up. If all your libraries are constantly churning then you have no idea of the quality of the libs you&#39;re linking to (and that lib&#39;s dependencies are also churning in turn). You can pin versions, but there is no guarantee what you&#39;re pinning to will be patched and fixed as issues come up"</p>
