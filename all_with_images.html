								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, there it is. I was wondering when this would happen.Facebook used to be involved with the Mercurial community, but it was difficult to work with them. They always wanted to do things their way, had their own intentions, and started to demand that the Mercurial project work the way that Facebook wanted. For example, they demanded that we start using Phabricator and started slowly removing sequential revisions from Mercurial in favour of always using node hashes everywhere, arguing that for their gigantic repos, sequential revisions were so big as to be useless.Eventually the disagreements were too great, and Facebook just stopped publicly talking about Mercurial.I figured they would emerge a few years later with their fork of it. They love doing this. HipHop VM for PHP, Apache Hive, MyRock; these are examples of Facebook forking off their development in private and then later emerging with some thing they built on top of it.The Mercurial project is surprisingly still chugging along, and there are still those of us who actually use Mercurial. I doubt I&#39;ll switch over to Sapling, because I disagreed with the things that made Facebook fork off in the first place. But if others like Sapling and this manages to put the slightest dent into the git monoculture, I&#39;m happy for the change and innovation. I really hope that git is not the final word in version control. I want to see more ideas be spread and that people can see that there can be a world beyond git."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank god.I have been waiting ten years (https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stevebennett.me/2012/02...) for someone to develop a better CLI for git, someone with the scale and clout to do it well and gain mindshare. It&#39;s not that useful to learn a new workflow if no one you ever work with will be familiar with it.This looks incredible. A simple command to uncommit or unamend makes you further realise what a disaster the Git CLI is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a big fan of FB as a company, but I think their open source work is pretty impressive. Various other large companies have the problem of giant monorepos that they constantly need to onboard new developers to, but I can&#39;t think of anyone other than FB who consistently released their solutions.Sure, most people are probably fine with Git once they learned it and if they only work with small to mid sized code bases (like me). But I&#39;m still happy Sapling is out there, I might use it or learn from it if I ever run into the problems it solves."</p>

And it&#39;s much less creepy if all that data isn&#39;t going to someone else&#39;s computer.Also piping in and processing the data from my mobile would be cool, but I wouldn&#39;t want to invade other people&#39;s privacy if I&#39;m in public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Physical books wear out in decades to centuries, computers break in years to decades. Also digital formats are constantly evolving and backwards compatibility for old formats is removed. Even without publisher/legal issues it&#39;s clear that preservation of digital media for even the next 10 years, and especially for the next 100 or 1000, is at risk.But I really wonder why is there no other major service like the Internet Archive? The way to preserve media is to distribute it and store it in many places, not just one central location. Does the Internet Archive store redundant copies in many locations? Does it use long-term physical formats?Also, figuring out what information is &#34;meaningful&#34; and which is completely useless or redundant is extremely important. Because we want to store everything with the potential to be important in the future, but we also have an incredible amount of data (hence one of the reasons why IA is the only major archiver). It may be good to strategize data collection, e.g. a shallow list of all sources and a deeper list of popular sources, a sample of various sources from every region, etc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Ever try to read a physical book passed down in your family from 100 years ago?  Probably worked well.No, it worked terribly because they hadn&#39;t been stored well and were covered in mold (even the ones from only 70 years ago) or otherwise falling apart. I couldn&#39;t search them for specific phrases I remembered my grandfather reading me as a child, and I didn&#39;t have the physical space of my own to store them all either anyway. Even making a stab at indexing them all was enormously labor intensive. I was the only one in the family interested in even trying. It really sucked.&gt;Ever try reading an ebook you paid for 10 years ago? Probably a different experience.Yes, it was excellent, since naturally it was DRM-free or I wouldn&#39;t have paid for it. I have digital stuff from the 80s, still perfectly preserved, that I can call up as I wish, when I wish, anywhere I wish anywhere in the world.I&#39;m 100% onboard with the correct argument that modern copyright and DRM go against the core bargain of IP (societal agreement for public benefit) and could use major reform. But I don&#39;t think this piece does a very good job of making that argument, the entire comparison and pretending that books don&#39;t require any sort of preservation and so on really distracts from the core issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DRM-laden digital books should be seen like the extra cheap paperbacks which fall apart sitting untouched on the shelf after a couple of years. Extremely different than the well-bound books one might think of when handling a 100 year old book.Non-DRM&#39;d ebooks in formats which are open, easily parseable, and that people care to archive should be fine for a long time. Some people here are talking about a decade as if we won&#39;t be able to parse epubs or text files in 10 years. I&#39;ve got documents &gt;30 years old already which are still easily parsed, and I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll have problems rendering them in another 30 years.I&#39;ll be utterly amazed if we can&#39;t render a basic HTML document, text-focused PDF, or hell even just ASCII text in the year 2032. I also have little doubt I&#39;ll still technically be able to load my DVDs or Blu-Rays of that data in 2032 and copy it into the holographic crystal storage devices that&#39;ll come out just before that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a scientist, I often have to deal with similar BS of a reviewer misunderstanding a submitted journal article, literally insisting we do something we already did, and explained in the paper.I try to just own the fact that I didn&#39;t make my explanation clear and visible enough, so I just submit an updated version along with a comment like &#34;We thank the reviewer for pointing out that we didn&#39;t clearly articulate our work on X, so we revised the manuscript accordingly.&#34;In this case change around the UI for this tool to make it slightly more idiot proof, resubmit, and it will be approved. Getting angry and adversarial will only make them have a bad attitude and intentionally be unhelpful. Take them seriously, stroke their egos, and take fully responsibility for having presented your feature in a way they didn&#39;t understand. Thank them for pointing out this huge flaw in your program and giving you the opportunity to fix it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this is why we need to cherish the web. I see no reason why a yoga app can&#39;t be done on the web. I do know that apps tend to convert better, if only we could bridge that gap.It&#39;s in particular troubling how much of this madness we&#39;ve internalized to just accept. The idea that you need to resubmit a 100 apps because Google decided you need to target a different internal version number is insane. It would be very bad if the SDK had a breaking change, but in this case it&#39;s just busy work: upping a number and resubmitting.And what about the rule to be able to report user generated content? Who the hell is Google to interfere on such app-specific functionality? What if my moderation workflow would only allow draft posts, each manually approved, making reporting them pointless? Does Google actually check if a report gets sent or followed up? I don&#39;t think so. So it&#39;s an invasive power grab, and then poorly regulated.These platforms and gatekeepers have become far too powerful and leveled up the arrogance that comes with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any large group representing App developers that could manage the large-scale negotiation and legal wrangling required to force Apple and Google to be more helpful when rejecting legitimate applications?When I worked in Google (Ads, then later in Recommendations for Play and youtube) people often said this was intention to avoid teaching spammers how to get around the rules.  But it&#39;s clear there are enough legitimate developers acting in good faith who are trying to change their applications without significant guidance that it seems entirely reasonable for a large-scale group negotiation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was just on the ground coordinating with 4 friends that got buried in 5+ foot of unexpected snow  in the mountains (forecast said 1&#34;-2&#34; when they went up) for the rifle opener in Montana. I wound up getting sick so I stayed home (hilariously I was the only one who got an elk) but I sent them up with my InReach.All I can say is THANK GOD that I did, because it turned into over a week long effort to get them out. Two decided to walk out and were able to text me a nav point that I was able to meet them at (took all day to get there because of the snow and mud, but I made it and was able to pick them up). The other two stayed up there, and we sent probably 100 texts back and forth coordinating what turned into like 3 solid days of fighting to get up there with snowcats and get them back down. Multiple situational changes that we would have been hosed without.In the end, I spent like $80 on texts, but it was money well spent. I think it&#39;s great for people to have SOS built into their iPhone, but there needs to be a &#34;use it now, pay later&#34; or no one is going to activate it and actually have it available when they need it. The other half of the equation is that you really need to be able to send texts. The SOS button is very expensive. Extremely expensive. That will keep a lot of people from using it. (Yes insurance exists, but hardly anyone has it). Being able to text your friends for help is substantially more useful. Being stuck on a backroad with no service, 5, 10, 20 miles from where anyone can be expected to drive by is a far more common scenario than breaking your leg at the top of a mountain and needing to be evacuated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Set backcountry search and rescue aside for a second.Seems to me this is for ordinary people doing ordinary things outside cell range, and finding they need help. A family member has a heart attack. A collision with a moose. Who knows what.Less “should’ve brought water and a jacket” and more “we’ve been on route 9 for two hours, a moment ago everything was fine, now he’s not breathing, we have no bars, and we have no idea where the nearest hospital is.”Besides, even if this feature only saves a single life, seems worth it to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a Paramedic in Northern California and am VERY happy about this feature. Even in some of our SF Bay Area counties, we have a lot of windy mountain roads with no cell service at all. Our portable radios don&#39;t even work up in the hills. To have an iPhone be able to send GPS location to the public safety access point is fabulous. Our dispatchers can at least drop a pin on a map and we can route to that location ourselves. This already happens in a lot of cases but the caller has cell service. We&#39;ve been on multiple incidents up in the hills where people have reported that they had to drive several miles down the mountain before they were able to get any reception to make a 911 call.This will save us a lot of time, and it will save lives. This is a game changing feature."</p>

When FS5 came out, you could modify the looks as well, so I&#39;d get the flight dynamics as close as I could and another guy would build the model of how it looked. I forget what that package was called, now. But it was a lot of fun. I don&#39;t think any of us had an idea that VA&#39;s would turn into a Thing. We were just teens having fun :)"</p>

If you treat PayPal like a bank, you will have a bad time.Almost all horror stories you hear about PayPal involve the user treating PayPal like they were a bank. Just do not store money in PayPal... sweep nightly if you use PayPal for business. They even provide tools to make this automated.The reason this policy exists is likely to remove super old liabilities for long-dormant accounts that have been long forgotten about.PayPal is not interested in storing funds forever... they want you to buy stuff with it or transfer it to your real bank account.This policy seems aimed at convincing people to &#34;move it or lose it&#34;..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paypal has always loved keeping money they didn&#39;t earn.  They should be treated like a crypto exchange: never keep your funds with them, only use them to transact then move funds away (if no other alternatives available)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have only ever used paypal to pay for things with a credit card. I was tricked into having the account at all by a fraudlent and misleading UI built by ebay and that&#39;s the only reason I had it in the first place. I did use it to pay for some things so I guess their plan worked.Paypal recently, after a decade or so of use, demanded I hand over multiple forms of ID. I refused and said close the account. They refuse to close the account because I have not handed over ID documents that I don&#39;t want them to have on their files because they are untrustworthy both ethically and in terms of competence as you guys know well.So the account is there ready to be hacked. I&#39;ve pointed this out to them on about 20 separate occasions and they refuse to close it.Paypal are crooks. It is in their dna. They&#39;re crooks for no reason, just from force of habit. You cannot trust them in any way. Society allowing them to have any market power whatsoever is completely insane. Yet another case of a cpu attached to a network being on the critical path of what some company is doing preventing otherwise intelligent humans from thinking a normal, critical fasshion about what they are doing and forming a minimally appropriate response, trapping the rest of us who literally cannot act at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Forgive my ignorance but it seems that one major problem with crypto-exchanges is that they don&#39;t necessarily have any assets other than the crypto that has been deposited there, which means all overheads (which I am assuming for some of these guys is $Ms/year) can only come from trading crypto unless they are charging reasonable money for the privilege of using their exchanges.In the FIAT world, banks make tonnes of money from things like loans and mortgages so they can handle some risk by holding onto cash.If this is true, how does it get fixed? Is there any reason someone would take out a loan in crypto and pay interest on the repayments?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pardon for living under a rock, but why are crypto exchanges affected by the mood in the crypto market?I thought that a crypto exchange functions like a currency market: I put an offer to sell 10,000 EUR for 1 BTC and someone else puts an offer to buy 10,000 EUR for 1 BTC. When orders cross, a transaction happens and the exchange gets a fee, whether in currency or crypto units.What are crypto exchanges fundamentally doing differently that they are suddenly losing money?Surely a drop in transactions would make them lose fees and require them to fire some staff, but I expected a &#34;Facebook-like&#34; downsizing, not a full-blown bankruptcy.What am I missing?"</p>

These are written manuscripts of african scholars which are hundreds of years old, and still exist today. Some record the history of great west african civilizations along with other things they studied (e.g. science, religion, math, literature, ect). I was never taught this history even existed but yet was made to learn the various details about asian, european, middle eastern, central/south american history. This, and the attempts to destroy/steal these manuscripts at various points in history, made it click how serious power of controlling information, and ultimately influencing beliefs can be, with respect to giving legitimacy to the various rulers/authorities.

I happened to randomly change isinf to std::isinf (it’s a random habit of mine to put std:: in front of these C functions). Suddenly the regression disappeared! I guess on Clang only std::isinf was a compiler intrinsic while GCC recognized both? Anyway, that’s my small-change optimization story."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that this piece really got me thinking about is how many other crypto companies are the same ponzi scheme because they are counting made-up things as assets on their balance sheet.In other words, suppose I create token SCAMMER, and I say its supply will be capped at 1 million tokens (or 10 million, or 100 million - that&#39;s the &#34;nice&#34; thing about crypto, I can kinda choose whatever number I want), and then I&#39;m able to sell 10 of those tokens for $100 each. According to FTX math, I now have $99,999,000 of assets on my balance sheet, but of course if I actually tried to sell a lot of my &#34;kept&#34; tokens I would tank the SCAMMER price.Even better, and I think what is probably more common in the crypto industry: suppose I get my buddy to create a SUX2BEU token. I tell my buddy I&#39;ll by 10 SUX2BEU tokens for $100 each if he buys 10 of my SCAMMER tokens for $100 each. Now suddenly we can both say we have huge assets on our balance sheets! Until, of course, someone decides to pull aside the curtain covering the wizard.So many ponzi schemes on top of ponzi schemes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often joke that crypto has been run by gold bugs who were forced to &#34;smoke the whole pack&#34; on fiat currencies. So a lot of crypto is a nihilistic homage to federal reserve systems.In that way, &#34;DeFi&#34; feels the same about the finance industry.It was no secret that SBF hated traditional finance. And so I assume he refused to learn anything from it. But what he ended up creating was almost a hilarious parody of the financial system.That&#39;s at least how I can square the circle about how someone who could criticize Lehman Brothers for letting themselves get overleveraged on shady asset classes could literally have negative 8 billion dollars in &#34;Hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@’ account&#34; and then publicly go to Twitter to say they have a &#34;liquidity problem&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m horrified by so many of the comments here that seem to lack even the most basic of human decency. Allow me to fill people in for those who have never uprooted your life and moved across the world for a job. It is a massive commitment on the part of the employee, where you sell the majority of your earthly possessions, property, cars, etc. Then you go through an immigration process which even if its handled by FAANG involves a ton of work. You get to the new country, find a place to live and start to adjust.So to do that to someone and then days later be like &#34;we actually don&#39;t want you&#34; is beyond shitty. This persons visa is dependent on their employment so now they get to go into a city they don&#39;t know and try desperately to find employment with an employer who is interested in sponsoring someone from abroad (which is a small fraction of the total employers).For all you budding Elons, here&#39;s a shorthand for it. If you ask someone to move across the world and don&#39;t need them anymore, give them three months on the books to find somewhere else that don&#39;t count against their visa. It will give them a chance to get settled and go on interviews. Or don&#39;t recruit internationally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many commenters here (presumably US/CA citizens) don&#39;t realize that the gut-wrenching feeling of being laid off whilst your visa depends on uninterrupted employment is _nothing_ like the SHTF-but-all&#39;s-ok feeling of being laid off &#39;regularly&#39;.In the USA, for most work visas, you are given a 60 day death clock pleasantly sugarcoated as a &#39;grace period&#39; to find a new employer or leave the country. Cue trying weave in that baggage in between screening calls &amp; technical interviews to explain to prospective employers how you have 47 days and 15 hours left to be hired or leave. The complication of dealing with USCIS and attaining a work visa (usually bound to your employer) is a marathon even with unlimited time, but in a puny 8 week window?...In my own experience this also happened in mid 2021 when Australia&#39;s borders were closed (to AU citizens as well...) so leaving back home wasn&#39;t even an option."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imho the real question here is, why is it that Meta keeps hiring right right until they do large layoff rounds?The kind of issue that requires large layoff rounds is not something that just materializes overnight, out of the blue.So why does their management - which should be able to read the writing on the wall, since that&#39;s part of their job - not issue a strict hiring freeze (in addition to other measures taken to try and avoid/reduce the impeding layoffs).Why do they go from hiring to firing in the blink of an eye?"</p>

That, and the encryption slight-of-hand with iCloud, makes the cynic’s case for them.App telemetry, metrics, etc might get handwaved away with a sinister phrase, like “essential for improving user experience.” But placing trust in a company on privacy due to the relative lack of financial incentive seems hopelessly naive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple will probably get away with that as it is all in the fine print. But,1. Let&#39;s not forget vast majority ( if not all ) of people on the Internet, inclusive but not limited to Main-steam Media, HN, Reddit and Twitter who commented between 2017 and 2021 thought privacy meant anonymous. And before anyone disagree, very very few on HN even bother to downvote or stand up against the notion of privacy meant anonymous.2. Apple play this card, both in PR and marketing, along with media ( Submarine Article or not ) as a tool against Facebook. Or Social Media but let&#39;s be honest we all know they mean Facebook. And of course, for people from US, after 2016 Facebook is the most evil company on planet earth. Any Facebook bashing equals great.3. A lot of people were brought into the idea of privacy meant anonymous. So in other settings, Apple use the word &#34;personalised&#34; instead of Data Collection, cough, I mean tracking.4. The good thing about all of these, anything illogical will have to unfold some day. ( Just like Crypto ) Apple of course collect Data from you. Apple of course has all the Data about your usage pattern. So when some people came to realise privacy doesn&#39;t mean anonymous, I guess they aren&#39;t so happy?5. Apple&#39;s true definition of privacy is that All Apple&#39;s user Data belongs to Apple. Any data to third party are by definition &#34;Tracking&#34;. Since Privacy is a Fundamental Human Right, I guess the only choice is to give Apple all your Data?6. Most people, especially tech nerds will likely play the I trust Apple more than Google card. Because Apple are not in the Ad business! - That was 2017 to 2021 if not 2022. They have their ads business right infront of you for a long time. They have been preparing their Ads business for a long time. Most tech nerds, or Apple apologist just turns a blind eye to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Even when consumers follow Apple&#39;s own instructions and turn off &#34;Allow Apps to Request to Track&#34; and/or &#34;Share [Device] Analytics&#34; on their privacy controlsReading the description in Settings for both of these switches, we learn the following:1. Allow Apps to Request to Track specifically &#34;Allow[s] apps to ask to track your activity across other companies&#39; apps and websites.&#34; This clause clearly doesn&#39;t apply to any internal analytics process.2. Share [Device] Analytics is a bigger issue, and is the problem. The switch says that it sends information about how the user uses the operating system and Apple services. That clearly includes the App Store, so switching this off should switch off App Store analytics.Including the first point seems stupid, since it muddies the claim against Apple.A note about the App Store privacy information. It (separately) indicates that they collect the information this article alleges - so Apple IS disclosing it. However that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the Analytics toggle reasonably seems to apply to the App Store as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Mass layoffs makes the news because papers depend on sensational headlines, but it&#39;s important to put into perspective.&gt; The pandemic produced Amazon’s most profitable era on record ... Amazon doubled its work force in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.So it doubled its head count in the past 3 years and is now trimming by 3% (or 1% of global).Update: Tried to figure out whether the doubling head count was corporate employees or total. I don&#39;t have time to dig into it now but a quick search did turn up Amazon&#39;s EEO reports in which they break employees down into a number of categories including &#34;Professionals&#34; -- which sounds like it would include engineers. 77K in 2019, 121K in 2021. So it&#39;s reasonable to assume those did double from 2019 to the present. See https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/our-workforce-dat..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just the latest round of cuts at Amazon: &#34;From April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition.&#34;Also: &#34;Amazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it stopped filling more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze corporate hiring across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.$5B loss from one business line is a lot. Maybe this manner of investment inspired Zuck on the metaverse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would think about your positioning some.You’re marketing this as having “less complexity” which   first of all, isn’t going to appeal to people unless they’ve already used the other tools. But, if they had tried Trello, that’s far from complex, as you say it doesn’t have the features you think are needed, so you are more complex than that. It might be that you’re excellent at UX but that needs some comparative examples to see how you have differentiated things.Instead, it might make sense to go more with all the features you need, nothing you don’t angle. Note that I don’t think this really differentiates too much from clickup which has personal productivity options, and as you get bigger you know customers are going to ask for more and more features, because that’s what they do, and we also know that business accounts are the money makers in this market.  It also runs counter to building an “all in one” tool. If you hope to replace chat, docs, collaboration, calendar, and journaling, that’s a big change for people who stepped in just looking for task management.I did see that your prices are lower so you might try positioning based on lower prices than your competition, if you have carefully chosen those price points."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m in the same industry, and find these attempts of constraining technology through secrecy extremely naive by our legislators.
I’d wager that if you already know how to operate an SDR, you properly will have little trouble with the fairly simple  algorithm of measuring phase differences, filtering, CFAR etc. to make a passive radar. Synchronizing a bag of RTL-SDRs with a common oscillator is a trivial soldering task.The cat went out of the bag the second SDRs jumped from DARPA R&amp;D to DVB-T commodity.That aside having a passive radar breadboard is not the same as a high-end passive radar where frequency/phase stability, use of wideband multi-source emitters, ultra-low noise amplifiers and N&gt;&gt;2 channels for increased angular resolution are integrated in an operational system. These systems that actually works, should be controlled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can order a reasonably good passive radar on Alibaba right now.[1]The DVB-T/T2 Passive Radar (external radiation source radar) itself does not emit signals, but receives the echo signals of non-cooperative radiation sources (radio, television, communication base stations, etc.) reflected by the target for detection (as shown in Figure 1). The radar is composed of antenna, multi-channel receiver, and signal processor: the dedicated reference antenna receives direct wave signals, and the monitoring antenna array receives target echo signals; the multi-channel receiver amplifies the signals received by all antennas, performing frequency conversion and A/D sampling. The signal processor processes the output signal of the receiver, and outputs target information after reference signal purification, clutter suppression interference, matched filtering, target detection, parameter estimation and tracking processing. Unlike other passive detection systems, DVB-T/T2 Based Passive Radar(external radiation source radar) can achieve single-station positioning and speed measurement, and can detect more types of targets (can detect radio silence targets, such as autonomous cruise drones, birds and balloons), and is particularly suitable for applications where there are restrictions on electromagnetic radiation and high detection performance requirements.Type of Target: Low-altitude targets such as drones, balloons, paragliders, and general aviation aircraft, including non-cooperative targets with radio silenceDetection Range Directional model: 5 to 10km (DJI Phantom 4), Omnidirectional model: 2 to 4km (DJI Phantom 4)All suppressing this does is cut the US out of the market.[1] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Silent-Sentry-Passive..."</p>

In Linux the music players you find bundled with different distros are simple, but they just work.However since moving to MacOS, I have to either use iTunes or Music, and in Android the default music player and the latest updates of the alt music player I installed the author problem is true; they expect me to use their services and that&#39;s front and clear, while my local music is hidden away in a menu button.This is a fairly ridiculous situation IMHO (well, solitaire in Windows getting ads/online is slightly more, but I&#39;ll never go there) since a music player that fulfills my needs is pretty easy: show a list of artists, play either the whole artist or a single album in shuffle mode.Attempt 1: https://twitter.com/FPresencia/status/1364892370509127681Attempt 2: https://twitter.com/FPresencia/status/1578720636645826560"</p>

But on the small chance of liking a commercial product, Plex is truly dead simple for my parents.  They have an AppleTV.  They signed up.  I share it with them via their registered email address.  And they’re in.  It was as simple a process as I could hope for.That being said, do I like everything they’re pushing for? No.  But they at least allow users to opt out.I understand the sentiments here, truly.  I just don’t have a compelling reason to change since it does what I want, is simple to set up and use, simple to share, and gets refined all the time.This is heresy, but not all commercial software is the devil.  I suspect RMS would hate me for this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It may be  true today that calloc checks for multiplication overflow and doesn&#39;t zero memory if it doesn&#39;t need to, that&#39;s modern revisionism.  Historically, calloc did not do either of those things.eg, from the 4.4 BSD, circa 1993:https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.4BSD/usr/src...    void *
    calloc(num, size)
     size_t num;
     register size_t size;
    {
     register void *p;
    
     size *= num;
     if (p = malloc(size))
      bzero(p, size);
     return(p);
    }"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regurgitating from an older comment of mine: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13110538----The first version of UNIX to include `calloc` was Research UNIX V6, and here&#39;s how it was implemented: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc...    calloc(n, s)
    {
    return(alloc(n*s));
    }

There are several interesting things we learn from poking around V6:- `calloc` originated not on UNIX, but as part of Mike Lesk&#39;s &#34;iolib&#34;, which was written to make it easier to write C programs portable across PDP 11 UNIX, Honeywell 6000 GCOS, and IBM 370 OS[0]. Presumably the reason calloc is the-way-it-is is hidden in the history of the implementation for GCOS or IBM 370 OS, not UNIX. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t seem to track down a copy of Bell Labs &#34;Computing Science Technical Report #31&#34;, which seems to be the appropriate reference.- `calloc` predates `malloc`. As you can see in the above code, there was a `malloc`-like function called just `alloc` (though there were also several other functions named `alloc` that allocated things other than memory). (Ok, fine, since V5 the kernel&#39;s internal memory allocator happened to be named `malloc`, but it worked differently[1]).[0]: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc... (format with `nroff -ms usr/doc/iolib/iolib`)[1]: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know if this is actually true?By that, I mean the title of this article, &#39;Why does calloc exist?&#39;. My guess would be that back in the origins of the C library:1) Few cared about automatic overflow checks, that was a job for the programmer, so it seems unlikely the creators added calloc() specifically so that it could check if m * n overflowed (after all, there are loads of libc calls that will shoot you in the foot if you don&#39;t do overflow/buffer size checks)2) calloc() is ancient, probably pre-dating many virtual memory optimisations, and back then, memory was relatively fast vs instruction execution, so adding calloc() to speed up giant memory allocations would be less impactful. But that&#39;s just a hunch, and I&#39;m often surprised by just how sophisticated early UNIX code was. Early computing was slow, every performance gain you could squeeze out of the system mattered and if there were VMs that could defer zeroing memory until it was really needed then people would probably try to do that.But my guess is, calloc() was simply a helper function, added because it was very common to malloc() some memory and then zero it straight away. Does anyone know the actual history?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author was doing the right thing with explaining it only makes sense when you know the history of how we got to where we are - but there is a bit more to it. It is all a series of band-aids. Band-aids all the way down. As somebody who has been involved with AWS since 2012 I&#39;ve seen them all get added incrementally in response to explosions in usage and complexity and customer unhappiness and frustration.Explicit allows being all you can do in an IAM policy were easy(ish) when there was a handful of AWS services and API actions. As there were more and more services and policy actions etc. they became unwieldy. Enter Permission Boundaries where you could wrap a few explicit denies around them. Kubernetes RBAC is nearly at the same place and could now really use those too - but I digress.Also, early on in my AWS journey, even two accounts (one non-prod and one prod) was only done half the time and viewed as a best practice to think about - people genrally just opened one AWS account. But when IAM wasn&#39;t enough (i.e. there wasn&#39;t enough granularity on the resources or the conditions exposed etc.) the answer became separate AWS accounts as the only, or at least the easiest, way enforce these authorization boundaries/separations with a blunt instrument you could trust. It also helped to keep your bills straight before they would do things like break them down by Tag.Then you often needed cross-account role assumptions to deal with the inevitable cases where things or people needed access between these accounts.Then the explosion in AWS Accounts led to AWS Organizations to provision and manage them all. And it built in Service Control Policies and OUs as a tool/layer to help further manage/constrain IAM policies/permissions (IAM policies, Permission Boundaries and SCPs now being in a venn diagram with each other these days).But AWS Organizations managing heaps of accounts was also too painful to use and get right and so they brought in AWS Control Tower to help make setting up Organizations easier.So, in short, this all makes sense when you understand the inability to totally rewrite/refactor important complex systems used by customers (breaking backward compatibility) and instead trying to keep solving all the challenges with an steady stream of incremental band-aids that you can announce at re:Invent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost ALL manuals for setting up something on AWS, third party tools, and sometimes AWS official tools, effectively have a step that requires admin permissions, like being able to attach arbitrary policies to an instance.At that point you can either:- give everybody Admin access- involve the same 2 or 3 trusted people in processes that they shouldn&#39;t really be involved- dig down into permissions to try to build something yourself that apparently the people writting the manuals gave up on doingLooks very bleak, anybody has a different view in this? Seems unlikely that big organizations work like this on AWS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rant: I&#39;m glad the author called out GCP as well, but the idea that it&#39;s the user&#39;s fault for granting too many permissions is absurd. Has the author tried doing this at scale? Try a super simple example: I want a user to have access to query a schema in BigQuery. Can you guess the magic combo of permissions that is going to take? Because the documentation is not going to correctly tell you. Thus after spending way too much time trying to get it done one ends up widely over-permissioning to just get the damn thing to work. You could argue their model is sound and it&#39;s just that how they aggregated permissions into roles is absurd or even just argue that they need better defined roles and I would accept that, but still it&#39;s quite frustrating as is. I mean just look at the length of the reference: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so happy to see this. It should live on folklore.org. The librarians were heroes (loved the &#34;pink slips&#34;, ha ha).I was an engineer at the time — my manager had apparently heard a little bird and told his reports that we might want to go through the Apple Library and check out any books that looked interesting ... because we would likely not ever have to return them.I grabbed Foley and Van Dam, maybe a few others. It was sad to see the library go but having only been at Apple for two years, perhaps it served to give me a taste of what Mr. Jobs at the helm would be like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every corporate librarian or archivist keeps a plan to save their archives in their back pocket. We have to. Corporate archives can come under attack at any time when someone in power—a new CEO, a legal department, the consulting firm behind an acquisition, even a random IT person cleaning up servers—suddenly doesn’t like the idea of a bunch of old stuff lying around. (If you want to know how the Hewlett-Packard Company Archives was saved after enduring a major spinoff, 6 CEOs in 10 years and a company split, read my 2020 article.)I like the idea that corporate librarians and archivists know they have a professional and ethical responsibility that supersedes what the current corporate leadership believes is their current business interest. (Think about the reasons someone would decide they don&#39;t &#34;like the idea of a bunch of old stuff lying around&#34;)Engineers could use some of this too.It is striking to me how the library staff is all smiling big on their last day of work -- because they know they saved the archives, without Steve Jobs noticing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Exported to PDF in case this get taken down by Apple.&gt;But then I read the New York Times article about Laurene Jobs starting the Steve Jobs Archive. Here’s what that article said.&gt;When Mr. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, a dozen years after he was forced out, one of the first things he did was offer Stanford University the company’s corporate archives, said Henry Lowood, the curator of Stanford libraries’ History of Science and Technologies Collections. “Stanford had a signed document from Apple’s legal department within 24 hours, allowing it to transport some 800 boxes from the company’s campus to the university.”This story wasn&#39;t made up by her. It was reported, may be misreporting, may be Apple&#39;s Submarine PR for years. And she kept the story going. ( So to speak )And then this interview [1] with Jony, Tim Cook and Laurene Jobs. I guess people can make up their own mind after watching the interview. But if anything a lot of what was being said by Tim Cook and Laurene Jobs was repeating what Steve had said publicly. Intentionally or not.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdvzYtgmIjs"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At the risk of sounding to newage-y, I experience the benefits of exercising as energy balancing.Solving problems, learning and building new things all day can be very mentally exhausting. Cardio, sports, lifting; helps re-balance the physical with the mental. I am sure there are more scientific words and biological descriptions that I lack the vocabulary for. If I get too mentally focused on a project/job/problem and go days without matching it with vigorous physical activity, I end up not sleeping as well, am less tolerant, more scattered and brain fog tends to start rolling in. If I counter it with the physical exercise or physical energy expenditure the mental clarity comes back, I sleep better, and don&#39;t have hair-triggered verbal impulse control issues. Otherwise, if I let it go for too long, lethargy sets in - which I attribute to the body/physical and mind/mental trying to rebalance itself. I dont think it cares that it makes me feel like crap overall, more that it&#39;s neutral in just wanting a balance however that comes about.I often refer to exercise as me taking care of my mental health - as opposed to being physically fit. That could be seen as &#34;exercise [being] the best cognitive exercise&#34;. Looking at it that way, exercise creates a mental-out imbalance, which causes the stored energy in the mind to be stimulated and need more output creating the mental sharpness. Obviously I have nothing to back up the claims other than decades of experiencing this to be true for me time and time again; though I do believe there are better biological explanations than energy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have any references to hand, but drawing from both personal experience and anecdotal stories from places like r/nootropics, the link between cognitive performance and physical exercise is already well established and almost universally accepted. In comparison, brain training games and sudoku puzzles are rarely, if ever, mentioned as beneficial (again, anecdotally). Am I misunderstanding what&#39;s being speculated here?Somewhat related - something that I do find quite curious from my own personal experience is that lifting heavy weights has a far greater impact on my ability to concentrate (and therefore perceived cognitive ability, I guess) than cardio/aerobic exercise does. Like night and day. I&#39;ve recently started attributing it to creatine supplementation, but I do wonder if there&#39;s anything more to it than that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working out makes you more cognitively sharp because it increases the rate of fluid transfer throughout your body and increases metabolism. Ancillary effects of this are calmness, endorphins, and regulated sleep. There I said it, no magic science required. You bring balance in, you get balance out. This ain&#39;t the type of cut throat science most of you on HN expect, but sometimes the simple explanation is the one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another interesting point is that the city of Ur had a harbour, which connected it directly to shipping routes with India [1] and Bahrain [2].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was on a ferry ship from Italy to Greece where they had  paid sattelite Internet via WiFi. The WiFi AP was at first a captive portal. You could buy Internet access with cash at the reception or you could pay online. For that they had to enable access to stripe.com. But stripe uses fastly CDN, so they enabled one specific fastly endpoint that stripe uses. You had direct IP traffic to this specific IP address. reddit also uses fastly CDN. So with a /etc/hosts hack I could load reddit pages for free. Not images though, as they are hosted by imgur.I assume one could also create a tunnel over reddit chat connect to the Internet, but I never did that.By default, reddit did not work though, as their fastly CDN endpoint is different from stripe&#39;s, also the stripe&#39;s endpoint did not correctly sign TLS for reddit.com. But setting a Host header of old.reddit.com on that fastly IP successfully downloaded the page.When I still had phone network by the coast, I set up iodine IP over DNS tunnel, but it did not work, even though DNS requests worked on that WiFi.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If you have $110 million in assets and $100 million in liabilities you are said to be levered 10:1There is no single leverage ratio [1]. On an asset basis, this is an 11:1 leverage ratio, i.e. $11 of assets for each dollar of equity. A lot of miscommunication around leverage seems to stem from this ambiguity.[1] https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/l..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems a bit too wordy to demystify the concept. Here&#39;s a simpler example.1. Bank A offers you 5% interest for a 1 year deposit. You deposit $100 of your own money. You are unlevered. Things go well and after a year you receive $105, a neat 5% return on your investment. Or things don&#39;t go well, bank A turns out to be a scam and you receive $0, a -100% return.2. Bank B offers you a loan for a year for 4% interest. You borrow $900, together with your own $100 you deposit $1000 at bank A. You are levered 1:9. Things go well and after a year you receive $1050 ($1000+5% interest) from bank A, you repay bank B $936 ($900 + 4% interest), so you&#39;re left with $114, a very neat 14% return (almost triple the unlevered return). Or things don&#39;t go well, bank A turns out to be a scam and you receive $0. But now you still owe bank B $936, so together with your own $100 loss you made a -1036% return. Oops.p.s. It&#39;s called leverage because (like a physical lever that allows you to lift something much heavier than without) supplementing your own funds with lots of borrowed money allows you to tackle something much bigger than using only your own money, like buying a house or starting a business or getting 5% on $1000 instead of on $100."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this uncharacteristically hard to understand.In the stock brokerage example, we&#39;re told:&gt;They might allow you 2:1 leverage when you buy stock: your $1,000 buys 20 shares now.But then a couple of paragraphs later:&gt;But you now owe $1,000 to your brokerage, and are 1:1 leveredMy brokerage offers 2:1 leverage, which results in me being 1:1 levered? I think I understand what patrick is saying here but I also find it hard to followOn the other hand:&gt;One is that, because people can ask for money from their checking accounts at any time, impecunious operation of the bank could cause the value of the mortgages to be impaired just a tiny little bit at a time when people need most of the money in their checking accounts.I&#39;ve read this four or five times and I don&#39;t understand the chain of cause-and-effect here at all. Why does &#34;people can ask for money from their checking accounts at any time&#34; mean that &#34;impecunious operation of the bank could cause the value of the mortgages to be impaired just a tiny little bit at a time when people need most of the money in their checking accounts&#34;?"</p>

Without knowing the history of the Met logo I have always found the (new) logo fairly iconic- the stickers visitors wear, and the various paraphernalia with the logo look good to me.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s important to note that Uniswap is decentralized and anyone can &#34;list&#34; anything for trading without asking anyone or going through any process. This means there are thousands of tokens, probably millions in the future, available to trade.Users do not see these tokens unless they actively search them out. Uniswap uses the TokenList standard (https://tokenlists.org/) and by default users only see tokens such as the top 100 projects on CoinGecko. There are many lists created by reputable players such as Aave and Gemini which cover the entire gamut of projects users want to trade without exposing end users to scam tokens.I believe this is a good system and has worked well as having any kind of listing process or even a DAO introduces subjectivity and provides points of capture for bad actors. With an open listing process and standards like TokenLists we can say that Uniswap is truly a public good and will be around as long as we need it which provides a guaranteed way to swap any asset for any other asset no matter who created it or how controversial it is which is a good primitive for humanity to be able to rely on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some comments: While the report findings might be correct on the number, the terminology and conclusion in related discussion are often not. No real person ever traded these 26k tokens. The creation of liquidity pool should not be considered a launch, as you still somehow need to convince other people to buy it from you. Nothing was &#34;launched&#34;.These trading pairs are more akin to spam, to show up in the search results (somewhere else, do not show up on Uniswap). Other research find the scam volume is way less than 1% of the total trading volume. Only looking this number does not reflect the true health of the market or the controls Uniswap has in place to prevent trading these tokens.We also do not call fake Viagram advertising email rug pull, even if it is clearly intended to steal your money without making your dick hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sure, because anyone can create and list a token on Uniswap. The only cost are the gas fees. That doesn&#39;t mean those tokens have any real liquidity or are being used. Just like anyone can create a website and put it online. The only cost are the hosting fees. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll get any visitors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Voluntary Chapter 11&#34; in Delaware. Figures.That gets them out from bankruptcy in the Bahamas, which is much tougher than US law. The Bahamas still has classic tough bankruptcy laws, where there&#39;s no debtor-in-possession reorganization. It&#39;s straight to liquidation, with a court-appointed receiver in charge.This should be, and may be, converted to a straight liquidation. Chapter 11 can be useful for restarting companies that actually do something, like General Motors. There, much of the value is in the ongoing business. FTX, going forward, has no ongoing business. Lawyers for creditors will be making that argument.Note that Bankman-Fried is still employed by FTX, &#34;assisting&#34;.Current banners at FTX.com: &#34;FTX is currently unable to process withdrawals. We strongly advise against depositing. Deposits of TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, and HT are disabled. All onboarding of new clients has been suspended until further notice.&#34;&#34;We have reached an agreement with Tron to establish a special facility to allow holders of TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, and HT to swap assets from FTX 1:1 to external wallets.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Second of all, there&#39;s no need to include &#34;window shopping&#34; in our recorded history; this is when you undo a ways, take a look around, then skedaddle out of there back to &#34;the present&#34; without changing anything. This is just a matter of moving information back and forth from undo-stack to redo-stack.Usually the whole reason I might undo for a while is to get back part of something I was working on and merge it into other changes I’ve made since then. I’m curious why the author dismisses this, personally cherry picking old history is my primary workflow with undo. In editors that support the undo history they’re advocating here, like emacs, I’m usually undoing a long way so that I can put something in the clipboard, then redo all the way back and cut-and-paste the previous partial state.It is nice in emacs that typing after undo doesn’t lose my undone edits, that is handy and is a nice little safety net, but it doesn’t actually solve the problem I normally want to solve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many times I want to undo to a previous state, but then apply again a few of the changes I just reverted, basically cherry-picking from the future (from the redo stack).It would be interesting to be able to see all edits as individual patches/diffs that you can commit/discard individually. Like a mini automatic git inside the editor, automatic in the sense that every &#34;edit&#34; creates a commit, undo/redo move HEAD.This would be entirely optional, you can continue using Undo/Redo as usual, but if you need to do a more complex history operation you can open this &#34;git&#34; view and operate on the edit tree directly.Photoshop has this nice undo panel where you can see individual edits and click your way to the desired point in history:https://www.bwillcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how...One can imagine such a view in a text editor, where each entry shows a diff of what that step did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Vim has this, it&#39;s :earlier and :laterhttps://vimtricks.com/p/vimtrick-time-travel-in-vim/    :earlier 3 – Undo the last 3 changes
    :earlier 5m – Go back to the state of the file 5 minutes ago
    :later 2 – After undoing something, redo the next 2 changes
    :later 1h – Travel forward through the change history 1 hour

Vim also stores the tree of changes, but it&#39;s a pain to access without plugins."</p>

It was common for engineers to come in and find we didn&#39;t do rebasing and find it weird, but we took the opinion that history should be exactly what you actually did, not some clean and idealised version of what you wish you had done. There are advantages and disadvantages to this, but having a defined approach was the most important aspect.Also the fact that we didn&#39;t rebase and used merges everywhere was a major contributor to no one ever breaking their git repos, something that git seems notorious for elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Modern Git workflow is very simple on its own:1. Your codebase has a `main` branch which is write-protected2. Devs submit changes to `main` from their own branches using PRs3. Devs can do whatever the fuck they want on their own branch4. PRs are merged one at a time5. When merge happens a dev&#39;s PR is squashed into one commit that gets appended to `main`6. If next dev wants to merge their PR with a conflicting change they have to resolve the conflict first and then they merge7. The end result is that `main` is a linear history of all PRs with the time they were committed to the `main` branch i.e., when they could&#39;ve started to break prod.This is a solved problem and it works great in industry. Why break it? If you want interactive rebase then make 2 PRs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO the single most important idiot proof of git should be a universal &#34;undo&#34; command.- Committed wrong? Undo- Switched to wrong branch? Undo- Pushed wrong? Undo- Merged wrong? Undo- Wrong reset? UndoThere should be a &#34;idempotent&#34; undo for every action in git. If not, warn the user for possible outcomes.In this way, we can safely learn git via trial &amp; errors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an excellent description of a false sharing perfoance issue, and I wouldn&#39;t envy the work involved in tracking that code down through the JVM. These sorts of issues are common inside the OS kernel itself. Kernels are managing lots of shared resources, and as you add more CPUs, these sorts of issues emerge as bottlenecks. They&#39;re enough of a problem that the perf tool recently got a new sub-command, &#34;perf c2c&#34;, which tries to help identify false sharing (and other cache ping-ponging) issues much quicker.If you&#39;re interested in learning more about this class of issues and the new tool, there was an excellent talk at LPC 2022 by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo. And as luck would have it, the videos just came out, so I can link it here. In my opinion it was one of the best talks of the conference.https://youtu.be/A23UopXKq6E"</p>

The new recording is then played back and re-recorded, and this process is repeated. Due to the room&#39;s particular size and geometry, certain frequencies of the recording are emphasized while others are attenuated. Eventually the words become unintelligible, replaced by the characteristic resonant frequencies of the room itself.performance recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtO4DsSazc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Markdown is a convenient but deeply limited markup language  with only a small subset of html&#39;s features. And yes, limitations are good because we want documents not web apps, etc, etc, but I mean &#34;images can&#39;t have captions&#34; limited, &#34;navigation bars don&#39;t exist&#34; limited. Actual important features of html don&#39;t exist in markdown, which is why almost every markdown platform ends up adding extensions and shortcodes. Why use markdown at all? Just use html.&#34;But html isn&#39;t style-agnostic&#34; yes it is. CSS isn&#39;t style-agnostic. Instead of a markdown browser, how about a browser with a fixed stylesheet and no js? You don&#39;t even need a browser for that, that could just be a userscript that gets plugged into an existing browser. It&#39;d break non-compliant websites that require javascript or custom css, but so would a markdown browser. Most people wouldn&#39;t write content for it, but most people wouldn&#39;t write content for a markdown browser either.&#34;But html is cluttered&#34; it doesn&#39;t have to be. This is a valid webpage:    &lt;!doctype html&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Page Title&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
    Ut ac lorem ut massa euismod vestibulum.

    &lt;p&gt;Nullam rutrum blandit eleifend. Aenean a varius diam.
    Morbi sodales velit nunc, vel vestibulum lorem tempus sodales.

Personally, I prefer writing in markdown, but that&#39;s no reason to insert a markdown renderer into browsers. HTML can already be as sleek and readable as you want. If we added a new type of markup for anybody with a personal preference, we&#39;d never stop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This doesn&#39;t really make sense, for a couple reasons...There are many flavors of markdown. We&#39;d need a standards body, compatibility suites, etc., and for all the browser vendors to adopt it.Meanwhile, markdown is designed to transform to HTML, which browsers already render. Adding a markdown-to-html plugin/step to your web server or publishing process is not exactly the most burdensome thing, relative to everything else it takes to develop, publish, and maintain a site. And it resolves the markdown flavors issue.The thing is, people could choose to publish, simple uncomplicated sites now -- it would be cheap and easy, too. The HTML is barely more complicated than the equivalent markdown, and it would take a few lines of CSS to apply a basic style.The many sites that choose to be complicated, cluttered, and expensive will continue to be so, for the same reasons they are now. Markdown would just be another way to build simple sites, which they don&#39;t want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HTML is already a markup language. You could just as easily make basic websites using HTML and some basic inline CSS.(They’d even have some extra features missing from Markdown that I’d consider still part of a basic content formatting suite like floating or multi-column layouts. They’d even have a defined standard for machine readable metadata!)The problem is that people don’t make websites like that very often, even though they can. This is trying to solve a problem that doesn’t currently exist."</p>

I.e., let&#39;s remove crypto and magically-dev&#39;ing-ourselves-out-of-holes from the equation.There must be policy wonks here on HN who know the ins and outs of local/state/federal government, copyright law/fair use, etc. (I&#39;m assuming the U.S. IP lobby is the 400 pound gorilla in the room.)What are some good starting points to look for a more robust way out of the problem-- how do we sustainably grow a crowd-sourcable archive for copyrighted digital artifacts? What&#39;s an approach that could eventually be on a referenda or party platform? Does archive.org have any idea? Any other orgs have an idea?There should be a sustainable solution to bootstrapping civic databases to archive and make available/discoverable all the shits citizens care about without waiting 70+ years for it to enter the public domain.It&#39;s absurd as it is now. We&#39;ve got a scientific database duct-taped together by a fucking grad student in hiding, and AFAICT nearly every researcher uses it.What&#39;s the reasonable legislation to say, &#34;As long as the project does X and avoids Y, the project may archive Z&#34; for all digital artifacts Z in some domain?Edit: clarifications"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The discussion on race conditions at the end is an important one, and IMO the bugfix is a bandage at best: the notion of anything accessing the “current” object after any kind of delay, especially in an event handler, when there is any chance the thing is not a singleton, is a recipe for disaster. In this case, dismissing the “current” security code screen was a supported API surface and that should set off all the red flags.Of course it’s annoying to have to track the identity of “our screen” and bind that identity to event handlers, or make it accessible with context etc. But it’s necessary in anything remotely security-adjacent.(And never assume anything is a singleton unless you add a breadcrumb comment for someone who might change that assumption on a different team!)"</p>

I&#39;ve been doing that for more than 20 years now.This bug, if you look into the fix, falls into my &#34;state transition&#34; category. You can (and should) model large parts of your software as a state machine, with explicit transitions and invariant checks. If you do not, you still end up with states, just implemented haphazardly, and sooner or later someone will forget to perform a task or set a variable when transitioning from state to state.This category is my strong contender for #1 problem area in all devices that have a user interface."</p>

Let&#39;s also say you want to make an unpopular decision (or multiple unpopular decisions) that you know will drive a certain percentage of your staff to leave the company.  Wouldn&#39;t it make the most sense to announce those decisions before making layoffs?  Let people self select whether they want to stay and work for you and then make your layoffs after to ensure all teams are properly staffed.  Instead, Musk has already laid people off to the point that they are trying to hire back people previously laid off and current employees are sleeping in the office. Now he is pushing even more people out the door with no control over what teams will be hurt the hardest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am split on the remote work thing from a productivity / creativity perspective.I do think there are times when I&#39;m less productivity working from home compared to the office. I also think as a team we&#39;re less creative. Some of the best stuff I&#39;ve done in my career has come out of casual conversations with my team about the stuff we&#39;re building. I&#39;ve noticed I don&#39;t think about what I&#39;m building as much when working remote, I&#39;m just building it.That said, I don&#39;t think 100% office is good either. That tends to just burn me out and I know other people I work with say the same thing. I think I&#39;m at my best when it&#39;s 2-3 days in the office and the rest working from home.40 hours in the office is really extreme these days. And any potential benefit of having employees working together in an office 24/7 is going to be negated by their dissatisfaction. Were I working at Twitter I&#39;d probably be looking for a new job after this announcement. Not so much for the remote work decision either, but just the general lack of respect for how the employees prefer to work. This lack of flexibility probably means Musk won&#39;t just stop at remote work but he&#39;ll want keep track of your productivity, when you arriving in the morning, how long you take for lunch, etc. Working for these kinds of people in my experience is a living hell."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: &#34;FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried said in investor meetings this week that Alameda owes FTX about $10 billion, people familiar with the matter said. FTX extended loans to Alameda using money that customers had deposited on the exchange for trading purposes, a decision that Mr. Bankman-Fried described as a poor judgment call, one of the people said.&#34;In the FTX International terms of service ( https://help.ftx.com/hc/article_attachments/9719619779348/FT... ) they say that users have full title, ownership and control of digital assets. They say that the assets are the property of the user, and shall not be loaned to FTX trading, shall not be treated as they belong to FTX trading, and that users control the assets in the account.So if they did indeed loan out customer deposits, that is just straight up criminal fraud, open and shut. This isn&#39;t like some DeFi scheme where they are working around some legal loophole or in the fine print tell you that they will probably lose your money. This is just straight up illegal under the plain vanilla theft and fraud laws of any country. This isn&#39;t even a bank run (banks at least tell you they are loaning your deposits out) -- it&#39;s a run on a U-Haul self-storage where you find out that they actually sold all the furniture in your storage unit to a pawn shop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"MD and I work in the field. The technology is called CAR-T, as the article mentioned. It’s been used pretty widely for “liquid” tumors for a while (eg leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma),but solid tumors are particularly difficult to target using current CAR-T therapy. If this CRISPR  tech can be applied widespread to solid tumors that opens up a huge swath of patients that can be treated.However cost and logistics are a huge factor. CAR-T therapy currently cost about $300,000-$500,000 to treat a patient. Beyond the cost of the immunotherapy you require a huge institutional investment because there are characteristic side effects that occur within the first 30 days of treatment which necessitates patients to be either admitted to the hospital for 30 days or stay in close proximity with daily check-ins (yes the cancer is getting treated BUT now your immune system is hyperactive which can be very dangerous in the short term).Very few academic hospitals, let alone community hospitals, have this bandwidth which will lead to cancer care being concentrated in a handful of a few very large cancer specific institutions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This pulls together so many advancements that it would make a 90s oncologist cry.1) Being able to rapidly sequence the genomes of cancer cells to detect common mutations2) Computationally simulating those mutations to look for viable T-cell targets3) Custom building T-cell receptor proteins [0] capable of recognizing those targets4) Inserting those custom receptor proteins into the patients&#39; own T-cells with CRISPRTruly, we&#39;re living in the days of future medicine...[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-cell_receptor"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a haematologist who is involved with patients who have CAR-T (I don&#39;t do it myself, but do other types of transplant and I look after the patients before and after) and my research area is in the way T cells target cancer.This study isn&#39;t CAR-T.  It is more similar to adoptive TIL therapy because it is using the T cell receptor (TCR) to target the cancer&#39;s mutations.  This has a huge advantage over CAR-T.At the moment we use CAR-T to target, mostly, B cell cancers.  These cancers have CD19 and CD20 on their cell surface, as do most B cells.  We can safely target these cells because it turns out your B cells aren&#39;t critical for life.  Think of it like an amputation.  Your B cells went rogue, you wipe them out.The problem is this doesn&#39;t translate to other cancers, which don&#39;t have an obvious cell protein you can target specific to a group of cells you can do without.All cancer cells have mutations, and all cells in the human body have to display a sample of its proteins on its cell surface. This way our immune system regularly identifies cancer and removes it.  Cancers that get established have somehow leveraged local immunosuppression to hold off the immune system, and so the immune system and cancer become a stalemate, or worse the cancer takes off and kills the person.If we can target the mutations of the cancer, then we can get at the heart of the cancer itself.You might ask why the cancer just doesn&#39;t display it&#39;s antigens on the surface.  If a cell does this it gets removed by NK cells (natural killers) - our body&#39;s fail safe.What I find interesting is that I didn&#39;t think we were close to predicting what TCRs can bind to to a peptide on MHC on the cell surface.  I&#39;m going to need to look at the article to findout how they did this.  I suspect they used a library of known TCR-antigen interactions."</p>

You have to make something people want and convince those people it&#39;s in their best interest to pay you.Open source can be a part of a larger strategy to earn a living (consulting, customizations/open core, relicensing, books/talks/seminars, etc), but yeah, GitHub stars aren&#39;t money.[0] https://blog.senko.net/open-source-is-not-a-business-model"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I continue to think that the best model is the one adopted by Fody.NET[0]. It&#39;s open-source, on GitHub, under the MIT license, developed in the open, and with a voluntary OpenCollective. And if you open an issue or pull request and you&#39;re not on the OpenCollective, it&#39;s usually immediately closed, by policy. The result is a system that is paid enough to be excellent, excellent enough for most users not to need support, and non-bogged enough for paying users to get excellent support.The best part is when corporations get involved. A company will absolutely get something for free if it can, but if it has to pay, it&#39;ll pay a lot more than the absolute minimum, for PR reasons.[0]: https://github.com/Fody/Home/blob/master/pages/licensing-pat..."</p>

I gave them away for free during launch weeks (but readers could still pay if they wish) and this model worked so well that selling programming ebooks is now my primary source of income."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It bears repeating because this is a common mistake in inflation discussions: a decrease in inflation metrics means price increases are slowing down, it doesn’t mean that prices are going down （that would require a negative CPI print).Also, this number is year over year, so the decrease just means the price increases between Oct 21 and Oct 22 are not as steep as between Sept 21 to Sept 22, which is not hard to achieve because Sept 21 to Oct 21 had a bigger month over month jump.The right way to interpret this number is that high prices have plateaued a bit. Yes that means your groceries are going to be x% higher than in 2020. Short of deflation, they always will be."</p>

  write(&#39;pw&#39;, into=&#39;Password&#39;)

I am the author of Helium. It&#39;s a wrapper around Selenium. It&#39;s fully open source. Under the hood, it uses Selenium 3, which is old. But boy does it work beautifully.1: https://github.com/mherrmann/selenium-python-helium"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;re going to get a lot of responses that say record-replay testing doesn&#39;t scale, is unmaintainable, etc. They&#39;re totally right.But the thing is, early on when your app is in flux, neither does writing Selenium code. There&#39;s a pretty big truism in UI automation that writing UI tests before a UI freeze is a recipe for a shit-ton of pain. Coding to ids or xpaths only gets you yay far if the UI flow itself fundamentally changes.But re-recording might be easy.Don&#39;t use stuff like this for long-standing tests. Unless you architect your app just right so that IDs are always stable, and you never change the interface, it&#39;ll break and break in ways that you can only fix by a complete re-record. Plus the tests tend to be extremely timing-fragile because recording uses delays instead of synchronization points, so they just won&#39;t work in CI.But do use stuff like this at your desk during bring-up, when the cost of a re-record is lower than the cost of a test rewrite and it&#39;s ok to re-run the thing if the first try craps out due to a timing glitch.And from there, keep an open mind.I went to a GTAC (Google testing conference) where a presentation made a very good argument--with numbers and everything--that for smaller projects with simple and more or less static UIs, and where the tests were all fundamentally scripted, there was almost no advantage to coding the tests later. Record-replay was the best way to go.But I definitely don&#39;t think a system like PlayWright fully replaces remote stubs like WebDriver and coding tests in the languages that can talk to it.At some point you hit the issue that the login screen changed and now every single test is invalid. It&#39;s awfully nice if you used Page Object Model and you have a single-point-of-truth to fix it.More to the point, test automation can do more than just execute a script repeatably. Randomized monkey testing is something you can really only do in code, ditto scenarios that need to talk to testing interfaces exposed from the app itself.Glad you found a tool that resonates with you!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Selenium just couldn&#39;t parse the over-engineered Javascript framework we had, and I had to pile on hacks on hacks.Excuse me, but isn&#39;t selenium actually a browser robot and not a javascript parser? I assume this is just that DOM is mutating so much that they could or could not find that element or always have to wait for it and comes with unreliability and such.I haven&#39;t used alternatives, but using selenium feels like solid &#34;Engine&#34; to make abstractions on."</p>

I grew tired of having the respect I afforded Marty, and his employer, with attempts to resolve the dispute privately, get turned into a giant waste of time, effort and money. The Reddit post had been up for 15 months and attempts to resolve the dispute with Marty had gotten me nowhere. With my patience stretched to the absolute limit, I decided to take steps to remove the Reddit post myself.Reddit Moderator: I reached out to one of the r/DOOM moderators. We made contact and arranged a call via Discord.The moderator introduced himself and spoke about his love for the DOOM franchise and its fanbase. Along with the r/DOOM subreddit, he told me he also moderated the official DOOM Discord server.I told him how Marty’s Reddit post had affected me deeply, both professionally and personally. It was a source of ongoing stress and harm, and I asked if he’d consider removing it.Much to my relief, he instantly took it down.But within 12 hours, the post was reinstated. The moderator blocked me on Discord and didn’t reply to my emails.A few days later, Marty’s lawyers contacted me and said removing the Reddit post had greatly offended him. He was furious and made it clear in the strongest terms that an amicable resolution would be impossible.I just read some of the article and that&#39;s horrible behavior from ID.You have my support, Mick."</p>

I express that as a compliment, even if in the real world it works against you.It&#39;s not the main topic, but I like to call out attention to this:&#34;incidences of online abuse escalated at an alarming rate as Marty’s Reddit post led to frustration over my alleged professional failure, and toxic gamers grew openly aggressive.They shared my personal details via message boards, including Reddit, which meant that abusers could now reach me in more ways than ever. They email-bombed my inboxes, crashing the server and clogging my messaging services, crippling my ability to communicate. They harassed my other clients with attempts to get me fired from their projects. They called my phone numbers around the clock, screaming messages full of abuse.I began receiving specific expressions of violence, the content so vivid it made me sick. The torrent of abuse telling me how to kill myself, how I’d be mutilated, how they would circulate photos of my body to traumatise my family, how my family would be murdered, how they’d hurt my animals, how they’d shoot up any event I attended, how I’d be raped to death, really started to wear me down in ways I couldn’t previously imagine.&#34;I&#39;m strongly against authoritarian overreach and used to consider trolling a &#34;fact of life&#34;, nothing requiring intervention. I no longer believe that. We&#39;re talking about a disappointing audio track for a stupid game yet the man and his family have to fear for their lives. And surely Mr Manager Marty looks at it with approval.A line has to be drawn in the sand. There must be a cost to such threats. A massive fine or some short prison time. Further, those enabling and launching the mob, even if unknowingly, need to carry responsibility too. This isn&#39;t just defamation, it spills over into real world danger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great writeup. What a clever design!I remember Apple had a totally different but equally clever solution back in the days of the 68K-to-PowerPC migration. The 68K had 16-bit instruction words, usually with some 16-bit arguments. The emulator’s core loop would read the next instruction and branch directly into a big block of 64K x 8 bytes of PPC code. So each 68K instruction got 2 dedicated PPC instructions, typically one to set up a register and one to branch to common code.What that solution and Rosetta 2 have in common is that they’re super pragmatic - fast to start up, with fairly regular and predictable performance across most workloads, even if the theoretical peak speed is much lower than a cutting-edge JIT.Anyone know how they implemented PPC-to-x86 translation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember years ago when Java adjacent research was all the rage, HP had a problem that was “Rosetta lite” if you will. They had a need to run old binaries on new hardware that wasn’t exactly backward compatible. They made a transpiler that worked on binaries. It might have even been a JIT but that part of the memory is fuzzy.What made it interesting here was that as a sanity check they made an A-&gt;A mode where they took in one architecture and spit out machine code for the same architecture. The output was faster than the input. Meaning that even native code has some room for improvement with JIT technology.I have been wishing for years that we were in a better place with regard to compilers and NP complete problems where the compilers had a fast mode for code-build-test cycles and a very slow incremental mode for official builds. I recall someone telling me the only thing they liked about the Rational IDE (C and C++?) was that it cached precompiled headers, one of the Amdahl’s Law areas for compilers. If you changed a header, you paid the recompilation cost and everyone else got a copy. I love whenever the person that cares about something gets to pay the consequence instead of externalizing it on others.And having some CI machines or CPUs that just sit around chewing on Hard Problems all day for that last 10% seems to be to be a really good use case in a world that’s seeing 16 core consumer hardware. Also caching hints from previous runs is a good thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know the names of the key people behind Rosetta 2?In my experience, exceptionally well executed tech like this tends to have 1-2 very talented people leading. I&#39;d like to follow their blog or Twitter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back before the birth of docker when I was consulting, a friends startup wanted a way to install their multi component application (web service, database etc.) inside a corporate environment. They built it on a Debian setup and generally apt-getted (apt-got?) all their requirements, used supervisord to manage the backend process (written in Python) and had it running. To do this on prem, they needed an installer.I cooked up this idea of creating a dummy file (dd), formatting it into a file system, mounting it as a loopback device and deb-bootstrapping it. Then I chrooted inside it, installed all the dependencies needed, added all the code and things we needed for the application, left the chroot and use makeself to create a self extracting zip file of the whole application along with an initial config dialogue. We wrapped up the process using a Python script so that people create such &#34;installers&#34;.Once you ran the file, it would unzip itself into /opt/{something} and start up all the processes. Inside the chroot was Debian with a db and several other things running. Outside the chroot was Redhat or whatever. It ran surprisingly well and was used for a couple of years for all their customers even after Docker came out. I rejoined them as a contractor after they got a decent amount of funding and the same thing was still in use .I wrote about this as an answer to a Stack Overflow question back then https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5661385/packaging-and-sh...It was a proto docker without proper process isolation. Just file system isolation using chroot. Definitely brought back memories. The real value docker added was standardization, a central container registry, tooling etc. It mainstreamed these kinds of arcane old school sysad tricks into a generally usable product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun deep dive. In a previous life I wrote web apps, and I liked to develop on Chromebooks to make sure that everything ran smoothly on low-end machines.I would set a price point of $2-300, which usually meant I was lucky to get a Rockchip. And this was before it was popular to build for ARM architectures.And yet, ChromeOS&#39; chroot-based projects like crosh always managed to deliver. Surrounded by aluminum MacBooks and carbon-fiber Dells, I would run Rails apps and X GUIs and source builds on a rubberized hunk of plastic that had been designed for use in schools.I have always been surprised at how well that worked. If it was using the same fundamentals as Docker and Podman, I&#39;m not surprised that the containerization movement has enjoyed such popularity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, containers are more than chroot, until you:- Want to give them their own IP addresses or networks, or- Put upper bounds on their resources, or- Get tired of dealing with chroot and unshare and seccomp and probably other tools I&#39;m forgetting, or- You want to run an arm64 container on an x86 host with minimal configuration, or...this is a really fun (and important) exercise for anyone working with containers seriously to undergo but let&#39;s not trivialize how insanely easy Docked made creating containers become."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Kagi the last few months. I&#39;ve never had a reason to complain about its search results - they seem to work plenty well enough day to day that I don&#39;t really &#39;notice&#39; them. Like most, I now search reflexively, as an extension of the mind, so I only &#39;notice&#39; search when it&#39;s bad.What really excites me is that is that I&#39;m paying them. That sounds odd, but seriously. It&#39;s incredibly refreshing to know that the company providing my search results has an incentive to make things better for _me_ and not a legion of advertisers. With Google I can&#39;t help thinking about every keypress being logged to optimize sales pitches at me. I just don&#39;t feel that with Kagi, because I&#39;m paying them.Sure, they might be logging every keypress (I don&#39;t actually think they are, but you never can tell) but even if they were, I could be reasonably certain they were doing it to retain my subscription, which probably means making my search better, not selling me other stuff.It&#39;s a priveleged position to be in, and the economic argument isn&#39;t watertight, but in the &#34;search as a brain extension&#34; space it still _feels_ premium, because it creates trust. And that frees up brain space for other things - like where the hell was that article I was looking for?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just signed up and tried it a little bit and I like what I see so far. I find myself increasingly frustrated with Google search results for a particular use case: searching for documentation. For example, today&#39;s work had me thinking about Python&#39;s datetime and timedelta and I wanted a reference on what functions are available. With Google I am annoyed with results from geeksforgeeks.org and freecodecamp.com because they are not reference materials and generally only cover some basic use cases. In Google, those two sites are in the top four results. In Kagi, they are not. Instead, there is a longer-form blog post from guru99.com, stack overflow, and the official Python documentation.Now, I will admit that for this particular query Kagi and Google results are pretty close. But my general experience is that when I search in Google I find that I have to look farther down the search results to look past the blogspam to find the authoritative reference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this article misses the biggest issue with search engines today. It&#39;s less about any ranking algorithm (like PageRank), but rather the root cause is with indexing. No matter how much you fine tune your ranking system, if your index is filled with SEO junk and blogspam, you&#39;re fighting a losing battle from the start.For some reason, a lot of these search engines like to brag about the number of documents in their index, which never made sense to me. Maybe it was true in the past, but on the modern web, larger index !== better results. In fact, I&#39;d argue the opposite since you&#39;re much more likely to serve SEO spam.That was my motivation to start hacking around on CrowdView (https://crew-rho.vercel.app), a search engine specifically for forums and discussion content (e.g. forums, discords, twitter, reddit, etc). It has a curated index (today, curated by yours truly) to remove SEO junk and help you figure out &#34;what does a real, genuine human think about this think?&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the thick of it, illiquidity and insolvency blur. But not after the fact.As usual, Levine put it best: “the problem is not a timing mismatch, in which FTX’s customers asked for their cash back but FTX did not have enough ready cash because it had long-term but money-good loans out. The problem is that FTX took its customers’ money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless and there’s a huge hole in the balance sheet” [1].Before one is insolvent, illiquidity and insolvency are circular questions of asset value. After the fact, it shouldn’t take someone more than a few minutes to come to a conclusion. (There is a deeper discussion on the folly of accepting as collateral assets correlated with confidence in oneself. I recommend reading the article.)[1] https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-09/bankma..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s even more funny is that Binance make it look like they are a stable financial institution, and it&#39;s thanks to their high standards that they won&#39;t acquire FTX.
Binance is most probably much more of a fraud than FTX.Binance doesn&#39;t even have physical headquarters in any country in this world - and the reason is that they are being actively investigated or banned almost everywhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why does anyone trust Binance either? They’re notoriously shady about where they operate and what assets they actually hold, to the point that they’re officially not headquartered anywhere.If you have $100k at Binance, is there any reason to believe you could withdraw it tomorrow? Any contract you may have with Binance is made with a local shell company that could just as well be a hot dog stand. Any money you’ve sent them is effectively nowhere.FTX was supposed to be above the board and they collapsed in a day. A few months ago FTX was the white knight buying out distressed crypto companies. Why would Binance do any better?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Glasses are expensive because there is no competition. One company - Luxottica - owns pretty much everything.You go to LensCrafters and prices seem super expensive, so you go to Pearle Vision and that&#39;s expensive too, so you go to Target Optical and prices are still high and then you think maybe glasses are expensive, since you went to multiple stores and they all have similar prices. What you don&#39;t realize is that all those retail brands are owned by the same company - Luxottica [1]. They operate under several names, so there is an appearance of competition but there isn&#39;t.But wait, it isn&#39;t just stores, they also own eyewear brands such as Ray-Ban, Chanel, Coach, Oakley, Prada, Tiffany, and so on. Yes, all of those brands are owned by Luxottica [2].Wait, not done yet. They also own insurance. Luxottica owns the vision insurance company EyeMed. [3]Still not done. Luxottica has merged with Essilor and now own multiple lens brands [4].See 60 Minutes story on Luxottica if you&#39;re not outraged yet [5].Where are the anti-trust enforcers in this country and other countries, and why are they not doing anything?[1] https://www.luxottica.com/en/retail-brands[2] https://www.luxottica.com/en/eyewear-brands[3] https://eyemed.com/en-us/about-us[4] https://www.essilorluxottica.com/brands[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDdq2rIqAlM"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Same reason medical care is so expensive in the US: Insurance and the art of the upsell. The provider gets to charge high prices because the bulk of the cost is covered by insurance and thus &#34;hidden&#34; from consumers. The insurance company gets a non-trivial cut of the pie, which pads the bill further. And in my experience, when you go in with something wrong with you, most doctors will recommend (or perform without asking) tests that aren&#39;t covered by insurance and you don&#39;t find that out until the bill arrives in the mail.I have a pretty standard vision insurance plan and need glasses roughly every two years. (Two pairs: one for indoors, and sunglasses for outdoors and driving.) I go into an optometrist office and get my vision checked. $10 copay or whatever for the exam. Then the pain starts. The frame selection is terrible and it turns out that the only decent-looking frames and lenses cost 3-4x what insurance will cover. And insurance doesn&#39;t cover more-or-less &#34;required&#34; add-ons to lenses like anti-glare coatings. And the person selling you the glasses is _very_ good at convincing you that you need all the extras.I did the math one time and I paid $200 per year for vision insurance to save $190 (including the cost of the exam) on one pair of glasses.The last time I bought glasses, I took my (recent) prescription to an online eyelasses e-tailer website and purchased a pair that included all the fancy extras for $60 out the door. I don&#39;t _love_ them, but I can certainly live with them for the price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Warby Parker recognized this as a business opportunity. I’m surprised others haven’t jumped in as well with reasonably priced eyewear.&#34;This author is uninformed. Others have jumped in. And Warby Parker wasn&#39;t even the first.15 years ago I would buy my single-vision prescription glasses from optical4less.com. The cost was $58 for 2 pairs, including worldwide shipping.Today I buy my glasses from Zenni. Last month, I paid $176.75 total for two pairs of glasses, each with single-vision photochromic lenses (and one pair with additional blue light blocking)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey cool, this is my project. Happy to answer questions.Edit: I am also looking for a new opportunity. If you need a good Staff/Principal Engineer, check out my resume here: https://heckel.io/resume.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I know the developer of Ntfy and have worked with them in the past.I love this tool because it sits in a very convenient place in the alerting and monitoring stack.At work the kind of alerting pipelines and frameworks needed can by necessity end up being nontrivial and somewhat sophisticated. If you run some stuff at home or in the cloud or whatever, I have often wanted some kind of simple alerting but never want to deal with mocking out similar systems that I&#39;ve built at work.Ntfy sits perfectly in this space, and I&#39;ve used to to frame out my own kind of micro-alerting frameworks for a bunch of stuff that I run. It&#39;s incredibly easy to encapsulate in something like a bash TRAP or even || conditionals on random cronjobs, and just makes getting some kind of alerting so trivial. As such, it&#39;s spiraled out into a lot of different stuff that I run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this project. Super simple to interface with, accomplishes the task very well, reliable, good documentation. It&#39;s hard to think of better design and execution for this type of utility.I use it to get notifications of the CI running on build.wireguard.com, which took less than a minute to get working. Sometimes I&#39;ll use it for random one-off notifications, like when a command finishes running or some shell script sleep-loop scraper finds what it was waiting for. It&#39;s the nicest thing I&#39;ve had for that kind of thing since mytelephonenumber@txt.att.net."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the case of helping someone with a technical problem, as author notes. words like &#39;simply&#39;, &#39;merely, &#39;just&#39; are downplaying the person&#39;s efforts and inherently cause unnecessary strife, discouragement, resentment, etc.  Sometimes, letting them work through it for a while longer on their own is the better course.In the situation where help is clearly needed, &#39;let&#39;s consider possible solutions&#39; is a better entry point, along with &#39;let&#39;s ensure we don&#39;t make it worse&#39; - i.e. take a snapshot of the current situation, store the current working file, etc.  Now you&#39;ve gone into a collaborative situation, and if there&#39;s a solution the person will feel like they&#39;ve been a part of it, not like they&#39;re an idiot who should have been able to figure it out on their own.  Makes for a much better working environment, better morale, sense of being on the team, etc.For the person on the other end, the person who needs help, this is where keeping a log of your activities (in the lab world, this means a detailed and updated lab notebook, maybe a logging app of some kind for programming), so if someone asks the (sometimes irritating) question of &#39;what have you tried already&#39; you can just point them to it.For the case of seriously depressed people who can&#39;t get out of bed, that&#39;s a bit tougher.  Cup of psychedelic mushroom tea perhaps, plus someone to hold their hand for a few hours?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not saying it&#39;s not good to learn about how &#34;just&#34; might be perceived or avoided but I am surprised this article is getting so much support. I feel like in the environment I&#39;m in &#34;just&#34; never implied anything negative (e.g. lack of understanding on the receiver&#39;s part, making it seem like they should have considered ... but didn&#39;t, etc.), rather:- I don&#39;t yet understand why steps x, y, z are necessary. To me it would seem simply/naively doing ... might work but I&#39;m probably missing something.- Would an (objectively) simpler (though possibly not perfect) solution (which I&#39;m just putting on the table here) suffice here?- I think we can do ... here and it&#39;ll be fine. Should we / let&#39;s see if that works, and revisit ? / .Sure, &#34;just do it&#34; would often be bad, indicating a variety of things like &#34;stop dwelling on this or arguing, do what I say&#34;. Or &#34;can you just quickly do this (thing I find trivial but don&#39;t understand at all) for me&#34;, but in the end it&#39;s the context that matters.Like, I can turn this around as well. The word &#34;don&#39;t&#34; is negative and should be avoided at all cost. Better: &#34;could we try ... instead of ...&#34; (see submission title).Then conclude &#34;don&#39;t worry about it&#34; should not be said.
Which to be fair is also true in some contexts but again, context!EDIT: To be clear it is valuable for me to learn that usage of &#34;just&#34; could be problematic. That&#39;s important when not knowing the other party but among coworkers I also happen to have more of a relationship with than just one-off comments, these kind of word choices are not what make or break things. Especially in a diverse environment I assume everyone is acting in good faith and I would only let word choices affect me if the sum of my interactions with a coworker has been negative already and I &#34;know&#34; they are trying to incite an argument."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny... my roommates and I used &#34;just&#34; for comedic effect in college.I was stuck writing an algorithm and asked my more-experienced roommate for help. He briefly scanned my code and said, &#34;well, you kind of just... code it.&#34;I looked at him quizzically and just blurted, &#34;straight up?&#34;&#34;Yep, just straight up code it.&#34;Then we all laughed at the absurdity. He wasn&#39;t trying to trivialize the problem, to be clear, but didn&#39;t know exactly how to express what he was thinking. But that became our standard answer to any programming challenge. &#34;Just straight up code it.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Binance was threatening to dump a huge amount of FTT tokens on the market. FTX has a big+vulnerable position in FTT. FTX asked Binance to sell them the tokens for a fixed price, so as not to crash the FTT token price. Binance declined - this was yesterday/today. Of course the price of FTT crashed today. And now Binance buys FTX to help them out... smells like Binance played 4D chess all along.https://decrypt.co/113674/binance-moves-to-liquidate-its-ent...https://decrypt.co/113788/binance-ceo-declines-alamedas-bid-...https://decrypt.co/113866/battle-crypto-titans-ends-binance-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some more background: the companies were engaged in fighting over regulations, and on a personal basis between the 2 CEOs. It went down to really childish levels at some point.But one thing is undeniable: SBF (FTX CEO) was trying to weaponize US regulation against his biggest rival CZ (Binance CEO). CZ retaliated by selling the FTT token, exposed the fact FTX was over-leveraged, and took over.This is, as the kids on Twitter say, the embodiment of the old &#34;F#$k around, find out&#34;.Along the way every FTX client who couldn&#39;t withdraw, and every crypto user losing value got screwed - but why should these 2 characters care? The space just became more centralized, and whatever smidge of trust was left after the Celsius debacle has evaporated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was worried about sharing broadly and leaking info from 1 contact to another, but it seems like the Signal team did all the right things here.When you create a story you can make it a group story or not.If you do not make it a group story, reactions and replies to stories get sent to you over your 1:1 chats and not shared across other recipients of the story.If you make it a group story, and share it with multiple groups each group receives their own copy of the story and replies and reactions can only be viewed by others in the same group.After having been burned SO OFTEN by other social platforms embarrassingly notifying others when I did something I thought was a passive post, or leaking information from 1 of my subgroups with another I was very worried that would happen here, but great job signal team!The only awkward part that I&#39;ve noticed so far is if I have a contact in 2 groups that I create 2 group stories with, they now have 2 identical stories show up on their story board.  It makes sense and I think the UI clearly indicates for which group replies and reactions to each story it would go to which is probably the safest (best?) solution, but I could see that getting a little annoying if I share multiple groups with a frequent story poster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course my first reaction was &#34;I hate this&#34; but then I thought about it and whatever I don&#39;t care at all. I downloaded the update and it&#39;s a new tab. They don&#39;t force it on you at all. They very very clearly state that you can opt-out and how to do it. This was tastefully done, which is fresh air in the world of social media crapware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My gut reaction to this was disappointment that Signal is working on yet another not-messaging feature a la their crypto integration... But the longer I think about it, the more positive I feel. I actually enjoyed using stories on other social media platforms before I left them. The idea of something similar, but end-to-end encrypted, is actually exciting!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I mean this story is cathartic, but I don&#39;t get what the &#34;rabble rousers&#34; expected to happen. You don&#39;t go into a meeting like that to present problems, but to present solutions. And a 12 month delay on a $60 million contract isn&#39;t a solution, it&#39;s another problem for the sales/client success people. And doing it in front of a group of management, no less - that&#39;s like firing a shot across the bow, declaring that the current PM team is incompetent.It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re right, it matters how you communicate and strategize. This seems to be a skill that many people lack. This sounds like a conversation that should be had with a handful of managers who you can convince to your side, and concoct a plan to stage the product development and release such that it gets done and you don&#39;t cost a giant contract (and people&#39;s jobs).People talk shit about office politics, but sometimes you need to read the room..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I spent about 18 months working on a doomed project. For a lot of that time, I thought I was the only one who realized it was doomed.I had a similar feeling about a project once. I thought &#34;Boy is this stupid. No one in their right mind is going to pay for this. Why are we building this.&#34; Let me manager know my feelings. Stayed and built it.Thing is a huge success. One of our best selling products. Boy do I still feel dumb. Very humbling, honestly. Shows what little I actually know about what people want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah, that freeing feeling. I had that once.I was a new security champion for a team. The product had schema owner SQL injection vulnerabilities on every page we developed. I had a meeting with the department head and explained the whole situation and two remediation options. He chose the third option - do nothing. According to him we have a realtime DB backup. Has it ever been tested? No. Do you have procedures for it? No. How long will it take (15 minutes is the end of the world for this system to be down)? No idea.I walked out with a clear answer in my head and that free feeling. I left for another team. Not my problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been chasing infrasonic ranges in home audio for over 2 decades. You can&#39;t &#34;detect&#34; these frequencies in the normal way. You experience them by way of your physical environment being excited by them. Feeling pressure waves move through whatever you are standing/sitting on can add an entire new dimension to the experience.I used to run experiments with friends and family using a 800L ported subwoofer tuned to ~13Hz with a 40Hz cutoff. Not one person would mistake it for being on vs off. Certain content makes these frequencies substantially more obvious. Classical music performed in large concert halls is one surprising candidate outside of Mission Impossible scenes. Being able to &#34;feel&#34; the original auditorium in your listening room is a very cool effect to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They really should have said &#34;inaudible&#34; rather than undetectable.  It is detectable (as they note)... just not as what we think of as sound. [edit - fix; how did I leave out words?]I don&#39;t know how common this is now, but at one time it was popular in the car audio world to mount &#34;ass shaker&#34; devices to seats to emphasize bass feeling without requiring the space of a normal speaker.  I think cinemas have done this too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not a veteran (though I went through 1.5 year of mandatory service back in my country) but I constantly have nightmares for as long as I could remember. There are nights where I don&#39;t want to go to sleep because the night before I had a particularly disturbing nightmare. Remarkably scary dreams.I&#39;m healthy, exercise nearly ever day. I avoid eating several hours before bedtime.I was diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder) but I don&#39;t take any meds. I&#39;m slowly coming to the realization that my baseline anxiety level is way higher than of the average person. For no apparent reason.It&#39;s frustrating but I&#39;m trying my best to figure out a long term solution.edit: grammar"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love a lot of the innovation going on in the healthcare digital space wrt apps, but this NightWare service reminds me of Sleep.io, which has become a nightmare to try to procure.I&#39;ve been trying for months to get on Sleep.io as I suffer from chronic insomnia, and it has been one of the most frustrating journeys I&#39;ve endeavored upon. They only provide their app to insurance customers that partner with them, there is no option to buy a subscription directly. Despite their marketing and outward &#34;shoot us a message and we&#39;ll help you out&#34; virtue-signaling, you quickly realize that you&#39;re just sending messages into the void. I tried so hard and offered to pay a subscription rate to try the service. Didn&#39;t even get a response.It&#39;s the absolute worst of all worlds: being prevented from being able to use an app that I shouldn&#39;t need to talk to a doctor about or have the correct insurance for is unbelievably frustrating. Stuff like this terrifies me for our future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Available by prescription only, it’s also the first and only digital therapeutic developed specifically to treat nightmares that is cleared by the FDAWhy is this prescription only? I am surprised to see that something as unobtrusive and harmless like this should be locked behind a prescription.As they&#39;re making specific health claims, these claims should be investigated and demonstrated with evidence, but I fail to see why something this important and good would be locked behind a doctor&#39;s visit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How I have waited for this: A simple, accessible library for graph-like data with datalog (also in a statically compiled language, yay). Have even pondered using SWI-prolog for this kind of stuff, but it seems so much nicer to be able to use it embedded in more &#34;normal&#34; types of languages.Looking forward to play with this!The main thing I will be wondering now is how it will scale to really large datasets. Any input on that?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a really impressive piece of work! Congratulations!I note that it appears to be a library, but it&#39;s licensed under the Affero GPL. I believe this means that if I link your library into a program, and if I then allow users to interact with that combined program in any way over a network, then I have to make it possible for users to download the source code to my entire program. Is that your goal here? Were you thinking of some kind of commercial licensing model for people writing server-side apps that use your library?(I&#39;m curious because I&#39;ve been deciding whether or not to roll my own toy Datalog for a permissively-licensed open source Rust project.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very cool! I love the sqlite install everywhere model.Could you compare use case with Souffle? https://souffle-lang.github.io/I&#39;d suggest putting the link to the docs more prominently on the github pageIs the &#34;traditional&#34; datalog `path(x,z) :- edge(x,y), path(y,z).` syntax not pleasant to the modern eye? I&#39;ve grown to rather like it. Or is there something that syntax can&#39;t do?I&#39;ve been building a Datalog shim layer in python to bridge across a couple different datalog systems https://github.com/philzook58/snakelog (including a datalog built on top of the python sqlite bindings), so I should look into including yours"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Current USPTO patent examiner here. The most effective way to eliminate bad patents would be to give examiners more time, say double the time across the board to start. If an examiner can&#39;t find prior art in the little time they&#39;re given, and they have no other reasons to reject the application, they&#39;ll have to grant it. The amount of time was (basically) set in the 1970s based on data from the 1960s. There have been some minor increases since then. Several orders of magnitude more prior art exists now. And while search technology has improved, it hasn&#39;t become orders of magnitude better. So I&#39;d argue that the workload has increased dramatically since the 1970s. Simply giving examiners more time would probably greatly reduce the grant rate, and also incidentally reduce examiner stress levels. Patent examination is a tough job, as examiners rarely get enough time to do a quality job, and this leads to the high stress levels.USPTO upper management is taking comments about the &#34;robustness and reliability of patent rights&#34; until February. You can leave your comments here:https://www.regulations.gov/document/PTO-P-2022-0025-0001Unfortunately giving examiners more time is only briefly addressed in this request for comments. I think the public should really drive home the point that the procedural changes discussed wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near as effective as simply giving examiners more time.Don&#39;t believe examiners are overworked? Take a look at this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/patentexaminer/(Note that this comment is only my opinion, not that of the USPTO, US government, etc.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two additional notes:1. Zhang posted an attempt at solving this problem in 2007 that he later more or less admitted was flawed: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/131221/yitang-zhangs-2007.... But speaking with mathematicians who are intimately familiar with Zhang&#39;s previous work, there seems to be good reason to be optimistic nevertheless. First, the idea behind Zhang&#39;s proof is similar to the zero-repulsion ideas appearing in known results about Siegel zeros, and is thus reasonable. Second, Zhang seems to have matured late, and unlike the flawed 2007 paper, his 2013 paper on bounded gaps in primes is meticulously written. He came a long way between those two papers, and he may have come even further since then.2. Zhang is 67 years old. If the paper is correct, then Zhang constitutes a strong counterexample to G.H. Hardy&#39;s famous claims that &#34;mathematics is a young man&#39;s game&#34; and nobody alive today could say, as Hardy did, that &#34;I do not know an instance of a major mathematical advance initiated by a man past fifty.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t resist saying one last thing about Siegel zeros: number theorists REALLY would like for this result to be correct because the possibility of Siegel zeros is unbelievably annoying. I mean mathematicians are supposed to enjoy challenges / difficulties, but Siegel zeros are just so recurrently irritating. The possibility of Siegel zeros means that in so many theorems you want to write down, you have to write caveats like &#34;unless a Siegel zero exists,&#34; or split into two cases based on if Siegel zeros exist or don&#39;t exist, etc.But here is the worst (or &#34;most mysterious,&#34; depending on your mood..) thing about Siegel zeros. Our best result about Siegel zeros (excluding for present discussion Zhang&#39;s work), namely Siegel&#39;s theorem, is ineffective. That is, it says &#34;there exists some constant C &gt; 0 such that...&#34; but it can tell you nothing about that constant beyond that it is positive and finite (we say that the constant is &#34;not effectively computable from the proof&#34;).*So then, if you try to use Siegel&#39;s theorem to prove things about primes, this ineffectivity trickles down (think &#34;fruit of the poisoned tree&#34;). For example, standard texts on analytic number theory include a proof of the following theorem: any sufficiently large odd integer is the sum of three primes. However, the proof in most standard texts fundamentally cannot tell you what the threshold for &#34;sufficiently large&#34; is, because the proof uses Siegel&#39;s theorem! In this particular case, it turns out that one can avoid Siegel&#39;s theorem, and in fact the statement &#34;Any odd integer larger than five is the sum of three primes&#34; is now known https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_weak_conjecture. But it is certainly not always possible to avoid Siegel&#39;s theorem, and Zhang&#39;s result would make so many theorems which right now involve ineffectively computable constants effective.*Why is the constant not effectively computable? Because the proof proceeds basically like this. First: assume the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. Then the result is trivial, Siegel zeros are exceptions to GRH and don&#39;t occur if GRH is true. Next, assume GRH is false. Take a &#34;minimal&#34; counterexample to GRH, and use it to &#34;repel&#34; or &#34;exclude&#34; other possible counterexamples."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not a mathematician, but the story of Yitang Zhang desperately makes me want this paper to be correct.&gt; Prior to getting back to academia, he worked for several years as an accountant and a delivery worker for a New York City restaurant. He also worked in a motel in Kentucky and in a Subway sandwich shop. A profile published in the Quanta Magazine reports that Zhang used to live in his car during the initial job-hunting days.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitang_Zhang"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; And, for the any employees still at Twitter, don’t underestimate the power of a pocket veto.This is something I&#39;ve been repeating to some of my younger colleagues.Engineers aren&#39;t really fungible resources, to the extent that these projects require. Ask any manager how easy it is to swap &#34;allocated resources&#34;, and they&#39;ll probably sigh heavily.People are afraid that if they don&#39;t follow their manager&#39;s every request, they will be fired. But remember that hiring is hard, and managers are loath to fire someone they&#39;ve already spent so much effort finding, hiring, and onboarding. Finding someone else to do it can take weeks, months, or longer! Which in many cases risks killing the project altogether.Even if you&#39;re at the bottom of the chain, as the person who does the actual implementation, you have a lot of power on what gets prioritized.See also the oft-circulated OSS &#34;Simple Sabotage Field Manual&#34; http://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/CAcert_Inc/Board/oss/oss_sabota..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I want is Little Snitch on steroids built into the OS where every process, including all native ones, including UI apps, are blocked from network connectivity by default, and the user gets an easy monitor of outgoing traffic with TLS/SSL inspection built in (you&#39;d need some OS API to enable that).Kind of like granular oauth permissions, apps should have to declare which outgoing they have, a description/why, and allow inspection of the actual traffic.What Adobe CC, Google Chrome, MS Office, and macOS/Windows itself do with this background network connectivity is completely out of control and abusive to the user. They get away with it because the vast majority of users are non-technical and don&#39;t realize it&#39;s happening.I&#39;ve profiled and decrypted the background traffic on a stock Android install and the volume was also appalling. Getting macOS to 0 background traffic involved blackholing large Apple IP blocks at the router, whereas some of their processes use random IPs from these ranges and don&#39;t use DNS.Just as the general public doesn&#39;t have the awareness or ability to fight for their privacy rights I doubt any of this will ever be remedied."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a one paragraph claim that doesn&#39;t provide resources to show that their claim has basis. It could very well be entirely accurate, but there&#39;s no information contained here to know one way or the other.For example there have been numerous claims made previously that link ANY network traffic to a supposed invasion of privacy, but once you delve into the underlying traffic it isn&#39;t nearly as nefarious as it initially seemed.This article is telling you to &#34;open up the network monitor of your choice&#34; but network traffic and CONTENT are apples Vs. oranges, and yet we&#39;re meant to draw conclusions from that? We&#39;re meant to know Microsoft are taking your slide&#39;s content whole-hog? Isn&#39;t that yet to be determined?"</p>

You just pray that you never meet a drunk driver or someone texting in oncoming traffic who suddenly swerves into your lane. You pray that none of your employees click the wrong button and bankrupt the company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started a company to pursue circadian lighting (called Twist) and sadly pivoted away from it as a core value proposition because of weak reception from the market.I feel we were 20 years too early (we shut down about 5 years ago).Our tech enabled smart circadian lighting (we called it adaptive lighting) without configuration, an app, or wifi. The lightbulbs worked without any smart gadgetry necessary.Every time the switch turned on the light made a 20 ms computation based on the time it stored (via a low power clock and a super cap) and turned to the right brightness and color temperature automatically. This was protected by a patent but also could not find a buyer for the tech despite how differentiated it wasNow I have an entire home with hue downlights + bulbs that does circadian lighting (with HASS as well) and while its not nearly as elegant of a solution as Twist (aforementioned startup), it is pretty great and a huge life changer to me and my fiancè.Edit: for context we use Philips Hue downlight retrofits + bulbs in other fixtures, all white ambiance, and Lutron Aurora  dimmers, connected to HASS on a RBPI, running adaptive lighting from HACS"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, Apple HomeKit + Hue has supported this for a few years (fall 2020?), they call it Adaptive Lighting, and for me this has been a killer app.It&#39;s kind of a bummer that Hue doesn&#39;t support it natively, but since I was already in the Homekit ecosystem, it was fine for me.I&#39;ve paired this with powerful Sowilo [1] light strips, which have excellent warm/daylight white range and brightness, and it&#39;s kept S.A.D. in relative check.[1] https://sowilodesign.com I&#39;m sure some people can come up with a cheaper solution via AliExpress than Sowilo&#39;s, but having a turnkey solution that integrated with Hue was essential for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really see an advantage to this over just installing fixed warm color temperature lights in the house. Depends on the building I suppose, but a well designed house should have enough natural light to only use the lights at the time when you would want &#39;warm.&#39; If you live in at high latitude and need a &#39;SAD&#39; light for morning and daytime use, that will always be a different light fixture and system, and therefore doesn&#39;t require this type of setup either.Ultimately, regular indoor lights just aren&#39;t bright enough to engage the biological response of daylight, regardless of color temperature."</p>

Additionally, if manufactured cells last longer in the body, patients who regularly need blood may not need transfusions as often. That would reduce iron overload from frequent blood transfusions, which can lead to serious complications.&#34;They discuss automating the process, but the costs are still likely to be high as you&#39;d need near-clean-room standards of sterility to avoid contamination problems - although that&#39;s also a problem with blood donation.  Notably, some countries (incl USA, China) allow people to sell their blood, which tends to draw in poor and desperate people who may be more at risk of having transmissible diseases:https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/03/plasma-...In the long run however, this might become the normal process.  Bio-synthetic blood cell production has been talked about for over 20 years, it&#39;s cool to see it actually happening.

There are both ethical and personal benefits - ethical, because it&#39;s a visceral experience of doing something good for society that most people can do, and with little effort; personal, because of potential health benefits from donating blood, see e.g. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle... ."</p>

Slow download rates, surprisingly frequent failed downloads from iCloud.com, requesting your data from Apple takes at least a week while they put it together, etc.One of last form of lock-in that I&#39;m struggling with is iCloud Photo Library.  A service that has been a blessing and a curse.  I&#39;ve been saving my photos there for the better part of a decade.I&#39;m working on getting my photos out (first by requesting my data from Apple, then from iCloud Drive on Windows) and I&#39;m appalled - everything gets dumped into one directory.  Inconsistent file naming. Timestamps not always accurate, and &#34;Date Taken&#34; seems to have disappeared from a number of my photos.  Albums are not included (unless you count them being a list dumped into a csv). All of that data is kept inside iCloud.. only for them- not for you.So what comes next is a long journey to re-organize all of my photos by year, month.  I&#39;m not even sure if my Hidden photos got copied over.This is all 100% a dark pattern to keep users locked into Apple.  How many people would get this far?  Not many- my wife would have given up at having to request her data from Apple. Then how many would stop when they find out all of your photos get dumped into a single directory (30k photos!) if you try to leave?All of this is to say, I&#39;m done with Apple. I want control of my data, not this circus show."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I read TFA, I thought to myself, &#34;if it gets bad enough, I&#39;ll just load Linux on my Macs.&#34; And then it occurred to me how I got started using Apple products. So grab a cuppa for story time. It was a time that I worked for Microsoft, and mmm, mmm, wasn&#39;t that uncarbonated company soft drink tasty. But as I dicked with some Plays for Sure(tm) device for the last time, I got fed up and told the spouse, &#34;get in the car, we&#39;re going to BellSquare to buy iPods.&#34; iPods turned into ditching the Windows Phones for iPhones, then a hackintosh to get a feel for OS X Leopard, then &#34;fine, I&#39;ll get a MacBook if I&#39;m going to do iOS development on the side&#34;.Fast-forward fifteen years, and it&#39;s a house full of HomeKit, Apple Watches (loving that new Ultra), MacBooks, HomePods, etc. It all works well together, so it&#39;s easy to justify ditching $DEVICE for an Apple product. And when Apple Premium (one price for all of Apple&#39;s services such as TV+, iCloud storage, et. al.) came around, well, of course I said &#34;put that on the Apple Card, please.&#34;The point I&#39;m driving at is that a household of Apple products started with one simple purchase of a couple of music players. But keep up the advertising crap to the point that I&#39;m loading a non-Apple OS on Apple hardware, and that unravelling thread might take the rest with it. &#34;It all works so well together&#34; is a blessing and a curse. I&#39;m pretty sure that if, whatever the reason, we ditch the iPhones the rest of it goes with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This general trend of deteriorating UX in widespread services is extremely exhausting and depressing.The accuracy you could get with Google searches in 2005-2010-ish was amazing. Knowing how to Google was a secret weapon of computer literacy, you could find anything. Now I save links on a small server (I work on many machines) unless something is posted here on HN, as it&#39;s one of increasingly few places where I can search and actually find things.Same story with YouTube, searching for a video there has become an exercise in self flagellation.I don&#39;t know if it was Netflix that started the ball on nonsensical, avant garde categories followed by thousands of auto-playing calls to action, but combined with intrusive ads and obfuscation the day-to-day experience on mainstream internet really sucks the joy out of whatever amazing content that lurks in the cracks of what is actually a set of amazingly marvelous technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Isn&#39;t the whole point of monospaced fonts columnar alignment (e.g. the table in the article)?  Seems like &#34;almost&#34; defeats the point.Then again, I don&#39;t see values lined up much these days:    {
      &#34;someKey&#34;:       &#34;someValue&#34;,
      &#34;someOtherKey:&#34;  &#34;someOtherValue,

and if you only care about leading whitespace (that is, the whitespace before a character appears on the line), maybe it doesn&#39;t matter how your font is spaced.I suspect numbers in these almost-mono fonts are monospaced, so numerical values should still have nice rhythm too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the US, both college education and healthcare have become enormous taxpayer wealth extraction schemes.  Everyone has a &#34;right&#34; to education and healthcare, therefore we should subsidize it with taxpayer money.  That is as far as the politics go.  We have stupidly funded the demand side of the equation to where both education and healthcare are incredibly bloated behemoths capable of absorbing all the money thrown at them.  All perfectly justified.Where the taxpayer money should have gone: on the supply side.  For example, the number of UC campuses in California should have doubled as the population doubled.   The last UC campus to open was Merced in 2005.  Before that was Irvine and Santa Cruz in 1965.  And we wonder why tuition keeps increasing?  1) Demand increases with population increase.  2) Demand increase with more people seeking 4 yr degrees.  3) Demand increases with the US subsidizing the ever living shit out of college tuition.  4) Supply stays relatively constant.Similarly Obamacare drove the demand side by subsidizing health insurance and onboarding millions of new members.  It did almost nothing on the supply side - same number of hospital beds and doctors.  Insurers and medical groups made a killing as the price of their services grew dramatically.In both cases, political stability was achieved in shoveling taxpayer money at education and healthcare without increasing competition.  This is a very clever way for existing vendors in healthcare and education to soak the government.Solution: drive prices down by investing in supply of education and healthcare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Double edged sword. What the author proposes can be found. Go to some small low endowment private or public school for less money. Oh wait, you say, I don’t want to go there! The buildings aren’t as nice, the dorms are cramped and drab, there aren’t as many resources, the food sucks, the Wi-Fi is spotty, heck even the website sucks. Why is this? Because they don’t have the human or financial resources to do so.You get what you pay for. Student and parent expectations have changed and so have college and universities. If you want what colleges used to be like 50 years ago go to a small private or public school that is just barely staying afloat, it will be more or less similar to the so called halcyon days of low cost, no frills college.The thing is—people don’t want this as voted for by their choice in school. The biggest drops in enrollment are at community colleges, state schools, and small private schools. If people were price sensitive cheap schools would have people busting down the doors to get in. They don’t. In fact, when a college lowers their tuition, they paradoxically often see a dip in enrollments.Why? Because human brains are broken. We connate price with prestige and prestige with quality.Colleges get punished if they lower the price, so what do they do instead? They increase the discount rate. Rarely do families pay the sticker price. Google any college tuition and you will see average price paid. It is typically anywhere from 50-75% of sticker price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks so much for posting this, I love the spirit of it. I&#39;m passionate about my sobriety journey. I just got home from a dinner party of ex coworkers and friends. Being the only one not drinking is hard for me and a huge change. I used to lead the charge with booze, it was the thing that took my crushing anxiety away. It made everything more fun. Well, that can only last so long when you abuse it so much and it fucks up your life.I successfully made it through tonight and will hopefully have many more successful nights. Love and strength to anyone else out there in a similar boat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hello from Astana, Kazakhstan. I just spent wonderful night playing World of Warcraft, coding some lua addon for it and tinkering with VPS. It&#39;s Sunday&#39;s morning and I&#39;m going to prepare more coffee. Now I need to endure till the evening so I can actually attend work at Monday with proper schedule. At work I&#39;m working on creating an ECG device which hopefully will be useful and cheap for local hospitals. And some other projects which are more boring.Have a good day or night or whatever time you&#39;re happening to have around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am currently in this phase where tech stuff does not interest me very much. I still work a tech job and do a fair bit of coding, but mostly put a stop to obsessively reading every tech article on this website, code up something new in my free time, learn a new language etc.Sometime during the pandemic, I stopped caring, perhaps fell into a bit of anhedonia. Thankfully, reading HN kept me informed about boreout (the relatively unknown cousin of burnout). Past few months, I made a big decision to move back to my home country and generally be more social, get more involved in the arts, watch movies, listen to music, read books, just take things easy. I think I am doing fine in my new job. The roaring interest in tech is still not back, but I&#39;m confident it will be back eventually.Until then, I&#39;m happy reading about the good work done by other people. Perhaps one such idea might spark an insight in me and make me go to work. Cheers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The &#34;affinity cursor&#34; is a really lovely innovation. Most HTML/DOM/contenteditable based rich text editors end up adding support for virtual cursors that enable you to have the insertion cursor somewhere that the native browser cursor hasn&#39;t got support for (next to a floating image, end of a table row). Effectively this is what this is doing.Internally the inline formatting will be marked as tags in a rage, exactly like html. Essentially there is a possible cursor position both inside and outside a formatting tag, but both appear as the same visual location on the screen. This is such a lovely way to indicate the difference.So with this code:  Something &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;

There are two cursor positions that are visually the same place:  Something |&lt;b&gt;|bold&lt;/b&gt;
            ^   ^

Most editors &#34;jump&#34; over one of those positions to hide the implementation detail from users. This idea exposes it with a little tail on the cursor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m Bike&#39;s developer. Thanks everyone for the comments.While I have the eyeballs I hope you don&#39;t mind me asking...I&#39;m in process of adding autocomplete to Bike. Problem is that I generally find macOS autocomplete painful and unpredictable. I both disable it and have many typos. I&#39;m not talking so much about the suggestions, but about the surrounding UI.I&#39;m looking for ideas/links for how to make autocomplete better and more predictable. I know Mac apps, I do know much else. What are your favorite autocomplete implementations past or present? If you could have a &#34;fixed&#34; macOS autocompletion what would it look like?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice. I love these little innovations, it’s exactly the type of design ideas that makes me want to try an app.I wonder if it’s an intentional easter egg that the keyboard shortcuts in the popover spell out “bischl”… which is more than a little reminiscent of “bicycle”. (Could improve it by replacing “h” for “highlight” with “y” for “yellow”: “bisycl”.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The claim: reduces CO₂e emissions by up to 80%*The asterisk: water boiling phase excludedWhen I boil pasta, I use full heat to get the water boiling, drop in the pasta, then let it come back up to a boil, then drop the temperature as low as possible to keep a slow boil going--about medium-low.Guesstimating that the boil takes about as long as the time to cook the pasta, I&#39;d say that the pasta cooking portion only takes up about 1/3 of the energy of the total (cold pot to cooked pasta).The 80% savings only covers the pasta cooking phase, so overall, it&#39;s only saving 4/15 or 27% (roughly). If you use a lot more water, then that initial boil time further reduces your savings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"According to Kenji, you don&#39;t even need boiling water to cook pasta:https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-cook-pasta-salt-water-boi...https://www.seriouseats.com/tips-for-better-easier-pasta&#34;Want to get even more crazy efficient? Try soaking pasta in water as your prep your other ingredients. By the time your sauce is ready, you can just add the pasta (along with some of its soaking liquid) to the pan and, with a minute or so of cooking, your meal will be ready to go. One less pot to clean and a pretty satisfying magic trick to boot. Still skeptical? Here&#39;s the science to back it all up. The one exception here is fresh pasta—because it contains eggs, it needs to cook in boiling water to set properly.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Backpackers have been using this technique to save fuel - I&#39;ve got a cozy for my cookpot.I also remember seeing this on one of the Victorian Farm shows - it was something like a pot roast brought to a boil in the morning, then put in a well insulated container to sit for the day.Edit: Whoa, I just clicked through to &#34;The Product&#34; section, and it&#39;s an open source design using an Arduino.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Long-time Vim/NeoVim user here...about 20 or so years with it being my daily driver for the last 8. As soon as I found Helix, I was unsure whether it would become my new editor, but I&#39;ve been using it every day for a few months and haven&#39;t really looked back. The only thing I still use Vim for is `vimdiff` with Git, but I don&#39;t think I need to, just been lazy about configuring Helix to do the same thing.Helix does everything I need, nothing I don&#39;t, and I don&#39;t have to learn a bunch of esoteric syntax. It&#39;s a great editor for people new to the world of shell editing, and I highly suggest trying it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I really liked about it was the UI experience where as soon as you typed the first character of some sequence it started showing you all the other option starting with the same character. (Try pressing space or Ctr-w in Normal mode)
It made the whole thing far more explorable and I really thought it was a good experience although clearly not yet on par with something as fully mature as vim (but also with far less technical baggage).The first thing I did on my vim setup was installing an extension which gave me very similar command completions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a huge fan of Helix, use it everyday. LSP works out of the box(if you install it with a package manager, otherwise you need to do a bit of config) .My configuration file has 5 lines or so, great defaults. No need for overly complicated configuration, or installing dozens of plugins, etc.. Did I mentioned is crazy fast? Opens in ms, and everything feels very snappy. The only thing I noticed, when I use it with tmux, the colorscheme get reverted, dunno if that is a tmux issue or not. But in general, great editor, thanks to the authors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems to me yet another confirmation that there is no man (or woman) for all seasons and all situations.Musk looks like the disorganized mess he&#39;s making at Twitter, the kind of &#34;visionary&#34; we&#39;ve all had to work with and who has sucked the will to live out of us: unreasonable expectations, constant changes of trajectory, the feeling that one well-spent night or one too many drinks for them would make our lives heaven or hell.Zuck is spending billions on a bet that, frankly, seems like nothing more than a nerd&#39;s dream. I am cautious in my observation, and I think it is a caution shared by many, for who could have predicted the adoption of the automobile, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, social media?
And so much leeway is given to this case as well, forgetting that other supposed &#34;manifest destinies&#34; of technology, such as flying cars and robotic sex dolls, have gone by the wayside partly because of technical limitations and partly because, in the end, no one cares about them, either for now or forever.But we have seen the same ups and downs in many historical figures, the Churchills, the Napoleons, the Einsteins, who, after proving themselves to be brilliant as well as favored by the stars, failed to repeat later what gave them notoriety, success and admiration. Perhaps they ran out of luck, perhaps no one had the courage to tell them that it was time for retirement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It added more than 27,000 employees in 2020 and 2021, and added an additional 15,344 in the first nine months of this year—about a fourth of that in the most recent quarter.So it basically doubled employee count in the last three years. Insanity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still, after all these years, hold the belief that facebook failed to innovate because the engineering interview is based on memorization. Having worked with those types of engineers, they can absolutely build exactly what is needed. But abstract and engaging product vision does not come easily with them. Outsourcing that capability to an attractive and charismatic product manager can never close that gap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having worked with a lot of instrumentation and control stuff, I really, really like RS-232. It just works. I made the mistake on one project to go all USB, and it was a complete nightmare. Basically, anything you can think of went wrong, from USB controllers maxing out on number of devices (despite the number of devices being a mere fraction of the allowed devices in the USB spec), devices causing other devices not to work if on the same hub, devices disconnecting, etc. I couldn&#39;t even get manufacturers to tell me how many USB devices their USB controller supported. I often had to use tools like USB Device Tree Viewer (https://www.uwe-sieber.de/usbtreeview_e.html) to understand what was going on. There was another USB debug tool that I used that I&#39;ve forgotten the name of (maybe USBDeview). And if USB devices disconnect, the only way to guarantee getting back to them is to restart the OS process, which makes your software very fragile. Same thing with cameras with USB vs something like Camera Link. A camera&#39;s USB driver crashing would make you restart your entire program, making it very hard to build systems. Camera Link, another serial protocol, also just works.RS-232 and RS-485 are just so reliable. The higher voltage of +/-12V makes it more resilient to noise, and the protocols are just simple. It isn&#39;t the fastest around, but it can still be pretty fast depending on how the protocols are implemented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my proudest hacker moments was also one of 
my first: debugging a noisy console session whose transport was RS232.Long story short (it was 30 years ago so I also can’t remember the precise diagnosis) there was corruption on the line in that sometimes when you typed a space it would come out as something random.  Few other characters were corrupted as often, if at all.  It was almost always spaces that were showing up as random other characters.My observation was that space was encoded as 00000 — all low, the printed character  most susceptible to line noise — and that something wasn’t grounded.  Smarter people took my observation, figured out what was wrong, and soon all was fixed.  It felt like, for the first time, I understood the system with a depth I’d not had before.  It was cool.Oh, and playing DOOM for the first time over RS232, too.  Another precious memory indeed!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yesterday I was configuring a usb to serial converter to communicate with a CNC controller (over RS232). However I was unable to transmit any data and so I brought the oscilloscope to see what was happening. I disconnected my converter and connected the oscilloscope and all the data was there and my oscilloscope had no problems decoding it with the same parameters i had used with my usb converter. Confused, I disconnected my scope and connected my converter back up again, but sill nothing. After a few times back an fourth I ended up connecting my scope up while the converter was still connected and crucially I also had a cat /dev/ttyUSB0 running and as expected the data was right there at the scope, but to my big surprise it was also there in my terminal! I then tried to disconnect my scope resulting in no more data being sent to my laptop.The only explanation I could think of was a faulty ground connection. The scope was grounded through the wall socket same as the CNC and thus had the same ground potential. My laptop on the other hand was running on battery and only shared ground with the CNC through RS232 pin 5 (signal ground). However it seems this pin was not correctly connected on the CNC side and thus I was unable to transmit any data. Experimenting a bit I tried to connect ground to the connector shield instead and everything worked perfectly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know lines of code as a measure of productivity has been criticized to death here and elsewhere but today I went and did some analysis on past two years of my team members contributions and saw the team members that I know they are productive are modifying code a ton more than others. It can be subtraction of code too but overall more changes correlated with my perception of their contributions. My perception is pretty informed because I&#39;m their manager and I know this team and this code base very well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That was almost exactly what happened to me a couple of years ago. The company hired a terrible guy with an architect title. What he did was some really simple 3rd party integration sending some transaction details to an accounting provider. Instead of reading from db, he decided to intercept those before saving to db coz some of those were not saved at all (only a problem for accounting, but most of the customers did not use accounting providers anyway). So, he spent over a year on that and moved on to another project. I took the project over and lots of complaints from beta testing customers. My manager and I spoke to him about it and never get anywhere. &#34;Look, I can spend another year on this, and it might never really work. How about let me scrap his sh*t and start over?&#34; I proposed. Months later, green light I got. So I deleted all his code solely for that part, around 5k lines and replaced with merely ~300 lines, never had an issue since then. Soon we hired a new Product Lead, the first thing he did was asking how many lines code we wrote in the past year. Errr, okay, so I pulled out stats from source control. Ouch, it was minus ~3k lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Allow me to play devil&#39;s advocate for a moment:Most good writers will tell you that shorter is almost always better. You want to express your thoughts in the most succinct way possible. Review your own writing to remove as much as you can, then hand your draft off to an editor who&#39;ll try to cut even more.And yet, many writers are still paid by the word, and many book contracts still specify target page counts. Because even though shorter is better, the shortest possible length of a given text still serves as a rough measure of that text&#39;s breath and complexity.Is code any different?Yes, paying or evaluating programmers by lines of code is going to lead to misaligned incentives. However, I&#39;m not convinced the dynamic is any worse than for prose. Bill Atkinson spent a week removing extraneous code from QuickDraw; an author might spend a week cutting extraneous subplots from a novel. Word count is still a useful metric for the author.Perhaps the difference is that non-writers tend to be more familiar with the writing process than non-programmers are with coding. If an author was working on revising a novel, no one would ask them how many words they&#39;d written that week.Or maybe word count measurements are in fact making everyone&#39;s prose worse and we should do away with them too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microsoft&#39;s major arguments:- as long as the reuse of code is transformative enough, they consider it fair use- yet Microsoft&#39;s Copilot is not trained on Microsoft codebases, and not on Windows source code- yet Microsoft files DMCA takedown requests on Windows source code leaksAs long as these are the case, Microsoft&#39;s argument of &#34;Everything is considered fair use, except our stuff&#34; is flawed in a lawsuit. That is not how copyright works.That is why Copilot has to be considered an attack on a specific group of software, and a specific group of people. And that is my own opinion.Either get rid of copyright alltogether (including Microsoft&#39;s arsenal of patents for it) or not. But don&#39;t try to play the hero of open source while you are stealing their stuff, specifically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even if this succeeds (I sincerely hope that it does not, as I believe these to be sufficiently transformative as to be considered fair use), it doesn&#39;t functionally matter in the long term:1. The ability to be able to both run and train these models is going to eventually be plausible on a home machine with even modest hardware.2. These models, e.g. such as one scraped from all of the code on GitHub, will be publicly available via torrent or whatever.3. People will be able to run it locally as an integrated plug-in in their IDE of choice, jetbrains, vs code, etc.4. You&#39;ll never know if somebody has lifted a bit of code in violation of a license anymore than you would be able to tell if somebody copy-pasted from stack overflow without attribution in any commercial application"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The desired class-action status of this suit feels like a stretch to me. Typically, in a class action, the defendant&#39;s alleged behavior unquestionably harms the members of the class, which is why it&#39;s okay to make them party to the suit without their consent.In this case, I suspect that only a minority of the members of the purported class actually believe they were harmed by the defendant&#39;s actions, and some class members are _paying customers_ of the defendant&#39;s product based on the conduct at issue. (Which surely creates some kind of estoppel issue, aside from the dubiousness of the class certification in the first place.)Could some enterprising attorney get a bunch of members of the purported class to sign on to a brief opposing class certification? (I don&#39;t know if that would be an amicus or what, but surely those people have some kind of standing here.)(Enterprising attorneys: my email address is in my profile.)I guess the problem here is with &#34;enterprising&#34; -- there&#39;s no money there, except to Microsoft, who I imagine might be barred by legal ethics from funding something like this..."</p>
