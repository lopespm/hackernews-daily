								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The real problem here is that there is no consequence for incorrect takedowns.  If content is taken down and then it turns out to be fair use, no one suffers a penalty.The DMCA and similar laws provide protection to the platform if they act quickly on takedown notices, but the law needs to be updated to provide penalties for the reporter for inappropriate takedowns.This would allow Google/Facebook/et al to change their tools from automatic takedown to reporting the violation to the copyright holder, and then it is up to the copyright holder to file a claim.  If perhaps the copyright holder makes too many erroneous claims, they lose their copyright altogether.Let the platforms be neutral, put the liability on the copyright violators and copyright holders equally, so both have a reason to act fairly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just another of the myriad examples of how the DMCA is abused with no repercussions to the abusers at all.Remember when Youtube removed a video of someone in their garden with the rationale that the sounds of birds chirping infringed on some company&#39;s copyright [1]? And then they upheld the removal even following manual review, so the tired refrain that it was just an automated bot was not even applicable.[1] https://waxy.org/2012/03/youtube_bypasses_the_dmca/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good that OSM is accurate in cities as well, because in hiking, skiing, or even some ferry routes, OSM simply wins because that&#39;s often the only mapping provider to even have _any_ data. Some of my first hand experiences:- French GR-20 routes. Google maps are laughably empty, while OSM has you covered with almost the same information as the hiking maps you can buy on the trail.- Anapurna - similar to GR-20 situation. This route gets changed often due to landslides, but there is always some person doing a great job updating information not too late after.- Volcanoes - OSM maps often contain camping grounds, water sources, etc. This is something I actively contribute too. The level of detail is amazing. Some guides in fact lose potential clients because of this.OSM is a wonderful feat by all its contributors, and isn&#39;t appreciated as much as it deserves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know which mapping options Lyft/Uber/etc use, but in my neighborhood, Google Maps has given street names to the allies behind people&#39;s houses. You can tell the drivers that have a clue, and will realize they should not turn down an alley. Drivers that are less cognizant of how the world works, follow the instructions dutifully, and waste time trying to figure out why everyone is confused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been looking to replace Google Maps with OSM on my smartphone.  OSM itself is great, but I&#39;ve been having a harder time finding a good app to use it with.  Is anyone familiar with a good option?  I mostly use a maps app for location searches and real-time GPS navigation, but offline maps and location sharing are nice-to-have features.I&#39;ve been using OsmAnd and it&#39;s okay.  The interface is pretty good.  It supports offline maps, but not location sharing.  Map tiles are kind of slow to load compared to Google Maps, which is odd since the tiles have to be downloaded to local storage.  The location search often includes redundant results and whatever database they use to store place data is sparse on details like pictures, hours, or reviews.  I&#39;ll keep using it to stay de-platformed from Google as much as possible, but I&#39;d be willing to pay a bit for something more responsive and polished."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not proving solutions to textbooks seems to be a common theme in mathematics and theoretical computer science. It makes it difficult for those outside of the traditional classroom to learn the material. Instead textbook writers seem to have this adversarial approach against readers, thinking they’ll “cheat themselves” if they look up solutions or attempt to verify their work. Experts make mistakes, beginners would presumably make even more mistakes. Without a feedback mechanism beginners can’t truly know whether their logic is impeccable or if they have a subtle error that they themselves cannot detect. They could easily fool themselves that they have correct understanding.Due to that I will not recommend this current book to any colleagues.If you want an example of a fellow hacker news member that did things right, check out 
http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/He provides solutions and lecture videos... this is truly a democratization approach to learning and a model that other academics should follow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/hwex.html#...&gt;Please do not ask me for solutions. With very rare exceptions, I will say no, even if you are an instructor. I recognize that my stance limits the utility of these materials, especially for self-learners, but I&#39;m trying to optimize the learning experience of my own students at Illinois. The point of homework is not to solve that particular homework problem, but to practice solving a type of problem and get honest feedback on your progress. I&#39;ve found that when solutions are available, my own students are much more likely to rely on them, rather than trying to figure out the problems themselves, which means they get both less practice and less honest feedback, which means they do worse on exams and in the course overall.Interesting. I was asked multiple times for solutions to my self-pub ebooks that I relented. I didn&#39;t add them initially as I wanted readers to solve by themselves or ask for help if needed (and I did get a few mails, saw one of them asked on stackoverflow as well).See also https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms for more learning resources, practice problems, visualizations, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good ‘ole CS 373, had Erickson back in 2002 and it’s def. a defining course in CS at UIUC.The answers to a lot of these are now google-able; you’ll learn more by researching than being spoon fed the solution!Imagine those of us students back then when google wasn’t a verb yet trying to solve these problems!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Core dev Larry Hastings [0] puts it well. The cost-benefit case for this complicated language feature is limited.&#34;I dislike the syntax and semantics expressed in PEP 634. I see the match statement as a DSL contrived to look like Python, and to be used inside of Python, but with very different semantics. When you enter a PEP 634 match statement, the rules of the language change completely, and code that looks like existing Python code does something surprisingly very different. It also adds unprecedented new rules to Python, e.g. you can replace one expression with another in the exact same spot in your code, and if one has dots and the other doesn’t, the semantics of what the statement expresses changes completely. And it changes to yet a third set of semantics if you replace the expression with a single _.I think the bar for adding new syntax to Python at this point in its life should be set very high. The language is already conceptually pretty large, and every new feature means new concepts one must learn if one is to read an arbitrary blob of someone else’s Python code. The bigger the new syntax, the higher the bar should become, and so the bigger payoff the new syntax has to provide. To me, pattern matching doesn’t seem like it’s anywhere near big enough a win to be worth its enormous new conceptual load.&#34;This while we have elephants in the room such as packaging. Researching best practices to move away from setup.py right now takes you down a rabbit hole of (excellent) blog posts, and yet you still need a setup.py shim to use editable installs, because the new model simply doesn&#39;t yet support this fundamental feature.I can&#39;t afford to spend days immersing myself in packaging to the point of writing a PEP, but would help pay someone to do it well. I can see no way to fund packaging efforts directly on the PSF donations page (edit: see comment). It&#39;s great to see Pip improving but there is still not even a coherent guide that I can find for packaging using up-to-date best practices. This appears to be because the best practices are currently slightly broken.[0] https://discuss.python.org/t/gauging-sentiment-on-pattern-ma..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO the match statement has some very unintuitive behaviour:    match status:
        case 404:
            return &#34;Not found&#34;

    not_found = 404
    match status:
        case not_found:
            return &#34;Not found&#34;

The first checks for equality (`status == 404`) and the second performs an assignment (`not_found = status`)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;the Times’ tech team quickly donned their hall-monitor goggles and Stasi notebooks to warn that the Bad People had migrated to Signal and Telegram. This week they asked: “Are Private Messaging Apps the Next Misinformation Hot Spot?” One reporter “confess[ed] that I am worried about Telegram. Other than private messaging, people love to use Telegram for group chats — up to 200,000 people can meet inside a Telegram chat room. That seems problematic.”I&#39;m already hearing this in local debates. It seems to seriously scare some folks that there are places where they cannot deplatform whoever they want for anything.(PS: Open groups and channels are not encrypted on Telegram servers and can be reported. It is just that Telegram doesn&#39;t have a history of letting other abuse it.)Edit: I&#39;ve been planning to subscribe for a while. I do now.Do it if $5 is pocket money for you. If not for this then for something else he have done.Good journalism is extremely important but much of what we see today is a mix of extreme bias, outright lies and outrage manufacturing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some thoughts on the bigger picture-1: Really?  Do you have to write &#34;r-word&#34; instead of &#34;retard&#34; when you&#39;re writing about someone saying something?  What if Marc literally said &#34;r-word&#34; and I&#39;m vastly underestimating how woke this reporter is?  Wait, I have a solution. Use the actual word that a person said when quoting them.  Just write the exact sentence where you think Marc said the word retard.  Nobody should prosecute you for quoting someone without endorsing their opinion.  Obfuscating your reporting to avoid a word is bad writing style.1.5: Otherwise, the above seems to limit us to 26 taboo slurs in the English language.  A-word, b-word, c-word, ... There are other rude words, but there can only be a single r-word so bad that I mustn&#39;t spell it.  To prevent confusion, I have to completely spell/say the rest of the r-words.  What I&#39;m getting at is whole thing of not saying a word is silly.  Everyone knows that the c-word means cunt (at least in the USA).  If this wasn&#39;t common knowledge then you couldn&#39;t say c-word and have everyone know what you meant.  (Who decided that cunt was a worse word than chink anyway?  That&#39;s marginalizing Chinese people and totally not-woke. /s)2.  There are people that exaggerate and sensationalize something to get more views.  Some people are even fine trying to ruin someone&#39;s reputation.  But we are getting wise to these sorts of things.  If it&#39;s an isolated event these things kind of go away.  Even if Marc is on record once saying &#34;retard&#34; he&#39;s probably not a bad guy. Just from growing up in the 90&#39;s I&#39;ve easily said it a thousand times.  If I start to hear several other instances accusing Marc of using a slur and saying it in a hurtful manner then I&#39;ll revisit the issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s right. When I started writing in the 90&#39;s, there was an idea of journalism as telling stories in the principled defence of minority interests and as a public check on institutional power, but it has mutated into the unhinged and corrupt prosecution of deviance from official narrative lines. Social media is just a way for neighbours to denounce one another in a new snitch culture that rivals any 20th century system. I&#39;m usually a couple of years ahead of the curve on trends, and I even dropped Slack last year because it&#39;s not a place for real discourse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The complicated web was here. [...]&gt; I&#39;ve given in my resignation at my current place of employment and will be seeking an exclusively back-end role for my next adventureOh boy. I sympathise entirely with this post, but the story&#39;s exactly the same on the backend.Kubernetes. Docker. AWS and its gazillion impenetrable product names. The days of security updates, pentests, honeypots and captchas you have to go through in order to put up a webapp that won&#39;t be commandeered by (insert bad guy here) within hours. The endless cycle of breakage on your server because LetsEncrypt or whoever have upgraded their crypto libraries to fight against (insert bad guy here).The need for a lawyer to write you a privacy policy before you can let people log into your site. The endless bullshit of dealing with &#34;Log in with Facebook/Google/Apple&#34; because that&#39;s what people expect these days. And even then it&#39;s better than dealing with email verification because Gmail/Hotmail will kill your emails anyway.The complicated web is everywhere. Retreating to the backend is no escape. Sorry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s disheartening to explain this over and over again, but these frameworks are a-ok because user&#39;s expectations for the web have grown astronomically. The complicated web is here because users insist on interaction, and if any web page has more than around 10 interactions on it, the resultant complexity is best handled by a framework. I recently got to do a jQuery job for a client-- it wasn&#39;t a pleasant blast from the past but a kludgey swamp to slog through.The build pipeline complaint also strikes me as hollow. Create React App outputs folder you can drag and drop onto a  server and serve, same for Angular and I would assume Vue. Yes, it is a lot of JS from a ton of NPM libraries, but that&#39;s the trade-off when you get an entire ecosystem of code for free. If your application is security critical then consider either writing your own libraries or hosting security vetted copies of the libraries.The real reason to leave this industry is that it&#39;s all the same work at the end of the day. Despite what application you build, whether it&#39;s a social network, a security application or collaborative tool like Figma or Trello, it all runs together as a mish-mash of views, data and DOM elements. Unless you&#39;re really invested in the product, it becomes hard to maintain enthusiasm. You can only roll a CSS library, or auth scheme or API library so many times before you&#39;re ready to start some new adventures in coding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a bit of hyperbole in the article, but it strikes a nerve.I originally came from Java and was so fed up with the hulking class lib and the arcane build systems sprinkled with Ant snippets and XML galore, so JS felt like a fresh breeze.AngularJS was a bit convoluted and the syntax was not nice. But OK, data binding was nice. Bit like dependency injection on the Java side made the code much harder to reason about but helped build certain classes of applications.Angular 4 was just WTF. Somewhat cleaner module system but now with a clunky OOP language instead of the elegant functional expressions that JS had and Java finally adopted. For which reason exactly?And I tried Vue which is a much lighter framework but like Angular, the build system is just retarded. Instead of many dozens of JARs with dozens of sub-dependencies, modern JS goes for the kill and literally imports several hundred of npm package with thousands of dependencies.And in the end, I end up having to use &#34;browserify&#34; to have JS running in a browser. It&#39;s a clowns world in IT, but modern JS really takes the cake. I&#39;m back in backend, solving real problems instead of wrangling my build chain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting business model----------Experts Host Sites Here for $1/monthDo you like paying extra so other people can ask amateur questions? That&#39;s how it is at other hosting companies where beginners and experts pay the same price. Beginners drive up the cost by asking a lot of novice support questions while the experts don&#39;t contact support. That is great for amateurs, and unfair to the experts like you.No Support Linux Hosting has a completely different business model. We ignore the support questions, and pass the savings on to you! If you are an expert who does not want to pay extra for help with amateur support issues, then you can host with us and save big money.Experts like you can sign up now for free. We charge $1/month per website, and there is no limit to the number of websites you can host in your account. This is the best deal in the web hosting industry, as long as you are the type of person who can find his or her own answers.-----------From https://web.archive.org/web/20201109042643/https://www.nosup...I guess they took savings from security too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like it was old school shared web hosting with things like WHMCS, Cpanel, Softaculous, Wordpress one-click installers, in-house written web admin, etc.  Where each user was running in the same instance of Linux.  Not, for example, a VM per user.  That kind of setup has a really wide attack surface.  Not surprising it was hacked.  That kind of setup with deliberately narrow support was bound to get hit.Edit: Apparently their &#34;sister company&#34; sells virtual private servers, and appears to still be alive. http://nosupportvpshosting.com/index.php"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked on the support side of the hosting industry for a Long Time. A few observations. 
1) Hosting is hard. It doesn&#39;t seem like it should be, but it is. cPanel simplifies and complicates it because you&#39;re locked into doing things The cPanel Way whether you like it or not.2) Hosting is getting more expensive because cPanel keeps jacking up prices, and I strongly suspect that this host threw in the towel due to the severity of the compromise but also the razor thin margins. Digging out from under it was likely more trouble than it was worth, especially if they didn&#39;t have insurance for this kind of thing.3) KEEP YOUR OWN BACKUPS. For the love of all data that is important, keep your own backups. Did I mention that anyone with a website on any provider on any continent should keep their own backups? By all means, keep your own backups. Because if you don&#39;t keep your own backups, you&#39;ll wish you&#39;d kept your own backups."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like Google is a case study in an engineering only company. Everything is reduced to a technical problem. Incentives are aligned to solve technical problems. No one wants to work on something unless it is technically interesting and new. There is no incentive at all for delivering an excellent user experience over the long term - which usually can&#39;t be done with tech only, and involves a lot of dredge work of continuous introspection and improvement.We see this again and again. The cynic in me sees Stadia as yet another internal promotion scheme, masquerading as a product.I doubt this will ever change. The internal momentum of the company culture will make it so. What does it mean for investors? Google has enough money they can just buy their way into markets indefinitely. It will probably keep them going, but I don&#39;t expect huge growth. I&#39;d probably be putting my money into other stocks if I had to choose. I honestly don&#39;t think people would miss Google much if it was gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s painfully clear at this point that we need a consumer &#34;bill of rights&#34; to protect us from these giant tech companies. At the very least, companies must be legally required to present you in writing with the so-called violation of terms they&#39;re accusing you of,  evidence of the violation, and a phone # or other immediate contact so that you can dispute the accusations. It&#39;s insane that these basic legal rights don&#39;t even exist.You could of course sue Google, but that&#39;s an extremely expensive and time-consuming option, rarely worth it for a mere consumer. Going to court certainly won&#39;t make your suspended account become unsuspended any quicker."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is possibly tied to the recent assault on the ZXing Barcode scanner app[1].This is a legit open source app that&#39;s been recently flooded by 1-star reviews claiming that the app contains malware, probably in order to get users to switch to the other apps.
The funny thing is this app has not been updated since 2019 on the Play Store, so those reviews are clearly bogus.It takes a special kind of scum to slander an open source project in order to push malware.[1]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even legitimate app developers have no incentive to keep their apps sterile. Someone just has to approach you with your 10+ million users barcode scanner app and offer you +50,000$ in order to install some automated ad clicker for them.Don’t be naive, the majority will accept the money and gladly.I believe that particularly makeshift applications such as e.g. barcode scanners are susceptible to this kind of overtake. Apps that offer what should have been offered by the OS vendor in the first place. Why should the app developer refuse the money if what their app offers will be incorporated in a next OS update by anyways? Why defend your mini-adapter-app in an ocean of mini-adapter-apps, with yours becoming so large just because of a random seed and path dependency?This can have a big impact for end users. Imagine an authenticator app ending service to all their users in such a scheme and how you will be cut out from all your accounts by this. How many authenticator apps do you have to use in parallel to mitigate this risk of a single point of failure?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only reason this was detected was very overt behavior - opening AD popups. So I guesstimate for each one of these we have 10 that go undetected. 
This means the whole ecosystem is broken, as there is no reason this will happen only for updates and not for new apps as well. Apple&#39;s ecosystem is somewhat better, but I can&#39;t imagine they go through every line of code in each package, so most of their review is probably done with some combination of automatic static and dynamic analysis, and these can be fooled. The problem with both platforms is that they don&#39;t provide run of the mill users the option of installing an effective firewall and security solutions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The decision making power within the Rust project is uniquely delegated and distributed; with the core team holding little more privilege than other more specialized teams. [...] And the potential of such a system has bore fruit: It is not a mistake that such a promising technology has emerged from such a progressive conception of collaboration.These are values and thoughts describing an approach that the KDE community (and its foundation; hello from another board!) holds equally dearly and has inscribed in its Manifesto (https://manifesto.kde.org/, cf. Common Ownership).While maybe not unique, I&#39;m excited to see another organization adopt this idea set (a support body not interfering with technical agenda, low barriers to participation, not entrenching maintainers, working succession mechanisms, etc.) as a core message. We&#39;ve seen it work very well to sustain a productive community for 25 years and I think this bodes well for Rust!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really happy to see this happen. I&#39;m also really thrilled to see Lars Bergstrom on the board, and am excited about taking Rust farther both at Google and across the industry. Rust is evolving from being centered at Mozilla to being a true community and collaboration between many different groups, including big companies, so I think a well-supported foundation is key.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bitcoin is a mystery to me. Somehow it&#39;s hailed as revolutionising the economy, by replacing currency with a worse kind of currency.It feels like this is where all the &#34;how to get rich quick&#34; book writers and other hustle bros went and created one giant financial pyramid, which works in quite simple way:
- buy bitcoin
- tell everyone around how revolutionary it is, so they buy it and what you holding increases in value, then tell them to do the same.Keep repeating the above two steps through different layers of abstraction, so it&#39;s not so obvious anymore.The other thing that comes into play and makes it grow even bigger is when people see others who made money on this bunch of bollocks, and think that the fact they are rich somehow makes them smart. Then they buy into all of the cryptocurrency platitudes wholesale without stopping for a moment to critically evaluate it.I think I&#39;m a bit sour, because this whole crypto-crap infested the idea space of decentralisation, which is imho very important step that we should try to take take as a society. Now it&#39;s just forever tainted with bitcoin and all the greed fuelled people there, while the decentralisation should be quite the opposite in nature.You know what would be revolutionary? Getting rid of currency altogether."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh noes, if this starts a trend, becomes widespread, and businesses start hoarding crypto tokens instead of investing in building stuff, it could cause a great depression pretty much the same way gold hoarding caused the economy to collapse in 1929.When people, businesses and banks start hording tokens instead of investing in building and maintaining the production capacity of consumables, the ratio of value of tokens meant to buy consumables vs the actual production of consumables gets out of wack.When the music stops, people realize that others are sitting on tons of seemingly valuable tokens but stuff to buy with them is getting scarce because capacity is not being maintained, they reverse their trade, prices of stuff go up, volatility ensues in an incredibly destructive cycle.Too much savings being tied to tokens instead of assets that create real value is an economy wide coordination failure, a terrible Nash equilibrium. It can be hard to solve because it&#39;s a prisoner&#39;s dilemma where the first people to invest in real production are disadvantaged so everyone hoards tokens instead.This is what central banks are designed to prevent. We don&#39;t want cryptocoins to cause another great depression like gold tied currencies did almost a hundred years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment is unlikely to win me many friends here, but it is worth considering that while Bitcoin is, nominally at least, decentralized and free from government control, internet access is not.A simple glance at the trend of governments to partially or to fully shut down internet services to certain areas in times of unrest or mass protest means, in the case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies requiring collective transaction verification via online communications, that a loss of internet constitutes an inability to conduct financial transactions for those thus affected.While I applaud the efforts of so many to free the world from government control of &#34;money&#34;, the full implementation of this effort should be preceded by freeing internet communications from the control of those same governments, otherwise what appears to be a new financial &#34;power&#34; is actually a new financial &#34;weakness&#34;.Think over this carefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata: Trello and Jira both have free plans that I used that caused me to recommend them for paid usage at multiple companies I’ve worked with. Those free plans resulted in $xx-$xxxx monthly subscriptions.Asana has a paid plan with a 5-user minimum limit. I never bothered to even try it since I wouldn’t have the extended time to play with it. As a result it never even got mentioned to companies I’ve worked with.So, it’s important to have a free plan (or at least very cheap paid plan as the article recommended) for “influencers” to get heavily involved with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really aggressively oversimplifying a complicated problem that exists across a huge number of different types of software. In some cases, sure, a free plan is going to cost more in effort than it pays in users who convert to paid. That said, the objection that free users are going to take up too much time is pretty easily solved... look at Google, which has zero customer support and an enormous number of free users. As long as you set expectations up front, you can offer minimal customer service to free users (which also means you can sell it as part of paid plans).But even beyond that, there are just so many generalizations here that may not apply to you. Deciding whether to have a free plan or not should depend on what the actual percent of your users that convert from free to paid is - you shouldn&#39;t just go with no free plan because someone says, &#34;Many users will never ever pay, regardless of how good your product is and how much of a problem it solves.&#34;There&#39;s some reasonable thoughts in here, but the absolutism of it shows that the author hasn&#39;t really considered the breadth of possible scenarios here - likely they&#39;ve gone through this analysis with a product or two and come to the right conclusion, but that doesn&#39;t mean that conclusion is anywhere close to 100% applicable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is sad but true that users that pay less, or zero, are more demanding on customer support and make unreasonable demands via social. Had a guy this week using our free product that has 90% of the paid products features berating us on Twitter for not being 100% free and demanding we convert and rely on donations to support our 40 person team. Makes me regret having a free offering. In my 20 years doing software startups I’ve seen this over and over. Simply raising your prices, which we’ve raised to over 5x, dramatically reduces load on the  CS team per dollar earned."</p>

https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.clerk...For me it is also a red flag to include third party CDN JS (especially without SRI) on security critical applications (like the login for the dashboard and customer logins do with jsdelivr)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, first, congrats on launching your product. :) Personally, I don&#39;t have a need for it, and if I did, I&#39;d be very reluctant to use a proprietary service, but I&#39;m sure there are companies out there who will be happy to use you. Good luck!------------That said, maybe the HN community can answer something I&#39;ve wondered about... Why isn&#39;t there an Open Source, standardized, self-hosted, version of this kind of service? Or, why hasn&#39;t one, or two, options emerged that everyone uses and I would have heard of by now?User management, authentication, and authorization, are all problems that have been solved in many apps, and there are plenty of best practices. So, just like you shouldn&#39;t roll your own hashing algorithm, I&#39;d think we&#39;d want to do the same with this. It would make sense for one of the open source companies or organizations like Canonical, RedHat, Apache or Mozilla to have at least tried to do this.The closest I can think of to an attempt is Persona...Anyway, just been wondering about this for a while, and thought I&#39;d take the opportunity to ask."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really good stuff. The Next.js integration story is already really quite good[1] and the Clerk team has really good ideas on how to make it even better and more seamless.It&#39;s great to see a service focus on taking away all the pain related to user management, not just login.[1] https://frontend-docs.clerk.dev/react/quick-starts/next.js"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was surprised and happy to see this also being open sourced. As a developer of OpenLieroX (http://www.openlierox.net/), we also took inspiration of Soldat. The main difference is mainly the way you control the game, i.e. with mouse aim cursor in Soldat, and purely with keyboard in Liero. And also the ninja rope.Once we added mouse aim support to OpenLieroX as well, but the Liero community didn&#39;t liked it, and basically it became another game. Network play between both versions would be unfair. It would really need a different name.Teeworlds (https://www.teeworlds.com/) is also a more recent very similar game, also with mouse aim, and ninja rope.Interesting also that Soldat is implemented in Free Pascal / Lazarus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a surprise to see Soldat on hackernews :)I maintained Soldat back from version 1.5+ to 1.7 before someone else took over for a few years.The current version on Steam is Soldat 1.7 while the open source version is an unfinished Soldat 1.8 and needs some love before it can be released (gui is missing, new netcode, switch to lazarus/fpc, macOS and GNU/Linux support, new config file format to name a few.)So don&#39;t expect everything to work out of the box if you compile it.Any help is welcome btw ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks super fun, I&#39;ll give it a try!Something like 10 years ago I had a similar idea - a 2D shooter with the feel and gameplay of a FPS, only that in my case I thought of making it top-down, and the plan was that visibility would be a huge thing - your 2D character would only see things from their point of view that weren&#39;t blocked by the level geometry or other players.I never completed that game, for various reasons. But in the course of making that prototype, I did a lot of research about the networking model. I read every article I could find about client-side prediction, server reconciliation, and entity interpolation. I didn&#39;t want all this effort to go to waste, so I wrote what I had learned in article form, and put it on my website.That&#39;s the never-told-before origin story of my multiplayer networking articles :)https://gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Internet-accessble industrial control systems have been a problem for many years now. It&#39;s a documented issue but it&#39;s difficult to fix for a variety of reasons:1. Difficult to identify the owner: a lot of the devices are on mobile networks that don&#39;t point to an obvious owner.2. Unknown criticality: is it a demo system or something used in production?3. Security budget: lots of smaller utilities don&#39;t have a budget for buying cyber security products.4. Uneducated vendor: sometimes the vendors of the device give very bad advice (https://blog.shodan.io/why-control-systems-are-on-the-intern...)That being said, based on the numbers in Shodan the situation has improved over the past decade. And there&#39;s been a large resurgence of startups in the ICS space (ex https://www.dragos.com, https://www.gravwell.io). Here&#39;s a current view of exposed industrial devices on the Internet:https://beta.shodan.io/search/report?query=tag%3Aics&amp;title=I...I&#39;ve written/ presented on the issue a few times:https://blog.shodan.io/taking-things-offline-is-hard/https://blog.shodan.io/trends-in-internet-exposure/https://exposure.shodan.io/#/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"from https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1358868187656388611:    I can&#39;t immediately verify the veracity of the claims made by the sheriff but,
    the fact that the authorities *set up* a public-facing and/or remotely
    accessible system that allowed someone to change the water chemical levels is by
    far the bigger issue here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has some experience with hydroxide and water-treatment systems (as well as other potentially-dangerous industrial controls): always design your system such that even if your feed pump runs full-bore continuously, the system cannot harm anyone.The dilution of the solution stored in the hydroxide tank generally allows you to make this so.Sleeping well at night is a great side-effect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great write up!One thing to add is that you can even open tunnels during an interactive session without disconnection.To do this, type the escape command sequence ~C (will not show) and it will drop you to the control prompt. You can then add tunnels.     ssh&gt;
     ssh&gt; -L 8000:localhost:9000 
     Forwarding port."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a really fancy new -R feature that I love (added in 2017 I think).ssh &lt;target&gt; -R &lt;just a port number&gt;This opens up a localhost port on the target that acts as a socks server which tunnels all your traffic through the source machine.This is great for machines that you can SSH into, but are otherwise completely isolated from the network, or are monitored heavily. You can jump on, and pull down everything you need from the existing SSH connection, rather than using the machine to make requests out to the internet directly.This is also good if the source machine is a web server or something on a secured network which can SSH out, but not much else, and the destination is your command and control server on the internet. Then it opens up a socks port on the C&amp;C machine that gives full access to the internal network, impersonating the source machine.Every other -R is a point to point TCP connection, but setting up a SOCKS proxy with -R is magic. More analogous to a reverse -D than a reverse -L. Super useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The leaked internal slides from Intuit are really disgusting [0][1].From the article:&gt; Internal presentations lay out company tactics for fighting “encroachment,” Intuit’s catchall term for any government initiative to make filing taxes easier — such as creating a free government filing system or pre-filling people’s returns with payroll or other data the IRS already has. “For a decade proposals have sought to create IRS tax software or a ReturnFree Tax System; All were stopped,” reads a confidential 2007 PowerPoint presentation from an Intuit board of directors meeting. The company’s 2014-15 plan included manufacturing “3rd-party grass roots” support. “Buy ads for op-eds/editorials/stories in African American and Latino media,” one internal PowerPoint slide states.I&#39;m always stunned and disappointed at how easy it is to game the American political system. I say that with great respect for this country and the freedoms it affords me, but those freedoms mean little if skullduggery like this goes on.[0]: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483065-Intuit-board...[1]: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483061-Intuit-Turbo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been under the IRS Free File income threshold (I&#39;ve worked as a high school teacher and am now in grad school), but last year after reading this article was the first time I actually filed for free. That was after 5 years of paying for deluxe TurboTax.I had heard the government required TurboTax to have a free edition. But back in 2019 (and before), if you Googled &#34;TurboTax free&#34; you&#39;d be taken to a decoy free edition; the real one was called their &#34;freedom edition,&#34; and was hidden from Google&#39;s listings. If your tax situation is &#39;too complicated,&#39; the free edition tries to upsell you to the &#34;deluxe edition,&#34; even if the &#34;freedom edition&#34; could have handled the situation just fine.Thankfully now you can find the actual free version on Google, but it&#39;s still very confusing that the &#34;free edition&#34; is less free than the (still somewhat hidden) IRS Free File (&#34;freedom&#34;) version. And the faux Free Edition is still being heavily advertised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intuit is truly a scummy company with the way they behave here and elsewhere.  A simple example of one of these behaviors is that you cannot export data as CSV from Quickbooks Online, instead if only exports as a PDF or as an Excel XLSX file.  But the XLSX is carefully crafted so it reads out zeroes (0s) in all value fields if opened with LibreOffice or any conversion tools to get a CSV.Why do I know this?  I don&#39;t have any Windows computers, I mostly work on a Mac, and Intuit doesn&#39;t make TurboTax Business for Mac, only for Windows.  TaxAct has an online service for filing 1120S/K-1 for LLCs which can import data via CSV that works on any OS, so Intuit responded by no longer offering CSV exports and ensuring they&#39;re broken using F/OSS tools.  Really is making it a challenge to comply with the law this year for my LLC without me having to have Windows + Office 365 licenses."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Teletypes in Switzerland were ITU V.21 with three modifications:- 110 baud instead of 300 baud- not full duplex- carrier toneI experimented with a Java application and FFT to try to write a soft modem, so I still know the exact specification by heart. Bit 1 was 960 Hz, Bit 0 was 1160 Hz, the carrier tone 1060 Hz, and there were 2 stop bits. This means, the teletype could transmit 11 letters a second.The carrier tone is special: if someone stopped typing, the teletype switched to the carrier tone and kept it on for about 3 seconds then stopped.Being not full-duplex Deaf users used a convention so they know when they can type. The called party begins typing and ends with two stars, like this **. Then the caller knows he can type and also indicates the end with two stars. When a party is ready to hang up the phone he writes four stars.This is what my model (Telescrit) looked like: https://db1.rehadat.de/rehadat/bilder/TC058000/tc058773.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working in IT, the vast majority of engineers and IT adjacent people have little care or desire to learn about phone or communications systems. Especially nowadays when Teams and Zoom take care of your VoIP woes on the backend, and AWS or Azure are always doing something way cooler than a PBX can.I was lucky to work alongside an enterprise PBX architect and not only learn about phone systems, but come to appreciate the history of them as well. One of the more interesting things to me has always been the amount of accessibility that gets designed into phone systems. TTY, translation services, different languages, etc. It&#39;s something that always reminds me we&#39;re designing and dealing with a wide variety of humans that I don&#39;t get when designing a network."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This engineer inventor changed my great uncle’s life. My great uncle got scarlet fever at age 8 in the 1930s and had a fever of 108 F and nearly died. Because of nerve damage to his ear from the fever, he became completely Deaf at age 11. He learned how to lip read on his own and graduated high school when usually people like him would typically be excluded. Nothing stopped him. He even fished the fertile Pacific Ocean waters for Alaskan Salmon for a living, which was obviously extremely dangerous for anyone.Some of my best memories of my grandmother and her brother (my great uncle) as a kid were at my grandmother’s house, whenever she had a phone call from her brother. Her talking to her brother via a physical TTY terminal with the phone handset in the terminal receiver was just so fascinating, captivating and interesting to see in the 90s as a kid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This book hadn’t been written yet when I was in undergrad.  But this year, I found it and worked through it.  Even with 20 years writing software professionally under my belt, the ways this book shifted my perceptions on topics I assumed I knew well was surprising!I also find it charming that the book is co-authored by a married couple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend this book. The chapters were &#34;bite sized&#34;. Compared with the dinosaur book, it was easier to finish one chapter after I started on it. The chapters on concurrency made me cry with &#34;so this is how XXX works&#34; a lot. I also found the references near the end of each chapter were full of gems.I self-taught CS, so not surprisingly there were lots of &#34;void&#34; and &#34;dots&#34; in my knowledge space. This book connected lots of dots together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find it hilarious that so much disinformation went into this article itself. The mischaracterizations of Fauci and the reckless, the poor sources that themselves are spin machines, all highlight a lot of the issues: a spectrum of people hell bent on manufacturing distrust in various institutions for their own gains, now co-adopted as an identity by the GOP.We need to find a way to fundamentally change the incentives in media, change the public’s expectation of separating opinion versus news, and remove the cancer(s) of “think tanks” that only serve to undermine and destroy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an (European) outsider: Manufacturing consent is a key feature of societies. If societies are not just an accidental aggregation, but do have some actual cohesion, a core body (canon) of shared believes and opinions is absolutely necessary. If a society fails to manufacture consent as a common point of reference in this core domain, we may even speak of a failed society.A certain amount of mis- and disinformation, manipulation, falsely raised expectations (e.g., if masks do not stop CV19 dead in the track, it&#39;s also not a viable tool of mitigation), etc, is to be expected. A certain amount of dissent is vital to a thriving society, as opposed to a slow descent into dogmatism. A certain amount of dysfunctionality is actually functional to societies. However, if we are losing a common point of reference and the discussion turns from an ever varying problem space towards questioning and problematizing consent per se, society itself is at stake, as partitioning and claims to rightful dominance by one side or the other are inevitable. Dealing with this is not a matter of free speech, even, if suppression of free speech may be empirically observed as an – mostly failed – attempt to address this. It&#39;s actually more connected to the question, what speaking freely actually means: Is it to enter into or to contribute to a discussion, or is it a means of claiming dominance? In other words, does the address include those who do not share the specific set of believes and points of reference of the speaker, or does it exclude and/or ignore them, by this turning into an hermetic or even radical argument, meant only to augment the position of the speaker? Is it still pervasive, or has this turned into a hegemonial discourse? If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s not about manufacturing consent anymore, but about establishing a new, biased one, probably by force."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it is true that we should be having a discussion about what really constitutes disinformation in a way that treats the concept as more than just a political tactic, this article reads as though it is doing almost the same thing. The bit about disinformation functions like a subterfuge to really assert what seem like the author&#39;s political views: covid skepticism, russiagate, ... If there is anything worse than throwing around the term disinformation to summarily dismiss ideas one disagrees with, it is having a discussion about this practice to underhandedly characterize ones own ideas as being &#34;actually&#34; true; as though these ideas are merely examples of real &#34;fact-based&#34; discourse. It is frustrating to see someone broach an important topic, then author between the lines of the discussion more of the very same problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Transparent Wood Composites [1] &#34;are novel wood materials which have up to 90% transparency and higher mechanical properties than wood itself&#34;. This latest paper Solar-assisted fabrication of large-scale, patternable transparent wood [2] describes a technique that brings this material one step closer to production scale:&gt; Here, we report a method to produce optically transparent wood by modifying the wood’s lignin structure using a solar-assisted chemical brushing approach. This method preserves most of the lignin to act as a binder, providing a robust wood scaffold for polymer infiltration while greatly reducing the chemical and energy consumption as well as processing time. The obtained transparent wood (~1 mm in thickness) demonstrates a high transmittance (&gt;90%), high haze (&gt;60%), and excellent light-guiding effect over visible wavelength. Furthermore, we can achieve diverse patterns directly on wood surfaces using this approach, which endows transparent wood with excellent patternability. Combining its efficient, patternable, and scalable production, this transparent wood is a promising candidate for applications in energy-efficient buildings.This same group has previously described A Clear, Strong, and Thermally Insulated Transparent Wood for Energy Efficient Windows [3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_wood_composites[2] https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabd7342[3] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.2019075..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really disappointed with this narrative that natural fibres infused with chemicals are somehow still natural.“Bamboo fibre” bowls made with plastic for a recent trend: Not just not biodegradable as the name suggests, but also not recyclable.Like “vegan leather” (made from processed crude oil), these terms only seem to take us away from the products that we are actually looking for when something says “natural”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s hidden in one of the captions:The volume fraction of wood in the resulting product appears to be around 33%. So by volume it&#39;s two-thirds resin and one-third wood.I was hoping the wood fraction would be slightly higher to justify calling it &#34;transparent wood&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have plenty of criticism of the blockchain hype, but IBM does this for all buzzwords regardless of how useful the underlying technology is. It is all marketing to get executives at large companies to cut large checks. Once those checks are cashed they drop everyone and move on to the next buzzword.The current buzzword is hybrid cloud. Which is awesome for IBM because most large companies already have some on-prem and cloud resources. So IBM inserts a bunch of people into existing processes and resources and claims credit for creating a hybrid cloud for their customers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The point about theory-building requiring (or at least being accelerated by) interpersonal communication / teaching rings very true.In the middle of last year, my team went through a major re-org, and I&#39;m now working with a whole bunch of new teammates. My project didn&#39;t get cancelled in the reorg; in fact, it&#39;s actually come to more prominence due to synergy in the projects we work on. Essentially my new teammates are working on applications which have 2-4 years of catching up to reach the same level of maturity as my existing work.It&#39;s taken me the better part of a year to communicate the whys, whats, and hows of the systems we&#39;ve built. I&#39;ve given multiple talks, explained in 1:1s, written docs, and it&#39;s just taken a really long time to get across these ideas. All-remote work has definitely made a big (negative) impact in the velocity that ideas can be communicated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am sometimes guilty of reading the comments before reading the article. I often find the reactions more concise, insightful, and valuable to me than the source material.That said:If you are reading this comment and haven’t read the article, go read the article instead.This is an inverse scenario: imho most of the comments here are interesting but have only marginal value building from the insight of the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Worthless&#34; is an exaggeration: any significant body of code running a critical business process would be missed---and expensive to recreate---if it were lost. But I think the article does make a good point about the value to others. Unless you have a dev team whose head is in that code, and a business team built around that software workflow, just having the code won&#39;t be of much value to you. The value of software is inextricably linked to the team that has shaped it. So while it isn&#39;t worthless, it is certainly of much lower value without that team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, we actually have one of these at Caddy: https://caddyserver.com/docs/architecture(The filename on disk is literally &#34;architecture.md&#34; -- it is a Markdown file rendered by Caddy&#39;s template handler: https://github.com/caddyserver/website/blob/master/src/docs/...)It could use some improvement, but it&#39;s been really great for helping people learn how Caddy 2 works at a high level. Beyond our docs, I always encourage new contributors to thoroughly explore the godoc and code: it&#39;s very well-commented and organized, especially once you know how it all comes together. A single document will never be sufficient. But it can help you map between concepts and code.Code search is also invaluable for this; I recommend Sourcegraph: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/caddyserver/caddyEdit: One other valuable piece is explaining why the architecture is the way it is. Our architecture.md doc links to a video that explains how I arrived at Caddy 2&#39;s architecture (and why it&#39;s not arbitrary): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhJO8giOqQs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar advice, but I will go one step further: add README.md to other folders as well. It is dope to have a map of your whole system in an Architecture.md (or a README if it&#39;s not too long), but it&#39;s even more dope to be able to click through it and have submaps of how other components are structured.Displaying the folder/file structure and explaining what is what is a must. An example from Diem[1]:  consensus
  ├── src
  │   ├── block_storage          # In-memory storage of blocks and related data structures
  │   ├── consensusdb            # Database interaction to persist consensus data for safety and liveness
  │   ├── liveness               # RoundState, proposer, and other liveness related code
  │   └── test_utils             # Mock implementations that are used for testing only
  └── consensus-types            # Consensus data types (i.e. quorum certificates)
  └── safety-rules               # Safety (voting) rules


I recently digged into dependabot&#39;s code, and I found it extremely well structured. For example you have an Architecture section in the first README[2] with a diagram (how awesome is that!) and with links to the README of all the sub components, which themselves live in the subfolders[3].What I dread the most is going through a new codebase and not seeing any documentation in internal packages. Like how the fuck am I supposed to understand anything in there? By reading all the code?[1]: https://github.com/diem/diem/tree/master/consensus#how-is-th...[2]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core#architecture[3]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/comm..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who is in week two of spooling up on a multi-million-line codebase where most of the original authors have moved on to other projects, please, I beg you to heed this advice. I spend the vast majority of my time figuring out where a change needs to happen. The patches themselves are no more than 10% of the work.(The other significant factor is running tests.)"</p>

I don&#39;t remember where it was published or under what license (probably freeware), but the algorithm was incorporated into Hide4PGP (http://www.heinz-repp.onlinehome.de/Hide4PGP.htm), and we stopped work on it.This post just caused a bit of nostalgia.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen many possible explanations mentioned. Most common seems to be that raising daughters is more stressful than raising sons (for various reasons) leading to more arguments etc. Most intriguing might be that sons conceived into tenuous marriages don&#39;t even make it out of the womb. I&#39;ll add one more: mother/daughter friction. I can&#39;t even count the number of families I&#39;ve seen in which a mother feels betrayed when her daughter doesn&#39;t follow her example in everything, and lets those feelings show. I&#39;ve seen the same with father/son, though less so perhaps because mothers tend to be more active parents. It would also be foolish to ignore the issue of daughters growing into their adult bodies and becoming sexually active right when many mothers are feeling insecure about their own attractiveness. We can argue about causes, but the effect is real.When mothers and daughters fight, it always puts fathers in a difficult position. A dad who consistently sides the mother might get credit for being a good co-parent (usually not) but be alienated from their own child. A dad who consistently sides with the daughter is likely to lose all contact with either due to divorce. All this, regardless of who&#39;s right or wrong between the two. Again, a bit of this happens when fathers and sons are in conflict, but it doesn&#39;t seem quite as severe and has different potential outcomes because of how &#34;family&#34; court works.That&#39;s just one possible factor, affecting some cases, but it seems worth mentioning along with all the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; parents of teenage daughters argue more about parenting than do the parents of sonsFrom my own experience. When my daughter hit 12 it was a fucking nightmare. The hormones hit girls hard and they can become incredibly difficult. That said, now she’s 13 things are much easier and look to be getting easier by the week. Although my wife and I both have to be very understanding and on the same team to deal with difficult behaviour — we have a lot of strategy meetings.Lacking empathy, and wanting independence without responsibility are part of being a teenager. But 12-year old girls can sometimes be super charged griefers.On the flip side, teenagers are actually awesome to hang out with and total joys full of creativity and fun — if you work through the refusal to clean their room, general lack of hygiene and the drama."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/why-women-s-bodies-a...Male fetuses are more likely to die in the womb if the mother is stressed. Marriages are more likely to end if the marriage is stressful. Therefore, marriages with first born daughters are more likely to end with divorce, by no fault of the daughter.Disclosure: I was once a first-born teenage daughter. Yes, my parents divorced."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Context:
For those of you who still remember it, CubeWorld was a Minecraft-like RPG game that had a wildly popular Alpha, was eventually abandoned by its developer, was later revived, and was then universally vilified by the masses because the developers &#34;ruined&#34; the game.Veloren is the spiritual successor to CubeWorld, made by disappointed fans wanting something better."</p>

If you think about it, all things that we consider objects are just semi-permanent aggregations of fundamental particles that we recognize and label as objects for convenience of thought. When the patterns in such aggregations are outside the space and time scales that allow human minds to recognize them, the only label available is &#34;complex&#34;."</p>

* a VR porn character has more presence. Their eyes can follow you, they can turn to face you, they can reach to your face, hands.
* You can interact at a VR character. You can&#39;t with a videoIn other words, either Apple is going to need to support porn apps on the the app store or they&#39;re going to need to allow 3rd party stores."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I haven&#39;t seen mentioned here is that Homebrew forced people use Ruby to write formulas (ie packages), whereas MacPorts forced people to use Tcl. This one decision, plus hosting formulas on Github, was a major contributor to their present success.As much as I sympathize (deeply) with all the criticism of Homebrew here on this thread -- I used to use MacPorts religiously and love it -- I don&#39;t think Homebrew took the field purely through sneaky marketing or n00b decisions alone. They leveraged the momentum of a lot of new devs coming to OS X and provided an easier path for people wanting to help out.I hate to say it, but if this was a race (?), Homebrew won. Thankfully we all still have the choice to use MacPorts if we want, but there&#39;s no point in being mean about Homebrew at this point either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dear Homebrew maintainers,one simple effing thing: thank you! For all the hard work and the sheer pleasure Homebrew adds to the experience of developing software on a Mac."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The majority of the ports and software I want installed are essentially Unix/Linux/GNU environment tools.Macports has always seemed to me to be a more &#34;unix-y&#34; way of doing that, and it works politely with Apple&#39;s ways on top of the Unix core (eg locking down the system volume).It also has a very nice &#34;select&#34; and &#34;variants&#34; system that allows you to have multiple versions of a package as well as packages with more or less functionality (eg integrating with the MacOS keychain etc).When I first got into Macs (only around 5 years ago), I looked at both homebrew and macports and as soon as I saw homebrew blasting stuff into /usr/local while macports neatly put everything in /opt, I was convinced to go with macports. I also had previous experience with the BSD&#39;s port systems, which helped push me towards macports.But I&#39;m open to being convinced about homebrew, although I&#39;ve never needed something that it had that macports didnt."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of the most insightful Q&amp;A&#39;s about Steve that I&#39;ve read.  I especially appreciated the part about the risers for the gumdrop iMacs not working perfectly smoothly: he was pissed even though the audience couldn&#39;t possibly see the stuttering risers and even though the keynote was successful.One might think Steve Jobs was an arrogant, perfectionist prick.  But you realize in this small story, that the whole keynote could have been torpedoed, could have gone sideways and been ridiculed, if those mechanical risers had failed.  The big moment for this product that could (and did) save the company, might have been a laughable sad trombone even though Steve had warned Wayne that it was a problem that needed to be fixed.The work of hundreds of people, and hundreds of millions of dollars, were pitted against shitty mechanical hand-cranks -- that&#39;s why small details matter, and why Steve was pissed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s always interesting to watch other companies give presentations in their attempt at Apple style. Google comes to mind as being the worst.It’s like everyone has analyzed or identified certain little nuggets of a good presentation and then sprinkled them in... versus truly and innately understanding how to deliver a cohesive performance to an audience. The most famous example of this is the way everyone started to use “we did x y and z and you’re going to love it!” which was thrown around like peanuts on a domestic flight.Richard Feynman’s quote on cargo culting comes to mind."</p>

I don&#39;t run a blog thats very popular, but it has been quite easy to integrate (I use React, Gatsby/ static side generation, and Hyvor Talk has a react component). An example of the system is at the bottom of that blog post. There used to be a free tier, but now there isn&#39;t. I am only still using it because existing customers have the free tier and haven&#39;t bothered to look for alternatives. Unfortunately, you can&#39;t get it free anymore. I would love to see free tier reintroduced.I did find some bugs with the React component itself, but it wasn&#39;t bad enough to make me stop using it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If there is one thing I certainly wouldn&#39;t just play around with it&#39;s the immune system. It&#39;s incredibly dangerous and easily capable of causing all kinds of harm to yourself up to killing you outright.A vaccine is designed to produce an immune response of the right magnitude. Too low and it doesn&#39;t work, too high and it&#39;ll cause damage. At least one of the vaccine candidates in development was put back to the drawing board because the immune response wasn&#39;t strong enough. So this is not an area that is entirely predictable, you have to carefully test this to know if it works.I&#39;d also be very careful about the inhalation route. Inhalable insulin is a well-known failure, in part because of side effects due to the inhalation. And that is a protein that isn&#39;t designed to activate your immune system.I also hope the synthesized peptides were carefully purified, you really don&#39;t want to inhale e.g. residual trifluoracetic acid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an impressive amount of hubris. Does the author assume that all the certifications and testing stages were for show?I don&#39;t hold the highest view of LessWrong and the whole rationalist shtick. This post exemplifies why. Underneath this post is the assumption that the author is so much smarter than everybody else because they are Rational with a capital R and can therefore harness the power of science to make a vaccine[^1]. Again, that&#39;s an incredible amount of hubris. If there&#39;s one universal truth about science, it&#39;s that it is extremely specialized. Just because someone knows a lot about chemistry doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re qualified to talk about biology. There is no magic Rationality that can have amateurs making vaccines a good idea. Unless you are an expert in vaccines a priori, you cannot suddenly become one in a few weeks.Heck, I&#39;m skeptical of doctors who are not infectious disease experts giving advice. I still hear a lot of  &#34;well my sister&#39;s neighbor&#39;s brother is a pediatrician and he said XYZ&#34;. Doctors are certainly more educated than the average person, and if this was a minor medical problem I&#39;d certainly take a random doctor&#39;s advice. But this is a pandemic with a novel disease. Listen to the infectious disease experts.[1]: Quite honestly this feels like a plotline from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TLDR: I attempted to make a COVID vaccine. It was cheap. I have no proof that it worked. Other risks are unknown.The story reminds me of Barry Marshall, but with less science behind it. https://jamesclear.com/barry-marshall"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those defending this practice, consider carefully the implications of what you are advocating.On one hand you have a government deciding who can and cannot refer to themselves as adherents of a particular religion (by declaring that Ahamadis cannot call themselves Muslim).On another hand you have Google and Apple, yet again, being the complicit chokepoints of “free speech”, with regard to app developers.These may seem fair to you, but that may be because these practices have not negatively affected you...yet.But consider: Would it be fair if England declared Catholics “unChristian” and banned their use if the term?  Or what if the USA declared hasidic jews “Unjewish” and banned their use of the term. Or what if Apple caved to pressure theoretical from Israel to ban Jehovah’s Witnesses from using the term “Jehovah”?What next?  Government declaring who is and is not “white”?Oh wait......"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep thinking about infamous Telegram &#39;war&#39; with russian cenrosship agency, RosKomNadzor. Telegram was blocked via russian ISPs, but was never removed from Russian sections of Google Play and Apple Appstore.We now see that Apple and Google, time after time, easily submit to the will of local governments and remove questionable apps. Yet, Telegram was NOT removed. Russian media agencies claim that RosKomNadzor asked Google&amp;Apple to suspend the app, but the source for all media publications was always the same press-release by RKN. So it keeps me thinking: what if the world was played and all this &#39;blocking&#39; scandal was just a publicity stunt to raise Telegram&#39;s profile as a service that does not give up data to authorities?Does anyone know if we can confirm via Google &amp; Apple that they were asked to remove Telegram from play stores (and refused), or... they weren&#39;t really asked at all?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pakistan&#39;s laws are clearly wrong, but Apple and Google do not and should not have the authority to bypass any country&#39;s laws."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When a possible link between gut biomes and disease progression was first proposed, the response by the established science was pretty harsh.That people studying these links persisted and have created many reproducible experiments that demonstrate the connection is a testament both to perseverance and to science.When people try to argue that science is &#34;people making things up.&#34; as a reason for disbelieving science that challenges their beliefs, I use this example of fecal transplants as a real world case of how scientists challenge, confront, debate, and incorporate changes into their world views through process, review, and reproduction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile, offering high quality FMT transplants is a huge startup opportunity. People who need FMT are very sick, desperate, and willing to pay thousands of dollars to get it done. Recently, I have spent $2000 to order poop from the internet.Finding a high quality doctor is extremely difficult for a normal person. You have to find someone who is young, athletic, very healthy, never taken antibiotics, and then do some medical tests on them (pretty much everything that&#39;s wrong with a person can be transferred through FMT). Finding such person, bringing up the subject with them, and getting them agree to help is very hard.A company who could find and screen high quality FMT donors could make thousands of dollars just selling poop. Hundreds, if you&#39;re willing to drop prices to help people.All you have to do is find a healthy person who matches the criteria, and spend $2000-$3000 doing a number of blood/stool tests (and retest them every few months). Also figure out how to freeze/package/ship the transplants in a way that does the least harm to the microbes.If you are a healthy person who fits the description (or know someone who is), and are willing to help - please send me an email - fmthelp@protonmail.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; We believe privacy is paramount and free speech essential, especially on social media.this, from their &#34;technical difficulties&#34; notice, should have been enough for him to be fired on its own.  requiring some users to provide government identification, building such weak security that anyone can read and archive private messages, and not stripping out damaging meta-data from media posts are three ways to not provide privacy.if this was truly their mission, then their platform was already doomed, and a full housecleaning of most of the leadership should probably be done, not just the CEO.I don&#39;t care what side of a political spectrum you come from, or whether you support the site&#39;s mission or what it became, these failures should be unacceptable in any company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Odd dynamic there as unfortunately, standing on principle means getting martyred, and the quote from the former CEO of, “Over the past few months, I’ve met constant resistance to my product vision, my strong belief in free speech and my view of how the Parler site should be managed” is not CEO level strategic.His investors and board hired him to win, not to pick a principled hill to die on. Martyrs are cheap and nobody making investments can afford cheap things. The irony is Parler positioned itself as less radical than Gab, and it was that very position of bargaining with its platforms is what killed it. How can 4chan, Gab, and the even darker parts of the internet manage to persist online with hardly any money, but someone with Mercer level backing can&#39;t keep a site online? The lesson is an example of things we already know, which is that anyone who needs platform permission do to a disruptive startup is already dead.We absolutely need alternative platforms, and our societies need tools that can survive popular histrionics. Getting owned by some sanctimonious prick at Amazon is not pro level play."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Parler was poor quality because it was a product of extreme political grift. People who work in politics unfortunately don&#39;t understand the mindset of actually high quality products or services. What they&#39;re interested in is quick and loud splashes to attract a huge amount of attention, pull in a bunch of capital/resources, and then underdeliver in the extreme in the hopes that the attention of the crowd will move on and ignore the failures.This is of course a bipartisan trend, but as far as I can tell affects Republicans more.It was absurdly poorly run--literally on Wordpress with very little security and obviously no bug bounty program. They probably have never even heard of the concept of a bug bounty.All around disappointing. The next iteration, if it is to work at all, will require a complete mindset switch."</p>

If people aren&#39;t willing to do the job for the hourly wage alone with no tips, raise the wage until they are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The FTC alleges Amazon changed the way it paid drivers in late 2016, lowering the hourly rate and then used customer tips to make up the difference. Amazon continued to tell drivers they were receiving all of their tips, even after receiving hundreds of complaints from drivers, the agency said.How is this not simply theft? Why does this attract civil charges and not criminal ones?"</p>

Amazon executives chose not to alter the practice, instead viewing drivers’ complaints as a “PR risk,” which they sought to contain through deception. ...&gt; Today’s order provides substantial redress to the families victimized by Amazon’s anticompetitive deception. However, this cannot be the only action we take to protect workers and families from dominant middlemen. ...&gt; I also agree with Acting Chairwoman Slaughter and Commissioner Phillips that preying on workers justifies punitive measures far beyond the restitution provided here, and I believe the FTC should act now to deploy dormant authorities to trigger civil penalties and other relief in cases like this one.[1] https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, from Iran with love!First of all, thank you moxie and signal team for this proxy.Until 2018, many Iranians used telegram but Iran&#39;s regime after Russia blocked this messenger. telegram released mtproxy and this proxy was helpful. Russia lifted the ban on telegram but this app is still blocked on my country. but with VPNs, many iranians still use this app. after 2018, second most popular messaging app in iran was whatsapp, until facebook&#39;s new privacy policy, like all of you, many iranians switch from whatsapp to signal. mullah&#39;s regime removed signal app from the iranian app stores and started blocking all signal traffic in the country, but they don&#39;t block whatsapp. I&#39;m not a paranoid but it is difficult to understand for me why they didn&#39;t block whatsapp after 2018? can they break whatsapp encryption?I have a suggestion for signal team: please put tor in the signal, tor is better than any proxys or vpns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a big fan of the idea of independently-run proxy servers.Caddy has a secure forward proxy plugin born out of a research project at Google that does something similar, but works with any clients that let you configure HTTP proxies, and doesn&#39;t terminate TLS: instead it tunnels it over TLS. The proxy server itself can also be probe-resistant, i.e. difficult to detect that a website is acting as a proxy.I&#39;m hoping more people can help test the patch to support Caddy v2: https://github.com/caddyserver/forwardproxy/pull/74(Edit: Disclaimer - Don&#39;t use this in situations where your personal safety or freedom could be at risk... not yet. Not until more people with more experience can vet its implementation for bugs, and a very clear threat profile can drawn up. If you have experience with this, we&#39;d love your help.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s an irony how American companies try circumvents another country&#39;s law (regardless of whether you call it censorship or not, it is still a law) and boast about it.Yet, in the US these companies help the mainstream narrative to enforce censorship by banning (Google and Apple App market) or simply not offering other point of views basic hosting services (AWS).I am an Iranian and don&#39;t agree with all of our government actions but I can clearly see a tech neo-colonialism/neo-imperialism here. I am sure Signal&#39;s intention and people wanting to help is genuinely good but this does not change this double-standard.I would like to see your supportive reaction if an Iranian company offers hosting to Parler. I imagine you would call it foreign intervention!"</p>

I have no idea what you’re talking about; my general view is that people who meddle with politics usually meet a miserable end, and indeed they deserve to. I never bother with what is going on in Constantinople; I only worry about sending the fruits of the garden which I cultivate off to be sold there.’ Having said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they had made themselves, with kaimak enriched with the candied-peel of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee… – after which the two daughters of the honest Muslim perfumed the strangers’ beards. ‘You must have a vast and magnificent estate,’ said Candide to the turk. ‘I have only twenty acres,’ replied the old man; ‘I and my children cultivate them; and our labour preserves us from three great evils: weariness, vice, and want.’ Candide, on his way home, reflected deeply on what the old man had said. ‘This honest Turk,’ he said to Pangloss and Martin, ‘seems to be in a far better place than kings….

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is far too low. A fine large enough to destroy the company (as was effectively done to Purdue) would have been the only palatable outcome. And even more importantly, legal repercussions for all their employees who were personally responsible for this.All this settlement achieves is &#39;a cost of doing business&#39;, as they say. It&#39;s not punishment or deterrence. McKinsey and other companies like them will do similar in the future, and simply pay it off, again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know someone who worked for McKinsey for a few years, and some of the projects he described were straight up slimy. The one I recall right now was helping a big payday lender (read: large scale loan shark) figure out how to get their money back from people who were behind on their payments. The problem was that they can only attempt to withdraw so many times from someone&#39;s bank before they&#39;re banned, so the agreed solution was to estimate the best time of the month when the client had received their paycheck, but before they had used it to pay rent and other expenses.This person is no longer working there, and I&#39;m not surprised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The absolutely most fascinating part of this is learning how McKinsey has long argued that making recommendations that businesses may or may not act on does not create legal liability (until this).I’m trying to see that argument applied in any other instance and it becomes totally ridiculous.“You see, your honor, I merely suggested to my client that he kill his neighbor in order to take his land, I didn’t think he’d actually DO it!”"</p>

Googling around only lead me to forum threads where people recommended certain drives that would be very good at error recovery, but I thought it might be even better if you could get the raw stream from the disc and then do all the EFM reversal etc in software with more advanced analysis, brute forcing etc. But nothing of this kind seemed to exist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope no one is saying Privacy Sandbox is worse than third party cookies, or is trusting this article to form an opinion about it. Web advertising was a $319 billion dollar industry in 2019. Does anyone wonder who may be lobbying their government to scrutinize Google and offer themselves for interviews for articles like this? Does anyone think the result of beating up Project Sandbox will be more radical privacy protection?No, I don&#39;t think this article has anything really to do with a better privacy outcome and everything to do with watering down Google&#39;s stance to something more status quo for the advertising industry.There are no actual critiques of Privacy Sandbox&#39;s APIs here. There&#39;s no mention of what critics stand to lose if Privacy Sandbox becomes the standard. There&#39;s merely hand wringing of &#34;but do you trust Google?&#34; Everyone who&#39;s made themselves available for quoting in this article is a web advertising professional, including the ones who come off as not[1][2]. None of them care about you.[1] James Rosewell is cited as director of &#34;Marketers for an Open Web.&#34; He&#39;s also the CEO of a company that specializes in device detection. His LinkedIn headline reads &#34;THE  Fastest and Most Accurate  Device Detection = more  profitable websites&#34;[2] Alan Chapell is sarcastic about Google attempting to do this openly through the w3c. He&#39;s cited as running a privacy law firm. Their web site says they represent tech companies navigating privacy issues. They aren&#39;t actual privacy advocates. https://chapellassociates.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s way of leveraging their browser dominance to use 3rd party cookies as a way to gain competitive advantage:Step 1: Implement a whole new browser functionality where Google alone can track people.Step 2: Eliminate 3rd party cookies so Google&#39;s competitors have to create increasingly unethical and invasive fingerprinting techniques to remain competitive.Step 3: Increase advertising rates since they are the only company able to effectively target adverts on the web. (Profit)Did I miss anything?Google in their enthusiasm to prevent Microsoft from dominating the web has become worse than Microsoft was in its heyday."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I understand this correctly, then killing off 3rd party cookies is anti-competitive, leaving them in is anti-privacy, and putting out a privacy-enhancing alternative is also anti-competitive.  Is there anything that can be done that would satisfy all regulations?Also, this reminds me of a story I heard years ago, that a California oil change location needed to store oil above ground due to EPA regulations, but needed it stored underground to satisfy the fire department regulations.  So they were constantly getting fined from one or the other, and had to just include those fines as a cost of doing business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is seriously cool. I feel slightly validated that I&#39;ve also been wrapping these by hand, since it&#39;s kind of quirky to try and auto-generate these while keeping the same usability and such as their original incarnations.For those interested in a Rust variant, I&#39;ve been hacking on one for awhile: https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/cacaoI wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s yet ready for production use, but so far it&#39;s working pretty well for me. Been dogfooding it by building an app I&#39;ve wanted for a bit - a proper magic-wormhole macOS app.One of the things I&#39;ve really wanted to keep to is the delegate pattern, since I think it actually works really well for Rust&#39;s model. A fun example I finished yesterday is ListView cell reuse:https://twitter.com/ryanmcgrath/status/1357097991081844737/p...Ultimately I view this as one of the last pieces needed for a cross-platform Rust UI framework to actually work."</p>

Will bookmark this one for sure.It&#39;s great to see remnants of the demoscene pop up like this from time to time. I&#39;m sure there are many of us relative old-timers here that got their first taste of graphics programming thanks to those demoscene BBS tuts from back in the day (Denthor of Asphyxia anyone?).Just the other day I was reminiscing with a fellow programmer on freenode about mode13th shenanigans and the all-nighters that ensued.This HN post put a smile on my face.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool that people still keep such stuff!
I was part of the demoscene way back in the late 80s-early 90s, and I just clicked randomly on some of these fonts and one of them looked familiar. However I couldn’t tell if it was one that my friend (in our demo group that I’ve long since lost touch with) had made or if I saw it in someone else’s demo... this was not a time where we concerned ourselves with archiving our work for future generations to watch. And it would be impossible to find out since my parents kept asking me whether or not to keep my old Amiga that was sitting unused for years ... and I ignored their questions and eventually they threw it away... I’m just glad Bitcoin hadn’t been invented yet — haha."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No one is talking about the very big risk associated with this, that mental health professionals can commit you against your will with no trial, which is an erosion of civil liberties (incarceration without trial). Having known several friends who got committed and held against their will in psych wards when there was no good reason to, because their insurance was good, this is an issue.Notice they don&#39;t give any stats about outcomes, but the primary cited issue is &#34;mental health&#34; which is very vague and a subjective assessment.We should not create an extra judicial system that has no checks and balances. Otherwise we will head towards medical authoritarianism which could easily be abused by those in power (psychiatrists and others) for their own personal gain.See https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosalindadams/intake for an example of what I mean."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;ve had a program like this in Eugene Oregon for 30 Years. It&#39;s the model a lot of other programs follow.https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/this-town-of-170000-replac...They handle most non-violent 911 calls which cops would end up handling. Things like people walking into a business naked or sleeping in the doorway of a business, these guys get called. It&#39;s a big percentage of 911 calls in any city where you have homeless people.Usually they can help people out, but if people do get violent or belligerent, they call for police backup. That&#39;s pretty rare.Overdoses, sick homeless people, people shouting random shit at people in front of businesses, pretty much anything non violent, these guys talk them down give them a little help, drive them to a clinic, or whatever they need. It&#39;s a lot cheaper and more humane than arresting them."</p>

They told us to call the police. We called the police. They said they&#39;d call the ambulance........ Shortly after he was called up by the ambulance, who said the police was on their way.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Germany is pathetic and spineless for letting the EU-China deal go through. Never again never meant shit, it was just virtue signaling, a lie, a fraud. Because it is happening again and Germany is using the same old spineless appeasement tactic that was taken with Nazi Germany.If you are a German citizen you really need to ask yourself how you can change your voting behaviour to ensure that the people who made the EU-China deal happen never have political power again.If good people stand by and do nothing while genocide is happening, they are not good people because good people don&#39;t tolerate genocide.And the pipeline deals that Germany have with Russia is also messed up. Western Europe has to find a backbone and soon, and stand up to totalitarian regimes and dictators. If Europe fails to be a bulwark against this scourge then it will consume Europe also.EDIT: Just to be clear, I don&#39;t suggest the west should  invade china or it&#39;s proxies, or start wars, or start proxy wars. But is not making deals with a genocidal state that much to ask? Is maybe sanctions too much to ask for? Is clear an unequivocal support for Taiwan with mutual defence pacts too much to ask for?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think my digital life would be a mess without an RSS feed reader. Because of its existence I do not need to touch Twitter, Reddit, YouTube[1], or any Mastodon instance, for example, as I can just have the updates that interest me from these networks in the comfort of my Feedbin[2] feed.While Hacker News does not provide an interface that notifies you when someone replies to you, hnrss.org provides an RSS feed for that[3], so I know when I get a reply. I also have a separate feed for Ask HN[4] and Show HN[5], so I never miss anything that may interest me, even if other people do not care about it. Heck, I found this post because it showed up on my feed reader!As a system administrator, I can use RSS to keep up to date with security issues in Ubuntu Server[6], WordPress[7], and CVEs in general, but also to follow commits in SourceHut repositories[8] and releases for pieces of software I use daily, but do not have repositories for my Linux distribution.I sure as heck hope it never go away.[1] In the YouTube case, with RSS, mpv, and youtube-dl, I never even have to see their web interface.[2] https://feedbin.com/[3] https://hnrss.org/replies?id=${YOURUSERNAME}[4] https://hnrss.org/ask[5] https://hnrss.org/show[6] https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/rss.xml[7] https://www.exploit-db.com/rss.xml[8] https://git.sr.ht/~${USERNAME}/${REPO}/log/rss.xml"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve mentioned this on HN before, one pattern I&#39;ve noticed is a lot of sites tend to truncate their RSS feed so you have to click through to see the full article etc. This is mostly OK but kinda frustrating, as in the before-covid times I used to ride the London Underground a lot where no celluar signal is available in the tunnels - so my offline RSS reader would be useless.So I wrote a little web service accepts an RSS feed, and then crawls each link in it, parses the HTML to extract the text using one of those text extraction libraries, and then &#34;republishes&#34; a new version of the feed (with the full article) which I then subscribe to in my RSS reader so I can read the articles offline, e.g.example.com/rss?feed=foo.net/artcles/rssI&#39;ve never open sourced it though because I guess it&#39;s a bit of a grey area - the sites want you to go to the full URL so they can show you ads etc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I provide an RSS feed for my blog. From my access.log, I see that there is a decent number of subscribers to my feed. Here is the data I could pull from it:  Feedly           91 subscribers
  Inoreader        16 subscribers
  Feedbin           6 subscribers
  NewsBlur          4 subscribers
  The Old Reader    3 subscribers
  BazQux            2 subscribers
  WordPress         2 subscribers
  -------------------------------
  Total           124 subscribers

I get about 4000-6000 hits to my website on a normal day. It increases by 5 to 10 times if a post hits the HN front page. When I publish new post, I see from the HTTP referer information in the logs that about 30 or so hits come from users who find a link to my post in their feed reader. These are very small numbers but they are good enough to keep the feed alive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A long time ago, due to an improbable sequence of events, I found myself teaching Computer Graphics at my alma mater, a year after I took the class myself. Over the following five years or so, my approach to the subject evolved, and I really got the hang of it.
After I stopped teaching, I took my notes, handouts and slides, and made them into a series of articles that I put on my website, where they remained in relative obscurity. Hacker News managed to find it every once in a while, and it was generally well received, but nothing came out of this. Until April 2019. It made the HN front page again [0], except this time it caught the attention of an editor in No Starch Press [1].Long story short, today I’m incredibly grateful and excited to tell you that CGFS is coming out as a real book, with pages and all [2]. The folks at NSP graciously agreed to let me publish the updated contents, the product of almost two years of hard editing and proofreading work, for free on my website [3]. But if you’d like to preorder the printed or ebook version, you can use the coupon code MAKE3DMAGIC to get a 35% discount at https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch.I’m still somewhat in disbelief that my work is getting published as a book, and this genuinely wouldn’t have happened without your support. So once again, THANK YOU :)[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19584921[1] http://nostarch.com[2] https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch[3] http://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey HN,I’m the author, Haven has been my side project for a little while.  The core idea is that we should be able to make it easy for anyone to host their own private webpage as an alternative to centralized social media.A lot of the decentralized community seems to have chosen federated models as the solution to “self-hosting is hard”.  I’m trying something different.  With core web technologies as the foundation, my mom or my wife’s grandmother can visit my site with any web browser and I’m still able to exclude the rest of the world.  For technical people, self-hosting is made easy with a one-line AWS deployment script, and an install script for the Raspberry Pi Zero W.  I’d like less-technical people to be able to use this too so I’m exploring providing paid hosting as a service.I think of Haven as a Facebook-alternative, but probably not a Twitter alternative.  I see Facebook as selling itself more as “stay in touch with your friends and family” where Twitter is more about “see what interesting people are saying”.  The latter has discovery as a core component.  With Haven everything is private so discovery wouldn’t make any sense.There’s nothing new here in terms of technology--server-side rendered web pages using Ruby on Rails, no javascript frameworks, RSS using HTTP basic auth.  But also no analytics libraries or ad-tracking.  Pages are lightweight and load really fast.  I’ve even provided a limited ability to add custom CSS so you can really make your page your own.I would love any feedback you want to share.  Both from a technical or installation side, feedback on the public webpage, as well as thoughts on communities that might be interested to learn about Haven.Thank you!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem I have with this is that it makes people create and manage an account. My 90 year old grandmother is not gonna manage that.I made a little hack for wordpress that lets you run a wordpress blog and have a shared security question that lets people access content. A simple question like &#34;What is the name of the family dog?&#34; or &#34;What is grandpa&#39;s nickname?&#34;, something like that. Not industrial strength security, but enough to keep it sorta private and out of search.The nifty part is that with wordpress and Jetpack, people can sign up for posts by email, so every time you post, your friends/family can get an email with the updates. No need to even visit the blog. Perfect for grandma.Here&#39;s the two files that make it work, in case anyone is interested:
https://gist.github.com/justinph/f0fb937d1ee418a45bfb85e91e4..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love the idea. We&#39;ve got kids and try to keep their likenesses off the public / data-slurping internet (Google, FB/WA/Insta, etc) by sending photos to friends and family via Signal.The downside is that everything&#39;s ephemeral. I&#39;ve long thought there was room for a private network where you can pub/sub to people you care about.  Sort of a simple and private Livejournal / Blogger.FWIW I think the self-hosting bit isn&#39;t where the opportunity is.  It&#39;s in hosted private sharing. One thing I&#39;d do is create landing pages for people who want to share privately and have $$. Parents are the first group that comes to mind.I wish you success - the world needs what you&#39;re doing!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Arrow is the most important thing happening in the data ecosystem right now. It&#39;s going to allow you to run your choice of execution engine, on top of your choice of data store, as though they are designed to work together. It will mostly be invisible to users, the key thing that needs to happen is that all the producers and consumers of batch data need to adopt Arrow as the common interchange format.BigQuery recently implemented the storage API, which allows you to read BQ tables, in parallel, in Arrow format: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storageSnowflake has adopted Arrow as the in-memory format for their JDBC driver, though to my knowledge there is still no way to access data in parallel from Snowflake, other than to export to S3.As Arrow spreads across the ecosystem, users are going to start discovering that they can store data in one system and query it in another, at full speed, and it&#39;s going to be amazing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excited to see this release&#39;s official inclusion of the pure Julia Arrow implementation [1]!It&#39;s so cool to be able mmap Arrow memory and natively manipulate it from within Julia with virtually no performance overhead. Since the Julia compiler can specialize on the layout of Arrow-backed types at runtime (just as it can with any other type), the notion of needing to build/work with a separate &#34;compiler for fast UDFs&#34; is rendered obsolete.It feels pretty magical when two tools like this compose so well without either being designed with the other in mind - a testament to the thoughtful design of both :) mad props to Jacob Quinn for spearheading the effort to revive/restart Arrow.jl and get the package into this release.[1] https://github.com/JuliaData/Arrow.jl"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great work! It makes me wonder if a few things could be possible:1. Make the surface of the ball a multitouch trackpad surface so you could pinch zoom in and out and two finger scroll up and down, all on the ball itself. Make it only work when the ball is not pressed on hard enough to move.2. Make the ball slightly squeezable, which registers as a click. That way you could roll it around on your desk or on the base. This honestly would also be a great kids computer toy so they don&#39;t have to get their hands near the device itself.3. Add electromagnets inside on all sides and place the ball on a magnetic trackpad or base. When squeezed it would turn on the downward-facing electromagnet in the ball to make it harder to move, so you could engage in finer detail work.Probably a materials challenge to do any of these but it would be really cool to see these new input frontiers explored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more absurd thing is criticism of Yellen on this part is being defended - by the White House press secretary no less - as a woman&#39;s right to use her skills to make money. Yes, women should absolutely be able to rise to their talent and ambition, but it&#39;s a clear conflict of interest for government official. It&#39;s a disingenuous use of the most vacuous forms of language to defend open corruption.But then again, if we wanted finance experts to chair the Fed and be the treasury secretary without any prior monetary relationships with banks and hedge funds, we would probably have just some academics. A lot of academics in economics/finance get paid for legal testimony on behalf of companies and such, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For additional context, the most recent payments for speaking fees from Citadel were barely three months ago[1]:&gt; The Chicago-based hedge fund paid Yellen $292,500 for a speech on Oct. 17, 2019, $180,000 for one on Dec. 3, 2019, and $337,500 to speak at a series of webinars held from Oct. 9-27, 2020.[1]: https://dailycaller.com/2021/01/28/janet-yellen-gamestop-cit..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regulatory capture is a gigantic problem, especially in finance.It’s obvious that we don’t have the right incentive structure with the SEC, either. If you can make 20x more using the skills you’d need to investigate companies trading instead, the talent pool is reduced to those motivated by power/ideology. I’ve always thought financial regulators should have some kind of incentive structure that closes this gap but it’s not clear how to do that without skewing the enforcement priorities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page.This is the most important lesson of options. It&#39;s never just a coin flip. You have an unimaginably huge number of factors riding against your success. It&#39;s not even remotely close to a 50/50 win/lose scenario. There are a million ways to lose, and just a few narrow ways to win. You literally have better odds going to the roulette table and placing a bet on red."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is good advice. I wrote a bunch of novels, got a degree - a Ph.D. in philosophy to make sure I&#39;ll never make any money and people who have money wouldn&#39;t want to give it to me -, and did some Internet advertising. Not very surprisingly, I&#39;m fairly poor. However, I&#39;ve still managed to save a little bit of money so maybe I should start trading now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Building an online course[1] has been one of the easiest ways to make money in my personal experience. Other things I&#39;ve tried building: SaaS, Trades business, Freelancing business.I&#39;ve made over $8k since I launched last month and it&#39;s been a great stepping stone into other ideas. The main problem I see going forward is getting consistent traffic. Building the course was the &#34;easy&#34; part and now I&#39;m focusing hard on SEO to keep consistent traffic going to my page. Long term I think I can make $100-$300 a day with it.I floundered trying to build SaaS and other types of business for years before making some money online. Selling a one time purchase can be a game changer for those looking to go independent. Look at the stairstep approach[2] for reasons why this works so well.Overall, if you invest a few days and put something out there, I think an online course can be a great way to build some income.[1] https://www.vim.so

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is such a shame that nowadays even these high priced devices are contributing to the enormous e-waste we are all piling up.It used to be like this: You spend A LOT of money for really nice headphones and use them (potentially) your lifetime. Or hand it down to your kids as your hearing gets worse. Sound doesn’t change much and the plug has been around for ages.Nowadays it goes like this: You buy your expensive Apple headphones. And even though Apple is probably supporting these longer than your average earbuds, after a while the bluetooth version will be obsolete and eventually the battery will have reached its end or inflate and become a safety risk.But because this was expensive and Apple supported it longer, it will have maybe lasted 10 years and one or two (pricey) battery replacements. This is still much worse than audiophile „analog“ headphones and I feel like this change is not adequately addressed.I would really hope to see more approaches like Shure‘s „Aonic 215 True Wireless“ which is an arguably quite ugly attachment to the drivers that have been around for a long while and just adds the wireless capabilities and bluetooth. It can also be used for any other Shure driver afaik. This way you keep the good old sound producing piece while swapping out the stuff that will degrade over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a detailed, well-written review, but like most mainstream headphone reviews it makes me cringe a little. Though masked somewhat by self-deprecating remarks, there&#39;s audiophile &#34;woo&#34; peaking out from behind the corner (e.g. the comment about lossless compression). More importantly, it&#39;s missing the most important part of a headphone review: a measurement of the frequency response curve!It&#39;s fairly well known that above the ~$100 price level, headphone sound quality differences mostly disappear once equalized properly [0]. The real test is not stock AirPods versus H9i (as done in the review), it&#39;s AirPods versus H9i once they&#39;re both equalized to a common frequency target. Otherwise you&#39;re testing the manufacturer&#39;s tuning as much as the actual quality of the hardware.Certainly, there&#39;s something to be said for the manufacturer getting it right in the first place so you don&#39;t have to bother with EQ when listening on a mobile device, etc. But I think the following two points are likely true:1) People will score the AirPods highly in subjective listening tests;2) The performance in those listening tests has more to do with the frequency tuning of the AirPods than anything about its hardware, and you could get a virtually identical listening experience with a $100 to $200 pair of Sennheisers and an EQ app.[0] See e.g. http://seanolive.blogspot.com/2017/02/twirt-337-predicting-h.... Sean Olive has a bunch of papers on this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;It is, therefore, my sworn duty to be skeptical of consumer technology companies encroaching on the territory of high-end audio equipment built by companies with decades of experience.&gt; but their track record with audio hardware is inconsistent. Somehow, the company that makes the HomePod—a marvel of mono speaker engineering—is also the company that continues to make and sell Beats products.When Beats were acquired by Apple. Especially with Jimmy Iovine in charge of Apple Music ( initially ). I was extremely worried that any of the crap Beats made infect Apple&#39;s Audio. Turns out Apple has Firewalled their department pretty well. I remember reading one of the story about HomePod team asking Jimmy Iovine&#39;s opinion on its audio quality. His reply was his usual &#34; You need more Bass&#34;.Apple audio engineering teams consist of many engineers from Bowers &amp; Wilkins . One of my favourite brand in Audio Equipment. ( I think, I could be wrong, Steve Jobs likes Bowers &amp; Wilkins too ) And you should notice their taste of Audio have many similar traits.So Beats continue to make crap, they did improve somewhat since Apple&#39;s purchased them. And Apple, continues to be Apple.But that is only with Audio, the AirPods Max Hardware Design is very much modern Apple and non-Bowers &amp; Wilkins. The weight and comfort issues. Something about Apple&#39;s Design Department changed ever since Steve Jobs is not there to be the Editor to edit things. Things like Keyboard, TrackPad or Headsets. User Comfort and usage are no longer the 1st priority. Instead it is aesthetics and design goals, that could be material ( the need to use Metal ), thinner or colour.Design is how it works, not how it looks. Hopefully recent Mac changes meant they learned a thing or two."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name.Jeff&#39;s pitch at the time (1997); so on point, so precise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWRbTnE1PEM&gt; The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, “What’s the internet?” Blessedly, I haven’t had to explain that in a long while.Here&#39;s Jeff explaining the Internet (at a TED talk): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMKNUylmanQ&gt; Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal... If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.Jeff speaking about innovation, invention (based on first principles), making data-driven decisions (and also when to not trust data), learned helplessness at Stanford (2005): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhnDvvNS8zQ&gt; When times have been good, you’ve been humble.Heh. Reminds me of this 2008 lecture where Jeff is selling AWS to startup school students: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nKfFHuouzA Classic.&gt; Amazon couldn’t be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to.Not sure about that last part, Jeff.So long, and thanks for all the fish."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"According to a post in the comments, the author is 18 years old which means that I&#39;ve been using Linux longer than the author has been making use of the blood in his veins. But that does not mean that I didn&#39;t learn something from his post!While the technical accomplishments and understanding are commendable, I think that the main takeaway for me is the excellent approach to learning. Keeping it simple and taking an open-minded approach to learning (as exemplified by his attitude toward systemd) is an approach that more people could stand to take. So often we complicate things in our heads to the point where they seem unknowable and so we assume that they are too difficult and we don&#39;t try. I have seen this in myself at times and I see it others as well.I&#39;ll be sharing this post at work so that the people who I work with who don&#39;t really understand Linux so well can appreciate the approach that was taken and hopefully also glean something from the excellent write-up itself."</p>

The main focus is implementing job control like: jobs, fg, bg, and various signal handlers in order to understand how forking child processes work.I see that your shell doesn&#39;t handle much other than cd so this might be a nice next step if you want to continue working on it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In the case of Wayland, the “vague authority” are a bunch of volunteers who have devoted tens of thousands of hours of their free time towards making free shit for you.That does not mean anyone is under an obligation to like it.&gt; Maybe Wayland doesn’t work for your precious use-case. More likely, it does work, and you swallowed some propaganda based on an assumption which might have been correct 7 years ago.If you insist on disregarding people&#39;s use cases, don&#39;t be surprised they don&#39;t like your software. I&#39;ve been down this road a lot with FOSS software: &#34;I don&#39;t use it because it doesn&#39;t do what I need&#34;, &#34;sure it does!&#34;, &#34;no, it really doesn&#39;t&#34;, &#34;well you don&#39;t need that anyway!&#34;...On the whole however, I can certainly understand the frustration at having to deal with a community that gets annoyed at anything that changes simply because they&#39;re already so used to the garbage pile they have that they now hold the delusion that it&#39;s actually not garbage.In my admittedly somewhat distanced opinion, Wayland&#39;s biggest mistakes were not launching with a coherent strategy for replicating functionality like screen sharing, screenshots, and to a lesser extent remote desktop/applications. They just punted and said &#34;that&#39;s a compositor problem!&#34; as though that was supposed to make it ok. People have thus harbored some inherent resentment ever since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have no beef with Wayland specifically and I agree that if you are harassing maintainers of any project you&#39;re probably an asshole. However,&gt;Maybe Wayland doesn’t work for your precious use-case. More likely, it does work, and you swallowed some propaganda based on an assumption which might have been correct 7 years ago.I&#39;m a game developer. None of the software I use works reliably or at all on Wayland. None of it. And I&#39;m completely fine with that, I&#39;ll keep using Xorg and you can give me a call when my &#34;precious use-case&#34; is handled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m using a Dell UP2718Q (3840x2160, 144dpi, 60Hz) and a Fujitsu Siemens P17-2 (1024x1280, 96dpi, 75Hz) side by side, and without Wayland this setup isn’t even possible to get working properly. Sadly, KDE still doesn’t support it nicely under Wayland (so I moved to Ubuntu Budgie), but under X11 it’s entirely impossible to run it properly, as except for Qt nothing supports mixed DPI, or mixed refresh rates properly.Once proper wide color gamut and bitdepth support is added, it’ll be even better, as the monitors are 10-bit Rec.2020 and 8-bit sRGB. Which under X11 isn’t even possible to support, as again, Xorg only sees one single screen it’s drawing on, and it’s up to the lower levels of the stack to split that.EDIT: Answering the most common question which is asked all the time as my comment is getting some visibility here:Now why does wayland break screenshot and keyboard tools? Because &#34;every program is a keylogger by default and can see any event, look at the contents of any window&#34; is a major security issue, especially as it means the entire security model of screen lockers or containerized applications is useless.Under X11, basically every application you run can trivially escalate itself to root. As even your Zoom client can just listen to your key events when you unlock your screen or use sudo in your terminal, save your password, and tada it can elevate itself. Under X11, there is no security whatsoever, and no separation of privileges.EDIT2: Why is sandboxing applications important? (a) more and more proprietary software is also released for linux, which you probably shouldn’t trust. And (b) if e.g. your XMPP client is compromised, you don’t want the attacker to gain root.EDIT3: Yes, screenshot tools and screensharing still works. I can use KDE Spectacle under Budgie or Chrome, and Slack, Teams, Discord, Jitsi all work just fine. OBS requires a patch, but also works nicely. It’s not impossible, it just requires software using it to be updated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I review a lot of technical software documentation. This is one of my go-to resources for explaining how docs should be organized. These ideas are generally accepted among software technical writers; you may just hear them use slightly different words for each doc type. E.g. I use &#34;overview&#34; instead of &#34;explanation&#34;. I&#39;ll also mention that this framework isn&#39;t comprehensive; there are other types of critical documents that aren&#39;t explained here, such as release notes. I think the key breakthrough with Divio&#39;s framework is getting authors to think about docs in terms of desired goals and outcomes: learning-oriented, problem-oriented, etc.Edit: I suppose you could argue that release notes fall under the category of reference-oriented, but when I look at the guidelines for reference docs it&#39;s clear that the Divio people were thinking about API references."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the origin of this work is from Jacob Kaplan-Moss who did the original refactor of the Django documentation. He wrote up the concepts here in 2009:https://jacobian.org/series/great-documentation/Daniele Procida built on this and formalized it through this resource, which is really amazing and definitely the best resource for writing docs that I know of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sites are not detecting a portrait screen and deciding that they&#39;re displaying on a phone.  Someone who switches their monitor to portrait, or resizes a window to be taller than it is wide, is still going to get the desktop view.In this case the author is scaling their resolution, and so their browser is presenting itself to sites as 720px wide.  Sites see that and show a layout optimized for a screen of that width.  Those sites are acting correctly.The author&#39;s proposed solution is for sites to use DPI instead, but this would thwart the preferences of users who use scaling because they want the whole site to look bigger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I must be missing something, because I don&#39;t understand this author&#39;s point at all.&#34;Lots of websites think “Vertical Screen == Mobile User”!&#34;
No, they don&#39;t - They think a 720px wide screen is a tablet user, which is probably a fair assumption.I could equally write &#34;Just because I browse zoomed in 500% doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m on a mobile&#34;When you zoom in, things get bigger, so fewer of them will fit on the screen... You have a choice between horizontal scrolling, or the website showing you the version of itself designed for smaller viewports.Looking at the &#34;How it should render&#34; screens - I just checked the Guardian site, and that is exactly how the website looks at 1080px wide. The author admits that because of their zoom solution they are running at an effective width of 720px, so maybe just.. don&#39;t do that??The proposed solution doesn&#39;t seem to solve anything, because physical size of the screen isn&#39;t the full story, it also depends on how far away from the screen the user is - which the browser can never know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a product manager, my immediate response is... not worth the time.You&#39;ve chosen to have a unique setup, which is fine, but your use case represents some absolutely miniscule fraction of users. On top of that, it&#39;s not even that websites are unusable, just that they&#39;re not ideal.When you decide to do weird/special/unique stuff, don&#39;t expect the world to adapt to you. You can rotate your monitor back or live with it. The idea that companies should spend engineering/QA/PM resources to deal with this is... vain."</p>

I ended up admitting that the thing I was looking for didn&#39;t exist, so I made it (website in this case so very small risk/outlay).  It made a boat load of income from ad revenue back when CPMs were better (still exists these days but revenue is way way down on what it was - perhaps less than &lt;5% - and my regular work salary these days  totally eclipses even what it was at its peak anyway).There must be so many of these sorts of stories on HN - someone scratching their own itch, only to find out that others have the same."</p>

I am now where you were 3 years ago: I just quit my well-paid SWE job without any concrete backup plan and all I have been dreaming of for years is being an entrepreneur.
It either happens now when I&#39;m still young, or never, I figured.However, I am still quite unsure how to actually get the ball rolling. 
My current game plan is to just brainstorm for a week or so and then start building the best idea I came up with during that week, then give myself a release deadline of one month for an MVP and see if I can raise some interest.But after reading the paragraph about ideas[1] I am not sure anymore if this is a smart approach or not... 
What do you think, what&#39;s the best thing to do to get to that initial spark?[1]: https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/#pursuing-the-right...(sry, non-native speaker)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding the first paragraphs where luddism is mentioned several times; Lord Byron, father to Ada Lovelace the first programmer, was one of the few on the House of Lords to defend the Luddites:&gt; But the police, however useless, were by no means idle: several notorious delinquents had been detected; men liable to conviction, on the clearest evidence, of the capital crime of poverty; men, who had been nefariously guilty of lawfully begetting several children, whom, thanks to the times!—they were unable to maintain. Considerable injury has been done to the proprietors of the improved frames. These machines were to them an advantage, inasmuch as they superseded the necessity of employing a number of workmen, who were left in consequence to starve. By the adoption of one species of frame in particular, one man performed the work of many, and the superfluous labourers were thrown out of employment. [...] These men never destroyed their looms till they were become useless, worse than useless; till they were become actual impediments to their exertions in obtaining their daily bread.There is a lot of proganda use of &#34;luddites&#34; as anti-tech when luddites main grief was regarding income and inequality.[1]: http://www.luddites200.org.uk/LordByronspeech.html[2]: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/byron-was-one-few-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A comment I made on this when it was posted a few days ago:I am surprised that this was regarded as a close decision. I guess a lot depends on wording, but when one person is predicting the dollar will be worthless, and the person in the role of judge claims that given global economic uncertainty, it&#39;s a &#34;close&#34; question, I wonder if they&#39;re just saying that to be diplomatic.Obviously there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty, but one way to think about it, is that it can get so much worse than it currently is. And it seems like the predictions being wagered over were pointing to the &#34;so much worse&#34;. I think the same holds for the environment, and for the proposed war between rich and poor.I get the temptation to treat those as close, because there&#39;s tensions that you could imagine leading to some worst case scenarios. And so one might want to acknowledge the tension, and you want to put that acknowledgment into some sort of partial credit. But I think that way of thinking gets all confused and hair splitty, and comes from a place of thinking everything&#39;s a trick question, and not wanting to be perceived as overlooking nuances.Anyhow, credit to all parties involved for formalizing their discussion and getting a bet out of it. I think those kinds of conversations are valuable, and I think it helps to get people thinking about what it takes for beliefs to be true over the long run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Has Tech Destroyed Society?I recently watched the documentary The Man Who Saved the World[0], about Stanislav Petrov, who one day in 1983 made the decision to ignore the early warning system computers telling him the USA had fired 5 missiles at the USSR.[1] It seems had he followed orders, a report to his superiors would have resulted in mass retaliation. The decision was in his hands.In the movie, as well as a reenactment of the incident, the real Petrov visits the USA to speak at the UN, and visits Kevin Costner, his favourite actor. Costner asks him how many people would have died if not for his actions that day. You expect him to say millions.  Petrov explains that everyone on the planet would&#39;ve died.They visit a disused missile silo in the USA and Petrov explains to a guard there that just one of those missiles had more explosive force than all the weapons used in WW2. According to this page[2], in 1985 the USA had 21,000+ nuclear weapons, USSR 39,000+.It&#39;s very chilling, to say the least. It makes humans seem so very crazy, to create the possibility of that situation in the first place. Petrov explains emotionally to the guard that the Russian people wanted peace, and thought the USA wanted to attack them.I can&#39;t help thinking about that, reading about Whether Tech Has Destroyed Society?[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Saved_the_World[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alar...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_nuclear_weapons_sto..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anybody knows if Scaleway it&#39;s better than the parent company?I was an online.net costumer for a lot of years for a personal project, and a happy one, but then they changed the contract unilaterally, which included the billing going up almost 75% with another changes in the ToS. And look I get it, sometimes prices rises, and you can always change providers, so the problem was not that... but the customer service and poor communication.I only notice the change, after my credit card notified my of a higher charge than the ones I&#39;m used to. There was not notification about it in the dashboard. And after a lot of tickets with representatives, they told me under the excuse of &#34;ram / hdd prices are going up&#34; the notice was send through email, and probably gmail mark it as spam... and then the nightmare to cancel begin.After telling them to cancel the account, they told that under the new contract (that I didn&#39;t accept) they could only do it if I got charged another extra month, even if from the start you always payed one month in advance, plus paying the setup fee at the beginning.Look I get it, hardware it&#39;s messy and prices can go up to stay in business, but this attitude of &#34;I am altering the deal, pray I don’t alter it any further&#34; was the one that made me look for another solutions, and be skeptical about Scaleway despite in paper being a good alternative to Digital Ocean (that let me tell you, DO customer service it&#39;s gold in comparison to what I got from online)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1) I am a big fan of the general philosophy of Solid. But as others have mentioned, I&#39;ve found it extremely difficult to understand specifics of the proposal or to see concrete progress, based on publicly available resources.The best place I&#39;ve found is Ruben Verborgh&#39;s blog (he&#39;s a researcher who&#39;s affiliated with Solid). For example here&#39;s a nice post which goes into more detail on the ideas behind Solid:https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-f...2) In terms of applications, I&#39;d personally like to see more of a focus on productivity applications, rather than so much focus on social media. Better interop between cloud SaaS apps would be valuable to businesses and professionals, and would sidestep many thorny challenges like decentralized moderation.As a concrete starting point: what if I could store my Google Docs text files on my own storage layer, and edit them in realtime using a variety of editor apps? This would resemble my ability to edit a .txt file on my computer in vim or TextEdit, but would port that metaphor to the world of modern online collaboration.Here&#39;s a short Twitter thread I wrote on this topic:https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/13552551626260684823) I&#39;m very curious to see more incremental paths from the current web to a decentralized approach. For example, what if we could start annotating existing websites with private data and sharing those annotations P2P, rather than starting over from scratch?I&#39;ve explored this a bit with my Wildcard project, where users can store annotations in a &#34;spreadsheet&#34; that is linked to a web page:https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every now and then this gets shared again and every time I am struck by what a terrible job the front page does of explaining what Solid is and why anyone would want to use it. Like, okay, yeah, &#34;control my own data&#34; is a nice pitch in this day and age I guess, but... what can I do with it? &#34;Any kind of data can be stored in a Solid pod, including normal files like you might store in Google Drive or Dropbox&#34; - that sounds kinda useful, where&#39;s the link to SolidFile? Is there even a SolidFile app or is that just a thing someone could make with this protocol?Hell, where&#39;s the front page link to check out the list of any apps using Solid? It&#39;s like two or three random clicks to find this page (https://solidproject.org/apps) if you are curious, and it&#39;s super uninspiring - why does one of the apps in the &#34;Showcase&#34; section at the top not even have a description?Solid always just feels like a solution looking for a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post[0] by Ruben Verborgh helped me understand the problem Solid is trying to solve:&gt; In December 2019, Google and Facebook proudly announced a major milestone, which was echoed in news media all around the world: it is now possible to copy a picture from Facebook to Google Photos. This news came in mere months after we celebrated the 50th anniversary of another technological feat: the moon landing of 20 July 1969, when millions of households witnessed Neil Armstrong take a giant leap for mankind.&gt; So let me get this straight: two of the largest tech companies in history make headlines because in 2019, they move a single photo over the whopping distance of 11 km it takes from the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park to the Googleplex in Mountain View, whereas in 1969, we sent live video signals from 380,000 km away on the actual moon?&gt; If those two companies, both widely hailed as pinnacles of technology, genuinely consider this to be innovation they are proud of, the only logical conclusion is that data-driven innovation today is fundamentally broken.&gt; The problem is widespread and not limited to technology or social media. Any sector that requires personal data to deliver services, from retail over insurance to health, suffers from the damaging effects of siloization. Companies increasingly need more access to data, but they won’t get there if they keep on collecting that data themselves.[...]0. https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2020/12/07/a-data-ecosystem-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is mostly nonsense. There is nothing wrong with there being more shares short than shares outstanding. It just seems problematic, until you think it through.Person A has 1 share of company Y. Person B borrows 1 share of company Y from person A, and then sells it into the market. This is called a short sale. But person B just sold their borrowed share. Now that share is owned by person C. Person C can now lend it back out to person D, or to person B again, and the process can repeat infinitely. The idea that short interest is constrained by shares outstanding is just a fundamental misunderstanding of how the short market works.Shorting behaves the same way that fractional reserve banking does, and there is a &#39;money multiplier&#39; like leverage effect in the process. There is nothing nefarious about this, and it certainly isn&#39;t &#39;countfeiting&#39;. Short sellers provide an important service to capital markets, maybe the most important service: they help to identify mismanaged or fraudulent companies. The idea that attacking short sellers is attacking wall street is completely backwards. Most of Wall Street hates short sellers, because they drive down the prices of companies and confidence in markets (in the short run, in the long run, they increase it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, it seems like none of the top commenters here have put in at least minimal effort to read and understand this.The author does not complain about short sellers per se or about the fact that more than 100% of a stock&#39;s float can be shorted. That is all nice and fine. Instead what the author does complain about is that fact that the (supposedly regulated) mechanisms for shorting a stock are fraught with loopholes and exceptions that make it possible for brokers and the DTC to create stocks &#34;out of thin air&#34; for the short sellers and never neutralize. This dilutes the company&#39;s stock in the process and thereby damages the company&#39;s shareholders.It is an issue that, if true, should absolutely be brought to public and regulator&#39;s attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems to be really upset about this, but I don&#39;t understand why. Nothing they are describing, if you ignore histrionic language like &#34;counterfeiting&#34;, seems especially nefarious. Maybe I am misunderstanding. Basically, a short is when A borrows from B a share of corporation C with the promise to return a share of corporation C at a later time, plus some cash interest. A naked short is where instead B gives cash equal to the value of a share of corporation C minus some interest to A, with the promise that at a later time A will deliver a share of corporation C to B. The second activity seems functionally equivalent to the first, and I don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m supposed to be outraged by either."</p>

Fun fact (though probably not as surprising to an HN crowd as it is to most people I tell this to), VLC can also be used to convert media to different formats, AND works as a quick ad-hoc media server if you want to display something on a TV.  This can be really handy if you have a video file in a weird format and want a way to quickly watch it on a device that doesn&#39;t support weird formats.I think I&#39;m going to donate.  Keep up the good work folks!"</p>

Once you installed videolan you were ready for all media formats.
It was so tiresome to tell the people you convinced to try Linux that no, by default they couldn&#39;t play their media, that they needed gstreamer this and that.
You made the transition to Linux so much easier to lots of people by offering a simple to use very feature rich application everyone needs and uses.Thank you!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh my god, they don&#39;t even bother implementing the app any more...It reminds me of my first App Store experience. I made an app that was somewhat successful (about 2000€ a month, enough to pay for a students living expenses).Within short time, a chinese speaking developer cloned it. They copied the icon (slighlty different color), they copied the UI, they even copied all the text in the dialog boxes. They released the app with a slightly different name.I contacted Apple to complain about the obvious copyright infringement, but they only forwarded my complaint to the developer. Interestingly enough, the developer actually replied to me. They sent an email threating legal action. I asked them to at least change the icon, and they did. But until today, the rest of the cloned app is still on the app store and competes with my app.It&#39;s not comparable to your case, since in my case the competitor wasn&#39;t a scammer, just someone with a very lose interpretation of intellectual property.But it makes me feel that Apple really doesn&#39;t give a shit what goes on in their store, as long as they make their 30%. (or 15% from small fish like me now)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, in situations like this the best way is to:1. Register your videos and images with the USCO. It&#39;ll cost &lt;$100.2. You can now file DMCA takedowns. Send one to Apple with the USCO registration ID and a copy of the image and a link to the app in question.3. Apple will either immediately remove that fake app, or be liable for up to $350k in punitive damages for wilful infringement and lose all DMCA protection.4. If Apple didn&#39;t react a week later, approach a lawyer. They&#39;ll likely be willing to work purely for 50% commission, because it&#39;ll be a slam dunk in court.5. Repeat the same with Facebook / Youtube if they advertise there with your images or videos. Take Screenshots and write down the url and date and time.Of course, one would hope that Apple will do the right thing, but it&#39;s also reasonably easy to force their hand.That said, I don&#39;t know anyone for whom app development worked out financially if you fairly price your own labor. So maybe just stay away from cheap apps in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m dumbfounded at Google&#39;s lack of planning on this. I tried Stadia, and they had (have?) so few games that they seem to have neither search nor pagination on the list that you can play. None of the games are ones that I care about.It feels like they could have—at the cost of short-term profit and pride—partnered with Valve and shipped something mind-blowing. But instead we&#39;re left with a bunch of AAA games that feel half-baked (Hitman crashes on first boot and complains about a lack of a controller) and a bunch of indie games that feel like a sad attempt to squeeze a few extra bucks out of a middling title (the Hello Neighbor hide and seek game) and titles released half a decade ago (superhot).Minecraft is on every console imaginable—except Stadia. What about Roblox? Fortnite? Factorio? Among Us? Any Sid Meier&#39;s game? Any Paradox game? Every genre of game that I actually put time into is completely absent on their platform. Every game from the top 10 (perhaps 20 or more?) on Twitch right now is absent on Stadia. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, but whatever it is, it&#39;s wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know Google/Stadia recently partnered with LG to bundle the Stadia app with LG TVs, but I wonder why Google doesn&#39;t do this with every TV manufacturers (save Sony.)If I were Stadia&#39;s marketing chief, I&#39;d1. Bribe the TV manufacturers to include the Stadia app2. Advertise that the TV includes _a game console_ during TV commercials.3. Allow the TV users to pay a bit extra ($20?) to buy a basic game controller.4. Have all the store demo units to auto stream Stadia playing video games and explicitly explain you don&#39;t need a xbox/playstation to play these games.5. Buy out Witcher 3/Call of Duty 4/Project Cars 2/other older games and make them free for TVs with Stadia bundles.Most smart TVs these days are more than fast enough to stream HD broadcast. I don&#39;t understand why Google doesn&#39;t push this.Fiddling with my phone to play Stadia on my TV is pretty crumple some. It&#39;s just too much work for normal folks. People just want to turn on the TV and start playing.Edit: I guess monopolistic abuse is a concern. However Sony and MS have their own streaming services. Google can just advertise &#39;play games with Stadia and Playstation Now and Xbox Cloud on your TV!&#39; I am 100% if players switch to playing games on TV without game consoles, it hurts MS/Sony a lot more than to Google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is totally the right move.  I am a (very happy) user of Stadia. If you haven&#39;t tried it, you really should...it&#39;s an amazing piece of tech. I can find myself with 20-30 minutes worth of downtime during the day, fire up Cyberpunk 2077 or Hitman or Assassin&#39;s Creed in moments from my browser *on a macbook* and play at high settings with no noticeable lag.Obviously you need a strong, steady internet connection for Stadia to shine, but I&#39;d guess that the HN crowd skews towards that.If you&#39;re an old gamer who wants to play newer games but doesn&#39;t have a ton of time and don&#39;t want to drop $1k+ on a gaming rig, check out Stadia.The game library does leave a lot to be desired, no question about that. But this decision seems to be the right move to mitigate that by giving developers better access to getting their games on Stadia rather than Google trying to be both the platform and the content."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huge FastAPI fan here.I use it for my projects (and one project even makes enough revenue that I sponsor Sebastián’s work through GitHub sponsors at $250/mo) and it for sure has increased my development velocity.It’s an absolute joy to work with. The automated interactive docs are great for iteration. Type hints as first class citizens is an awesome developer experience that I didn’t think I wanted.Using the auto generated OpenAPI you can even generate client side code and typings to interact with your API.It feels like flask but with lots of quality of life improvements.[1] https://www.vim.so"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FAST Api is a nice library, but it uses code-based api specifications. It&#39;s generates the spec from code. So you need to write your API code by hand first, and do serialization manually...This is an important distinction and might not be what you want.Using spec first API design makes more sense IMHO.
You first spec your API (Either in OpenAPI or GRPC or whatever Interface Definition Language you use). This allows Backend and Frontend developers to change the API definition.From there you generate all type-save model objects, client and server stubs, and fill in the implementation with full type hinting.At my current company, we wrote OpenAPI specs first, no need to know Python. And use https://openapi-generator.tech/ to generate both the Python server, python client and typescript client. We&#39;re looking into generate Kotlin and Swift clients too...I&#39;m a big proponent of spec first API design. It&#39;s much cheaper to agree on a spec first before you start coding.But it depends on what you are doing.Personally I like GRPC best, since the code generators are top notch.Very good article on this principle:https://medium.com/apis-and-digital-transformation/openapi-a...First, stop writing interface code for your APIs by hand.
Second, stop writing interface code for your APIs by hand.
Third, stop writing interface code for your APIs by hand.We&#39;re living in 2021... Every time I see somebody manually mapping an objects to a JSON dictionary I&#39;m crying in the inside. It&#39;s like writing machine code by hand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, how has nobody noticed this before? This looks seriously rotten:&gt; Michigan-based entrepreneur Robert Simpson decided to see what would happen if he bought the entire stock of one company. Using a single broker, within a couple of days Simpson had paid a little over $5,000 for 1,285,050 shares in OTC bulletin board property-development company Global Links. According to Simpson, these shares were delivered into his account shortly afterwards. Yet the following day 37,044,500 Global Links shares were traded on the bulletin board. The next day, 22,471,000 shares were traded. On neither day had Simpson traded a single Global Link share, he insists. And events surrounding Simpson&#39;s investments became yet more confusing. Global Links had only ever issued 1,158,064 shares. Simpson had managed to acquire 126,986 shares that did not exist. How he had managed to be sold more shares than were in issuance is exactly the question Simpson hoped his foray would raise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recent events have a lot of people confusing high short interest with naked shorting.A stock can have short interest greater than 100% without any naked shorting.How is this possible? The textbook definition of a &#34;short sale&#34; is that someone borrows stock and then, literally, sells it short. The buyer of the stock is free and clear to do whatever they want with the stock, including re-lend it for another short sale. Wikipedia has a good primer on how this works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)This has created a lot of confusion on WallstreetBets, where many participants have come to believe that Gamestop&#39;s short interest of 113% means that there are 13% more shares shorted than long positions to cover. It&#39;s not true, though, because the long interest is always greater than the short interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Summary:Every so often, someone gets very steamed about short selling, often with no real reason. Back in 2005, someone got very steamed about short selling, and then got a journalist to write a somewhat confused article about it. It&#39;s not clear anything was actually wrong then, but in any case, the rules have been changed a few times since then, so there doesn&#39;t seem to be any obvious relevance to current times.It&#39;s also worth noting that there&#39;s no real theoretical basis for why naked short selling would be harmful, no real empirical evidence showing it is harmful, no general laws against it, and the structure of the market allows and expects it to take place in some specific cases. If your mental model is that the stock market is a tool to allow people to trade a fixed number of concrete objects back and forth, this probably seems odd, but since that&#39;s not really a good model of how the stock market works or is intended to work, it&#39;s not clear that means much."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary: if you have an index on a column which is mostly NULL, consider using a partial index covering only the records where it&#39;s non-NULL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Partial indexes are amazing but you have to keep in mind some pecularities.If your query doesn&#39;t contain a proper match with the WHERE clause of the index - the index will not be used. It is easy to forget about it or to get it wrong in subtle ways. Here is an example from work.There was an event tracing structure which contained the event severity_id. Id values 0-6 inclusive are user facing events. Severity 7 and up is debug events. In practice all debug events were 7 and there were no other values above 7. This table had a partial index with WHERE severity_id &lt; 7.
I tracked down a performance regression, when an ORM (due to programmer error) generated WHERE severity_id != 7. The database is obviously not able to tell that there will never be any values above 7 so the index was not used slowing down event handling. Turning the query to match &lt; 7 fixes the problem. The database might also not be able to infer that the index can be indeed used, for example when prepared statements are involved WHERE severity_id &lt; ?. The database will not be able to tell that all bindings of ? will satisfy &lt; 7 so will not use the index (unless you are running PG 12, then that might depend on the setting of plan_cache_mode[1] but I have not tested that yet).Another thing is that HOT updates in PostgreSQL can&#39;t be performed if the updated field is indexed but that also includes being part of a WHERE clause in a partial index. So you could have a site like HN and think that it would be nice to index stories WHERE vote &gt; 100 to quickly find more popular stories. That index however would nullify the possiblity of a hot update when the vote tally would be updated. Again, not a problem but you need to know the possible drawbacks.That said, they are great when used for the right purpose. Kudos to the author for a nice article![1] - https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/plan_cache_mode/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Partial indexes can flip query plans if the covered part becomes so small that it won&#39;t be represented when sampled by the stats collector. The planner could then decide that the index scan isn&#39;t worth it and could try an alternative less efficient index if one exists."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; They already host source code of millions of apps. Release integration should be trivial to implement.Release integration is trivial for anyone. It&#39;s the easiest and most irrelevant part of the app stores.&gt; Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during youtube-dl debacle.And controversial on others, like shutting down Popcorn Time&#39;s repository. As any other, they&#39;ll listen if there&#39;s enough outcry.&gt; Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.This is situational and opportunistic. It can change any day. In fact, managing an important app store is exactly one way to re-(un)-balance this relationship.&gt; They could finally give the desktop the app store it deservesMicrosoft won&#39;t have GitHub compete with the Microsoft Store and its newer efforts like winget. It would unermine their unifying vision that has been in the works for years for no benefit.&gt; This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.Sure, lets pipe user feedback directly into GitHub issues. Good luck with that if you have a hundred issues a day.I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single angle that would paint this as a good idea. Phone manufacturers like Samsung are in a much much better position to try. And indeed they have been trying an failing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like a great way to create incentives that undermine githubs mission while simultaneously taking a huge amount of developer resources for a product that will have niche interest at best.Building app stores is hard. Moderating app stores is hard. Both are significantly different from running GitHub.While I appreciate the author&#39;s intent here, this just doesn&#39;t feel like it was deeply thought out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Or we could just stop using app stores.Honestly, I&#39;ve yet to find an argument for the existence of an app store that holds water. Let people install what they want. Provide reasonable paths to update and upgrade and cut out the middle layer.The layer of control that Google and Apple exert over people is anti-competitive. But the answer isn&#39;t competing app stores. I don&#39;t need someone to tell me what I can or can&#39;t install on the operating system on my device."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone assuming a conspiracy theory needs to read this.Keep in mind that Robinhood also gives everyone a margin account by default. They also let people invest on margin before their inbound bank transfers arrive (Robinhood Instant). The influx of new traders sending money to Robinhood or selling other stocks to buy GME quickly drained their credit lines, reducing the capital they had available for collateral.Keep in mind that when someone sells a different stock to buy GME in the same day, they&#39;re buying GME on margin. Stock trades don&#39;t settle until T+2, so any new purchases using those proceeds are done on margin.This was a capital crunch at Robinhood due to an unexpected herd of new traders all looking to do the same thing in unison. It violated the assumptions of their business model, and the only way to keep the platform from grinding to insolvency (or violating regulations) was to slow down the unexpected event by slowing meme stock purchases.Is it really so hard to believe that such an unprecedented mass movement would break the underlying business assumptions of a pre-IPO startup that was heavily dependent on their credit lines?The biggest problem is Robinhood&#39;s poor messaging. It&#39;s clear their highest priority was to avoid admission that they were running out of money. They didn&#39;t want to trigger a bank run or shake the confidence of their newly acquired users, so they tried to obscure the message as much as possible. As a result, the popular narrative assumed some sort of evil conspiracy theory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">",,Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. &#39;&#39;This sounds like a liquidity issue, but Robinhood&#39;s CEO said in the interview that there was no liquidity issue.The why doesn&#39;t matter at this point because Robinhood CEO was caught lying by contradicting himself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar explanation was posted Jan 28 on twitter by Silent Cal[1]. This article and the twitter thread do paint a very plausible explanation. And is easy to accept.OTOH, a potentially far more nefarious, yet plausible, underlying motive was posted on /r/wsb today [2] that links GME to counterfeiting shorts.Given Steve Cohen&#39;s numerous scandals through the years as detailed on wikipedia [3], needing to cover up for counterfeiting shorts also seems like a plausible explanation.I hope the finance committee investigations AOC called for take place and consider both points.* - Not invested in GME, and prohibited from doing so by my employer.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I realize this is a site about the past, but I really hope this is the future. I want an internet of specialty sites, browsable curations, diversity of offering, freedom of choice, and full of the quirky/unusual. It might have to do with growing up in the 90s and experiencing that kind of world wide web, w/o walled gardens.Several years back, perhaps even via an HN post or comment, I came across a blog, hosted on a university network (IIRC, perhaps related to media studies). The page consisted of a group of possibly graduate students contributing some of the weirdest and most obscure media I&#39;ve ever seen online. Nothing obscene and nothing seemingly new/current, so it was rather hipster in that sense, but I kick myself for not having saved the URL.Nothing says I need to use walled gardens or get my news from the big networks, but I often feel I&#39;m being pointed that way. In the end, I just want something different than what&#39;s usually being served up.(It doesn&#39;t escape me that this 90&#39;s TV site is full of walled garden/big network type content of the time)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried polyphasic sleeping for a while when I worked at an IBank. I remember it as one of the most productive periods of my life but it was incredibly anti social and got the strangest looks from management.I&#39;d do 35 minute naps with an alarm at 0430, 0830, 1230, 1630, and without an alarm at 2030 and 0030 (on the basis that I thought my body would sleep through if I was &#34;doing any damage&#34;).It made going out at the weekends or playing poker in a casino incredibly difficult so after 3 weeks I had to pack it in.I was lucky to live a 5 minute, folding, bicycle ride from the office but I also had a little card I&#39;d leave on my desk for the corner that said, &#34;I have not collapsed I&#39;m having a nap.&#34;The one thing I&#39;ve kept from those days is that I still wear a sleep mask to bed."</p>

I figure that is made up of 90 mins of one sleep cycle, and some time either side for falling asleep and waking.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycleAll made possible by pandemic working from home."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to me that this delineates between facts and personal experience as if personal experience doesn&#39;t occupy the same space as facts. Perhaps a more useful way to think about people&#39;s relation to truth is one of proximity. For a given individual, their personal experience is entirely factual, and because it is also most proximate to them, it is weighted the most highly. Intuitively, I think we understand this, so we tend to weight other people&#39;s experiences similarly, knowing that those are as proximate to them as our experiences are to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key point:&#34;The problem is that facts—at least today—are themselves subject to doubt, especially when they conflict with our political beliefs (21). In the past decades, America has seen a decentralization of news and information (22) that has allowed people to gather their “own facts” (i.e., alternative facts; ref. 23). Most recently, claims of “fake news” allow people to distrust any information that fails to align with their political beliefs (24, 25) and to trust fake news that aligns with their beliefs (26).&#34;This is the epistemic crisis we&#39;re currently facing. Up until about the late 70s we had 3 news networks that were all pretty much middle of the road politically. Newspapers could have more of a discernible political leaning, but even there most of the mainstream ones we&#39;re pretty centrist. People who hewed to an extreme political position in either direction were ostracized and thus had a very small audience. We had more of a common narrative which is now gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A personal experience is a fact. It is a fact we can be pretty sure of, and we know the context of that fact. Obviously, once we extrapolate from that experienced fact, it becomes bias.A fact that is not a personal experience is difficult to trust. Even if I trust the source of that fact, I am often not sure if I understand the fact properly. Anyone who has ever tried to understand a math theorem might relate.It is entirely rational to trust more in your personal bias. In fact, I would argue that the only way to trust a fact is to make it somehow into something that you can personally experience. For example, to understand a math theorem, it helps to look at lots of different kinds of examples where it holds (and where it doesn&#39;t)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe this kind of thing is a big contributor to Amazon&#39;s hegemony in online shopping. I&#39;m reluctant to order from other sites because there&#39;s a whole new set of dark patterns I may fall victim to. At least I&#39;m familiar enough with Amazon to know I&#39;m not getting charged for things I didn&#39;t intend to order, the low stock warnings are somewhat legitimate, etc. I&#39;m not saying Amazon doesn&#39;t have its own issues, but at least it&#39;s a known quantity.If it weren&#39;t for Amazon&#39;s dominance, other sites would be able to compete without resorting to these dark patterns, so this is a self-perpetuating cycle: people only shop on Amazon -&gt; the only other sites that can survive are the ones that engage in deception -&gt; trust in non-Amazon shopping sites decreases -&gt; people only shop on Amazon -&gt; ...I don&#39;t mean to cast these scammy shopping websites as victims. My concern is more about how the legitimate sites that could exist don&#39;t because they&#39;re crowded out by Amazon (and other big players like Walmart) and the scammy shopping sites this article discusses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting - I feel like the site should separate dark patterns that add information from ones that lie or obfuscate. In my experience, consumers feel differently about these categories.I&#39;ve sat in on a few dozen user research sessions for ecommerce. This was qualitative research that included their general shopping habits, and additionally testing new features. The most interesting thing that I learned is that consumers (a) are generally pretty aware of when they&#39;re being pressured, and (b) are fine if it&#39;s transparent and accurate.A classic example of this were low-stock notifications. The shoppers were generally okay with being told that something was low stock if that was really true. Many people could name specific items they lost because they were sold out. Some could also name instances of when they had bought something &#34;1 item remaining&#34; and seen it on sale the next day. They preferred having the information because it helped them make an informed decision. It turns out that lots of people browse the same items for a while, and use sales or almost-out-of-stock as a &#34;now or never&#34; moment.The most interesting user session I ever sat in on was for a countdown timer for a sale ending. The designer refused to design it at first, and then was like, &#34;fine, I&#39;m going to design the hell out of this and then show you in user research that nobody wants this.&#34; And then she showed it to 5 people in user research, who were generally okay with it on the condition that it counted down to the actual sale ending. Some said they actually liked knowing, because when they&#39;re just looking on their phones they might not be in a good position to buy it, and want to know how much time they have later to get it. They said that they&#39;ll often refresh the page to see if the timer resets, because if it starts ticking from the same time, they feel like the site is just scammy and they&#39;ll leave.Anyways, I&#39;m not trying to defend lots of these patterns. Most of them are clearly wrong, and the ones that I mentioned above can also be used to lie and deceive. But I wouldn&#39;t put them all together - in my experience, consumers generally want accurate information even if they&#39;re aware that the company is doing it to pressure them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; The solution to this problem: “uniwidth” typefaces, sometimes also called “equal-width”, “duplexed” or “multiplexed” typefaces. And no, I am not talking about monospaced fonts here.I&#39;m not into web design but I think the core problem here is lack of accepted terminology and even awareness that this type of font is a thing.The article certainly brings awareness to something I didn&#39;t know is a thing but seems very useful.My mind wants to say &#34;weight invariant&#34; or &#34;style invariant&#34; but those suggest the thing doesnt look any different rather than just the size not changing with other characteristics.It&#39;s probably obvious that I don&#39;t like &#34;uniwidth&#34;, but at the moment I can&#39;t think of anything better that isn&#39;t super wordy, like &#34;font with style invariant width&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not a monospaced font used for code:&gt; also called non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal spaceinstead, it preserves the width if you apply a weight like BOLD:&gt; Uniwidth typefaces, on the other hand, are proportionally-spaced typefaces, but every character occupies the same space across different cuts or weights.This allows visual cues other than color in interactive text such as the :hover CSS pseudo-class."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ahh, very satisfying to learn the name of this property.It’s especially important in data tables when coupled with tabular numbers (essentially mono spaced numbers) so you can e.g. bold a cell without having the thousands or decimal separators get out of alignment in a column of numbers. Spreadsheet programs use fonts with this property."</p>
