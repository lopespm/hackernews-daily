								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of something.I used to work with a senior guy who went freelance and then bunched together with several other freelancers, also seniors, to form... &#34;an operation&#34;. The MO was that one of them would go and interview for a permanent job, impress the heck out of everyone and then say &#34;there&#39;s more like me, be happy to help you out, but on a contract basis and as a group.&#34; They were basically bait-n-switching them to outsource parts of their development and in some cases it worked, because their fees were very reasonable. And the fees were reasonable because they did very little of the actual work themselves and instead re-outsourced it to some Ukranain dudes.Looked fishy as fuck and I&#39;m not sure how it ended because I felt out of touch with the guy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of this threat model:Long term moles at a company, able to climb high and perform well due to remote work which enables:- never really meeting the mole- the “mole” is a superstar because they have a team of corporate raider-employed 10x’ers evaluating and executing everything that this mole does at work. The mole’s code is written by 3x MIT grads hot swapping on the keyboard. The mole’s biz ideas come from a few HBS grads. And so on.Productivity, business intuition, and engineering talent is off the charts for this mole. It rises far enough in the hierarchy such that it maneuvers the company towards favorable action for that corporate raider. Every idea the mole suggests, the corporate raider works in the background to enable via favorable market conditions.  Whoever is the public face of the mole’a reputation might be in flames if found out, but what’s that vs netting 3% of a corporate buyout valuation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the implication that there&#39;s this shadow company, Fronk. Seemingly defunct, they&#39;re actually thriving secretly behind the facade of a failed startup.Every marketing manager has engaged them privately to boost their numbers. Every developer secretly works for them on the side.But no one anywhere ever talks about it until one day a former consultant notices an expired NDA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just to throw it out there, I graduated during the pandemic, and it was so frustrating not only the amount of cheating that occurred, which meant that if you didn&#39;t cheat you fell behind; but also how professors responded. I had a few professors who made exams ridiculously hard with strict time limits, just because they expected people to cheat. So the exams were designed in a way they cheating was the only way to get through it, which just encouraged more people to cheat. Not to say every person cheated, or every professor designed tests to be harder, but both groups were larger than you&#39;d expect.The good news is I think that with classes being in person again things will go relatively back to normal. Honestly I don&#39;t think I can fault students who cheated during the pandemic, it was just so abnormal that most people did whatever they had to to cope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We employed the method of mixing the order of questions, not giving question titles, and having a pool of subtly different questions (a negation or a different constant slipped in) in order to vastly increase the amount of necessary communication to collaborate.We had the students turn on their webcams just to discourage them sitting in the same room, which basically would negate our former efforts. Neither did we flag any behavior nor did we record anything or used some automatic software.I believe that worked quite nicely. A few cheaters were easily spotted when they had the wrong constants in their answer.I understand that not every course and exam style is suitable for that. But for our databases course, it was applicable.I think that this was not much more invasive than a traditional exam. Anything more, like watching the screen, or having audio, would make me feel uncomfortable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine a business that sells deliverable medical testing kits. This business is the best at what they do; they sell more kits than any other organization, they cost less, they&#39;re delivered faster, and are superior in any way, shape, KPI, or form imaginable to traditional alternatives. The only issue being that each kit is in fact a bloodletting kit, and their intended use is to inform you which of your four humours is out of balance.I&#39;m of the opinion that e-proctoring, whatever its privacy concerns, is fundamentally an exercise in &#34;doing the wrong thing faster&#34;. Our exams are a poor reflection of student ability. Our exams have no bearing on actual proficiency in the subject matter. Our exams are ineffectual at catching cheaters. Leaving aside any discussion of privacy, e-proctoring (and traditional proctoring) fails to accomplish its fundamental goals.To automate these exams, to make them ever-more scalable and easier to distribute, is not a victory. We&#39;ve merely perpetuated a flawed system.If we want a meaningful assessment of student ability then we need to use better methods. Dethrone exams from our curriculum. Leverage project-based assessments. Use oral exams where feasible. Replace the infinitely looping lecture halls with recorded videos and open-source textbooks. Use the recovered instructor time for something meaningful. This is not a Gordian knot. It can be solved with a little courage and a little pragmatism."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course he would. He was a regular hacker. If you&#39;ve read Steve Jobs&#39; biographies they all describe Woz wanting to keep things open and hackable and Jobs pushing through for the vertical integration they have now. Woz made the altruistic decision most of us would&#39;ve &#34;preferred&#34; but Jobs made the decision to create the most valuable company in the world instead. Hard to say who was right, really."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Woz also got into hacking about computers at an ideal time. Not long before then it would have been impossible to build a sophisticated computer in your garage. Years later, miniaturization has continued to progress and many things that were once relatively simple to replace have become much harder.When most parts on a computer were through-hole components and relatively large integrated circuits that could easily be hand soldered, the skill required to participate in the repair process was much lower. Today, even relatively open hardware like a desktop PC has a ton of added complexity that would make people far less likely to ever want to attempt a repair on their own. While I&#39;ve reflowed solder on a faulty GPU in the oven before, that&#39;s not exactly a good idea. A person is usually going to replace the things that have been component-ized like the RAM, GPU, SSD, motherboard, etc. rather than try to actually repair them.Granted, when a component like that breaks on a PC you can just pop it open and replace it, rather than having to find a specialist to repair a laptop or phone where all the parts are glued in or soldered. While I can sympathize with people that do want that (there are projects out there trying to bring products in this category to market), I&#39;m personally okay with that being the niche that it is. Most people didn&#39;t hack their computers back then and to this day most people don&#39;t hack on their computers.There probably should be components available for experts like Louis Rossman who can replace these parts. There probably should be schematics available so they can more easily make these repairs and they can have businesses like his who can specialize in doing these sorts of repairs (they already do exist, clearly). Companies like Apple absolutely should not be using any sort of DRM to prevent use of third party hardware components in repairs. Going out of your way to make your devices difficult to repair is unethical. But I think we&#39;re well past the point that someone without specialized skills should be able to expect to repair any device that they purchase."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The original article presents her in a very bright light, as a smart and brave woman who is engaged in a legal battle against large greedy corporations. And I find the photo quite cool.I think she is just overly susceptible, and maybe a little bit paranoid (which is understandable for a person with enemies as powerful as hers).This reminds me of the time when a russian entomologist named a new wasp species he discovered after her in her honor, and she took offense because the wasp was a parasite species, and blocked sci-hub in Russia for a few days in retaliation !edit: sci-hub was blocked only a few days, not months, my memory failed me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked as a researcher all my life in academia and the industry, I can only support Sci-Hub. Publishing as it works currently is an incredibly time consuming and expensive process funneling tremendous amounts of tax money into the pocḱets of publishers.To some extent the whole situation reminds me of the video and music content piracy era in the early 2000s. I hope there will be an equivalent of Apple Music/Spotify/Netflix for scientific papers in the near future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So no new articles have been uploaded this year.While I have relatively good access options through my university, roughly half of the publications appearing in my Google Scholar alerts are unaccessible. As they are also in fields were use of preprint services isn&#39;t common, it really interferes with me being up to date with ongoing research.As the use of sci-hub is so common, I wonder about the wider implications of the newest articles being inaccessible. Could bibliometric methods be used to quantify this? Missed citations? Less citations for articles published in more obscure journals?Interesting that no new solutions have come out yet. I&#39;m seeing people getting back to use #ICanHazPDF - not the best way to conduct research when an article is often just a gateway to more finding more relevant articles to read."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think its too easy to get a patent, and that leads to a great proliferation of patents that serve little purpose but to slow innovation.I worked at a patent law firm about 15 years ago in my wild youth. I’ll never forget hearing an attorney explain that getting a patent is basically bullying the examiner, and if that doesn’t work, appealing repeatedly until it’s eventually accepted.Are there statistics of the number of patent applications rejected? Even better, I would love to see the number of patent applications filed by the Apple computer corporation, and how many were accepted, and how many were rejected.Edit: Autocorrect error."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sixteen years ago, I had the idea for headlights aimed by GPS and started to make some prototypes. Then I read a patent that was basically &#34;a plurality of inputs + processor -&gt; headlight aiming&#34; that covered everything imaginable. I knew the patent wouldn&#39;t hold up in court, but I wouldn&#39;t have the money to fight it.More recently, I&#39;ve been working on a self-driving wheelchair. It&#39;s a fairly obvious straight line from self-driving car to self-driving wheelchair, but someone&#39;s gone out and patented it.  I still don&#39;t have the money to fight it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the OP:&gt;&gt; The study particularly wants to find examples of where a patent has been denied in the US but accepted in other jurisdictions, which will be a key area for European electronics companies.The question at hand does not seem to be what the title of the OP indicates, but rather about patent applications denied in the US but approved elsewhere.  Looking briefly at [1] too is hinting that the interest may rather be to relax the patent eligibility criteria so that more of patent applications in the US are approved.  Note:  IANAL.---[1] https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/09/2021-14...Excerpts:  &#34;Last year, after a split panel decision concluding that a method for manufacturing drive shafts was patent ineligible, ... The questions presented in the petition are: (1) What is the appropriate standard for determining whether a claim is directed to a patent-ineligible concept under step one of the Alice two-step framework?; and (2) Is patent eligibility a question of law for the court or a question of fact for the jury? ... The Senators indicated a particular interest in learning how the current jurisprudence has adversely impacted investment and innovation in critical technologies like quantum computing, artificial intelligence,[6] precision medicine, diagnostic methods, and pharmaceutical treatments.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The big question here is how Senior Google executive Urs Hölzle managed to get a &#34;remote work visa&#34; from the government of New Zealand. It reminds me of the &#34;special treatment&#34; that Peter Thiel got, where he got New Zealand citizenship after spending only 12 days in New Zealand [1].It is almost non-existent in the western world to be able to get a remote-work visa (minus Croatia and Czech Republic--both countries are part of the European Union and therefore become &#34;westernized&#34; quickly after accession).Yes, you can technically get _self-employment_, non-remote work visas in many European Union countries. But, the point and intent of such visas is that you contribute to their economy, assimilate, learn the local language, and eventually become a functioning contributing citizen in their society.The hypocrisy of the situation around remote work makes me angry, as I am disabled and I require remote work as an accommodation. I have 2 rare immune-mediated neurological diseases affecting my peripheral nervous system, plus type 1 diabetes (autoimmune and insulin-dependent).I should also point out something else unfair. I am a dual US|EU (Croatian) citizen who works part-time remotely as a contractor for a US-based company in Croatia, while studying for her masters degree in electrical engineering full time. Because I am an EU citizen, I can work in 30+ countries remotely, outside of the United States, while essentially getting paid more (compared to the locals and most other European Union citizens) for just having US citizenship and related credentials. I basically live like a queen in Croatia.[1] https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/new-zealand-ga..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in this guy&#39;s org as an L5 &amp; L6.  Opposition to remote work is the primary reason I left Google in 2015.Its also one of the reasons we lost out on a number of good internal transfers.  We had one amazing guy.  World famous, luminary in his field, who lived in Livermore who had a deal to WFH 2-3 days a week who turned down a job in our org because he would have lost that deal &amp; would have had to commute from Livermore every day.EDIT: To be clear, the opposition to remote work that impacted me came from the VP immediately above me.  It is certainly possible that other forks on the org chart under different VPs were different.  I never specifically talked to this person and got his views on remote work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some context, here&#39;s the current situation for New Zealand citizens attempting to enter New Zealand (according to newspapers -- I&#39;m not from there):&gt;&#34;The demand is so high, and the supply so scarce, that any rooms that become available disappear within seconds. Dates are released completely randomly and can appear any time of the day or night, and there&#39;s no queue.&#34;&gt;&#34;It makes it close to impossible for the average New Zealander to get home,&#34; said Chris Ruscoe, currently in Tennessee, about the high demand and the software enabling people to secure rooms so quickly.&#34;&gt;&#34;The difficulty and frustration and desperation that these folks are feeling, including me - who tried for three weeks, 18-plus hours a day and got nowhere.&#34;https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/446516/tech-savvy-kiwis-...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never understood the secretive nature of these Amazon &#34;devplan&#34; / &#34;FOCUS&#34; lists. If an employee has a performance issue, they should know. Period. If they are on a formal list, they should know that too.The only &#34;positive&#34; here is that it can affect the individual&#39;s moral to know you are not meeting expectations - but that has to be communicated regardless. If it&#39;s understood it has to be communicated and there is a list specifically including the individual, it&#39;s up to the company to manage that communication in a supportive manner.And the consequences of this secretive list are a culture of fear and uncertainty and doubt. Especially with the harsh consequences such as - if you leave while on this secretive list (which you cannot even know you are on) - you are ineligible for rehire.The solution is not to maintain a secretive list of employees who have performance issues - it is to be fully transparent about those performance issues and destigmatize being included in this nebulous secretive list in the first place - through a culture of support and shared success.Honestly it boggles my mind how Amazon managers accept this status quo at the scale that Amazon operates. It is so on it&#39;s face a recipe for having a toxic culture which breeds stress, doubt, and only serves to reinforce poor performance outcomes.Out of all the things I&#39;ve heard about Amazon culture for its software organization - this single thing (secretive lists of employees with performance issues with &#34;never rehire&#34; consequences that employees can&#39;t even understand they are on) symbolizes for me all the reasons I would avoid them as an employer. There is no way to have this process without creating a toxic culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Should I tell an employee that I entered them into Focus?” the question reads. The response: “Do not discuss Focus with employees. Instead, tell the employee that their performance is not meeting expectations, the specific areas where they need to improve, and offer feedback and support to help them improve.”The headline is editorialized. IMO whether you’re told you’re in Focus or not is irrelevant. If your manager is telling you you’re not meeting expectations, that’s plenty of signal of what’s going on.The discussion in this thread is written more as if Amazon is pushing out capable talent.There’s a more fundamental question - are we saying once you get hired, your job should be permanent, regardless of your performance?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Donald Knuth&#39;s The Art of Computer Programming has, in its first volume, a lengthy section on simulating an elevator. It is a single regular elevator (nothing &#34;special&#34; going on as in the post here), but even so, as he tries to make things precise, you realize how much detail is involved, and get some appreciation for the task of programming.It occupies about 15 pages (plus several pages of exercises and solutions). Knuth started working on TAOCP when he was a PhD student at Caltech:&gt; The program developed below simulates the elevator system in the Mathematics building of the California Institute of Technology. The results of such a simulation will perhaps be of use only to people who make reasonably frequent visits to Caltech; and even for them, it may be simpler just to try using the elevator several times instead of writing a computer program. […]&gt; The algorithm we will now study may not reflect the elevator’s true principles of operation, but it is believed to be the simplest set of rules that explain all the phenomena observed during several hours of experimentation by the author during the writing of this section. […]&gt; The elevator system described above is quite complicated by comparison with other algorithms we have seen in this book, but the choice of a real-life system is more typical of a simulation problem than any cooked-up “textbook example” would ever be.It ends with:&gt; It is hoped that some reader will learn as much about simulation from the example above as the author learned about elevators while the example was being prepared.And one of the exercises adds:&gt; It is perhaps significant to note that although the author had used the elevator system for years and thought he knew it well, it wasn’t until he attempted to write this section that he realized there were quite a few facts about the elevator’s system of choosing directions that he did not know. He went back to experiment with the elevator six separate times, each time believing he had finally achieved a complete understanding of its modus operandi. (Now he is reluctant to ride it for fear that some new facet of its operation will appear, contradicting the algorithms given.) We often fail to realize how little we know about a thing until we attempt to simulate it on a computer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found a &#34;mode&#34; in an elevator in India that I have not seen anywhere else: if a destination floor number is highlighted, and you press it twice, it gets cancelled. I have used this magic power just once, when an obnoxious man got on and insisted on having a loud conversation on his phone. Since he wasn&#39;t paying attention, I double-tapped his floor number and made him skip. I happened to get off at the floor before his, so the elevator went down to the first floor after dropping me off. Small pleasures...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, the particular use case and whether it is fair use or not, is of minor interest. A far more pressing matter is at hand: AI centralization and monopolization.Take Google as an example, running Google Photos for free for several years. And now that this has sucked in a trillion photos, the AI job is done, and they likely have the best image recognition AI in existence.Which is of course still peanuts compared to training a super AI on the entire web.My point here is that only companies the size of Google and Microsoft have the resources to do this type of planetary scale AI. They can afford the super expensive AI engineers, have the computing power and own the data or will forcefully get access to it. We will even freely give it to them.Any &#34;lesser&#34; AI produced from smaller companies trying to compete are obsolete, and the better one accelerates away. There is no second-best in AI, only winners.If we predict that ultimately AI will change virtually every aspect of society, these companies will become omnipresent, &#34;everything companies&#34;. God companies.As per usual, it will be packaged as an extra convenience for you. And you will embrace it and actively help realize this scenario."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the training set contains verbatim (A)GPL code does this mean that Copilot also should be distributed by Microsoft under GPL? Because without it Copilot (as it is distributed by Microsoft) couldn&#39;t be built, wouldn&#39;t it make it a derivative work of GPL&#39;d code (and obviously every other license)?I see a lot of people comparing human learning to machine learning in the comments, but there is a huge difference - we don&#39;t distribute copies of humans"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am really confused by HN&#39;s response to copilot. It seems like before the twitter thread on it went viral, the only people who cared about programmers copying (verbatim!) short snippets of code like this would be lawyers and executives. Suddenly everyone is coming out of the woodworks as copyright maximalists?I know HN loves a good &#34;well actually&#34; and Microsoft is always suspect, but let&#39;s leave the idea of code laundering to the Oracle lawyers. Let hackers continue to play and solve interesting problems.Copilot should be inspiring people to figure out how to do better than it, not making hackers get up in arms trying to slap it down."</p>

Flip basically charged 1 month rent and guaranteed a fill or they&#39;d pay the rest (6 months) of my lease. Compared to our landlord who wanted 1.75x rent, up to 2.75x rent if not filled immediately, after significant negotiation. Hiring a broker myself would have likely cost 1x rent or more anyways with all the risk on us.I really like the service provider + financial underwriting combination, where you get basically an SLA for them providing a  service, where they take 100% of the risk after the fee."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My father has COPD from over 50 years of smoking. I convinced him to switch to vaping and he&#39;s been using a Juul for a few years now. Awhile after the switch his primary care physician listened to his lungs and said they sounded a lot better. She said she because the science isn&#39;t in &#34;I can&#39;t tell you to vape but I can tell you to keep doing what you&#39;re doing&#34;.Should non-smokers pick up vaping? Probably not. But in this one instance it was a good move for a smoker.I&#39;d like to see more studies in this area and some more regulations on the &#34;juice&#34; for vapes. The quality, and I assume health effects, vary widely between different juices. For example: I bought him a non-refillable vape by another company and he started coughing and complaining of soreness in his throat.I also think the arguments against the flavored juices are hysterical/hypocritical given the variety of flavors of liquor one can find.Disclaimer: I think all drugs should be legal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We spent decades trying to get rid of cigarettes and it worked and now we let this fucking Juul through the front door. It’s as if we haven’t learned a fucking thing in decades, and the fact that this founder is celebrated in Silicon Valley sickens me. He just found another opportunity to hook kids on nicotine for another few generations and now he’s a fucking billionaire. Fuck that guy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s quite outrageous.If this special issue was peer-reviewed, people donated their time for free to publish 11 studies with potentially severe conflicts of interest.If the issue was not peer-reviewed, then the editors handed out free publication for money, which is what predatory journals do.There is no way to spin this as remotely related to good scientific practice, which would mean:- Funding is independent of results- Double-blind peer review- Pre-registration wherever possible"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let me take these PhD level regex down to elementary school awesome.I have a process table and I want to grep it for the phrase &#34;banana&#34;:ps auxww | grep bananaroot  87  Jun21   0:26.78 /System/Library/CoreServices/FruitProcessor --core=bananamikec 456 450PM   0:00.00 grep bananaArgh! It also greps for the grep for banana! Annoying!Well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s pgrep or some clever thing, but my coworker showed me this and it took me a few minutes to realize how it works:ps auxww | grep [b]ananaroot  87  Jun21   0:26.78 /System/Library/CoreServices/FruitProcessor --core=bananaDoc Brown spoke to me: &#34;You&#39;re just not thinking fourth dimensionally!&#34; Like Marty, I have a real problem with that. But don&#39;t you see: [b]anana matches banana but it doesn&#39;t match &#39;grep [b]anana&#39; as a raw string. And so I get only the process I wanted!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The more general tip is that a single regex isn&#39;t the only tool you have.  You don&#39;t have to get your final product one one step.  Almost every &#34;disaster&#34; regex comes from someone trying to do too much at once.One other solution would have been to run the regex twice, once to pick up all instances of Tarzan, and a second on the results of the first to filter out all instances of &#34;Tarzan&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This trick may be thought of as a simplification of the systematic approach to parsing stuff, that is the lexer-parser division of responsibilities.The lexer uses regexes but only for splitting the input stream of characters into tokens. Identifiers, integers, operators, strings, keywords, opening brackets and whatnot - each type of token is defined by a regex. This part is hopefully deterministic and simple, although the lexer matches regexes for all kinds of tokens at once, which is why lexer generators are often used to generate lexers.The heavy lifting is done by the actual parser which tries to combine the tokens into something that makes sense from the point of the grammar.So in this trick the sub-regexes between |&#39;s define the tokens (the lexer part) while the group mechanism selects the single token that we want to keep (a very very simple parser)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former film pro here. I don&#39;t see anything &#39;impossible&#39; here, most of this is stuff I could do on my desk 10 years ago with a modest setup - but only with a lot of patience and manual labor.If these demos fairly represent the user experience then it&#39;s slick as hell and further blurs the line between editor, compositor, DI specialist etc. Much will depend on whether the ML marketplace can be competitive with many mature commercial offerings from software studios that have no intention of letting their lunch be eaten. Video production involves a lot of bleeding edge technology but the client base is also suspicious of new providers or do-it-all solutions at first, and very loyal to products and tech support offerings that have got them through difficult projects in the past, so there will be a big hill to climb between people acknowledging it&#39;s cool as hell and their willingness to sell it to a producer who is making a 5, 6, or 7 figure bet on what some editor/VFX geek is telling them.The web browser/cloud storage is an issue. It could be a plus in many circumstances, but it&#39;s also a big barrier to any production that&#39;s working in a remote location without reliable internet, especially given the massive data volumes involved. That limits a lot of the use cases to post production, and many producers and directors are going to be wary of starting on one platform and finishing on something else; nobody likes workflow changes unless they can be shown something seamless, like having your Avid/Final Cut/Premiere/* project leave your machine and show up frame-perfect in Runway, along with a definite answer about export time like being able to take in 12 hours of video and have it online within 24h. There will also have to be a lot of questions about security, downtime, and being able to get your project back out of Runway if money runs out, the editor gets fired, creative differences rear their head etc.Looks like an instant win for short-form projects like personal shorts, music videos, commercials, corporate, demo reels, spec pieces. Potentially very good for reality TV indie and low-mid budget films once the above questions are answered. Toughest nut to crack is large budget or episodic TV where there&#39;s very stiff competition and contractual or professional commitments already in place, but doable within 5 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so glad to see this on the front page -- this website, in conjunction with a video from Two Minute Papers, is what convinced me to teach myself machine learning. I come from a filmmaking background, and have used green screen extensively. It&#39;s big, bulky, has to be set up correctly, lit correctly, and is expensive and just generally a pain to work with.I&#39;m currently working on a fully-automatic version of this based off some excellent research from the University of Washington. It&#39;s still in its infancy, but if you&#39;d like to follow my progress, I post occasional updates over on https://nomoregreenscreen.comThis is just the beginning of what&#39;s possible in the intersection between DL and creative filmmaking, and I&#39;m really excited to get to be in this field at a time when compute is cheaper than ever and all the information I could want is available for free on the internet!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve just given this a go, with very little work I was able to produce a near seamless mask which was able to adapt to dynamic and changing pose - interesting stuff.The main drawback I observed was computation speed, most edits required &gt;20 seconds of loading/buffering (with a 1Gbps internet connection). I presume the computation occurs on their own servers, so with beefier hardware the performance could be increased, however my intuition is that the app would perform faster if running natively (rather than a shared resource quota on a remote server).In this regard, the lack of performance could be a major productivity killer, my hypothesis is that it is the video processing/manipulation which is taking a long time (and not the model classification). Many companies have tackled this problem space with completely video transcoding chips (such as YouTube), however this generally still incurs long periods of waiting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was wonderfully written and if your gonna start a data team, this is how you do it. But I can see that I’m the only one who thought it was crazy to start a data team in the first place.This company makes 10M and spends 3M on the team and infrastructure to make data a core competency?A vast majority of wins discussed were lowly differentiated web / mobile / supply chain analytics which they could have gotten and setup with 3rd party software for an order of magnitude cheaper.I can only imagine what this hypothetical startup could have learned if they spent that money actually talking to customers, and running more experiments.I’ve heard people talk about data as the new oil but for most companies it’s a lot closer uranium. Hard to find people who can to handle / process it correctly, nontrivial security/liabilities if PII is involved, expensive to store and a generally underwhelming return on effort relative to the anticipated utility.My take away was that startups benefit tremendously from a data advisor role to get the data competency, as well as the educational and cultural benefits, but realistically the data infrastructure and analytics at that scale should have been bought not built. Obviously there are a couple of exceptions such regulatory reasons like hippa compliance for which building in-house can be the right choice if no vendor fits your use case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so eerily familiar I swear I&#39;ve had many of these exact conversations word for word. The only way this doesn&#39;t turn into a complete nightmare of a cluster is if the exec team &#34;gets it&#34;.  If so, you just might stand a chance at building a data team that gels with the rest of the org.But if the exec team simply hired you for window-dressing, expect to be treated like a scapegoat and a punching bag.

If the exec team doesn&#39;t give you equal footingf with Product (or Marketing, Finance, and Eng for that matter) then this will rapidly become a soul-sucking job.  However, if E-team does give you the authority to call Product&#39;s bullshit, and tell Finance to stuff it, and not take direction from Eng leads, then you actually might be able to accomplish something really cool."</p>

It’s so realistic I wonder if the author took it from his diary or something. Everything about it is supersaturated with authenticity and teaches better than any other article I’ve read. Kudos to the author, and I would love to see this style of article take off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great, but remember that if you&#39;re interested in investing, and not the markets themselves and trading, then this whole landscape is already so over-optimized to the point of being irrelevant. You could&#39;ve achieved everything you wanted in investing even in the pre-computer era, like for example Buffett did. In fact you could&#39;ve done everything you wanted already in the 1600s Amsterdam - see the book &#34;Confusion of Confusions&#34;, a pretty great read.Read the 10-Ks, think about what people (will) need, what kind of margin pressures and competition dynamics will play out across the economy, read finance history books, play with pricing models. Focusing on market structure is kind of like focusing on network adapters and packet switching details, focusing on valuations/pricing/finance is like building deep ML models. Of course you need the damn networks to work, but guess what - some pretty clever people have already solved that for you."</p>

So a wave of regex vulnerability reports and then we build this type of checking into prettier or similar and we do not have these in the future?EDIT: It appears there as a project that found 100s of CVE reported Regex vulnerabilities in npm projects -- this is maybe one of the sources of mass reports.

What will happen in the latest attempt from an affected user? Tune in and be ready for an exciting ride!https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2372Spoiler: bugs are not sentient beings that solve themselves just by closing the issue (or the whole issue tracker, for that matter).EDIT to clarify: Sorry for the snarkyness. I just find it funny in a sarcastic way that up until I reported the issue in 2020, the issue had been reported repeatedly but &#34;lost&#34; in the way because the project closed or ignored the issue every time it changed issue tracker. Which happened twice since 2017! so go figure the amount of reports that had gone to waste. On the flip side, this time they haven&#39;t changed platforms (yet), although the issue has been closed prematurely anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the 8 years that have elapsed since this pitch was made at Google, one conclusion is absolutely crystal clear:  the industry has as little self-regulatory control over its use of such dark patterns as the public has over avoiding them.Regulation, taxation, and where necessary, criminalisation, are obvious and necessary.I&#39;ll note that for once, the patterns are not entirely synonymous with massive tech monopolies, though it is the monopolists who have the greatest resources and capability to tune their attention-diverting practices to the absolute maximum degree.The naivete Tristan reveals here is rather charming, however."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The distraction of notifications, or &#34;sign up for our email news letter&#34; distractions I&#39;m certainly against. But, the fact of having my time wasted (getting a notification I don&#39;t care about) has highlighted other things that waste my time such asMovies that start with 1-3 minutes of company logos. An animation of &#34;A Scott Free Production&#34;, followed by an animated logo of &#34;Bad Robot&#34;, followed by yet another animated logo of &#34;20th Century Fox&#34; and all that is then followed by card that says &#34;Scott Free Production of a Bad Robot movie published by 20th Century Fox&#34;. I want to reach and and shake the people silly &#34;QUIT WASTING MY TIME!&#34;The same with both movie trailers and game trailers. I go to see the game trailer and there&#39;s 30 seconds to 2 minutes of logos. For games, I want to click the video and see gameplay IMMEDIATELY. I don&#39;t want some 5 minute CG movie nor do I want to see the publisher or developer&#39;s names. Those are solely 
there to stroke their own ego. The user/player/viewer as absolutely no need for it. They aren&#39;t respecting my time.Of course those things have been around forever but the fact that my devices and apps waste my time in so many ways as highlighted other ways my time is also wasted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh dear. After reading the notes in the study itself about the scale this was done at, scaling up might be an issue:&gt; A typical H₂O₂ synthesis reaction was carried out using 120 mg of 1% AuPd/TiO₂ [...] The reactor system was then pressurized, typically to 10 bar. The reactor was then cooled by a water bath to 2 °C. When the reactor had reached the required pressure and the flow through the system had stabilized, the solvent (H²O, HPLC grade), typically at a flow of 0.2 ml min¯¹, was introduced into the system.Oh hey, 0.2 mL/min of water. In Virginia, the lowest flow cutoff for waterworks is 0.5 MGD (or 5000 people), the border between Class 3 and Class 4. That flow rate is 6.5 million times that done in the tests here. The large water treatment plant I worked at is another 400 times that, and there are plants that would be another 5 or 6 times that. So the necessary scaling factor is going to be measured in the billions.So what about those reagants? This uses about 0.6 mg of gold to process 0.2 mL/min of water (if I&#39;m reading the notation of 1% AuPd/TiO₂ correctly). Scale that to our small plant, and that&#39;s about $225,000 of gold and $350,000 of palladium. Go to the scale I worked at, and that&#39;s $190 million of catalyst in terms of raw metal worth alone. That&#39;s comparable to the cost of a regular treatment plant of that scale--just on the catalyst. This assumes that there&#39;s a neat linear scaling, which I doubt is going to be the case (square-cube law!)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anytime you read things like 100,000,000 times more effective - you should be asking, what was the numerator or denominator in this. Or are they just describing some tiny part of the system.For example, normally you need to filter, do settling for sediment etc - how did they solve all this?Given the orders of magnitude involved here a 5 MGD plant could produce 500 trillion gallons per day of &#34;commercial approach&#34; water cleaning. The water handling issues alone in doing 500 trillion GPD seem large. Am I missing something?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Psilocybin&#39;s effect can be amazing, but there were moments when I took truffles in Amsterdam that almost made me commit suicide. The sane part -- whatever was left of it -- recognized it and found an immediate way to stop it. So what actually happened is that I locked myself up in an empty room and cried (I couldn&#39;t harm myself there, because I didn&#39;t know how to get out until I sobered up a bit).After one hour of crying I started noticing the magical effects of &#34;we&#39;re all connected&#34; etc. So after the bad part of my trip, the amazing things came. I don&#39;t mind that I cried, but I do mind that I was acting on a suicidal tendency that I never experienced sober.I think I overdosed on it, being quite an inexperienced user. Because the first time I took half a dose, that was an amazing experience and it allowed me to reconnect to true child-like wonder (measured in units of whatever the smart shops in Amsterdam sell).N = 1, I know.All I&#39;m saying is: be careful, have a trip sitter and a good set and setting. Don&#39;t go all out simply because you see a few positive papers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The site is ~~wrong~~ somewhat correct about how big reddits homepage is.~~It seems to not run any scripts when testing, so 1.5MB is the basic JS + CSS.~~In reality, it&#39;s much, much worse. (On a desktop)Even with an adblocker, reddit.com downloaded 18MB in the first 10 seconds. That would put that cost at over $1.I stopped after that because it seemed to be just continuously downloading... something.I know Reddit is quite media driven these days, but it seems to be unnecessary prefetching a lotEdit: Looks like I was testing the desktop version,   
see jefftk&#39;s reply.However, it doesn&#39;t help reddit&#39;s case that much. After looking into what it&#39;s actually downloading in my &#34;desktop&#34; test, there are lots of huge PNG images (1000x1000 +) that seem to be displayed as tiny thumbnails.And for an infinitely scrolling page, it prefetches all the images in the feed at full resolution.If I turn off my adblocker, I get an autoplaying amazon ad (~5MB).Additionally, it starts auto-playing a livestreams which is just below the fold."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For Germany it says 0.07 USD prepaid for 1.39 MB which is 50 USD for 1 GB. Telekom offers 2 GB for 9.95 EUR prepaid which yields 0.0082 USD and is an order of magnitude lower than the quoted number. And this is literally the first offering I looked at, the second provider I looked at offers 12 GB for 15.99 EUR which brings the number down to 0.0022 EUR.I would take those numbers with a large grain of salt at the very least."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On a related note, I highly, highly recommend watching this well-made documentary on JWST, released around 3 and a half years ago -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLD9LKq0u9EThis documentary was produced by Northrop Grumman Corporation -- the builders of JWST under a NASA contract."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s my personal belief that these massive R&amp;D space telescope programs are nearing their end. Computational approaches among multiple sensors, combined with good &#39;ol factory mass manufacturing powered by low-cost reusable launch technology allows for the money spent on one-shot programs like this to be spent and allocated in radical different ways.Instead of building one huge short life-span spacecraft, why not launch hundreds or thousands of lower cost, less capable birds incrementally? You can start with a small &#34;first light&#34; capable instrument with a dozen or so spacecraft, then over time and more launches put up more and more capability and decommission failed or low capability pieces.Use some computational methods to combine the sensor collection from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of these kinds of  spacecraft and you could end up with planet sized instruments pretty efficiently.By eliminating lots of the hard engineering for the massive instruments (like serviceability, difficult to make massive mirrors, etc) you can build even better instruments that are generational and relatively inexpensive.You get a more flexible funding story as well, e.g. fund at maintenance levels during difficult economic times and fund at larger amounts during boom times with matching launch schedules.Tasking the fleet could be more dynamic as well, with different researchers able to reserve different percentages of a huge fleet for their specific experiments and needs -- e.g. reserve a hundred spacecraft for a long dwell &#34;deep field&#34; type observation, or reserve thousands for planetary imaging in a nearby solar system.I know there are naysayers about this who think it&#39;s improbable. I urge those to think about the Starlink fleet, which went from zero birds in the air in 2015 to over 1500 spacecraft today. Now instead of radio antenna, what if they had imaging sensors and were turned to face out? SpaceX certainly didn&#39;t spend anywhere near what JWST ran as a program to reach this point and the development time has been a fraction so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the JWST survives launch but has a subsequent mechanical problem that prevents it deploying properly (and it’s the kind of problem that would have been fixable on Hubble, using a shuttle mission) would it be feasible to mount a robotic rescue mission to chase it down and remote-hands it back to life? For less than the cost of just launching another JWST?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is the laplacian so ubiquitous? Well, locally any reasonable PDE is well approximated by a linear one. And linear PDEs are of the form Lu = f for a linear differentiable operator L. But why does the particular case of L = laplacian show up so often in physics? Galilean invariance says that the laws of physics should be invariant under translation and rotation. Checking this against Lu = f, you can verify that one requires that L commute with translations and rotations. That is L(u_h) = (Lu)_h, where u_h(x) = u(x+h), and similarly for rotations. What you can show (pretty easily on the Fourier side) is that every linear differential operator with these properties is a polynomial in the Laplacian."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sure. But I have a question: why? Why should we opt out of the telemetry? To me, this idea seems to not just be admitting defeat, it&#39;s ensuring defeat right from the start.Telemetry should always be opt-in. Yes, that means vendors will get much less data. It&#39;s on them to deal with it.On a related note, I wonder how long it takes until one of the vendors of popular CLI tools or desktop apps get fined for GDPR violation. I wonder how much of existing telemetry already crosses the &#34;informed consent&#34; requirement threshold. I&#39;ll definitely be filing a complaint if I find a tool that doesn&#39;t ask for it when, by law, it should."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;PRs and Status&#34; is a very optimistic headline for a list of rejected pull requests.I like the idea, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. I can understand why some Homebrew devs think it&#39;s just an attempt from someone to pad their resume. It&#39;s essentially a single person setting up a website, then submitting a bunch of untested pull requests to a bunch of projects.I imagine this would work much better if a large distro like Debian would adopt this first. They have the credibility and weight necessary for such a project, they can make it much more useful by asking for the desired setting during OS setup, and they can make sure it&#39;s universally respected via patches in the packaging process. From there it would have a chance at wide adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not support this idea. The differences between the things they all group together under one umbrella is wild - ads, usage reporting, automatic updates, and crash reporting are all very different things and it&#39;s actively harmful to control all of them with a single switch.At the very least, there should be two different switches - &#34;ads&#34; and &#34;everything else&#34;.If you don&#39;t want telemetry or crash reporting, that&#39;s fine - you may not care about helping the developers of an open-source project improve their software and that&#39;s your personal choice. Similarly, you may want to manually install security patches, while I want them to be automatically installed so I have one less thing to worry about.There may even be some crazy person that wants ads. I don&#39;t, but I&#39;m not going to try to take away their freedom to choose them, which is what this proposal would do - an all-or-nothing switch for non-essential network access.Give me granularity. There&#39;s no (user-facing) reason not to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to me that there is not as much push back against Rust from the kernel. Linus (I guess everyone addresses him with his first name), has been very critical, even dismissive of systems programming languages other than C. But with Rust he has a more, I guess we could say passive approach. This might be a good indicator that Rust is doing something very respectable.On the other hand I&#39;m slightly suspicious of this movement. Rustaceans are very, very eager to promote the language. It would be interesting to know how much this movement comes from within the Linux kernel community or if it is driven more by the Rust community.In any case the language seems to have potential of becoming a new mainstream systems programming language in a few years."</p>

I recommend instead of scrolling through the Amazon catalogue like he described, he might want to see if there is a local film festival that screens world cinema. Cinema from other parts of the world for me often leads to great new perspectives and insights. Outside of Hollywood there is plenty of auteurs and refreshing cinema happening. Or take a deep dive into the best of the best without the American lens with lists like the TSPDT.https://www.theyshootpictures.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Roger Ebert wrote an essay [0] in 1992 reflecting on his career as a critic. He writes&gt;In the past 25 years I have probably seen 10,000 movies and reviewed 6,000 of them. I have forgotten most of those films, I hope, but I remember those worth remembering, and they are all on the same shelf in my mind.Overall, he seems never to have lost the joy of watching movies. A relevant quote:&gt;When you go to the movies every day, it sometimes seems as if the movies are more mediocre than ever, more craven and cowardly, more skillfully manufactured to pander to the lowest tastes, instead of educating them. Then you see something absolutely miraculous. Something like &#34;Wings of Desire,&#34; or &#34;Do the Right Thing,&#34; or &#34;Drugstore Cowboy,&#34; or &#34;Gates of Heaven,&#34; or &#34;Beauty and the Beast,&#34; or &#34;Life Is Sweet,&#34; and on your way home through the White Hen Pantry you look distracted, as if you had just experienced some kind of a vision.[0]: https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/reflections-after-25-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The root cause of this is basically Hollywood (i.e. who makes what gets shown in your local multiplex) has given up on making movies exclusively for American audiences.  You need a global audience, and you need the potential to get a billion dollars + in revenue.  E.G. as he points out comedies have died, that&#39;s because comedy is highly localized versus the kids movies + adventure plots which are more universal.  End result is everything gets boiled down to its rawest, most accessible elements and everything feels samey."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a xoogler who interviewed way back in 2004, let me say that this post sums up my feelings exactly. The people I worked with at Google back then weren’t necessarily there for high six figure salaries. We were there to work with other people like us. We were there to be part of something larger than ourselves. In some sense I felt alone most of the time, and when I interviewed I felt as if I had found my tribe. These are people who made me feel dumb, but also astutely aware that I could improve. I learned so much during my tenure there, and I regret none of it. Perhaps I do regret taking so long to realize the sense of purpose and mission died when Emerald Sea started and good projects (reader, google talk, code search) were being canabalized to prop up a pipe dream that was never going to work. That’s the nexus event in Google’s time line… where things went askew and never came back to normal. Now people only care about perf, OKRs, and levels. Being a poor new grad with no savings and intentionally picking projects that would not get you promoted (but were fun) was frequent back then. The courage to do new things is rewarded in ways different than titles and symbols. Perhaps no “one” is more cognizant of that than the anthropomorphic Google of today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on the infra team for a TypeScript-based product downstream of the author. His and his team&#39;s approach and writings influenced at a lot of my thinking about core development, and I&#39;ll always be grateful for having had the opportunity to learn from them by osmosis.The success or failure with which any companies hires and retains folks like these is a mystery to me. As the evidence shows, Google (and I suspect almost any &gt;100-person company) is far too much an amorphous glob/slime mold to even have a single coherent approach to this problem. But what are the successful strategies here? How important is it even to retain this kind of talent? How do we know how a company is even doing in this regard?In my meager-in-comparison 6.5 years at Google, while I certainly saw many amazing SWEs come and many go, I&#39;m far from knowing what the real trajectory was. But I can imagine that for many folks, the perceived trajectory would be a major motivating or demotivating factor to stay or to leave themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At the time I left, out of ~150k employees, only ~300 had worked there longer than me.This is why it is insane to accept the &#34;I know the people involved in developing that and they wouldn&#39;t let a terrible thing happen.&#34; Defense of it being ok for the co. to have massive unchecked power.The company is its people. The people /will/ change. Give a company serious power you cannot expect the staff to keep it reigned in. It&#39;s completely unrealistic and also unfair to the staff for them to have that moral responsibility forced on them. Ultimately 99.9% of the time the only thing they can do is resign, which reduces the impediments to bad things happening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; But drill isn’t popular. It’s widely seen as boring. Worse, there’s a body of opinion, especially in education, that considers it an ineffective way to practice. That’s a shame, because it’s the most effective way to build your skills.This resonated with me as I watch my kids go through school.Math used to be taught with more drill style. Now with common core every single problem is an epic quest of 10 frames and double pluses. It seems so ridiculous. I&#39;d rather them crush a worksheet of 20 problems that practices a single skill then 2 problems that try to include everything from reading to drawing just for a simple subtraction problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The premise of Wooden&#39;s methods is that the players already have a lot of experience playing basketball. Many many games by the time they got to UCLA. Informal and formal.And that&#39;s my caveat for this as advice on painting. If a person doesn&#39;t already have a history of painting, by which I mean starting and completing paintings as paintings, no amount of drill is going turn them into a painter. The willingness to execute paintings has to be there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I paint realism in oils, mostly still life.I showed my grandma (98) a photo on an iPad. Her immediate reaction: “there’s no reason to paint realism anymore”. The method described in this article might work for realism in oils, but please don’t accept it as the exclusive way to create art.Art is about understanding the tools you’re using to create (for example how paint mixes, moves, dries, interacts with a surface), then choosing which tools to use and how to use those tools to convey an experience to an audience. Art is about experimentation, exploration, communication. Art is about studying &amp; talking with other artists to learn how they work, the processes they use, how they solve problems; sometimes copying them and then extending beyond.My point of view on this developed as I studied art in high school, through AP art, and then minored in fine art in college alongside my engineering degree. Plus many hours painting with my grandma and my mom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey all!I recently had some personal stuff which made it necessary for me to cut back on the hourly commitment I could make to work, but found it difficult to find contract, part-time, freelance (anything not full-time) jobs through traditional means, so I built sidequestjobs.It&#39;s an aggregator, so it gets jobs from various sources and curates them into part time, freelance, or contract based positions. I&#39;m hoping to add more sources over the next coming weeks, but I wanted to post it to get some feedback now.Thanks for checking it out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a company once that was very remote friendly. You could disappear for a month and then pop into Slack and ask, what’s next in the issues queue? Then work on issues for however long you wanted, billed hourly at a generous rate. Several times I disappeared for weeks to travel and climb and was always welcomed back.That company was minting money and wasn’t worried about deadlines. I wish more work was structured this way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve slowly come to realise that:1. There’s a large latent pool of talent that can only do part time/flexible jobs but aren’t even looking because so few are available.2. The total economic loss from such jobs being rarely offered is massive.Consider women who stop working for a year or two due to having a child or children. Many are only able to return part time at first. There’s so few part time jobs in software that many choose not to return to the industry. By the time they can return full time they feel so out of touch, from just a few years away, that they never return at all.Same happens with people who are injured, temporarily disabled etc. The demand of full time only (and often more hours on top again) means that the industry misses out on retaining a lot of skilled talent.And yes chronic conditions and disabilities are also very disadvantaged by the requirement of full-time only work.But as cool as the name sidequest is - I don’t think it’s quite right. Because for most people of the scenarios listed above this would not be a sidequest but a main quest.Awesome work though. And good luck!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a tip on finding a cofounder. I&#39;ve been looking for the last 12 months and I tried a lot of things, but the thing that worked best is this:Post a job ad.That&#39;s it. My ad sounded like a normal job in every way, with a title like &#34;Director of X&#34;. A couple of specific notes: 1) the first line said &#34;cofounder&#34; in it somewhere, and 2) it specified &#34;part-time to full-time, heavy on equity compensation&#34; somewhere else.The result: Lots of inappropriate candidates applied. But also, my 2 job posts resulted in three extremely excellent team members: a equity-only cofounder, a mostly-equity cofounder/early hire, and an amazing advisor. I have been working with these folks for months and they are very solid.I also recommend my vetting process: just like a job. That is, I did a phone screen, a multi-hour interview, a little take-home, and I winnowed down the candidates at each stage. With the chosen few, I kicked off a &#34;let&#39;s do this&#34; conversation. My pitch was, &#34;I know it&#39;s ridiculous, but let&#39;s get business married, we&#39;ll set up an offsite and start working together full-time... and, if we really need to, we&#39;ll get an annulment&#34;. That&#39;s what vesting is for!Hope that helps :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on a startup for years, like the better part of a decade and finding cofounders is like planning where lightning will strike; unless you&#39;re already in the right place, it&#39;s almost impossible.I&#39;ve tried things like cofounderslab, cold messaging through social DMs and working my network but there&#39;s such a small cohort of people who (1) find value in working at a startup, (2) are willing to take equity in the beginning without being paid and (3) believe in your idea enough to want to work hard.I&#39;ve had to learn how to scale myself into different roles (outside of engineering) to keep going, but it really is an exercise in testing your limits: mentally, physically, emotionally, socially...I hope this is something that actually works.edit: Just to give more context, I have had people who I trusted and who initially signed on to help, but they fell out somewhat quickly due to one of the three things I mentioned above. Most people don&#39;t understand how much work goes into actually making a startup happen and flame out pretty quickly...alas..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having tried to get a project away for 2 months (and failed so far)It seems like there are a lot of potential CEOs out there with ideas looking for a CTO to do the heavy lifting -- and the VCs are all over them -- met multiple in last few weeks with nothing more than an ideaAs an engineer, with a vast piece of prototype tech funded myself up to this point, and no CEO -- because I don&#39;t really want a CEO right now, just some additional R&amp;D funding to clean things up to start that commercialising process -- but VCs don&#39;t appear to want to hear thatEx-meme company founder CEOs good, heavy tech R&amp;D without that badYou have to wonder how much deep tech is out there looking for home right now -- that can&#39;t get an investor audience without complying with the narrow criteria VCs are putting in place -- 90%+ won&#39;t even talk to you if you&#39;ve not been personally referred"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW the ET Legacy[0] project remains active, and exists because the Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory code was GPL&#39;d.I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good example of the &#39;best aspects of the GPL&#39; that Carmack was talking about, but it&#39;s at least certain that all of the work contributed to ET Legacy is work that had the potential to be closed-sourced, but wasn&#39;t.It would be really interesting to see the lineage of open-source projects based on the GPL-licensed id games.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m still bummed out that for years, GPL was the &#34;standard&#34; go-to open source license. So many projects became useless for any commercial projects whatsoever.GPL advocates say it&#39;s so that your code isn&#39;t exploited by corporations.But I&#39;d say that choosing GPL means it&#39;s more important to you that your code &#34;is not exploited by corporations&#34; than that it can be used for good by people with commercial interests.Those two things do not have to be synonyms. I&#39;d much rather allow the second if it means tolerating the first.(Edit: Seeing the downvotes, I&#39;d be genuinely interested in counter-arguments or thoughts on this)(Edit 2: Just because it keeps coming up, let me make absolutely clear that I do NOT in any way think GPL might never be a valid choice, nor that anyone, myself included, should feel &#34;entitled&#34; to &#34;free as in *.*&#34; code.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool to see a team of 25 students put this together and get prototypes made. I wish opportunities like these were available back in my college days.The headline is getting slightly ahead of the actual performance. Reaching Cortex-A76 performance is their goal after many more iterations. Their current implementation is not there yet, but that shouldn&#39;t detract from the magnitude of their achievement and their contribution to the open-source world:&gt; This culminated with an 8-core prototype built based on Yanqihu (雁栖湖) architecture using TSMC’s 28nm process with the processor running up to 1.2 or 1.3 GHz that should be taped out this month. But plans have been made to tape out a new prototype based on Nanhu (南湖) by the end of the year, using SMIC’s 14nm process allowing up to 2 GHz frequency, and further iterations of the architecture will aim at rivaling Arm’s Cortex-A76 processor.RISC-V is an exciting development in the SoC world. We&#39;re starting to see some of HiFive&#39;s boards trickle out into the wild. The performance is good, but it&#39;s not quite as groundbreaking as many of the headlines make it out to be. The most exciting part of all of this is that ARM has more competition and we get to see some open-source contributions like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MicroMagic is pretty interesting to me in the RISC-V space: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/new-risc-v-cpu-claim...They are getting perf-per-watt numbers that are ahead of everyone...albeit with a single core and no real 3rd party verification.Some of the group had worked on Sparc at Sun, and they had previously sold themselves to Juniper for $260M, then regrouped some time afterwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know whether it is possible with chip development or not. But I really hope that this project will enable numerous amount of derivative chips just as Linux kernel allows multiple distro. That means IoT/GPU/CPU/etc chips need not to start from scratch. In addition, having similar foundations might help fabs manufacture those chips swiftly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good write up.  Many years ago I decided to code/program a log based db, to see how far can I go.  It was supposed to be Light-weight (Berkley DB was the inspiration). It had a working stream to file for all changes, and a compaction thread in the background.What I learned...  creating the main/basic features of non-relational database (log based), is easy... but it is the edge cases that hit you hard and dealing with them creates about 90% of the code.It was a fun exercise from which I learned a lot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good tutorial.The problem of out-of-order data becomes more challenging as ingest throughput requirements increase if your storage representation must guarantee a strict total order. In high-throughput designs this is often handled by relaxing the strict total ordering requirement for how the data is represented in storage. As long as the time-series has an approximate total order at ingest time, there are many techniques for inexpensively reconstructing a strict total order at query time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t hear much about it these days, but circa 2004 when I was going into computer science I had multiple teachers and a guidance counselor warn me that all the jobs would be going to India and tell me I should pursue something else. This seemed to be very much the prevailing wisdom of the time. I pursued it anyway as it was my passion.I was one of five students in my program that had been a huge multi-campus program only a couple years earlier. We were the last cohort before the college discontinued the program entirely, and I was the only one to graduate. What I found  however for maybe five years after graduation was a insanely high demand for developers.There was genuinely a generation that was so strongly discouraged from becoming developers that there were very few. Seems to me like the folklorists have largely missed this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest issue with education is the whole &#34;study this, get a job doing that&#34; idea. It&#39;s plainly wrong, and it sucks in people who drink the koolaid and think there&#39;s an easy route to work.Very little is learned in college that is necessary for general employment. By general I mean just about everything that isn&#39;t licensed, like being a doctor.What college does is it throws a bunch of hard but irrelevant subjects at you that you slog through, so that you learn how to learn stuff. The best demonstration of this is in subjects that are scientific mathematical, because there&#39;s very deep trees of knowledge there that you have to trace, and there&#39;s relatively few ways to use common sense and cultural experience to answer questions.This is why there are so many devs with no &#34;relevant&#34; degree. If you can sort through the mess of learning a stack, you can do the job. If you need to know some particular CS thing, you will find it and learn it yourself. There&#39;s no magic dust in any class, it&#39;s all publicly known information that&#39;s been digested by many many people before us, and these days you can find umpteen explanations for just about anything online for free.The thing that sorts people is the ability to persevere through technical issues. You&#39;ll find a lot of people in this world are for some reason unable to deal with the mess. This is not a condemnation, I realise everyone has their own situation, economically and personally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I moved to Palo Alto in 1984 after the tech boom had collapsed. All the mortgages were under water. People talked about how exciting it had been.  “But how many disk drives will companies ever want, really?”In 1982 the MIT EECS department was trying to encourage students to pick other majors.*   By ‘84 they didn’t need to.* posters in the Infinite Corridor that read, “Course 6 got you down?  Change majors!”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with this article. GitHub Copilot is indeed infringing copyright and not only in a grey zone, but in a very clear black and white fashion that our corporate taskmasters (Microsoft included) have defended as infringement.The legal debate around copyright infringement has always centered around the rights granted by the owner vs the rights appropriated by the user, with the owner&#39;s wants superseding user needs/wants. Any open-source code available on Github is controlled by the copyright notice of the owner granting specific rights to users. Copilot is a commercial product, therefore, Github can only use code that the owners make available for commercial use. Every other instance of code used is a case of copyright infringement, a clear case by Microsoft&#39;s own definition of copyright infringement [1][2].Github (and by extension Microsoft) is gambling on the fact that their license agreement granting them a license to the code in exchange for access to the platform supersedes the individual copyright notices attached to each repo. This is a fine line to walk and will likely not survive in a court of law. They are betting on deep lawyer pockets to see them through this, but are more likely than not to lose this battle. I suspect we will see how this plays out in the coming months.[1] https://www.microsoft.com/info/Cloud.html[2] https://github.com/contact/dmca"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Julia Reda&#39;s analysis depends on the factual claim in this key passage:&gt; In a few cases, Copilot also reproduces short snippets from the training datasets, according to GitHub’s FAQ.&gt; This line of reasoning is dangerous in two respects: On the one hand, it suggests that even reproducing the smallest excerpts of protected works constitutes copyright infringement. This is not the case. Such use is only relevant under copyright law if the excerpt used is in turn original and unique enough to reach the threshold of originality.That analysis may have been reasonable when the post was first written, but subsequent examples seem to show Copilot reproducing far more than the &#34;smallest excerpts&#34; of existing code.  For example, the excerpt from the Quake source code[0] appears to easily meet the standard of originality.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27710287"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On the other hand, the argument that the outputs of GitHub Copilot are derivative works of the training data is based on the assumption that a machine can produce works. This assumption is wrong and counterproductive. Copyright law has only ever applied to intellectual creations – where there is no creator, there is no work. This means that machine-generated code like that of GitHub Copilot is not a work under copyright law at all, so it is not a derivative work either. The output of a machine simply does not qualify for copyright protection – it is in the public domain. That is good news for the open movement and not something that needs fixing.This is very good news. This line of thought implies that we can legally feed all proprietary code into GitHub Copilot in order to teach it all the patented and secret tricks of the companies we can see (since data mining is not copyright infrigement) in order to have it print those secrets back when we ask it to (so they become public domain)./s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Am I the only one who thinks this is kind of petty? It&#39;s not like Audacity is trying to read your email (or even rip off your tracks). The telemetry I&#39;m reading about is literally:1. error reporting - the user has to click a button to share crash logs. It&#39;s basically a macro to help the user create a support ticket.2. version checking - no PII information being kept, literally just helping the developer get an idea of what versions they need to be supporting--you do want them to support the version you&#39;re running, right? Well, if not, you can turn it off.What&#39;s the big deal?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish we could add telemetry to the rr debugger without risking this sort of blowback. We have no idea how many people are using rr, and how much, so when we talk to hardware vendors and other groups we depend on, we have no leverage. This is a real problem.It would be a big boost to free software if some org like Freedesktop had a standard telemetry library, data collection policy, data collection and publication service, and a distro-wide master switch to opt into data collection, and it was socially acceptable to use that framework."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is the problem I see:1. Users enjoy product for free.2. Users pretty much never tell maintainers what is going wrong for them: no messages (much less proper bug reports), no contributions in any way!3. Something invariably goes wrong for users that do the above.4. Users immediately hit social media and try to tar the entire project, developer/company reputation, whatever.  “Zero stars”, doesn’t work in their use case.  You have surely seen these “reviews” before, and mindless tweets.THIS is why I am torn on telemetry to some degree.  IF you demand no auto-feedback in the name of privacy, THEN you should help out voluntarily OR not use free software!  Yet software maintainers can’t count on this at all.  They risk being hanged in the public square for every bug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those unfamiliar with Strong Towns, here’s a best-effort summary of what they do:Strong Towns is a non-partisan non-profit that advocates for governments to build financially solvent towns. Many cities are perpetually broke because they owe more money in maintenance burden (fixing roads, pipes, etc) than they bring in through tax revenue.This happens because towns in North America tend to build out large neighborhoods all at once (think: suburbia). At the start, the developers pay for all the infrastructure, and then “give” it to the city to maintain.At first, everything seems fine. The city gets plenty of new tax revenue! But come 20 or 30 years later, it turns out that the tax revenue of the new development is not enough to replace the roads, fix the pipes, and so on.And so to pay for the repairs, the city then builds yet another neighborhood in the same strategy to collect the initial tax revenue and use it to pay for the repairs of the previous neighborhood. It’s effectively a Ponzi scheme (as referenced in the article).The gist is that many low-density spread-out suburban neighborhoods with expensive infrastructure are a huge cost center for a city. And since most North American cities build this way, we have a lot of cities that are “functionally bankrupt” or will be soon.If you&#39;re a systems thinker who lives in a town that can&#39;t seem to fix it&#39;s potholes, you may want to check out the book they&#39;ve published with the same name: &#34;Strong Towns&#34;.(Adapted from a previous Strong Towns post)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Not Just Bikes [1,2,3] YouTube channel also has an excellent series of videos based on work from Strong Towns.  I link to these videos whenever a friend asks why I chose to leave the United States. :)[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfQUOHlAocY

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This ‘Ponzi scheme’ (bond issuance) is the most efficient funding mechanism by far, and is proven to work sustainably within limits.That limit is the marginal point where the expenditure equals the net asset value gain resultant from it, such as real estate prices. How can you know this limit? You can’t, but the bond market can guess at it.Let’s say that you have a nice picket fence suburb with no police department and lots of robberies. You float a bond for your first police officer (not that this will help, but, run with it…). People buy it for nearly the risk-free rate. Why? Because they know that they will get paid back by the next bond, which will also get funded. Now the cop floats a bond for a Lamborghini. The demand is much lower, and the interest is unsustainable, so it doesn’t get funded.Now here’s where it goes wrong. The mayor sees that nobody wants to pay for the Lambo, and solves the problem by packaging it up with everything else. This works for the first Lambo, but they want 10 Lambos, so the bond interest rate is unsustainable.So what now? Taxes. They put a bunch of taxes on the residents, and then tell the investors that the Lambo bond will now get paid by tax revenues, which they have ultimate authority over. Now the calculus is different. The value of the expenditures is almost irrelevant. The only thing that matters is the marginal point where an additional dollar in tax reduces the net asset value by the inverse of the tax rate (e.g. $1 in tax revenue at 1% =&gt; $100 value destroyed). Notice we’re no longer talking about increasing values by large multiples, but destroying value by large multiples.Now the Lambo bond goes out supported by tax revenues. The casual observer might note that the people of the town are now paying the bond holders for their right to exist on the land that they ‘own’. The major innovation from feudalism is that now the peasants actually pay for the land up-front too, and they pay for any improvements on it, and then higher rent for the improved property.But that’s only an illusion of sustainability created by forceful extraction of resources. It’s like a strip-mining operation on middle class wealth. Profits are great until the resource runs out. So what is the solution there? Growth. Bring in more people to extract resources from. This is a requirement of the extractive funding model.Market forces create sustainable economies. Any use of force distorts away from sustainability, toward finite extraction, and extractive models require expansion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So.. I can see that this ML model is generating some code exactly same as the original dataset, which definiately a problem. A defect model, sure. 
Beside that, I cannot understand why the overall idea, using open-source project to train a ML model that generates code would ever be a problem. We human beings are learning as the model, we read others code, books, articles, design patterns... and it becomes part of us. Even the private code, I mean like you join a company, you read their codebase, methodology and it becomes something yours. Copyrights generally not allow you to &#34;copy&#34; the original, but you can still synthesize your own code -- cutting, combination, creating based on whatever you have learnt. 
The method of how a ML model works is differ from human brain for sure, but I cannot see why this would be a problem, or why an organic would become something superior that what they do is a creation and a ML mode is scraping your code. What is the difference here????And also recently we saw GPT that generates articles, waifulabs that generates ... waifus... to be honest I cannot perceive the difference since all of them are &#34;learning&#34; (in a mechanical way of human created knowledge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a genuine question about this whole thing with Copilot:A similar product, TabNine, has been around for years. It does essentially the exact same thing as Copilot, it’s trained on essentially the same dataset, and it gets mentioned in just about every thread on here that talks about AI code generation. (It’s a really cool product btw and I’ve been using and loving it for years).  According to their website they have over 1M active users.Why is this suddenly a huge big deal and why is everyone suddenly freaking out about Copilot?  Is it because it’s GitHub and Microsoft and OpenAI behind Copilot vs some small startup you’ve never heard of?  Is it just that the people freaking out weren’t paying attention and didn’t realize this service already existed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey everyone, I just wanted to chime in and say that GPT-J is incredibly legit. Every aspect of GPT-J is production grade — no difference in process, quality, or results, compared to any other big name research lab.I also want to apologize to Eleuther for giving them a hard time in the past. My earlier concerns were unjustified. To be completely honest, I was jealous they achieved everything I tried to achieve with my own open source research lab attempt. It took a long time to even recognize that jealousy in myself, let alone set it aside. Sorry.The credit for this work goes almost entirely to kindiana, aka Ben Wang. Remember that name; you’ll be seeing a lot of it in the coming decade. It’s clear to me that whichever lab he ends up at (he’s an undergrad! Google let him slip away because he didn’t have a degree!), he’s gonna be changing the world. Don’t know what, don’t know how, know he will.Every aspect of that codebase is immaculate. Most research code is not pretty; this looks carved out of marble and placed in a museum.Without Eleuther’s TPU resources, this work wouldn’t have happened. Tensorfork (my lab) didn’t get access to the TPU VM alpha. And TPU VMs were an absolute necessity here. (TPU VMs are a new thing; they’ve been in alpha since December, but only recently launched. If curious see https://github.com/shawwn/website/blob/master/jaxtpu.md and https://github.com/shawwn/website/blob/master/mlmind.md for why it’s the future of ML.)Eleuther also helped test the model thoroughly. Leo Gao (go follow him: https://twitter.com/nabla_theta?s=21) ran GPT-J through the gauntlet. He was the primary person behind The Pile, the training data that makes any of this possible. I can say with absolute certainty and no hesitation that there are no “gotchas” here.Eleuther’s https://6b.eleuther.ai page looks wonderful too. It’s like a free OpenAI API playground that everyone can try. Keeping it running for months is no small achievement. (Set top_p to 1.0 and temp to 0.8; the defaults are pretty bad.)Congratulations, and thank you everyone for all your hard work. The world is so much better for having access to this level of quality."</p>

I am actually kinda happy with that. I listen to some podcasts and read the news before leaving to get a couple of documents together. I’m going to my mom’s today to have a meeting regarding my eviction notice. My mom still lives with my dad. I can’t ask him to do anything, though, I guess. I was always so used to having to ask for stuff, that I completely forgot I could get people to do what I want for me. My mom, for instance, is not as bad as my dad, and I actually don’t mind asking her to help me with everything. It makes me feel like she loves me. I know that this is a small thing, but it’s something that makes me happy.I get to my mom’s apartment at 5:30. The place is very nice. There is a roof terrace, an elevator that goes up and down (where can you find something like that in an apartment building?!), and all rooms have their own AC units.

We don’t need offline applications to behave as if they’re online or SaaS ones.If this is only about telemetry or analytics, make it an opt-in choice on first run.I wasn’t aware that Audacity had been acquired by The Muse Group recently. [1] I don’t think this will go well for users when private interests and concerns conflict with public ones.The next obvious question would be about equivalent alternatives that are free and open source.[1]: https://www.prosoundnetwork.com/business/audacity-acquired-b..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given how beneficial sci-hub is, there ought to be some way that the scientific community can formally recognise this, as a way of legitimizing her cause.Some ways I can think of:* Get her elected as rector of a university. Contraversial figures are sometimes elected as Rector, at least in the UK, because students are the electorate. However for the same reason this isn&#39;t considered especially prestigious by people who know this.* Fund and create an academic post specifically for her (Ptolomy II Professor of the ethics of copyright strikes me a  a suitably biting title [1])* Nominate her to some well known prize[1] Ptolomy II decreed that any book found in a ship in the port of Alexandria should be copied by the scribes of his library - with or without the permission of the owner.  The UK actually has a similar law in that publishers are required to send copies of any book published in the UK to the British Library"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wonder how this is going to play out. For those who don&#39;t follow the current situation with Sci-Hub, Alexandra (the creator and likely the sole operator) of Sci-Hub shut down the part of the website (&#34;the magical proxy&#34;) that is responsible for fetching the papers that were not previously retrieved. This was done to comply with the request of the Indian court, as described in the article.As a result, any papers published in 2021 (and some of the rarer, older ones, that nobody tried to access in the past) are not retrievable by Sci-Hub. The user only gets to see a white screen.This is meant to be a temporary measure, but it&#39;s been going on since December of last year (due to various court hearing delays), and the desperation in online communities like the r/scihub subreddit has been palpable [1,2].[1] https://old.reddit.com/r/scihub/comments/o2xb57/how_do_i_eve...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The push for crypto without ecc ram is a nonstop horror show. Software under normal circumstances is remarkably resilient to having its memory corrupted. However crypto algorithms are designed so that a single bit flip effectively changes all the bits in a block. If you chain blocks then a single bit flip in one block destroys all the blocks. I&#39;ve seen companies like msps go out of business because they were doing crypto with consumer hardware. No one thinks it&#39;ll happen to them and once it happens they&#39;re usually too dim to even know what happened. Bit flips aren&#39;t an act of god you simply need a better computer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cosmic-ray bit flipping is real and it has real security concerns. This also makes Intel&#39;s efforts at market segmentation by not having ECC support in any consumer CPUs [1] even more unforgivable and dangerous.Example: bitsquatting on domains [2].[1]: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/linus-torvalds-blame...[2]: https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/08/10/bh-2011-bit-squa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OP here.  Unless you work for a certificate authority or a web browser, this event will have zero impact on you.  While this particular CT log has failed, there are many other CT logs, and certificates are required to be logged to 2-3 different logs (depending on certificate lifetime) so that if a log fails web browsers can rely on one of the other logs to ensure the certificate is publicly logged.This is the 8th log to fail (although the first caused by a bit flip), and log failure has never caused a user-facing certificate error.  The overall CT ecosystem has proven very resilient, even if a bit flip can take out an individual log.(P.S. No one knows if it was really a cosmic ray or not.  But it&#39;s almost certainly a random hardware error rather than a software bug, and cosmic ray is just the informal term people like to use for unexplained hardware bit flips.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s wild we have any images of the surface of Venus at all given how hostile Venus is. Given how hostile it is, it seems unlikely we&#39;ll go back anytime soon. These images were really a product of the Cold War where the US focused on Mars.It&#39;s worth noting that Venus is still probably a better terraforming target than Mars [1]. This romantic notion of Mars has rooted itself deeply at this point (eg with Elon Musk) but Mars is basically a more distant and inconvenient Moon. Almost no atmosphere (in fact, just enough because dust storms will occasionally just coat all your equipment), the Sun is weaker and gravity is still very low.Venus&#39;s atmosphere is about 3% nitrogen and 97% CO2. It has about 100x the atmosphere of Earth, which means there&#39;s actually more atmospheric nitrogen than on Earth. And abundant CO2 means oxygen is abundant.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI-old7YI4I"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice to see more professional commercial projects picking up Blender. It helps to see what are the things missing or suboptimal for &#34;expert&#34; users of the system.Blender and OBS Studio are very good examples of FOSS software that are the best at what they do and can easily offer competition to even the commercial alternatives.Most of all their design and UI language is consistent - something very rarely seen in FOSS software.And they have incredible depth of features 90% of which are overkill for the casual user but the experts sure do appreciate them.And the best part is the well-thought of extensibility and API story. Both of them have a very good community of plugins and extensions which add very useful features without feeling out of place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blender has gone from being a tool professionals scoffed at to one that professionals are stressing over themselves to learn by binging tutorials. It is quite the sight, I remember in 2008 wanting to get into game development and being poopooed on forums from picking up blender and instead pirating maya instead. I obviously dropped the idea completely because of it.Idk, I think there might be a larger lesson somewhere in there but regardless it&#39;s amazing to see the shift that has occurred."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blender is a very good piece of software. The main problem I usually have with it is finding documentation. Although the official documentation is fairly good, Blender is a huge program, and it can be hard to find the info you need. Also the documentation is not always up-to-date."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Googler, opinions are my own.I work in payment and idempotency is always a discussion point.  This draft links to one of our docs (though the draft points to a 404 URL, the correct link being[0]).As the draft calls out, Google Standard Payments uses the &#34;requestId&#34; field as our idempontency key, which is part of the request body, rather than in the HTTP header.  We did this specifically to decouple the protocol from the behavior of the request.  We could take the existing definitions and put that payload into any other protocol and it would work without having to use that protocol&#39;s sidechannel data (aka, the HTTP header).Our design makes idempontency part of the application layer, rather than any middlebox or load balancer.[0] https://developers.google.com/standard-payments/guides/conne..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a bit funny to see an IETF draft for this!Adding idempotency support to Stripe&#39;s API was one of the things I built while an intern in 2015. We&#39;ve since rewritten it almost entirely, but many the technical decisions made in 2015 still stand.One of the things that IETF doesn&#39;t specify (&#34;an appropriate response&#34;) is that Stripe&#39;s Idempotency API has a response body has the latest rendering of the resource. Here&#39;s what I mean:  # Set tax exempt status
  curl /v1/customers/cus_AJ6m5vWl7scnn6 \
    -H &#34;Idempotency-Key: aaaaaaaaaa&#34; \
    -d tax_exempt=reverse

  → {id: &#39;cus_AJ6m5vWl7scnn6&#39;, object: &#39;customer&#39;, tax_exempt: &#39;reverse&#39;, ...}

  # An unrelated request sets the customer&#39;s email
  curl /v1/customers/cus_AJ6m5vWl7scnn6 \
    -H &#34;Idempotency-Key: bbbbbbbbbb&#34; \
    -d email=&#39;foo@bar.com&#39;

  # Set tax exempt status with the first idempotency key:
  curl /v1/customers/cus_AJ6m5vWl7scnn6 \
    -H &#34;Idempotency-Key: aaaaaaaaaa&#34; \

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s more appropriate IMO to name it something like &#34;Request-Identifier&#34;. All the client should indicate is that if you get 2 or more POSTs with that same Id, you are free to no-op on any after the 1st successfully handled one.Idempotency is an emergent property of a system so it doesn&#39;t make sense that a client would dictate the key that&#39;s used to provide that behavior. So if the Idempotency-Key is quite likely not to be the actual &#34;Idempotency-Key&#34; in any sufficiently complex system, then don&#39;t name it that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll repeat my comment from nearly seven months ago [1] since it left a really bad taste about how users are dealt with. Nearly a year ago when the initial waves of the pandemic were raging on, Migadu removed its free tier. That&#39;s not a problem by itself because businesses have to make money to sustain and grow. But Migadu gave one month’s notice (contrary to the claims in the replies, that&#39;s what I saw) for users to switch. The replies to the comment also said that the new lowest paid tier was &#34;affordable in every corner of the planet&#34;, which sounded quite ignorant even for a non-pandemic time.Another point, which may matter to some people, is that while Migadu may be a Swiss company, the data centers where the mails are hosted were in France (this was the case at least a year ago). So the situation is somewhat comparable (not entirely though) to Fastmail being an Australian company with data centers in the U.S. being used.For those who want multi-domain email services for a lower (flat) price, look at mxroute. It&#39;s based out of the U.S. though, which may not be an option for people who want certain services outside Five Eyes jurisdictions.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25382626"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their $19 (Micro) Plan lists &#34;200 in/day and 20 out/day&#34;. My email usage, personally, seems to be in bursts. It stays below 1 or 2 outbound mails on most days, however on some days (rarely) there&#39;ll be threaded conversations with &gt;50 outbound mails. So, I feel like it would be fantastic if the plan had monthly limits instead of daily limit. Or some other sort of limit, say EC2 like, which would allow the user to consume the resources in bursts."</p>

The city&#39;s vulnerability was known beforehand [0] but the inevitable disaster was greeted with shock, confusion, and a search for peripheral explanations.  In the case of the pandemic, our vulnerability to zoonotic viruses and other diseases was also well-known; e.g. [1] was published in 1995.  But again the reporting, as it seems to me anyway, focuses on the particular circumstances of the disaster rather than our fundamental vulnerability.  There is a plentiful supply of unknown microorganisms to fuel the next global health crisis, and we need to expect and prepare for it so that next time we can prevail without great struggle.[0] https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/predicting-katrina/[1] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46722.The_Coming_Plague"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was a pretty good thread (by an ex-Wikipedia lawyer) on Twitter about the IP meaning of Copilot.https://twitter.com/luis_in_brief/status/1410242882523459585...And this is a longer article about how IP and AI interact:https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-101-issue-2/copyright...I am not a lawyer, but I am capable of summarizing the thoughts of lawyers, so my take is that in general, fair use allows AI to be trained on copyrighted material, and humans who use this AI are not responsible for minor copyright infringement that happens accidentally as a result. However, this has not been tested in court in detail, so the consensus could change, and if you were extremely risk-averse you might want to avoid Copilot.A key quote from the second link:Copyright has concluded that reading by robots doesn’t count. Infringement is for humans only; when computers do it, it’s fair use.Personally, I think law should allow Copilot. As a human, I am allowed to read copyrighted code and learn from it. An AI should be allowed to do the same thing. And nobody cares if my ten-line &#34;how to invert a binary tree&#34; snippet is the same as someone else&#39;s. Nobody is really being hurt when a new tool makes it easier to copy little bits of code from the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve given thousands of hours to open source projects, I really think open source is a pillar of modern society. So you would think I am all for something like copilot, but no.At first I thought this was a great feature, because easier access to code, but after some reflection, I am also very skeptical.I am able to make my code open source, because I can make a living out of it, and I have a lot of open source code that I love to share for things like education or private stuff, but if you want to use it for something real, you need to hire me. If you can suck all the code without even I noticing it, that&#39;s not fair.The other thing is code quality. I don&#39;t want to sound rude, but there are tons of bad code around. Not necessarily because the author is unskilled, but because the code might not need to be high quality (for example I wrote a script to sort my photos, it was very hastily written and specific to my usage, I used once and was done with it). Also, there are some bad/wrong pattern that are really popular.I am surprised you are able to DMCA a twitch stream because someone whistle india jones theme but in this case it is considered fair use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Host Here. Thanks for sharing.Richard is a great story teller and adventures that SQLite has taken him on pretty interesting.  I think he in on hn as well ( @SQLite).One interesting thing I found about how SQLite is developed is the amount of testing that is done. Between unit tests and parameterized tests and fuzzer tests they are doing billions of tests per release and spending days running them before each release. I know I don&#39;t like to wait for a long CI build before I deploy a service but something like SQLite needs whole different category of resilience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I&#39;m going to write my own mail server. I was making notes on that even as we were setting up this call. That&#39;s a big problem, and that&#39;s at least as difficult if not more difficult than writing a database engine, but I don&#39;t want to be beholden to Gmail. I don&#39;t want them controlling my destiny. I don&#39;t want them controlling the record of all of my conversations. I want to control that myself, and so I&#39;m going to go through a lot of pain and a lot of work and a lot of effort to come up with some solution that I can control myself. I can go out and lease a virtual machine out there in the cloud and run it myself and not depend on a third party to control my email.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; he managed to segfault every single database engine he tried, including SQLite, except for Postgres. Postgres always ran and gave the correct answer. We were never able to find a fault in that. The Postgres people tell me that we just weren’t trying hard enough. It is possible to fault Postgres, but we were very impressed.This is impressive for Postgres.SQLite is incredible.  I&#39;ve used it over the years in a variety of important projects."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The basic premise of TIPS was that one could train engineers on solving problems, pretty much like martial arts trainers do: by exercising and learning tricks.Theory of Inventive Problem Solving nicely abbreviates as TIPS. That&#39;s how it has been known in the west for decades. ТРИЗ is a Russian acronym. TRIZ just replaces Cyrillic letters with equivalents. If the author digged a bit deeper, they would have known it and a few funny stories. Like the fact that Genrich Altshuller did not want his teaching to carry on once he dies, but fan groups of engineers existed until the fall of the Soviet union when many of their members emigrated and continued the TIPS cult following, selling  courses and software to large enterprises (Dassault, Lockheed Martin and the likes)."</p>

On my way out one of the porters silently approached me and said: “Schwarze-sama, we checked the weather forecast and there will be rain this evening. So here is an umbrella to take along. Also, we took the liberty of reserving a table at that restaurant you wanted to go. Oh and last thing: here is a city plan for you where we already detailed down the way to Fushimi Inari.” It goes without saying that the guy responsible for my shoes already set out my hiking shoes and not one of my city or evening shoes.

Everything from Product Design to Apple Store and Services. The only thing that Japanese dont get ( and they somehow still dont ) is Software.Tim Cook first visit to Japan was in 2016 for business reasons. So I am going to say he has very little understanding of Japanese Zen culture, everything Steve took and put it into Apple.Very unfortunate Tim Cook&#39;s Apple is nothing like Steve Jobs&#39; Apple.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;The companies were losing money and employees trying to satisfy Amazon and their constant abusive changes,” Tom Rask, an attorney for Last Mile and Triton, told Motherboard. &#34;You have to hire numerous drivers who may or may not be working. One day Amazon dictates that you have thirty routes, the next day forty, then the day after twenty. You’re supposed to have enough drivers for back-up while Amazon is lowering pay. Amazon’s actions are unlawful.&#34;Sounds miserable. Id shut down too if I was losing money with only 1 client.If this were freelancing it’d be like having to be always available for one client 40 hrs a week, but not knowing if you’ll get to bill 5 hrs or 50… while your rates constantly decrease. There’s no point in having this business"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is more or less how it should be. If Amazon isn&#39;t going to offer a good enough deal, then companies shouldn&#39;t move packages for them. As more and more people figure it out, other delivery companies will stop working with Amazon as well, although it may be that the deals work out better in places with lower cost-of-living, easier delivery routes (due to climate, geography, etc.), or other advantages.If some other delivery company can figure out how to make it work economically, then they can do the work instead.If nobody is interested in trying to make it work, Amazon will have to either improve the deal it offers or go back to using FedEx/UPS/USPS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I guess I never really paid attention to the details behind all the Amazon headlines I see.&#34;In April, Amazon announced it would reduce the amount it paid for drivers from $17.25 to $16.00 an hour, according to the letter...Weeks later, Amazon announced a series of raises for its drivers around the country as part of a public relations push following a union drive at an Amazon warehouse&#34;&#34;Currently, Amazon delivery drivers are expected to deliver upwards of 400 packages a day on 10-hour routes that often extend up to 12 hours.&#34;400 seems crazy, I wondered about UPS. According to Google &#34;At UPS, the average driver makes about 120 deliveries per day, says Jack Levis, the shipping giant&#39;s director of process management&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Robinhood closed my brokerage account after I did transferred out assets (via ACATS transfer, to get a signup bonus with another brokerage without realizing capital gains).A few months later I asked how to reopen the account, using the &#34;reopen account&#34; form in their app to generate a support ticket. Three weeks later they sent an email saying that my account was permanently closed and I should apply for a new account. Replies to this email yielded a response saying that their email server was failing to accepting messages.So as requested I applied for a new account; the application stayed pending for three weeks, then I got an email autoreply telling me that my application is denied because I have a preexisting account (i.e. the old closed one). Replies to this email also yielded a response saying that their email server was failing to accepting messages.I filed a new support case explaining what had happened, what they told me to do, and asking what I should do next. No reply whatsoever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand that many give Robinhood crap because it is not &#34;sophisticated enough&#34; or because of the Gamestop fiasco. Although many startups like to claim that they are &#34;democratizing [x]&#34;, I honestly believe they did it. I have many friends that never traded before, and after they got their Robinhood account they feel comfortable enough to do it often. Even myself, who used to only trade a couple of times a year, started with $300 in my Robinhood account a few years back. Now I have at least ~60k that I rotate around in my Robinhood account on a daily/weekly basis. Yes there are other services that I now use or other apps that seems better, but for all intents and purposes, Robinhood did &#34;democratize&#34; trading for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember seeing their first public demo at LA Hacks in 2014. Seemed like a couple of kids right out of college. They had the iPhone&#39;s screen hooked up to the projector and one of their friends kept sending them silly text messages the whole time that they had to dismiss. This was before the Do Not Disturb feature came out.I remember wondering how it took so long for someone to make a half decent stock trading app for the iPhone -- all the other apps at the time sucked (and they largely still do). I was on ETrade before but signed up for the Robinhood waitlist immediately -- haven&#39;t left since being allowed in early 2015."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They&#39;re all strangely intention-less on every imaginable level. That can be unsettling.I&#39;ve listened to, and made, a lot of music like that. When I want to relax or think, I like music that engages me in some way but has a sort of drift, an ambient (in the Eno sense) quality even if it&#39;s slamming Berlin techno. It&#39;s different from the prog-rock I grew up with, which was difficult and loaded with intentionality.I ended up experimenting with music that was more generative, doing pretty sophisticated things with a degree of structure but without intentionality: always a random factor, a journey to an unknown goal (typical end result: wandering around for a while)AI art is like that. We see it wandering around for a while. It&#39;s getting better at picking up the trappings of identity, but persistently lacks intentionality.Maybe the trick is to supply the intentionality instead of the identity? Instead of &#39;creepy moat&#39;, a visual identity, make it do a painting of &#34;you are not going to survive and that&#39;s good&#34; or &#34;thank you but I am not worthy&#34;.If you have to feed it words, get a poet, don&#39;t describe the picture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting. There is a principle with a lot of modern, abstract art, which is that the work is not complete until the viewer sees it - that is to say, the observer brings a portion of the meaning to the work. This AI art seems to go one step further, there isn&#39;t really an artist anymore, in the traditional sense. The creator of the work is more like an observer - choosing which output they like best. The &#34;artist&#34; becomes a consumer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not sure how to say this best, it probably sounds negative but I don’t mean it that way. It is really interesting because using these tools abstracts away the talent/skills part of creating art - you say your idea, and get the computer to keep showing you completed pieces until you find what you meant, or at least something you found interesting. It reminds me a bit of the role of the DJ to do the searching and curating, but not actually create the music.In fact you could imagine a musical version of this where the operator is describing feelings or styles and the AI is generating music to match where the operator wants to go."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started seeing the value of this ideology recently. I have a really strict routine before I write a single line of code on a complex issue. All of these ways of thinking ultimately came out of efficiency gains I learned on my own in the kitchen. Prepare, then work. Trying to prepare while you work is chaos (but sometimes essential).The very first thing I do after finishing a design review narrative is to type up a list of discrete tasks that I plan to execute. These don&#39;t necessarily say what to do line-by-line, but draw out a very clear picture of what code areas are edited and what the dependency graphs look like. These also highlight specific configuration or other UX points to reference during testing. These task lists are specific enough that other developers could reliably execute them without any additional guidance.Then, I take a short break and review my task list when I return. 9/10 times I find I want to tweak it a little bit.After the final confirmation, I sent notification out to my team that I intend to execute the task listing so they have a super clear idea of what functionality to expect on the other side.I have found that this reduces my anxiety/stress by orders of magnitude throughout the day. Starting with visual studio and fumbling around various parts of the code base might be a good way to get your brain warmed up in the morning, but its certainly not a rational way to go about solving a complex problem.For trivial issues, production RCAs, etc., the process is certainly a little bit more streamlined than what I note above. This is more about how to do work on big tasks."</p>

No extra tabs, no bystander applications. I keep my desktop completely plain so that the only files I see are the ones I just produced/downloaded.I would rather go through the pain of reopening apps/websites than to have it lingering when I don’t need it right then.I don’t understand how people can have multiple windows of multiple browsers with multiple tabs open about things they aren’t working on while they work.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the most unfortunate things in the past 6 years is that support of Julian Assange and Wikileaks became a partisan issue purely because they exposed corruption in your favorite political party.It&#39;s hard to put a finger on just how much the current form of western democracy differs from the 18th century ideal of western democracy. Let this concretize it: Global western &#34;democracy&#34; conspires to put the single most hard-hitting journalist of the past decade in jail indefinitely on fictitious charges and virtually nobody cares. Where are the protests? Where is the outrage? Do most Americans even know who Julian Assange is?&#34;Fascism&#34; gets thrown around a lot and I know it feels a bit overplayed, and I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re there yet, but when most people are apathetic and the remainder form their opinion based entirely on their political faction, it&#39;s hard for me to believe that fascism isn&#39;t inevitable. After all, what is fascism about if it&#39;s not &#39;party firmly over principle&#39;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The really startling thing is ... considering how effective this technique is with the internet it must have been nearly flawless prior to about 2015 when most of the world didn&#39;t have access to the internet.What we&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t so much an elite group controlling the narrative as an elite group who used to be able to control the narrative and now can&#39;t patch over the rough spots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think Sigurdur Ingi Thordarson is a &#34;key witness&#34; in the claims against Assange. He might be A witness, but I very much doubt the charges rely on his testimony. As far as the media goes, most people don&#39;t care about Assange as much as the conspiracy crowd. And some of the comments here are verging on very conspiratorial."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; An honest list of drawbacksI appreciate putting up a list like this. That said, I want to comment on one of the listed drawbacks:&gt; Occasionally, obscure email servers will block emails sent through usI have a few years of experience running my own email server and I can tell you this is a major pain in the ass. When you send your email via a small email server (a server that sends a low volume of email), you will have constant issues getting mail delivered. Also, most of the issues will not be with obscure email servers, they will be with Outlook and Gmail. When you send email, you will never know if your email will be delivered to inbox, delivered to spam folder, or blackholed entirely.Related:&gt; We&#39;re not a suitable platform for sending marketing emails (although you should use a dedicated marketing platform anyway).Please explicitly ban people from using your platform to send &#34;marketing email&#34;. Clients like that are going to ruin deliverability for your other clients."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An issue with desalination systems of this type (that have water vapor in a carrier gas, so called HDH or Humidification-Dehumidification desalination systems) is the retardation of mass transfer to the cold surface by the carrier gas.  Multieffect distillation (MED) systems usually operate without a carrier gas for this reason, but this means they operate below atmospheric pressure, so they have to be sturdy to resist pressure loads.A few years ago, some people at MIT solved this problem with a bubble heat exchanger: the humidified carrier gas is bubbled up through trays of water (at progressively lower temperatures).  The surfaces of the bubbles provide a very large surface area for heat/mass transfer.https://news.mit.edu/2013/produced-water-cleanup-0205
https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/86334
http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/papers/reviews/HDH-Desalinat...Some of those involved went on to form a company to commercialize the technology, which has been used to recycle/purify brine from natural gas wells and other industrial tasks.   I think they ended up being bought out after several years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious what the 385% refers to&gt; the team’s demonstration device can achieve an overall efficiency of 385 percent in converting the energy of sunlight into the energy of water evaporation.Honestly I still don&#39;t know what that means, or how efficiency can be over 100%."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FTA: &#34;Unlike some desalination systems, there is no accumulation of salt or concentrated brines to be disposed of. In a free-floating configuration, any salt that accumulates during the day would simply be carried back out at night through the wicking material and back into the seawater, according to the researchers.&#34;The capabilities are freaking interesting, but let&#39;s say someone builds a big enough settlement on a coastline or island in which every building has one or more of these devices on its rooftop. Would this release back enough salt so that the surrounding seawater becomes hostile to its previous lifeforms? Also, since then the water used in the process would contain more salt, how much would that render the device less efficient?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just tried it on my kids&#39; Legos. I made two scans, one per box: it found ~2500 bricks, which I think is a very high hit rate.
However, the build suggestions are very, very lacking. For reference, my kids are 8 and 4.
The builds proposed are very simple, small, and still mention missing pieces (probably related to colors, which honestly most kids don&#39;t care about).
I think my 8yo would like it, she tends to build &#34;worlds&#34;, assembling many related contraption that each are fairly simple and match the themes found on suggestions.As for my 4yo, forget it. He is a builder, making very elaborate and complex constructions, the bigger the better. He would find suggestions absolutely uninteresting.
I didn&#39;t try to scan Technic legos (which he is fond of and make astonishingly complex contraption given his age). But it&#39;s an even more complex problem to solve.I suspect work on the app was focused on recognition, which honestly is impressive. The second part, finding models, maybe need a bit of work ?
I would recommend at least having an option to &#34;ignore color&#34;: it&#39;s nice to have a build that looks good, but overall most kids - including myself - like to build first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever I got a new Lego set, I built it once, using the manual and then would take it apart, a day or two later. For the bricks to be absorbed into my pile and let me build something new, better. Something I had imagined myself.For me there are definitely two kinds of Lego users. Those who struggle with the building instructions. For them following these is almost meditative.
Then there are those who don&#39;t and who have their own ideas. They will skim through the instructions and build the set once (if at all). And in general just welcome the addition of (new) bricks.For me the resp. set served mostly as fuel for my imagination. If it was a spaceship, the next thing I would build was one. Just not the one in the set.My dad built me a chest of drawers with lots of boxes for sorting Legos. And sorted them for me when he gave it to me as a present, for my 5th b-day. It was almost as tall as me at the time. I.e. I could just open and peek into the top drawer.He also told me why it was important to sort the bricks again, after I deconstructed my opi:I could let my imagination run free and find the bricks I needed quickly when building my next piece.Before, when they were all a pile in a big box, very often the creative flow was killed by the annoyance of searching a pile of bricks for the one I needed. You start building something and eventually you just stop.This thing looks like a tool for people who lack both. Sorted Legos and imagination."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve tried it this week and it&#39;s really cool to see it process a big batch of bricks.I was a bit disappointed by the suggested builds, because they&#39;re small, but I also understand it&#39;s early on and a difficult thing to do.Not vital, but I was surprised that it doesn&#39;t look for colors at all.One thing I&#39;d love is the same technology, but used to look for a particular part. It does that once you pick a build, but imagine building your own thing rather than suggestions and having the app tell you where you can find the piece you&#39;re looking for. If you&#39;re adventurous, you would even have a custom tray with a spotlight directed at your pile :)I&#39;ve been trying to take thousands of mixed parts back into their original sets and I was hoping this might be helpful. The technology itself probably would, but not packaged as it is for the moment.All that being said: really well done!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, the built in LSP is a mixed bag. Getting language servers configured is a breeze, diagnostics and go-to definition work just fine. But trying to get autocomplete and snippets to work is an exercise in frustration. There&#39;s a handful of different hobbyist implementations which are all somewhat-maintained and somewhat work together but it&#39;s buggy and you end up needing to do 20x the effort of using VS code to get not quite the same ease of use.I really hope they&#39;ll do some official work on lua-based solutions for autocomplete and code snippets in the future to really round out the LSP support, if that&#39;s something that they want to highlight as a feature of neovim. I still think VS code is the way to go if you want LSP features, but 0.5 is a terrific step forward and everyone who worked on it should be very proud."</p>

Yanked some text then deleted something but I want to paste the yanked text, not the deleted one? &#34;0p is the answer. Need to replace all ___ but not modify the prefixed numbers? I can use visual regex to easily work that out! I&#39;m doing something over and over? I can make that into a macro! There&#39;s a macro that I always use on certain file types? I can make an autocmd to load some string to some macro when I open certain file.It&#39;a awesome feeling that time I&#39;ve actually learning about registers, macros, regex, windows, buffers, and everything else in a modern and snappy tool![0] https://github.com/mjlbach/defaults.nvim"</p>

We (myself and two other guys) put together a demo loosely based on “Rollerball”, which Sony were very encouraging about, but that’s not the point of this post.I will always remember the NDA contract I signed… One of the terms was “If any of the terms of this contract are broken, financial reparation may not be sufficient”.I’m assuming “your first-born child” or something was what they had in mind, but I was young, single and childless, so … &lt;shrug&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the biggest tragedies isn&#39;t just that the childhood is wasted, but that many people never learn to have agency once it is available. I&#39;m not saying you need to start your own business or anything like that, but it seems like most people live their lives never questioning the scripts that are given to them.The basic life script we all seem to have in western society seems pretty awful when you think critically about it. Essentially we waste all out vitality and youth making other people rich, so that one day when we&#39;re old and infirm, we can finally do the things we like with the short time we have left. I think most of us never even think about it because it&#39;s too bleak of a reality. I feel somewhat fortunate in that the work I do is something I would generally enjoy doing even if I wasn&#39;t being paid for it, but I still have a nagging fear that what I could be is much more than what I am yet I lack the proper tools and perspectives to become that person (and I don&#39;t think that just starting my own business, like a lot of people here want to do, is really sufficient, it&#39;s just a small part of inventing your own life script)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article did a great job of articulating something I&#39;ve always felt strongly about but haven&#39;t been able to put into words.I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who felt like my schooling was mostly a giant waste of my time and energy.I was waaaay ahead in subjects I liked, because those things I learned myself out of innate interest. Rather than the system accommodating and encouraging being ahead, in those subjects I was held back and forced to sit through material I already knew, because &#34;in year x we learn this and in year y we learn that&#34;. Don&#39;t get ahead. Zero agency.In other subjects that didn&#39;t interest me, I was forced to sit through stuff only to forget everything I &#34;learned&#34; soon after.It really begs the question, what&#39;s the point? And while I&#39;m no genius at anything, surely a system like this will kill many, many actual geniuses, just like the article says."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the article is that it only uses examples of extra ordinary people.Most people are not geniuses, they are average. 
You are not a genius.Most people who flunk out or drop out of school
do not become billionaires and neither will you.Most people who decide to give it their all and become
various forms of artists will never be famous, noticed 
no wealty or admired (Though on a nano scale you may have people who do)By a large margin most restaurants / startups fail.
You are not going to create the next unicorn.yes this is not 100% accurate because it does happen.
Much like buying a lotto ticket. 
People do win.But you will not. (Almost entirely certain but again some do win).People like Lonardo da Vinci are 1 in a billion. 
Maybe one in 2 billion.People like Jobs and Zuckerberg are a lot more common. 
There are maybe 1000? 10.000? 
If we say 100.000 that is about 0.0013% of the world
population. 
You are not in the 0.0013% (2019 estimate)(Though you really need take into account the privilege accorded people based. on where they live, where they were born, family. If you win the lottery and grow up in a wealty educated country, you have a HUGE advantage.Much like buying 1 lottery ticket drastically increases you chance of winning.The point being nearly all people fail to be special. 
They will not be remembered by the grater society after their death. They will have made no huge impact on the world.  They will never make it big.Thus we should not focus our choices in life my making a few of the same choices that are advantageous for 1 in a billion.We should not set our goals to achieve what they did.We should focus on having a nice life, a good set of friends, enough money to live ok, having interesting hobbies
Having a job that is ok. A safe and dry place to live.
Have some love.We should expect and respect that we will be average
That is not a failure. That is what most likely will
happen.So set out to make the most of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think i’ve got a slightly different take - i’m not saying my take is any better though.If we’re talking engineering principles, not team dynamics, then it’s:  1. Use immutability by default, even in languages that make that harder than it should be
  2. Understand how liberating idempotency is
  3. Divide and conquer, use abstraction to make hard problems manageable
  4. Delete code, delete tests, re-write stuff, re-write it again. Painful? Keep doing this till you get to the other side and feel liberation and empowerment, took me years to get past wincing at the idea of re-writing that thing AGAIN
  5. Pay attention to your build tooling - to do any given task, it should always take exactly 1 command. How do i run the tests? Run the test command. How do i deploy to non-prod? Run the deploy command. Etc

If we’re talking softer stuff:  1. Don’t block collaboration - e.g. if there are 5 people don’t work on 5 tasks concurrently. Work on 1, maybe 2 in some cases
  2. Accomodate 2 types of work: work that needs collaboration &amp; synchronisation (brain storming, planning, why are we even doing this, that kinda thing) work that needs focus time - sometimes that’s focus as an individual, sometimes that’s a mob focussed on one task and saying no to every other distraction in the world no matter how “urgent”
  3. Change what you’re doing throughout the day, don’t try to code all day, you’ll get in a rut, you won’t write your best code after a while. You can optimise this step, e.g. if the team is low energy after lunchtime, use that to your advantage and schedule the easy boring work then, don’t be afraid to use humour or burn low energy time just getting to know each other better
  4. Make sure people are being heard in the team. Hardest point to get right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like a lot of these principles but there is a crucial element missing from this presentation and that is time.As a company grows the importance of each of these principles changes. As a project within an established company grows a similar maturation happens.If you tried to adhere to all &#39;best practices&#39; (principles or not) from day 1 of a project you&#39;d be carrying a lot of weight that could crush otherwise good ideas.Some principles, when presented without a timeline, seem contradictory and that can lead to fights on teams where developers are well meaning but less experienced.I&#39;m encouraged that this presentation includes dimensions along which you can slice the principles, but I encourage the authors to adopt a &#34;stage&#34; dimension as well that helps focus devs/learners on principles appropriate for 1. The stage they are in and 2. The immediate next stage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh wow, author here - I wasn&#39;t quite expecting this to appear here today. I&#39;ve only really just start talking to people about it.That said, my mission is to make software engineering better for everyone. By capturing the best principles from the best in the world at what they do. And to organise and share that knowledge, freely.It&#39;s currently missing features to organise principles well, but I&#39;m working on it (discussion here: https://github.com/PrinciplesDotDev/principles/discussions/2...)You can reach me through my profile or following me on @princples_dev (twitter) - I&#39;ve only starting pushing this, but a lot more will be coming soon.It&#39;s an open source project and it needs your principles to make this a reality so if you&#39;ve got some to share, please do. Or if you have feedback, leave it here. I&#39;m building it for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When it comes to the problem of targeting, one interesting and promising tech is photochemical internalisation [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemical_internalizatio...], where you put the mRNA inside photosensitive molecules (and not lipids) and then shine some light on the tissue/organ where you want the mRNA delivered. Where activated by the light, the molecules then enter the cells, dissolves and deliver the mRNA.
The Norwegian company PCI Biotech has a tech they call fimaNAc for doing this with naked mRNA.https://www.pcibiotech.no/nucleicacidsThis presentation has a lot of illustrations and explanations:https://www.pcibiotech.no/s/PCI-Biotech-SMi-RNA-Therapeutics..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a long essay about the same topic and came to similar conclusions as Derek Lowe: https://trevorklee.com/are-mrna-therapies-the-future-of-phar...One thing that I&#39;d like to emphasize is how unbelievably tiny mRNA therapeutics have to be. It&#39;s probably around 30 mg, and it&#39;s hard to do it more than once every few weeks, at least judging by siRNA therapeutics (which have similar immune issues).30 mg is really tiny. It&#39;s hard to come up with a meaningful therapeutic in such a small amount of material. People have been hyping up self-replicating mRNA as a solution, but that&#39;s still in its infancy, and has its own problems regarding the &#34;compilers&#34;/polymerases that need to be packaged with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sort of mRNA work isn’t immune-driven at all, in theory, and if you need your target cells to keep producing your desired protein, you’re going to have to keep telling them that by sending them more mRNA. Once a day? Once a week? Who knows? That’ll need to be worked out by experiment.This doesn&#39;t seem like a problem from the point of view of those who are in the business of selling mRNA :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting article for two reasons, how the practice originated and what it implies.The practice seems to be somewhat wide spread (in the distance between departments case). That might be because it came from a Facebook group or forum where Law Enforcement officers exchange tips. The second is the choice of artist (Swift) who has been in a pretty visible battle with ownership of her music. I suspect that if the officers who use this technique thought about it, they might find that using Disney tunes would be more effective in terms of triggering DMCA takedowns.What it implies, and is explicitly stated in the referenced video, is that a law enforcement officer is explicitly attempting to deny you your 1st Amendment right (as adjudicated by the courts). While the doctrine of qualified
immunity would likely shield them from prosecution, it is still a violation of your civil rights and should certainly merit disciplinary action on the part of the police department."</p>

Most new home construction is more like $150 / sq ft. And with this system, you&#39;re very limited in what you can build.Who&#39;s the target customer for this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish some of these interior designers would check out European or Japanese apartments for the layout. You could do a lot better (and I would never want to have to use the sink proposed in that clip on a day-to-day basis). That A/C location is just plain wrong (the kitchen is where you&#39;ll spend the least time).  And that shelf splitting the living room + the bedroom? What?Meanwhile you have like... storage for plates for 20 people as if you could ever feed more than 3 people at once. And that double-door fridge... I imagine that if you&#39;re in a more rural area it&#39;s more necessary but there&#39;s a lot better choices here if you are actually trying to make a livable space, instead of a place that offers good shots.
This looks a lot like a &#34;set up your own AirBnB&#34; thing. So much so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if AirBnB made a strategic investment in this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I purchased one of these computers for my child. It made a loud buzzing noise and turned off last week. I discovered the locked BIOS for myself when I tried to boot from a USB to diagnose the problem. Acer wants $619.99 to diagnose it at their repair center, since it is 2 weeks out of warranty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He explained that all computer vendors do this to one extent to another, such as Apple with iPhones, and refused to provide me any means to unlock it no matter how technical I am.I bought a Razer Blade 15 two weeks ago during Amazon sales - once arrived I opened it and upgraded the SSD from 256GBytes to 1TBytes without any issue, and it works really good on Arch...So, Acer, not all computer vendors are doing this shit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before we all grab our pitchforks, maybe we should take a moment and realize that this is a single review on Amazon that&#39;s lacking in important details. The headline here reads &#34;Acer disables BIOS for laptops sold through Amazon&#34;, but the review mentions that they&#39;re able to get into the BIOS. They&#39;re only unable to change the boot order, which is a lot different from &#34;disables BIOS&#34;. Furthermore, I don&#39;t entirely understand why the reviewer tried to get a refund from Acer when they purchased it from Amazon. I bet there&#39;s a non-nefarious explanation for the disabled setting that the reviewer saw. Sadly with a $1,530 cost, I don&#39;t expect anyone here to buy the laptop just for research purposes!"</p>

Enough to awaken me from a sound sleep on a Tuesday evening!I don&#39;t really care that much about selling Klein bottles over Amazon - it&#39;s mainly to reach parents over the holidays.  But I do wish that Amazon would do something about this kind of thing.Finally, I&#34;m very low on stocks of glass Klein bottles. It&#39;s weird for me to ask my friends not to buy the things I&#39;ve worked so hard to make, but I guess I&#39;d better.  I hope to have more manifolds in mid to late summer.Warm wishes all around,-Cliff (way late on a cloudy Tuesday evening in Oakland)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One interesting aspect, that I thing will make it difficult for GitHub to argue and justify its not a a license violation 
would be the answer to the following question: Was Copilot trained using Microsoft internal source code or will it be 
in the future ?As GitHub is a Microsoft company and OpenAI although 
a non-profit just got a massive one billion investment 
from Microsoft (presumably not for free), will it
start spitting out once in a while Windows kernel code ? :-)And if it was NOT trained on Microsoft source code, because it could starting suggesting some of it...Is that not a validation that the results it produces are a derivative 
work based on the work of the open source code corpus it was trained on ?  IANAL..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I think a large part of the value add of machine learning is going to be the ability for huge entities to launder intellectual property violations.As an example, my grandfather (an old school EE who got his start on radar systems in the 50s, who then got his radiology MD when my jewish grandmother berated him enough with &#34;engineer&#39;s not doctor though...&#34;) has some really cool patents around highlighting interesting parts of the frequency domain in MRIs that should make detection of cancer a whole lot easier.  As an implementation he did a bunch of tensor calculus by hand to extract and highlight those features because he&#39;s an incredibly smart old school EE with 70 years experience cranking that kind of thing out with only his trusty slide rule.  He hasn&#39;t gotten any uptake from MRI manufacturers, but they&#39;re all suddenly really into recurrent machine learning models to highlight the same sorts of stuff.  Part of me wants to tell him to try selling it as a machine learning model and just obfuscate the fact that the model was carefully hand written rather than back propagated.I&#39;m personally pretty anti intellectual property (at least how it&#39;s implemented in the states), but a system where large entities that have the capital investment to compute the large ML models can launder IP violations, but little guys get stuck to the letter of the law certainly seems like the worst of both worlds to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see the point of this tool, independent of the resulting code being derivative of GPL code or not.being able to produce valid code is not the bottleneck of any developer effort.  no projects fail because code can&#39;t be typed quickly enough.the bottleneck is understanding how the code works, how to design things correctly, how to make changes in accordance with the existing design, how to troubleshoot existing code, etc.this tool doesn&#39;t make anything any easier!  it makes things harder, because now you have running software that was written by no one and is understood by no one."</p>

From the original article:
&gt; Alas, all [People&#39;s Policy Project&#39;s website] can do is funnel users into Intuit&#39;s terrible [child tax credit] site.
Today at work, I&#39;m learning how to use the IRS&#39;s e-File SOAP API in the hopes that we can build a flow that is easier to use than Intuit&#39;s.

Like, so good I almost enjoy using it to do my taxes.The very fact that Intuit has clearly invested money into making a beautiful interface for a tax program, a program that people use once a year, just goes to show how profitable the current arrangement is for them, and how determined they are to keep the average taxpayer from switching to any competing tax filing ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This makes me laugh exactly because the number of jobs I&#39;ve seen advertised after I&#39;ve left them to do other things because they weren&#39;t challenging enough, only to see that the prerequisites posted for the &#34;new&#34; job would&#39;ve screened me out before I even had the chance to interview and are far beyond what is necessary to do the job well.99% of the jobs that high quality developers could do that they&#39;re screened out of are because of poor concepts of what is needed to be successful.If someone has decent problem solving and analytical skills, can understand the problem domain and has the capacity to learn a new language/framework/construct in a short period of time (which frankly most of us can, and do with frightening regularity), unless you have something miraculously niche and technical, they&#39;re capable of doing the job. All you need to worry about is are they a competent developer and whether they&#39;ll be a good personality fit for the team.They say we rise to the level of our incompetence, but most developers never really grow out of solving problems and only get better with time and experience.Most degrees and professional certifications are meaningless to people who only care about the knowledge - there&#39;s no point in chasing paper that&#39;s out of date the minute the course is designed. We don&#39;t want that knowledge, it&#39;s old. We want current information which the courses and qualifications haven&#39;t been designed for yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a job for nearly 20 years.  Good job, good people, really hard to leave.  The folks at the company who hired me at the time (dot.com era) &#34;Just wanted people who could think about second order effects&#34;.  They didn&#39;t care about resume much.  They wanted &#34;thinkers&#34;.I worked in tech support and had a great relationship with engineering and etc.  They&#39;d ask tickets get assigned to me because they knew I was honest and thorough when it came to documentation and etc.  It was a good gig.Eventually we were acquired and before selling the company off as pieces they laid a huge % of people off, including myself (it was ok, I was ready to move on / and would eventually change careers).The company that got a bunch of the engineers eventually needed support people and the engineers reached out to me to apply.   I applied.But the job requirements had changed, masters degree required.  I no longer qualified (I didn&#39;t / don&#39;t even have a degree).  I applied, but didn&#39;t make it past new company&#39;s filters.  The engineers were told that if I didn&#39;t make it through the filter they wouldn&#39;t consider me.20 years doing that job in one form or another, and there&#39;s maybe a handful of people who know the proprietary side of their equipment... but no masters = not even considered for job.This was a technical job to be sure but it was largely IP (and some proprietary stuff) networking troubleshooting.   You could take capable high school students and they could do it with some good guidance.The hiring people industrial complex is insane."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"General SE hiring comment: One thing I realized, for most IT/SE jobs, the more accurately you describe your current stack in the requirements (or maybe the person you are replacing), the smaller your candidate pool is. You might even find that your candidate pool is exactly the people you are already working with.Which makes it problematic when we make HR people do the initial screening. They would filter out a lot of good candidates just because they used Python instead of Java, or had been working on a C++ project one year less than the person leaving the team.Could it be then that this is a communication problem between the Engineering team and the HRD? After all, the Eng&#39;g team writes the requirements for the job post, HRD just checks it and makes it look attractive.(Though honestly, I don&#39;t think this general comment applies to the job post in Carmack&#39;s tweet. Honestly I can&#39;t fault the job post for the way it was worded. I say the higher you are in an SE-org chain, the less this is a problem.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like SparkFun and I don&#39;t like patent trolls, but I have to say that SparkFun&#39;s mockery of the patent doesn&#39;t make sense. It is pretty clear that this patent was written by an engineer describing their actual system in great detail followed by one fairly narrow claim. I&#39;ve seen many patents that are mostly written by lawyers, and I don&#39;t see any influence of lawyers in this patent.SparkFun&#39;s criticism is kind of painful to read. The diagram that SparkFun claims is SPI is not SPI. The discussion that SparkFun claims is malloc is entirely unrelated to malloc. SparkFun claims that when the patent discusses processing multiple streams of data that it&#39;s discussing variable length arrays, but it&#39;s not. They claim that a MAU doesn&#39;t exist, but a MAU is a multiplier-accumulator unit. SparkFun seems to be entirely confusing the motivation of the engineer filing the patent in 2008 with the motivation of the patent trolls. I&#39;ve seen many patents that are fluff and nonsense, but this one is a solid patent.The infringement claim is probably bogus; I don&#39;t see any evidence that the pcDuino infringes the one narrow claim in the patent. I hope that SparkFun can quickly get rid of this lawsuit. I don&#39;t get any enjoyment out of criticizing SparkFun&#39;s post, but having spent the time to look over the patent, I feel that I should comment."</p>

Can I poke fun at them for not knowing what RAM is? Yes I can.&gt; The above paragraph succinctly describes malloc(), which is perhaps one of the most fundamental advancements in modern computing. The problem is that Al didn’t invent it. Memory management (the ability to take RAM and then give it back when your function is done) goes back to the dawn of computing.No, this is wrong.Nathan is referring to dynamic memory allocation, which is what malloc does, but that isn&#39;t what this line in the lawsuit is talking about.Dynamic RAM, or DRAM is RAM that stores state in a capacitor. This is what your laptop uses -- DDR4 SDRAM is &#34;Double data rate (version 4) synchronous dynamic RAM&#34;. In DRAM, the charge on the capacitors slowly dissipates, so DRAM needs to be &#34;refreshed&#34; periodically, which is why it&#39;s referred to a &#34;dynamic&#34; RAM.Static RAM, or SRAM, is RAM that stores state in a register-like structure (usually cross-coupled inverters). It&#39;s &#34;static&#34; in that it doesn&#39;t need to be refreshed -- as long as the supply voltage is maintained, the bits stored in an SRAM will remain intact.I agree that this patent lawsuit is bullshit, and I really hate to derail the conversation, but I&#39;m surprised by Nathan&#39;s misunderstanding here, given that SparkFun makes embedded boards that use all kinds of memory. SRAM/DRAM isn&#39;t unusual terminology. The distinction doesn&#39;t even matter in the context of this line in the lawsuit, but if you&#39;re going to make a point of nitpicking about something, you should really make sure that you&#39;re actually right about it first..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me: software engr, retired; also patent agent who worked in Google Patent Litigation.A rookie mistake is reading the TEXT of a patent. A pro looks only at the claims. The text is only there to &#34;support&#34; the claims, which boils down to using the same words. Cynical, I know.Claims unfortunately look like gibberish if you&#39;re unschooled, but &#34;construing&#34; them is an early step in a trial, and often if you get a bad claim construction you give up. I worked on tons of claim construction briefs.I&#39;ll read those claims a little later this evening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience at least talking to some younger people there is a clear dichotomy: despite all the talk about Gen Z being &#34;digital natives&#34;, people new in their career are much hungrier to get back into the office because they don&#39;t yet have good career networks built up and they&#39;re eager for mentorship. It is older, or at least more established workers who are less keen on that.I don&#39;t think FAANGs will have any trouble hiring a boatload of eager, hardworking college grads in September even if they lose multi-digit percentage of their current workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly don&#39;t know whether these articles are over-stating their case, and neither do I know how typical my own experience is, but for some reason it bothers me that the tone of the HN discussion is so reflexively dismissive.I understand that a lot of people will respond to a question of whether they intend to quit their job with a &#39;you bet!&#39; even at the best of times, but I&#39;m seeing a lot of people quitting and switching right now, as different company plans are crystallized for the &#39;new normal&#39;.In my current company (for another 2 months) I was interviewed to join a team of 12 tech developers, and a couple of months ago the first of the switchers quit to leave for another company specifically because they were guaranteeing remote-first work.Then another five of us quit over the following few weeks. We met up last week for a goodbye lunch in the park: half the team that I joined a year ago leaving the company over the Spring and Summer.Is a 50% quit-rate normal? Maybe each of us had slightly different priorities and plans for the future? But I do know for sure that people are reflecting more than I&#39;ve ever experienced before, about their work environment, the balance in their lives, and prioritizing other things than 40-50 hours each week sitting in front of a screen, inside an office."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish data and statistics weren&#39;t so frequently abused.This article told me nothing concrete of value.&#34;Hey this number is big&#34; - Yes, but was it also big before? How much bigger is it now? 2%? 10%?Is the cumulative number larger than just the sum of months under quarantine? Ie this is just pent up demand and if we averaged it across months it&#39;d look normal? Historically what percentage of people thinking about changing jobs at some point in time actually do within 12mo? 10%? 70%?Without any context to me this article is just as likely to be the precursor to a follow up articke about &#34;the major job resignation that never materialized&#34; as is it to be about an actual change in positions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I lived in HK 2018-2020, leaving around the passage of the “national security law”.I think HK is a perfect case study of a line of fallacious thinking popular among westerners: the idea that peaceful protesting or rule-abiding political opposition is generally effective.This is wrong for at least two reasons. The first mistake is failing to recognize that many governments (case in point) are not nearly as vulnerable to bad PR, so generating a bunch of sympathetic imagery (photos of student protestors getting gassed or whatever) might not actually be useful in swaying political outcomes.The second mistake is assuming that most (putatively) peaceful protests in the western world are actually the impetus for political change, and not just part of a legitimization strategy for political changes that were already in development before the protest started."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Empty words and token sanctions are not going to stop the CCP&#39;s blatant takeover of HK and trashing of the &#39;1 country 2 systems&#39; agreement.Real action - offer US citizenship to Hong Kong era that want it. Then go recognize the Republic of Taiwan as an independent country.Unfortunately the CCP is probably right in their assumption that our politicians are to greedy and spineless to make anything beyond a soundbite gesture. They&#39;ll keep expanding their borders, putting minorities in concentration camps, forced organ harvesting and researching interesting new viruses.We&#39;re all complicit, sickening really."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In this article, I was surprised to read that anyone thought &#34;freedom of the press&#34; still existed in HK at all.Once they took the boss of Apple Daily it was pretty clear.
HK is governed by one system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s my beef with estimates.I can give you a really really accurate estimate, but in order to do so we&#39;re going to have to spend a lot of time going through the request, building and verifying actual requirements, designing the solution and then validating it.The process will require dev resources, business resources and probably people from the support team and will take a lot of time.I&#39;m happy to do it. It&#39;s actually my favorite part of the job. But the business invariably doesn&#39;t want to spend the time and money to do that.They&#39;d generally much rather start with a fairly vague description of what they need and let the devs keep throwing stuff against the wall and see what sticks.Good and accurate estimation is not just a dev function. It requires buy in and input from the entire business stack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Estimation that isn&#39;t based on previous data - I think the article that follows this one refers to it as &#34;Evidence-Based Scheduling&#34; - is almost entirely a waste of time.We analyzed our five+ year history of estimates vs actual time, and our standard deviation was larger than our mean. It was ridiculous how wrong our estimates were. The problem was in what was being estimated - coding time. Developers would get asked how long a task would take, and only think about the time spent sitting in front of a computer, typing code, and not the other time - waiting for other resources or people to finish tasks that you depend on, sick days, software and hardware issues, etc.The only way to accurately take those unforeseen factors into account is by analyzing previously completed tasks that have similar scope. Even then you can only get close.A couple people have mentioned weather forecasting as a similar endeavor - but meteorologists don&#39;t just guess, they analyze previous data.Estimation that isn&#39;t based on concrete data is a fool&#39;s game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paid overtime will fix scheduling. Scheduling is bad because the cost falls on the employees, not the employer. If crunches resulted in time and a half, double time, and triple time, scheduling would get fixed.As I&#39;ve pointed out before, film scheduling is an established discipline. Making a movie is much more complex than a software project. There are a lot of moving parts. Things get changed. There are people problems, weather problems, and transportation problems. Most importantly, if a film project goes into crunch mode, everybody starts getting paid overtime. This reduces the tendency to underestimate.There are also third party estimates. Hollywood has something called &#34;completion bonds&#34;. A completion bond is an insurance policy for the investors. Either they get a showable movie into theaters, or the completion bond company has to pay the investors. A completion bond costs about 5% of the cost of the film.Completion bond companies do their own estimates. Estimation inputs are &#34;script, budget, shooting schedule, (and) résumés of key crew.&#34; To survive, they need a net error near zero - they must overestimate and underestimate about equally. Consistent underestimation would put them out of business.Since they do a lot of this, they have scripts and financial data from previous movies. They can look up &#34;car chase, metropolitan area, 2 minutes screen time&#34; for how much that cost the last 50 times someone did it. They also have director info, like &#34;director X averages 2.5 takes per scene&#34;. All this info is collected across multiple film companies.The completion bond company has the right to intervene if the project starts to go over budget. Worst case, they can fire the director and take over the production. This is rare, but it happens. &#34;Malcolm X&#34; by Spike Lee (1992) and &#34;Bad Girls&#34; are examples. &#34;Malcolm X&#34; was an epic movie, a bit too epic - it runs 3 hours and 22 minutes - and somebody had to say no to Spike Lee. &#34;Bad Girls&#34; (1994) was just a botched production, and the bond company put in their own director to try to salvage something. It still lost money, but did reach theaters.That a completion bond company can fire the director puts teeth in this system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like the conspiracy theory/practice distinction and I hope Ed will write more on how we could pay more attention to the latter.Noam Chomsky presents lots of evidence about outrageous acts of American government in his books, and he always claimed that it all comes from official and open government sources. Yet most people are either unaware or refuse to believe it anyway.These are conspiracies done openly, because almost nobody wants to go through and find the smoking gun in the heaps of otherwise boring government documents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Conspiracies happen constantly because people conspire to do nefarious things all the time. However nowadays the framework for evaluating those nefarious things (conspiracy theories) has been completely negated by those in corporate media conflating it with insanity and baseless, nonsensical accusations.And there&#39;s a reason for that, which Snowden touches on. Namely, the world in its current form is largely run by such nefarious schemes. The bad guys won a long time ago. And by taking away the language we might even use to talk about what they did, and the scale of it, they have further insulated their power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed people treat conspiracy theories with the same level of validity or non-validity regardless of the facts or details.Things like flat earth conspiracies have now inexplicably been lumped into the likes of those who believe in things like.https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/758989641/the-cias-secret-que...Or just question in general the motivation behind the decisions made by those in charge.There are some very obviously dumb conspiracies that have no basis in reality, there are some possibly far out there conspiracies that could have some merit and then there&#39;s conspiracies that seemed ridiculous but actually turned out to be true.The world is not black and white...it&#39;s very grey.Again, I find it odd these things tend to all be labeled under one giant &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; label. Much like any theories, some are possibly valid, others very obviously not.Categorizing these things together as has been done in recent years makes no sense."</p>
