								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like this approach.Far to often I’ve interviewed at places and been grilled by the interviewer only to find out when you start the quality isn’t great, what you where grilled on you won’t be working on “as that’s to hard”  or “we don’t do that” despite being grilled on it and the level of skill not to great they just want senior people. It’s the bait and switch.At least being taken through existing code you know what you are getting yourself in to. Also looking at the current open pull requests and closed pull requests to see the standard and speed of delivery. Bonus points for no PR’s and trunk driven development as that shows a very mature team.My simpler interviews have often been with companies that have held a higher bar than the ones with tougher interviews. Those companies have often been sink or swim though and if you don’t make the grade you’ll be kicked out pretty quick. My last company had a reputation for new starts disappearing and not great that way, but the team was probably the strongest bunch of people I’ve ever worked with as only do good survived."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly what I started doing at my company a few years back. You are presented with a complete app written in the stack we use. This app has some bugs we will solve to get it working (nothing that&#39;s a trick... actual, commonly encountered bugs that have all the error messaging you need to solve them). Once it is working you will walk me through a particular flow of the app, explaining what is going on and why we do it this way. There are optimization opportunities (purely optional, there for you to notice), areas we can dig into if we choose (or if I feel the need to). If you tear through it we can examine a different flow in the app. Perhaps we could discuss the database structure and how it might be improved or changed, maybe we dig into some CSS or into some GraphQL or any other aspect that we need to. I&#39;ve had people stumped and unable to continue but the vast majority of devs can make a good stab at it, even if they are not familiar with the specific stack. The best devs are barely slowed down by such unfamiliarity and can still reason, logically, about the code.So far I&#39;ve had really positive feedback from job candidates. A couple even described it as their favorite interview ever! I feel like it has worked well, given the people we have ended up hiring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s interesting, I&#39;ve never heard testing code skills by reading instead of writing.An example would have been nice though, as I&#39;m not sure how to find a piece of code that does something standalone that is too large to grasp in 20 minutes yet make a reasonable prediction at the output. That combination seems kind of weird.I wonder how well it would work to modify OP&#39;s idea and present a candidate with some code that has a bug in it (you reveal what the bug is to save time, they&#39;ll need to understand the code anyhow) and you ask them how they&#39;d fix it. First broadly, like what approach, then actually write part of it.To take my own advice and make the discussion more concrete, I should add an example. Random script from my github: https://github.com/lucb1e/randomdirectory/blob/master/random...To prepare for the interview, one could add an argument like -h to show usage (in the same style as -v is currently implemented), then tell the candidate that the bug is that passing -vh executes neither -v nor -h (one would commonly expect it to execute both). Fixing this requires a &#39;structural&#39; change to this little bit of code, but it&#39;s small enough to easily grasp and implement. The candidate might propose to loop over each character after a single hyphen to fix this, or they might propose to throw out this custom reinventing-the-wheel and use a proper arg parsing library. Either is fine, but they should be prepared to write the code (in any language, they can write just the changes in C, Python, JS, or whatever language they&#39;re comfortable with).Has anyone tried such an interview coding question?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello HN! Here is some context to decorate this announcement:The Zig self-hosted compiler codebase consists of 197,549 lines of code.There are several different backends, each at varying levels of completion. Here is how many behavior tests are passing:       LLVM: 1101/1138 (97%)
       WASM:  919/1138 (81%)
          C:  740/1138 (65%)
     x86_64:  725/1138 (64%)
        arm:  490/1138 (43%)
    aarch64:  411/1138 (36%)

As you might guess, the one that this milestone is celebrating is the LLVM backend, which is now able to compile the compiler itself, despite 3% of the behavior tests not yet passing.The new compiler codebase, which is written in Zig instead of C++, uses significantly less memory, and represents a modest performance improvement. There are 5 more upcoming compiler milestones which will have a more significant impact on compilation speed. I talked about this in detail last weekend at the Zig meetup in Milan, Italy[1].There are 3 main things needed before we can ship this new compiler to everyone.1. bug fixes2. improved compile errors3. implement the remaining runtime safety checksIf you&#39;re looking forward to giving it a spin, subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/89) to be notified when it is landed in master branch.Edit: The talk recording about upcoming compiler milestones is uploaded now [1][1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqDdWEiSwMM"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Zig’s compatibility with C is such a valuable feature.I also wish we could rewrite everything in a modern language, but the reality is that we can’t and that if we could, it would take a LONG time. The ability to start new projects, or extend existing ones, with a modern and more ergonomic language—Zig—and be able to seamlessly work with C is incredible.I look forward to the self-hosted compiler being complete, and hopefully a package manager in the future. I’d really like to start using Zig for more projects."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is way overdue for long form tweets! (Musk&#39;s response)this may very well be the first thing in my life I&#39;ve agreed with Musk on. By god scrolling through an entire essay chopped up with random replies and profile links thrown in because you have to click &#34;show more replies&#34; (which pops up twice?) over and over is awful. Just link to a Twitlonger.On yishan&#39;s actual points I agree though. Companies moderate haphazardly and improvise and they care about their bottom-line and to extinguish shitstorms. There&#39;s no coherent ideological bias on any sufficiently large social network, they just pivot to whatever is causing chaos on any given weekday.One important point stuck somewhere in the middle is his observation that in the physical world, no public square, or public debate looks like what&#39;s on display on internet social networks. All of them have rules, civility is a thing, if you&#39;re crazy someone&#39;s likely going to throw you out, there&#39;s identity instead of anonymity and so on. Maybe provocatively, &#34;cancel culture&#34; is simply culture. Culture is a bunch of rituals, rules, coercions, customs and traditions that predominantly tell us what not to so so we don&#39;t behave like a bunch of naked apes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve sometimes wondered if the way American media and culture treat people like Musk, Bezos, Gates is that we have no royalty -- there&#39;s no hereditary monarchy and indeed the old money keeps a studiously low profile.Do human cultures just need kings and princes? Is there a special kind of celebrity niche that the billionaire businessman fills that occupies an ancient hierarchical part of our society?I read Yishan&#39;s post here as kind of like a duke commissioning an epic poem in the hopes it&#39;ll influence the king. Maybe it&#39;ll work -- he shot his shot, and he&#39;s a pro at putting in just the right Internet comments in just the right place. But I wonder why I&#39;m so fascinated about seeing this conversation between these two nobles. Is this how the English lower classes saw their royalty in the 17th century? Did they chatter about the king&#39;s foibles on the street while they were out costermongering?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thread is an interesting perspective on social media &#34;censorship&#34; that you don&#39;t hear often.Of course everyone working at a social media company has an ideological bias, and that can come out in the product. But consider also that the latest censorship controversy creates negative PR, makes people leave the platform, attracts regulatory attention, and ultimately, hurts the company&#39;s profits. Content moderators are at least as worried about that as they are about making sure their ideological opponents aren&#39;t given a voice.Social media companies are in the unenviable position of playing referee in the culture war, and like referees in any sport, they&#39;re going to constantly be criticized for doing it, right or wrong. These companies are global and universal, and there&#39;s no way they can satisfy all parties. Sometimes, the values of left and right, or Iran and the US, or Israel and Palestine, are just irreconcilable. You&#39;re better off just trying to avoid as much trouble as possible, and avoiding negative media attention.Reddit is probably the most ham-fisted example of this approach. Their content moderation is pretty hands off, but as soon as any subreddit attracts negative attention, it&#39;s quarantined or banned, no matter if the controversy is justified or not. When Russia invaded Ukraine and Russia Is Bad Now, they just straight up banned /r/russia and any link to an .ru domain! That does nothing to address the conflict, but it does keep those NYT opinion pieces from showcasing Problematic Russian Bot Behavior on Reddit.I&#39;ll note that I don&#39;t think this model fully explains moderation policies at Twitter or other social media sites. I genuinely believe moderation leans left due to an ideological monoculture (I&#39;ve seen it first hand). But it&#39;s important to recognize the difficult situation social media sites are in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey everyone, OP here.I, like many others tend to waffle between loving and hating social media, so this is my take on what I think a better solution looks like. This is something I&#39;ve been working on for the past couple of months and a concept that I think will be though provoking, if nothing else, to the HN community. If you want to read more on my thoughts and the story behind this, you can check out my blog post here: https://dev.to/duensing/introducing-slow-social-4a90Besides that, I&#39;m happy to answer questions and take criticism."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a much bigger problem than Heroku.There are countless SaaS applications asking for full-repo  access to Github (all the source code, with write access).- Productboard- Bugsnag- Sentry- Skylight- Percy- CodeTree- DataboxThere are heaps of others, these are just some on top the of my mind. A ticking supply chain attack waiting to happen, since these companies make themselves into alluring hacking targets.Most of them need access only to issues (a few need read access to code or recent commits, almost none need write).Solution:- Let customers give granular access (only issues, only read to source code, etc) when the integration is setup. This is possible with Github&#39;s APIs.- Try to use push instead of pull where possible, i.e. provide a CLI tool to use with Github actions or use Github&#39;s webhooks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Additionally, we recommend disconnecting Heroku from your GitHub repositories.I have respect for the Heroku/Salesforce Security team for willing to ask users to perform this action.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might feel &#34;overengineered&#34; to people outside the Japanese society, but it actually just solves common issues here and it&#39;s not overengineering.
 The rotating mechanism is the easiest to see this.First, Kanji signs are more detailed than the alphabet and uneven lines can make it really ugly/hard to read. Same issue with breaking lead, causes ugliness.Second, traditionally handwriting in Japan have been seen as a way to measure one&#39;s upbringing; you can fake looks and style but if your handwriting is bad, that signals that your parents didn&#39;t raise you well. This was(and still is in some places) the reason resumes have to be handwritten.So tools that helps your handwriting had uses beyond just utility.(my handwriting is garbage and I&#39;m happy IT and tech jobs doesn&#39;t check this)"</p>

Bravo Jet Pens for avoiding that dark pattern."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"JetPens’ marketing is amazing.  Their online storefront is very well put together, and above all their buyer team ensures they have mountains of imported variety in every category.It’s so nice to see someone doing something well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting article and statistical analysis, but I really don&#39;t see how it concludes that the DK effect is wrong based on the analysis. The fact that the DK effect emerges with _completely random data_ is not surprising at all - in this case the intuitive null hypothesis would be that people are good at estimating their skill, therefore there would be strong a correlation between their performance and self-evaluation of said performance. If the data weren&#39;t related, then this hypothesis isn&#39;t likely, which is exactly what DK means. And indeed if you look at the plots in the article (of the completely random data), they depict a world in which people are very bad at estimating their own skill, therefore, statistically, people with lower skills tend to overestimate their skills, and experts tend to underestimate it.Also wanted to point out that in general there is no issue with looking at y - x ~ x, this is called the residual plot, and is specifically used to compare an estimate of some value vs. the value itself.That being said, the author seems very confident in their conclusion, and from the comments seems to have read a lot of related analyses, so I might be missing something. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excerpt from a newer paper by Nuhfer (2017) adds more clarity:“… Our data show that peoples&#39; self-assessments of competence, in general, reflect a genuine competence that they can demonstrate. That finding contradicts the current consensus about the nature of self-assessment. Our results further confirm that experts are more proficient in self-assessing their abilities than novices and that women, in general, self-assess more accurately than men. The validity of interpretations of data depends strongly upon how carefully the researchers consider the numeracy that underlies graphical presentations and conclusions. Our results indicate that carefully measured self-assessments provide valid, measurable and valuable information about proficiency. …”https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312107583_How_Rando..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is correct.  The effect is statistical not psychological.  It emerges even from artificial data and occurs independently of the supposed psychological justifications even for data where those justifications are clearly removed.If you adjust the experiment design to avoid introducing the auto-correlation you get data that doesn&#39;t show the DK effect at all.  Some might take issue with the adjusted experiment as using seniority related categories like &#34;sophomore&#34; and &#34;junior&#34; as skill levels has its own issues. To show the DK effect is real you need to come up with a better adjusted experiment that avoids the autocorrelation while still generating data that generates the effect. It&#39;s unclear if that&#39;s possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ha, Flash Boys 2.0 was from 2019. This blog post is literally &#34;I read a thing from three years ago and have lost faith in something that I never believed in in the first place&#34;.As someone who knows and has worked with all the people involved with the write-ups referenced in this blog post, I can pretty confidently say that the author is way way behind here. There have been some insane advancements in recent years that would blow his mind.MEV harvesting is actually an insanely fascinating field of study, and it comes down to consensus in a world where information can only move as fast as the speed of light.Front-running is a general problem where, if you can find out that someone wants to buy something, and can buy it first and sell it to the person who actually want it at a premium. This gets really interesting in the blockchain space, because Miners (Validators) decide the order of transactions, and in some cases validators can be incentivized/coerced to move around transactions in a way that might be beneficial for certain users. This is what is referred to as &#34;Miner Extractable Value&#34;.Yes it&#39;s a problem, yes there are mitigations, yes there are fun and weird ways around those mitigations, etc.This is what happens when people are incentivized to take a really good hard look at what global consensus really means. At a high level, most users don&#39;t really need to know or care about any of it, but it exists as a parasitic force constantly extracting value from the network. Still, IMO the parasites that feed off MEV are at a significant disadvantage compared with those who feed of legacy financial networks (for more on that, you can read the actual Flash Boys book https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Crypto Andys like to hand-wave about the risk of a 51% attack but consider this:&gt; This is in addition to the long-standing concentration of Ethereum mining power, with normally three and sometimes only two mining pools controlling over 50% of the mining power.There is further hand-waving about how Proof-of-Stake (over Proof-of-Waste) will magically fix these problems. But it&#39;s actually this PoW computing power that makes the network more resilient to hostile takeover.I&#39;ve heard it described that the attraction of Crypto is the essence of the American Dream: by getting rich by doing nothing while lauding how smart you are over other people. So much of Crytpo can be explained by Bitcoin FOMO. Everyone just jumps on the latest shitcoin or NFT because &#34;I&#39;m not missing out this time&#34;.Ultimately something has to create value or it will come crashing down. The only use case we really have is illegal activity. Some of that is justified on ethics grounds (eg bypassing capital controls in Venezuela). A lot of it is just shady.There&#39;s a ton of talk about the &#34;potential&#34;. So far the offshots (eg NFTs, Web3) are just ludicrous boondoggles in finding problems for a solution. I have doubts this will ever create value for the masses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While many contracts within Ethereum have clear flaws, that doesn&#39;t mean Eth as a whole is broken.Time bandit attacks go away once proof of stake finality arrives. Also, trading ought to be done in Layer 2s. Does MEV work on L2s?Re: certain token drops wasting lots of gas, it&#39;s up to the token authors to use an implementation that avoids gas wars.Once you go into claiming equivalences with P = NP, you&#39;ve lost me. Theoretical optimums are an academic game, in reality you can get 95% of the way there with heuristics.&gt; Because Ethereum transactions are programs, the halting problem means that it isn&#39;t possible to accurately predict the resources needed to execute them.Ah, more appeals to theory. They&#39;re programs with a low ceiling on the number of steps and possible codepaths. They barely even have loops half the time. Estimating isn&#39;t that hard in practice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"According to the original complaint, a few months after being interviewed by an FBI agent on returning from his trip to North Korea, Griffith had the following conversation over text messages:Griffith: I need to send 1 [REDACTED UNIT OF CRYPTOCURRENCY] between North and South Korea.
Other Guy: &#34;Isn&#39;t that in violations of sanctions?&#34;
Griffith: It is.A few day later, also in text messages to someone else:Someone: What interest does North Korea have in cryptocurrency?
Griffith: Probably avoiding sanctions... who knows.&#34;It looks like it wasn&#39;t just speaking at a conference after being denied permission from the US that got him in trouble, it looks like both before and after the trip he was working on a variety of ways to get the North Korean government more onboard with cryptocurrency, including discussions about mining ventures, moving funds in and out of the country, and offering connections with other cryptocurrency people."</p>

It&#39;s a shame that this happened.The situation is kinda similar to the one with Bobby Fischer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer&#34;In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the US government, which warned Fischer that his participation in the match would violate an executive order imposing US sanctions on Yugoslavia. The US government ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After that, Fischer lived as an émigré. In 2004, he was arrested in Japan and held for several months for using a passport that the US government had revoked. Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic passport and citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing, allowing him to live there until his death in 2008.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of comments have said &#34;stay in therapy&#34; or &#34;quit therapy&#34;, but my immediate reaction is that maybe you have the wrong (ineffective) therapist and need to switch.My spidey sense went up when you mentioned what &#34;you told your therapist&#34;, full stop. I was at least expecting &#34;what my therapist responded&#34; or &#34;what my therapist told me that didn&#39;t work&#34;. That really (spidey sense, no evidence really) implies that your therapist is having low impact.I&#39;ve had half a dozen therapists in my life. What I realized is there&#39;s a huge difference between most therapists and good ones. With a typical therapist, not much happens, you phone it in and they don&#39;t notice or call you on it. A good therapist somehow has a way of listening and then catching you properly off guard at least once or twice a session. They can stare into your soul and see through your bullshit, even when you don&#39;t notice the bullshit you&#39;re saying. If you don&#39;t feel that incisiveness, perhaps it&#39;s time to start shopping for a new therapist.Therapy really is a 100x profession."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in my late 20s, but I noticed that people live as if they are forever.They spend half of their life working for survival, preparing and planning for their (!) future.Some people die in the process and never live to see that future, 
but some people reach that point and become aware of the finite time that just elapsed.Having physical needs met is trivial in our society. 
Everything beyond is self imposed suffering by comparing oneself to others.But for what purpose? Just to have more than someone else? Just to be better than someone else?Nobody truly cares. Nobody cares about how fancy the technology is that someone built to make people click more ads online - even if that someone thinks he is doing god&#39;s work.We came to this earth naked and we will leave naked. Just like my parents did. Any material possessions and people will be left behind. Most of us will be forgotten 2 generations ahead or end up as UTF-8 characters on wikipedia.I can at least walk joyfully in the present and not suffer my imagination about the future. I can also make a conscious choice to not indulge in activities that destroy the planet for others. I don&#39;t think the older generations see it the way I do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, you have reached the zenith of your career. Congratulations. You are self-sufficient and able to provide for the financial needs of your family. This is a true victory.Now, it is time to focus on people other than yourself. Most other advice on here is awful; it amounts to different directions to run on the hedonic treadmill.Instead, you have to give back now. What good is there to be done, that only you could do? What will be worse off if you don&#39;t lend a hand? This can range from finding better ways to support and mentor your children, to donating time to tutor students in programming, to building a well in Africa. Think hard about what you really care about, and then work hard to bring that into being."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing how much collateral damage is caused by our horrible copyright laws. Mostly just so the MPA/RIAA can protect their roles as gatekeepers of what we&#39;re allowed to see and hear.They can put enormous pressure on even the wealthiest and most powerful companies to act as copyright police on their behalf. Even Google is afraid of them. ISPs are forced to spend huge amounts of time and money working for them. Now duckduckgo is being strong armed into doing a bunch of free work for them too? Maintaining lists of websites and domains to block and removing links to even non-infringing material like youtube-dl just to keep from being sued into the ground.I don&#39;t know what it&#39;ll take to rein in these guys, but I doubt the courts will be the ones to do it. So far courts seem fine with the idea that ISPs must permanently ban users from their service over nothing but repeated unsubstantiated claims of infringements which is an insane amount of power to give any industry.Has any US politician ever run on a platform that includes copyright reform?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is like the Framework laptop but it&#39;s a UK-based company that has been around for years, and with an explicit focus on Linux compatibility to boot. I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t come across them before as I&#39;ve been looking for Linux-compatible laptops for years.They do some things better than Framework such as supporting Ryzen processors, and seem a bit cheaper overall. The battery life seems like it would be better. They have a spare parts store as well and a full disassembly guide as well as an &#34;open warranty&#34;. I was never a fan of Framework&#39;s swappable ports.The biggest disadvantage seems to be that the screen is bog-standard 16:9.I&#39;m curious on the quality of the speakers, webcam, keyboard, and trackpad. I have a feeling they will not be great - in comparison to a Macbook at any rate.From reviews it looks like the trackpad is poor because it is not whole-trackpad clickable, and the keyboard is also poor due to the short key travel.Are there any other decent alternatives available in the UK?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got one of these in December 2021 and frankly love it. Got fed up with being pretty much the only person on earth who had a shitty experience with Apple Silicon, so jumped back to Linux after 17 years away. I don’t use it as a portable, or at least haven’t yet - it’s my daily driver for work and permanently plugged in to a monitor (which also is a USB hub). I opted for Manjaro and enjoy using it way more than I did the M1 macbook pro it replaced.I really like that they provide a detailed pictorial complete disassembly guide: https://support.starlabs.systems/kb/guides/starbook-mk-v-com..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangantially related, I remember reading the Asahi Linux wiki [0], and was shocked by this statement about Apple Silicon machines. It&#39;s fascinating that Apple has a reputation for being anti-libre, yet the hardware they built is arguably very libre-friendly.&gt; This puts them somewhere between x86 PCs and a libre-first system like the Talos II in terms of freedom to replace firmware and boot components; while a number of blobs are required in order to boot the system, none of those have the ability to take over the OS or compromise it post-boot (unlike, say, Intel ME and AMD PSP on recent systems, or the DMA-capable chips on the LPC bus running opaque blobs that exist on even old ThinkPads).&gt; From a security perspective, these machines may possibly qualify as the most secure general purpose computers available to the public which support third-party OSes, in terms of resistance to attack by non-owners.[0]: https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Introduction-to-Appl..."</p>

I was hopeful that I could make a full recovery which I did and then some.This new tool I believe saved my life, and I’m excited to use it for the rest of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; not necessarily meant to replace exerciseI&#39;m hoping someone can answer a question to which I&#39;ve never heard a really satisfactory answer:  Why does human health benefit from exercise whereas any kind of simple machine wears out with exercise? For example, doing a hundred stretches per day improves my health whereas stretching an elastic band 100 times per day will cause it to lose elasticity and soon destroy it. So what&#39;s the low-level mechanism by which exercise improves health in people but not in simple machines?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclosure: I own FREQ stock.The failure of the prior trial was suspected, and I believe it, due to a refractory response by overdosing the inner ear with too frequent administrations of the drug, and then testing for effect too soon. I bet even those candidates of the phase IIa trial though would, if checked on now, show some improvement.Animal research has shown that natural cochlear hair cell regeneration and resultant hearing restoration is very real, we mammals just don&#39;t have the natural cellular signaling to redifferentiate those base cells - small molecule drugs like FX322 do exactly that. I am optimistic they&#39;ll eventually find the right dosing regimen to see reliable and optimal clinical effect, and it will be a seismic advance in medicine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article says the treatment focuses on increased speech intelligibility. Speech, depending on how you define it, can occupy a fairly narrow range of the audio spectrum that humans can perceive.My hearing loss is mostly on the high end (10-12K and above) and impedes my ability to hear speech in noisy environments. More troubling has been the inability to enjoy music/sound in those upper ranges, resulting in the music lacking a certain sparkle and brilliance.I hope this therapy regenerates hair cells across the entire spectrum."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even before the poison pill was adopted, the evidence is the market wasn&#39;t taking Musk&#39;s offer seriously. That&#39;s because he was offering $54.20 per share (ha ha, 420), but the stock price never closed higher than $48.36. So almost $6/share was left on the table.Part of it is that Musk doesn&#39;t have $43B in cash, he&#39;d have to raise it or borrow it. He&#39;s worth more than that but it isn&#39;t liquid; as an officer of Tesla there are some restrictions on when he can trade. Another part is that many doubt whether Musk is serious or if he is playing games again, like the last time &#34;420&#34; appeared in a financial announcement from him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, I&#39;m not very corporate savvy and this might be a very stupid question. Is there a NON-culture/political reason for all the push back against Musk buying Twitter? From the read, this just seem to be opening the door for someone else to try and take majority control and pining away for the days of Dorsey (which, if looked at objectively, weren&#39;t great... just filling an opportunity)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand how any board can implement a “poison pill”, not just Twitter but Netflix and others, and not be found working against the interest of shareholders. Can anyone help me understand?You’re categorically changing the profile of the stock. This has a chilling effect on large investors, including but not limited just to Musk, right?Vanguard, for example, has just had its range of further investment limited arbitrarily. Isn’t that bad for all stockholders, to know that large stakeholders will not drive the price up if they somehow gain substantial belief in the company?The risk portfolio of Vanguard just went up considerably because in the case that they fully lose faith in the board, they no longer have the option of installing a friendly board, they must simply liquidate their holdings. This, in turn, makes them more skeptical of further smaller (non-takeover) investment because it’s more to liquidate and more risk.Who does this benefit besides the board? I guess I understand that the board is not beholden to the interests of all shareholders equally, and I’m not suggesting that this doesn’t benefit some shareholders, but where does the line start?"</p>

If you do it the naive way, it won’t work, and you’ll end up losing the contents of your file:    awk &#39;{do_stuff()}&#39; myfile.txt | sort -u | column --table &gt; myfile.txt

The shell will truncate myfile.txt before awk (or whatever command) has a chance to read it. So you can use sponge instead, which waits until it reads EOF to truncate/write the file.    awk &#39;{do_stuff()}&#39; myfile.txt | sort -u | column --table | sponge myfile.txt"</p>

`vipe` will let me remove some of the branch names from the list, before they get passed to the delete command."</p>

It adds a timestamp at the beginning of each input line.I often use it with tee to save the log output of any command.  $ ping google.com | ts &#39;[%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%.S]&#39; | tee /tmp/ping.log

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool, but maybe the README&#39;s disclaimer should also warn that using YouTube&#39;s private APIs is against their Terms of Service[0], specifically this section:  The following restrictions apply to your use of the Service. You are not allowed to:
  (...)
  3. access the Service using any automated means (such as robots, botnets or scrapers) except (a) in the case of public search engines, in accordance with YouTube’s robots.txt file; or (b) with YouTube’s prior written permission; 

It would be great if YouTube updated their ToS to permit this because that could unlock some really interesting innovation. Until then, devs should at least be aware that building a product with these APIs is risky.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms"</p>

You are not allowed to leave the store until you have finished writing your manuscript or writing project.Sounds like a cute idea.

I think there&#39;s some room to improve here, e.g. an AR ghost overlay of previous frames as well as ML extracted frames from pure paper without having to print a template (both of which I believe are feasible). But overall I love that people are experimenting with this stuff (and wouldn&#39;t want to react negatively here in any way to discourage this type of work).Some might argue moving from digital to pen and paper is a step down but I&#39;d argue the opposite. I&#39;d love and look forward to a possible future where we move digital advancements into the analog world in this way. As Theil says you can barely tell the difference between this world and the 80s if you remove cell phones and computers, but things like this are a cool way to hopefully get us closer to computers aiding more natural forms of interaction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi Dominic, thanks for open sourcing the library. I have quite a few questions though:1. Marijn has built an awesome open source richtext library (https://prosemirror.net/) which has a huge plugin ecosystem and bindings with a bunch of front-end frameworks (including React). Is there any specific motivation behind building one from scratch?2. How is this different from Facebook&#39;s own DraftJS lib?3. What&#39;s the story of realtime collaboration support with OT/CRDT? Prosemirror had this in mind when designing its state model and delta model, so it comes with out of the box support for realtime collaborations. Can we expect the same with Lexical?4. What&#39;s the cross platform strategy for Lexical? If I store the editor&#39;s state as JSON on the server, how will I render it on devices and native desktop apps?We&#39;ve built our own library on top of Prosemirror to power the comments and feedback sections of Zoho Writer - https://writer.zoho.comI&#39;m always looking out for better approaches/alternatives in this space and I&#39;m curious how different Lexical is. Thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the big frustrations with DraftJS is that Facebook moved on (which is understandable), but the core repo wasn’t given control to the community, so patches and updates couldn’t be pulled in. Obviously it’s open source and could be hard forked, but that’s not ideal.I’d be curious if there are plans internally to make sure Lexical continues
to be supported by Facebook and doesn’t end up with the same fate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The examples shown on the site are code editing. Which puts it in direct competition with the more established Monaco from Microsoft [1].Competition is welcome, but the description sounds like this is more of a library than a finished product (which Monaco isn&#39;t), and if so, some examples showing how to take advantage of that would have been helpful.[1] https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Twitter was at $70 per share a year ago. So what? Jack Dorsey was CEO a year ago, too. The share price was $33 less than a month ago.But, despite an absolutely incredible roller-coaster news cycle, things have been definitely trending down at Twitter ($33/share last month), which was reflected in its share price. The current executive team (and Dorsey) had wasted time focusing on things that didn&#39;t matter instead of things that did matter.Boards have several fiduciary duties to the shareholders. As an all-cash offer, this generates for the shareholders a substantial return with NO RISK, and so the board has a serious legal obligation to carefully review this offer and make a decision.If the board elects to reject this offer, then their reasons for doing so need to be very clearly elucidated, because, as Twitter is a public company, they would have to see something in their crystal ball that the rest of the market does not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s ignore personality and societal issues for a moment and look at the value proposition. The &#39;best and final offer&#39; of $54.20 per share is just too low to be acceptable for major investors.Just  over year ago, Twitter shares traded at about $70 per share. Musk&#39;s offer is about 25% lower than last years peak. There&#39;s no reason to assume Twitter shares can&#39;t reach the same levels ever again, nothing much has changed fundamentally over a year.Musk&#39;s offer is a cash only offer. $43 billion is a lot of cash. That&#39;s a lot of Tesla shares to sell, or massive loan. If Musk thinks Twitter is that valuable to take such risks,  current major  investors will probably want to unlock that value themselves.I think the takeover offer is just as believable as last week&#39;s announcement that Musk was joining the Twitter board."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this post.While the author clearly feels bad about the fact that they&#39;ve lost his community and that GitHub didn&#39;t restore it (which is honestly what any of us would&#39;ve felt under similar circumstances), they&#39;re also focusing towards the future and using their personal experience as a parable all of us can learn from.Lesson 1 on UI design I think is really important. I often think scary popup boxes are enough to get people to think about what they&#39;re doing, but this example clearly demonstrates that what&#39;s important is to use design not to scare (alone?), but to convey the information which makes a dangerous action dangerous as well. I also really like the fact that when the action isn&#39;t dangerous, the distractions (&#34;Type this repo&#39;s name&#34;, etc) just go away. It&#39;s super intuitive, and (for a newbie designer like me) really helps build an intuition for various design principles put in action.Lesson 2, which was to use soft deletes, is something I have more thoughts about. I assume that the cascading done on GitHub would be done on a FK constraint, but I&#39;m not really sure how you&#39;d do a &#34;cascading soft delete&#34; without making some kind of manual cascading logic? If anyone&#39;s aware of a standard way to accomplish this, please do let me know. Of course, the best way may just be to simplify the model so they aren&#39;t needed at all haha.As designers and developers we&#39;ve been given a chance to sharpen our toolkit. Thanks, HTTPie! You&#39;ve gained a new star :)Edit: Changed GitHub couldn&#39;t restore to GitHub didn&#39;t restore, as pointed out by @ncmncm (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31033758#31034195)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The problem is that the box looks exactly the same for repos with no commits and stars and for repos with a decade-long history and 55k stargazers and watchers. And it says “Warning: this is a potentially destructive action.”It seems a bit much to expect the website to show you a warning of different levels of severity depending on the stars a repos has, particularly when the standard message is pretty severe and explicit. It even makes you type the name of the repo you want to make private before proceeding - I don&#39;t see how that wouldn&#39;t make anyone snap out of autopilot. I sympathise with the author&#39;s misfortune but it is pretty hard to look at that warning dialog and conclude that he was not sufficiently warned of the consequences or given a chance to reflect.I find it disappointing that all of the lessons supposedly learned from this ordeal are lessons for other people, not the author. Surely lesson #1 should have been &#34;check what repo you&#39;re in before taking destructive actions&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sure, the author should be responsible.Yes, GitHub should have a better UX around this action.But...There is another thing to consider:Is it really necessary that a repo that is accidentally made private and then made public should lose its stars anyway?Is that really what the repo owner or the people who starred the repo even want to happen?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some sites that are so useless and they have never ever helped me once, yet somehow they are always in the top 10 results1. w3schools2. pinterest3. microsoft answers and all microsoft websites actually (it always looks like the person asking the question is asking exactly what i want, but unlike stackexchange, there are seldom any useful answers)4. all the code clones for SO5. all alternative to / review sites like capterra, g2, alternativeto, etc. They might have some good suggestions but they always hide the link to the software/site and instead link it to their spammy page. So you have to select part of the link and then re-search it on Google. Doing this for OSS projects can sometimes lead to a whole new rabbit hole.6. The best of lists. Google for the love of god, please ban them.. they are always always SEO spam and product placements. Often the blog post itself says &#34;to put your product on this list pay us a $1000 and we will include them in our list.&#34;7. Quora and similar answer sites.. okay it&#39;s a mixed bag but you have to be very careful on these sites as most often the answers are just spam. I never read any answer with a link in it.  But I think it&#39;s more Quora&#39;s problem than google. But if google is strict with them they may do a better job at moderating I guess. Also now quora hides answers and asks for a payment. Did they learn nothing from experts-exchange!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know google search is probably not the same as google flights, but I spent a few hours recently (over a few days) using google flights and it was a delight to use compared to the Expedia children.We had a bereavement in the family and had to book multiple independent tickets because we could not travel together. This was just after the Ukraine war started so prices had gone through the roof. Exact number of days was not that important as compared to the price and the duration and using google flights UI to slice and dice the data was such a joy. Want to freeze the airline and look at the alternatives - which include from and to dates, number of days of trips, or freeze any other parameter and analyze others, the response was sub-second. Did not eventually book through them since I did not want to get into the google payment system (they offer booking through others that I did not explore).On the opposite side was Expedia children where they would show a price of 2800 and when you click the price invariably it has gone up to 3600. Again. And again. And again. Not sure if that problem existed with google although I paid the exact same price as the airline as shown by google, it could just be a coincidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one thing I wish that Google offered would be the ability to blacklist sites for a period (coud be fixed - say 6 months).So damn annoying when the top search results all lead to shitty SEO-optimised sites that use a whole page to blather on and on, leading to a tiny information nugget at the end. No value, just excellent SEO scamming.As these scam artists get better and better at this, Google gets less and less useful.When I see a site like that, I can be quite sure there is no value to me from that site. I want to blacklist it - not forever (though I&#39;d settle for that) but so I don&#39;t see it in search results again.The crazy thing is that this could even be a benefit for Google themselves. They could aggregate these signals and use them to identify SEO scammers, since their algorithms clearly can&#39;t. I&#39;m sure that Google aren&#39;t happy with the lacklustre performance of their search in modern times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 10 years ago, I had a internship at Newell Rubbermaid. As part of the experience, the entire group of interns across all the brands got to have lunch with the CEO and basically ask him anything we wanted.At some point, someone asked about his biggest regret. We all expected some business blunder, but he said that he was offered an executive position by Kraft to lead their Asian segment, and that his wife really did not want him to take the job because it would require them to move to that region. He regretted not listening to her, because it ended up being the catalyst that dissolved their marriage.We were all stunned silent, and you could tell that he was genuinely remorseful and so vulnerable in that moment. There are only a handful of moments in that internship that I vividly remember, but that was by far the most impactful one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of folks are misinterpreting this article, or just using it as a jumping off point to get something off their chest.This article is not literally about the dirty dish. It&#39;s not even about compromise. Rather, the article is really about having healthy communication with your partner.The author&#39;s wife was trying to communicate to him: &#34;when you do X, I feel like Y, and it hurts me.&#34;But he wasn&#39;t hearing it. Not really. Now maybe his wife wasn&#39;t communicating as effectively as she could. But the author seems to indicate that she was and that he could have done more to recognize what she was saying and to empathize with her. He didn&#39;t get it, and now he clearly regrets it. It&#39;s too bad a healthy relationship didn&#39;t come out of that, but sometimes there&#39;s just too much damage.My wife and I have been together for 33 years, married for 26 of those (we met in HS). I&#39;m extremely fortunate that she&#39;s empathetic, compassionate, and has the patience of Job. Because it turns out that for a large portion of our marriage, I behaved like an asshole. She&#39;s not confrontational, while I thrive on it. We had a rule never to let a day end angry at each other, but mostly due to faults on my side she wasn&#39;t always heard because I wasn&#39;t open to listening to her. This built a lot of resentment. It came to a head years ago, but we worked through it and our relationship is healthier than it&#39;s ever been.&#34;You&#39;re not wrong Walter; you&#39;re just an asshole.&#34;The hard work in a relationship isn&#39;t compromise. That&#39;s table stakes. The hard work is communication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My relationship just ended for mostly similar reasons (it wasn&#39;t just glasses in the sink, it was a few other things I did that she considered disrespectful that seemed minor to me)I was the only one working and paying for the apartment, her hobbies, and school, but things like the above would escalate into long arguments that I would ask to defer. The problem was, I would sometimes forget details that were important to her if we postponed an argument for a few days, so she wanted to have them now and that was disruptive of my work (I WFH, she studies from home). I might miss an entire day of work because of some minor thing that exploded into a 6 hour argument, while I was trying to disengage the whole time, but couldn&#39;t.A couple weeks ago I had enough, and decided I needed more autonomy, and moved out. I didn&#39;t want that to be the end of relationship, but for her it was the end.Not sure what my point is, I just wanted to get it off my chest. Sometimes these seemingly minor things may just be a sign of deeper incompatibilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like they&#39;re trying to make an insidious suggestion about the usage of these. IMO, there&#39;s likely a good reason - user experience.At a hardware level, grabbing the microphone can take time. Even worse that timing is inconsistent across devices, workloads, etc. That leads to a bad experience when unmuting and needing to delay your commentary. The solution to this is to keep the microphone on, but mute at a software level. This way the mic is always hot and ready to relay audio as fast as the software can switch.I&#39;d be somewhat willing to bet continue to stream audio is also a quality assurance mechanism. Some networks will shape traffic according to load. A quick jump in bandwidth can introduce unexpected jitter and latency. By continuing to stream audio (but not necessarily process or re-transmit), video conferencing can better ensure an un-interupted experience.----With that being said, if you really care about privacy, consider getting a hardware mute microphone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Meet at least it&#39;s very obvious to tell they do this because if you talk while muted, they will show a pop-up saying that you&#39;re talking but you&#39;re muted.Whether this functionality is justification for more nefarious data usage remains to be seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Deaf person, the notification annoyed the heck out of me and there are not even an option to disable the notification. I muted my mic because I am Deaf and I don&#39;t use my voice to communicate with my fellow Deaf friends over Zoom/Teams.And there is no option to disable Zoom joining-room audio (the one that when you join the room, Zoom present the option to ask which microphone you want to enable). Why would I need to enable the microphone if I am signing to my Deaf boss? Deaf communities have major grief with those notifications.At least, I can disable the microphone access in my macOS and Zoom won&#39;t complain. However disabling mic permission in iPadOS will make Zoom to whine about it. Every time I join a meeting, it will let me know that the microphone access is disabled and &#34;kindly&#34; asked me to enable it. In Windows, I can deny the microphone access to Zoom in the Windows setting, however for some reason that made Zoom to crash."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d just like to add to this:  I find it absolutely reprehensible that The White House is trying to blame this on Russia, even coining a phrase &#34;the putin price hike&#34;.Inflation is hurting Americans, and the war in Ukraine is killing Ukrainians.  The idea that these people would try to use one of these things to advantage themselves politically instead of addressing the suffering that their policies are causing (and changing course) is reprehensible to me.There is a daily White House press briefing that I suggest everybody watch (you can 2x speed through it).  Here is a link to today&#39;s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07-AMwJbXQYJust the way that they talk about this is so...vile.  8.5% inflation is a nightmare.  You&#39;re in charge.  Take ownership of that, and for the love of god stop trying to use the massacre of innocent people in Ukraine is a political tool for youself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stepping back from the numbers and into the realm of personal anecdotes:1. I was listening the radio a couple weeks ago and the DJ invited people to call in and talk about the mask mandate being lifted (in Toronto). Woman calls in, says she went to the grocery store, got three bags of groceries, $146. The dj asks &#34;and... were people wearing masks?&#34; &#34;oh yeah, some were&#34; says the woman before going on to explain how she paid $14.50 for a roll of aluminum foil. The topic was masks and the caller didn&#39;t even want to talk about that, the cost of goods was her top and only issue.2. Standing in a park, an older gentleman is walking by with two small bags of groceries in his hands. I look at him to greet him as he passes, but he walks straight up to me as though he wants to address me. He stops in front of me, looks right in my eyes, lifts his groceries and says &#34;FORTY DOLLARS! Too much money!!&#34; (English was not his first language.) I directed him to the discount grocery, he confirmed that&#39;s where he is already shopping, and it&#39;s a green grocer with dry goods so I know his bags contained no (costly) meat, just vegetables and maybe some bread, pasta, or eggs.I frequently hear of &#34;inflation&#34; etc. on the news or economic reports, but this is different. I have never been approached by strangers on the street who are so frustrated and shocked by price hikes they couldn&#39;t walk all the way home without telling someone, even a stranger. This economic situation is different from any I have experienced in my ~40 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest story here is in shelter prices.https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-pri...March saw a continuation of a year-long trend in which YoY shelter inflation accelerated by almost exactly an additional 0.3% each month. March came in at 5%, 0.3% higher than February&#39;s 4.7%, and so on.Shelter is the largest category in the CPI basket, and it is critical for a reason. It isn&#39;t coming from Ukraine. It mostly isn&#39;t coming from supply chain bottlenecks and shipping container shortages. It isn&#39;t discretionary. And most importantly, it&#39;s a deeply lagging indicator with a long way still to go to catch up to the current activity in the housing and rental markets.My expectation is to see this trend continue. Base year effects (in the second derivative) might slow it down a bit, but by June we could be looking at almost 6% inflation in shelter alone.And remember -- a linearly increasing growth rate is faster than exponential price growth.Interest rate hikes may help, but the dynamics are such that they&#39;ll need to make things worse before they make things better."</p>

Most of them are just bash scripts, many of which have now reached a complexity so high that I wish I&#39;d started writing them in a different language but it&#39;s too late now. The majority of the rest are Python.Off the top of my head, the most used ones are:* A replacement front-end for &#34;tar&#34; and various compressors* A script to synchronize my music library to a compressed version for playing in my car* A secure-but-readable password generator* A system to batch compress folders full of video files. (For ripped blu-ray discs, mostly.)* A replacement front-end for &#34;ffmpeg&#34;, see above* A &#34;sanity check&#34; program for my internet connection to see if the problem is me, or Comcast* A front-end for &#34;rm&#34; that shows a progress bar when deleting thousands of files.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes. And it’s a strange one.I made a program to gender swap any text you put into it and then got a book deal to rewrite and illustrate Fairy Tales. It’s been published around the world.https://genderswappedfairytales.comThe idea is to shine a light on the original versions but it also creates a lot of never-written-before characters. A lot of brave princesses and lady-beasts, but also men desperately wanting children and being rewarded for kindness.I wrote the gender swap algorithm in Swift. It seemed like it would just be a simple auto replace type thing when I started but there’s some weird things in English, for example with his/him/her/hers where they don’t swap back and forth sensibly and you have to understand the context.It was his &gt; it was hers.It was his sword &gt; it was her swordSo I ended up down this rabbit hole of natural language processing to break up each sentence into verbs, nouns etc to work out the correct words to use. Even tried training an AI to do it based on the finished swapped text but a whole bunch of rules worked more reliably."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t Tor-like multi-hop (but is similar to other multi-hop VPN providers out there). A proper multi-hop would happen across two different vendors in control of two different networks, as it were.The iCloud Relay paper outlined a pretty private and secure design [0] (and the intention to standardize it via IETF would probably make it simpler to self-host such a solution [1][2]). Among the VPNs, orchid.com&#39;s distributed VPN stands out as a cross-provider multi-hop solution whose privacy guarantees are closer to Tor&#39;s.Eventually the hope is HTTP (www) itself bakes in desirable privacy properties, so regular users don&#39;t have to pay the cost of multi-hops [3].[0] Overview: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/111/materials/slides-11...[1] https://ietf-wg-masque.github.io/[2] https://tfpauly.github.io/privacy-proxy/[3] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ohai-ohttp/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use (and really like!) Mullvad, but have never tried the app, preferring to use my existing OpenVPN clients with the profiles Mullvad provides.This isn&#39;t because I have any reason to mistrust their app, but just because if I&#39;ve already got a perfectly serviceable client on my device, why add another binary to do the same thing?But I would be interested to hear, from folks who have used the app, what you like and don&#39;t like about it. In particular, I&#39;ve had some headaches setting up split tunneling/proxying via OpenVPN - I was never all that good at its config language - and I&#39;m wondering if the Mullvad app might make those easier to achieve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m wondering how this compares to Apple’s iCloud Private Relay.Mullvad is trying to increase their transparency and make sure users can trust them which is great. But would there be a way for them to make it so that users do not have to trust them? What if the second server was hosted by another entity?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My first attempt uses the small alpine image, which already packages thttpd:  # Install thttpd
  RUN apk add thttpd

Wouldn&#39;t you want to use the --no-cache option with apk, e.g.:  RUN apk add --no-cache thttpd

It seems to slightly help with the container size:  REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
  thttpd-nocache   latest    4a5a1877de5d   7 seconds ago    5.79MB
  thttpd-regular   latest    655febf218ff   41 seconds ago   7.78MB

It&#39;s a bit like cleaning up after yourself with apt based container builds as well, for example (although this might not always be necessary):  # Apache web server
  RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y apache2 libapache2-mod-security2 &amp;&amp; apt-get clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists /var/cache/apt/archives

But hey, that&#39;s an interesting goal to pursue! Even though personally i just gave up on Alpine and similar slim solutions and decided to just base all my containers on Ubuntu instead: https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/using-ubuntu-as-the-base-fo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is remarkably a good hack and I did learn quite a bit after reading the post, I&#39;m simply curious about the motivation behind it? A docker image even if it&#39;s a few MBs with Caddy/NGINX should ideally be just pulled once on the host and sit there cached. Assuming this is OP&#39;s personal server and there&#39;s not much churn, this image could be in the cache forever until the new tag is pushed/pulled. So, from a &#34;hack&#34; perspective, I totally get it, but from a bit more pragmatic POV, I&#39;m not quite sure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve repeatedly asked Atlassian if:1. They can confirm that they have backups of our data (about a thousand stories, substantial confluence, opsgenie history, and three service desks).2. Will our integrations, configuration, and customizations also be recovered, or will we need to rebuild those once our data is recovered?I have received no response, and no human is even willing to acknowledge those questions. The service desk staff ignore them as if I never asked. Repeatedly.Also, I&#39;ve been asking around, and haven&#39;t been able to find a single story from somebody that can confirm that they were down, who has had their data recovered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding the backup restores:I once worked a company that had a data loss issue. There was nothing else we could do, we had exhausted every option we had over almost 40 hours. At the end of the second day, it was decided to restore from backup.We had done this before, as a test. It took about 12 hours to restore the data and another 12 hours to import the data and get back up and running.One small thing was different this time, and it had huge consequences. As a cost-saving measure, an engineer had changed the location of our backups to the cold-storage tier offered by our cloud provider. All backups, not just &#39;old&#39; ones.This added 2 additional days to our recovery time, for a total of five days. Interestingly enough, even though we offered a full month&#39;s refund to all of our customers, not even half of them took us up on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember finding out one of the senior managers from my company ended up as head of software at Atlassian.

(B) it&#39;s with angles,
(C) the thunderbolt ↯ is commonly used for &#34;not&#34; or more specifically for dis-proof in this area and(D) at least by my 30 s internet search on a mobile phone I couldn&#39;t find any other &#34;no-angle&#34; or &#34;no-right-angle&#34; symbol.Someone could argue that usually you use a simple strike through as like as in ≠ (unequal), ∉ (not-element-of) or ∅ (empty set) but I would say it was chosen to avoid confusion in this case. The angle itself (without the &#34;no/not&#34;) consists of only to orthogonal lines so it would be kinda complicated to &#34;strike it though&#34; in any direction without ambiguity that would resemble a triangle, a fork or whatnot.■"</p>

(I still have no idea, nor can supply an example of the symbol in use.) […] it is the case that ISO 9573-13 existed long before either AFII or the STIX project were formed.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Edited to upload the image to imgur and avoid spammy advertisements).Here I&#39;ll date myself: I remember this as &#34;diode with a gate&#34;. Back when we did circuit diagrams with stencils, you had the diode stencil which looks like a triangle with a line on top, and then with the electrical stencils you had &#34;decorations&#34;.The intention was to put down the original symbol on the paper, move the decorations stencil over top of it and then add the required decorations. It&#39;s why diode symbols look like this: https://imgur.com/a/0tSLV7O (notice &#34;step recovery diode&#34;).The &#34;lightning bolt&#34; isn&#39;t a lightning bolt, it&#39;s a hint that this diode is going to have a very sharp &#34;snap off&#34; in the waveform. See: https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_compon...OK so why do we have a seperate decorator for a diode? Can&#39;t we just have a pocket full of stencils for diodes? Space was at a premium back then. It goes back to daisy wheels and typeballs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing)#Impact_pri... You would have one position for &#34;diode&#34; and one position for &#34;decorator&#34; and the printer would know when it got one ASCII char it would print the diode, then send whatever the thin space is to advance the print carriage a small step, then print the decorator.Someone should be able to find a daisy wheel or typeball dedicated to circuits and bear this out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Haidt makes an excellent observation about the mid-20th century unity being an aberration due to the technology of the time:&gt; Gurri is no fan of elites or of centralized authority, but he notes a constructive feature of the pre-digital era: a single “mass audience,” all consuming the same content, as if they were all looking into the same gigantic mirror at the reflection of their own society.Something I think we overlook is that America was more fractious prior to the mid-20th century, but the stakes were lower because our institutions were more distributed and more local. The federal government had a vastly smaller scope back then, but so did nationwide and multinational corporations. Differences in world view are less significant when the bureaucrats and executives with power over your life live nearby instead of in another city and state. Our current structure, with a homogenous federal government and nationwide corporations arose against the backdrop of that unity.What I see missing from Haidt&#39;s analysis is increased federalism and localism as a solution. Aside from maybe California, our individual states remain vastly less fractious than the nation as a whole. Here in Maryland, for example, our Republican governor has an approval rating over 70% in both rural and urban areas. That&#39;s not because the state doesn&#39;t have ideological diversity--a third of the state voted for Trump. But the extremes are compressed compared to the nation as a whole--Baltimore isn&#39;t San Francisco but neither is Carroll County rural Alabama. Not only that, it&#39;s hard to get folks in Carroll County worked up about Baltimore they way they get worked up about San Francisco, and vice versa."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I am a big fan of Jonathan Haidt, and have read several of his books, I can&#39;t help but feel that this is written from a point of view that is entirely too impressed with (if also afraid of) technology.Peter Turchin predicted escalating levels of polarization in the US, reaching a peak around 2020, without any need to look at social media.  The level of political polarization now, while high, is less than the late 1850&#39;s.  I also think he&#39;s more impressed with AI-generated content than is warranted; unpaid zealots can crank the stuff out in more than enough quantity.Turchin blames elite overproduction; it seems a much more fundamental issue than social media.  Haidt even provides evidence for that here:&#34;These two extreme groups are similar in surprising ways. They are the whitest and richest of the seven groups, which suggests that America is being torn apart by a battle between two subsets of the elite who are not representative of the broader society.&#34;Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I am no fan of FB or Twitter, but I don&#39;t think Haidt&#39;s take on this is accurate.  The stupidity of current discourse uses social media, of course, because that&#39;s the dominant media, but I don&#39;t believe they caused it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“He described the nihilism of the many protest movements of 2011 that organized mostly online and that, like Occupy Wall Street, demanded the destruction of existing institutions without offering an alternative vision of the future or an organization that could bring it about.“Calling Occupy nihilistic is strikes me as blinkered, and shows the neoliberal bias of the author. Occupy is where the 99% vs. 1% lens arose, which is a reasonable description of concentration of wealth and power across Western countries and especially the US. Occupy attempted to employ more empowering and less alienating peer-to-peer governance.Occupy didn’t “succeed”, probably due to both internal and external forces, but it wasn’t nihilistic."</p>

For example a closed Brayton cycle gas turbine + steam turbine system. Certainly complex and expensive, but could get much better than 40% efficiency."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The university where I did a post-bacc had a research project back in the late 1990s to build a TPV-powered hybrid electric car that used compressed natural gas to heat an emitter surrounded by water-cooled PV cells.With the technology at the time they weren&#39;t able to get the efficiency to be competitive with an internal combustion engine, but something like this probably could&#39;ve made it competitive. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any need for it with today&#39;s battery performance/price, but maybe as a range extender or something.https://vri.wwu.edu/viking-series-cars-history/ (scroll down to Viking 29)https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/97...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK, so perhaps it&#39;s not the de-carbonization future we all wanted, but this could be an absolute game changer for planetary exploration, where RTG (nuclear-decay-driven thermal engines) are common. The existing efficiency for those is abysmal, which is actually OK since heat is such a useful product in itself.I&#39;m looking at Dragonfly, specifically, where an RTG provides the electricity and heat to keep everything alive. Imagine what 10x longer flights would do for that mission."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A well-written article, especially clearly listing out the differences in the forms of communication helped make the point.
But sadly, the people most prone to bad-faith communication are also probably least likely to take this criticism and improve. I have also resorted to bad-faith communications in conversations where it seems like that is the only way to be heard.Consider this example:
Person A, displaying some humility, says : &#34;You might be right, there is a chance politician X is in the wrong&#34;.
Person A assumes this is interpreted by Person B as: &#34;There is uncertainty about politician X being in the wrong&#34;
Person B actually interprets this as: &#34;Person A has admitted, without any doubt, to politician X being completely in the wrong&#34;If I ever find myself in a conversation where I&#39;m in the shoes of Person A, using good-faith communication means actually risking a complete failure of communication. Why even bother to communicate?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an alternative ending: what if good faith communication was superior to bad faith in a systemic way ?Clues:- at a personal level: have you ever tried to put in practice &#34;highly skilled, non-naive good faith communication&#34; ? If you did, you&#39;ve probably noted that more often than not, it doesn&#39;t make you weaker. It increases your value, your status, even your financial success. So maybe this could also be a contagious/unstoppable strategy simply because it has an edge for personal success ?- as an organization: good faith leadership, good faith communication... seem to overall be a competitive advantage because it goes hand-in-hand with happy &amp; productive people- as a society: democracy emerged despite a world of tyrants to take over most a the world. Why ? Maybe because it was stronger in a systemic way ? It unlocks collaboration, decentralization, resilience... Moreover, it doesn&#39;t sound unreasonable that democracy would be fittest as poverty diminishes. So maybe authoritarianism, not democracy, is in danger of extinction in the end ?Result: instead of spiraling bad faith, maybe we will have (though slower) spiraling good faith ? Maybe &#34;good faith&#34; will win simply because it&#39;s stronger, in a kind of evolutionary sense.This has implications in everyday life : practicing &#34;highly skilled, non-naive good faith communication&#34; may be the best way to personal success.
And this may also be the best way to incidentally induce a &#34;good faith&#34; society"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be great for people who desire good faith communication to call out people who are resorting to bad faith techniques.  Especially, and most importantly, when those bad actors are of the same political stripe.It&#39;s impossible for those bad actors to hear criticism from &#34;the enemy&#34;.  Only people who share a position of almost total fundamental agreement, can maybe be heard in any criticism of how to better deal with the opposition.TLDR:  We should be most aggressive and loud in criticism of those we agree with most."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Deno core team member and TC39 delegate here.We have pondered about capability based security for Deno in the past. Our conclusion has always been that this is not possible to do securely in JS without freezing all prototypes and objects by default. The reasoning for this is that you need to make sure the capability token does not ever leak. For example as a malicious user I could override `globalThis.fetch` to exfiltrate the capability token destined for `fetch` and use it myself later.One could also override `Map.prototype.set` / `Map.prototype.get` to exfiltrate  a token every time it is added or removed from a `Map` (people will want to store tokens in a `Map`).One could also override `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]` to exfiltrate tokens  stored in arrays if those arrays are destructored, spread, etc.There are many more cases like this, where one can exfiltrate tokens because of the very dynamic nature of JavaScript.It is unlikely that freezing all intrinsic prototypes and objects is even enough. People will find ways to exfiltrate tokens."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The impression I get from the companies I&#39;ve worked at is to not trust packages that are mostly maintained by one person. Ironically, those packages are usually the ones that don&#39;t have outrageously large dependency trees and can usually be audited by a developer on a weekend, and the more &#34;trustworthy&#34; larger packages with hundreds of maintainers typically have monstrous dependency trees.Not saying 1-man tools are inherently better, but in my experience, these tools seems to have a tighter focus and less chances of scope/dependency creep."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Founder of Socket (https://socket.dev) here, a new tool built by npm maintainers to help solve JavaScript supply chain security.I totally agree with the idea that we should assume all open source packages may be malicious. Socket.dev uses &#34;deep package inspection&#34; to characterize the behavior of an open source package. By actually analyzing the package code, Socket can detect when packages use security-relevant platform capabilities, such as the network, filesystem, or shell.For instance, to detect if a package uses the network, Socket looks at whether fetch(), or Node&#39;s net, dgram, dns, http or https modules are used within the package or any of its dependencies.This entails running static analysis (and soon, dynamic analysis) on a package – and all of its dependencies – to look for specific risk markers.In this way, Socket can detect the tell-tale signs of a supply chain attack, including the introduction of install scripts, obfuscated code, high entropy strings, or usage of privileged APIs such as shell, filesystem, eval(), and environment variables.We are taking an entirely new approach to one of the hardest problems in security in a stagnant part of the industry that has historically been obsessed with just reporting on known vulnerabilities."</p>

My girlfriend has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and loves traveling this way, where she would often be bedridden at home for days, when traveling she can at least be in a natural park, listening to birds, waking up by a tawny owl, see deer and foxes pass by the car without noticing you. Life becomes simple and you&#39;re so much closer to nature. 
Even with sub zero temperatures and no heating at night, with the right gear this is still very doable. Of course you have to go to places with low population density and be mindful of your surroundings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bloody hell, that Winnie the Pooh quote got my eyes watering. I see people in the comments questioning whether the story is real but, regardless of that, I do want to compliment this woman&#39;s style of writing. It&#39;s not overly grim, not saccharine &#34;everything is beautiful&#34;. Very matter of fact, very bittersweet.Cancer is a terrible thing and I hope we beat it one day. I&#39;m glad she at least had the NHS covering her expenses because I cannot imagine how gutting it&#39;d be to deal with the loss of a loved one compounded with debt.May her last days be as devoid of fear as possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like a perfectly reasonable way to end a service. The server died, and the effort to bring it back up seems high.This is a reminder to pay for services you depend on. Per the Pinboard founder&#39;s post:&gt; I love free software and could not have built my site without it. But free web services are not like free software. If your free software project suddenly gets popular, you gain resources: testers, developers and people willing to pitch in. If your free website takes off, you lose resources. Your time is spent firefighting and your money all goes to the nice people at Linode.&gt; Like a service? Make them charge you or show you ads. If they won&#39;t do it, clone them and do it yourself. Soon you&#39;ll be the only game in town!https://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project was killed by invisible complexity. I felt a little sad
reading about it. There are lots of comments talking about the
sustainability of projects with respect to money and burnout, the need
to pay for services etc. I get that and agree. But I also get the
impression that wouldn&#39;t have helped here.When we reach a situation where some unknown person pushes an upstream
update, which causes a cascade of problems that even someone with deep
technical knowledge and daily connection to the project cannot unpick,
that&#39;s a breakdown in modularity/dependency.It&#39;s what we faced in the 1990s and from it evolved package managers,
version control, dependency management and all the good things.I think in 2022 we&#39;re back in a similar situation again.
Virtualisation, containers, cloud services and whatnot have regressed
development reliability.I predict the day when a really major service provider comes out and
says; &#34;Sorry everyone. It&#39;s been 10 days downtime. We&#39;ve put our 1000
top engineers on the problem and nobody knows what&#39;s wrong. We just
can&#39;t fix it.&#34;"</p>

Testing SSL for a few hundred users should pretty much free these days.He said Patreon pledges paid for 25% of hosting. So I looked up his Patreon. Turns out he has 3 (!) patreons, together paying $9 per month.The web is a strange place.Here comes a fun fact I can add: He is doing better than me. I have a website with about 500000 monthly users and 5 (!) patreons. So while he only had 1% paying users, I only have 0.001% :)Did I say the web is a strange place?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did some research on this as part of my undergrad in the early 00&#39;sI skimmed the article but it seems to align with the literature back then. The thinking was during our evolution that high volume low frequency sounds would represent a precursor to mortal danger (avalanches, earthquakes, stampedes, thunder, wind) so we were attuned to secreting stress hormones in early response. Unfortunately, much of our urban built-environment is full of (human-made) constant low-frequency sources, although we appear to have adapted to a degree (HVAC systems in buildings, traffic, industrial process plants, airports and air traffic, explosions, concerts).What isn&#39;t mentioned here, that I remember finding particularly concerning, was that while we seem to adapt, it&#39;s over our own time, as children we secrete more cortisol to low frequency noise than when we are adults... maybe some form of long term CBT I don&#39;t know.I have no idea where my old paper is but I remember (and someone with more time might want to check/confirm this) one important study showed cortisol levels of children at schools close to Heathrow compared to out in the UK countryside and how this affected standardised testing. There were limitations, and of course you had to control for a range of factors, socio-economic, teaching staff etc, but there was some measurable negative effect (again no idea if this was repeated/corroborated).The actual research I was doing was into our auditory perception of urban spaces. We took recordings of various urban settings and had participants listen and rate their emotional responses, if it felt &#34;hot&#34; or &#34;cold&#34; (and other adjective pairs), we also had them draw something to represent what they were listening too.Our &#34;findings&#34; were pretty limited for a short undergrad project but it was interesting how we generally appreciate background chatter and live-music and generally fearful and cold from large flat surface reflected sound (empty city plazas)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the things I struggle with the most in life. I feel like most people don&#39;t seem to care about noise pollution and zero care is put into designing living spaces or cities to minimize it. I&#39;ve moved into apartments and nearly cried because I realized that there was some noise pollution that wasn&#39;t apparent when I visited it (e.g. a water boiler that ran constantly at night, road noise during the day, etc) and would have to deal with it for a year.One of the few countries I&#39;ve been to that takes noise pollution seriously is Switzerland. A beautifully peaceful and quiet country."</p>

A summary &#34;party at so-and-so&#39;s house, weather was nice, overall vibe was ___&#34;.  The rest is context.  You know what the house/backyard is like, you know the general feel of that time of year, you know the crowd that usually comes, you can easily synthesize details like the smell of the BBQ and the taste of the food... build up a complete &#34;memory&#34; from stuff that could be summarized in a paragraph of text plus generic (not specific to one memory episode) context.I can build up a relatively vivid mental image of my walking route to school (from the bus terminal) over 40 years ago.  Is it accurate?  Who cares.  As long as no detailed record exists to compare it to that would reveal the &#34;lossy compression&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Compression is a component of general intelligence. A few years ago I was very sceptical of machine learning ever leading to general intelligence. I&#39;ve since changed my mind. There are a lot of parallels to this work and the concept of &#34;embeddings&#34; in machine learning.Intelligence requires the ability to generalize. A prerequisite for generalization is the ability to take something high-dimensional and reduce it to a lower-dimensional representation to allow comparison and grouping of concepts.We&#39;re doing this all the time. Take a pen for example: we&#39;re able to combine information from sight, touch, and sound. Through some mechanism, our brains reduce the multi-sensory information and create a consistent representation that is able to invoke past memories and knowledge about pens.Our brains encode the embeddings in a very different way to deep learning neural networks, but the commonality is that both are able to compress data into a _useful_ representation. Note that as a result of this, the quality of the compression is important. Some forms of compression might be very efficient but they also tangle concepts together, resulting in loss of composability. The ideal compression (from an intelligence point of view) is both information efficient and maximally composable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Living in Spain, I love trains and take them over airplane when it&#39;s an option. However, trains are often around twice as expensive as flying for may routes. I know nothing about trains, but intuitively I would expect the opposite, and I really wish it was more affordable, specially high speed rail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here in Germany, for as long as I can remember, the government praises itself every year for investing as much in rail as never before. I have not noticed the service quality to change for the better over the last 15 years. The ever-rising investments seem to be only enough to keep the status quo of the crumbling infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an American who doesn&#39;t drive, the experience of trains in the EU compared to the US is just delightful. Yes, there are super cheap flights and I used them often for longer haul trips but the trains were always amazing- I&#39;ve done trips including Mariupol to Lviv, Budapest to Berlin, and Berlin to Munich and always had a great experience. The Romania-Chisinau line is quite old but part of its charm. I see a lot of people talking about the expense compared to the cheap flights- those are solid and I&#39;ve used them a lot but after you factor in the waiting time at airports, the unexpected fees in case your bag is a kilo too heavy, the uber to and from a far away airport, etc. it&#39;s really not that much of a difference. There is no comparison to trains in the U.S. (e.g. I took one for 3 days from DC to LA; while I enjoyed it, it was a slough with no real food facilities for the passengers not in sleeper cars, old chairs, etc.). I hope there will be more investment, especially in the Baltics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I loved, loved, loved my Pebble Time. It did everything I wanted out of a smart watch, especially eliminating my phone-checking habit, because I was always on top of whether new emails were worth reading, it was a sanity saver during an intense M&amp;A process. Also, it somehow had a super long-lived battery, and it had so much more personality than most electronic devices, with its little 8-bittish animated icons, reminded me of a Gameboy Advance or something. Thanks for making one of my favorite devices of the last decade, Eric."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pebble had an incredibly clever design for their watch apps.  The watch itself had a limited processor and even more limited RAM but it could hold a few apps and those apps had a lot of capability.Each app had both a on-watch component and an on-phone component and you could install these apps from their own app store and same app worked on both iOS and Android.  They got around both the app install limitations on iOS and the cross-platform compatibility issues by making the on-phone portion run in the platform&#39;s JavaScript engine.You could, for example, create a weather application that fetched the weather from the Internet and displayed it on the watch.  The on-phone app would fetch the weather from the Internet using JavaScript code and then transmit that data to the corresponding C-based watch app.  Watch apps could even have settings that were just HTML pages.I always impressed by the cleverness and simplicity of that design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We sold 2 million watches and did over $230m in sales.&#34;So from 0 to 2 million in 4 years?I was just explaining to my child that many &#34;failures&#34; are only failures from a strange but important angle. They might have been profitable at the time they were canceled, but they were perceived by their maker as less profitable than some other potential product. A venture might net $1m/year and be deemed a wild success. Or it might be deemed a failure if the maker thinks they could net $5m/year on a different venture using the same resources."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this is an important part:&#34;Fortunately in western countries the suppression of heresies is nothing like as bad as it used to be. Though the window of opinions you can express publicly has narrowed in the last decade, it&#39;s still much wider than it was a few hundred years ago. The problem is the derivative. Up till about 1985 the window had been growing ever wider. Anyone looking into the future in 1985 would have expected freedom of expression to continue to increase. Instead it has decreased.&#34;Many people proclaim that &#34;free speech is dead&#34; and all of that, but it&#39;s still at an all-time high if you zoom out a bit. You don&#39;t even need to go back a few hundred years; look at the number of people persecuted by the government (both through the courts and outside of it) for things like blasphemy, subversion, civil rights, sexual deviancy (homosexuality, among other things), etc. just a few decades ago. In the US burning the flag was illegal in many states until the late 80s when the SCOTUS declared it was legal under the 1st (and only by a 5-4 majority).Yes, there are some developments I am not especially pleased with either, but it&#39;s also important to remember the historical context.Anyway, I liked this piece of nuance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The reason the current wave of intolerance comes from the left is simply because the new unifying ideology happened to come from the left.This is an (aggressively?) conventional idea that I have an (I guess) heretical opinion about. I&#39;m somewhat persuaded that there is a recent outbreak of intolerance for differing ideas and ideals (though I suspect every generation expresses a version of this opinion as they get older and become out of step with cultural evolution), but I don&#39;t think it has any particular political valence. I have to watch my tongue just as much around &#34;aggressive conventionalists&#34; on either side, they just have different conventions. It&#39;s just as disqualifying as the x-isms from the left, if you care about staying in the good graces of convention on the right, to express opinions like &#34;immigrants are good&#34;, &#34;the 2020 US presidential election ran smoothly and had a clear victor who was duly inaugurated&#34;, &#34;gender is a social construct&#34;, &#34;people who are attracted to others of the same sex are normal and should have the same rights as anyone else&#34;, etc. etc.Honestly I think this whole thing is as simple as, people just have different views and lots of people of all stripes don&#39;t want to agree to disagree with the people they spend most of their time with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a Popehat article I finally got around to reading yesterday: https://popehat.substack.com/p/our-fundamental-right-to-sham...In that article, Popehat talks about the need to define cancel culture and understand how the free speech rights of the first speaker intersect with the free speech and association rights of people that respond.I think the most useful aspect of PG&#39;s article is that he does actually define what he means by heresy:&gt; Structurally there are two distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priority over the question of truth or falsity, and (2) that it outweighs everything else the speaker has donePG doesn&#39;t give any examples, but I do think that trying to be clear around definitions in order to be able to say &#34;is this an example of heresy at work?&#34; or &#34;has this person been unfairly cancelled?&#34; is a valuable exercise.FWIW, my main reason for commenting is that I find Popehat&#39;s article to be a valuable addition to the conversation because it&#39;s specifically addressing the &#34;cancel culture&#34; terminology rather than trying to swirl a new term (heresy) into the mix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a unique email address for every single service that I sign up for, similar to this, though selfhosted. I&#39;ve been doing this for years and it works wonderfully. If someone misuses my email address, or gets annoying, I can simply turn off the address. Bam!It&#39;s the easiest Postfix config in the universe, essentially just:  virtual_alias_domains = domain1.com domain2.com
  virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual

And then /etc/postfix/virtual looks like this:  phil.equifax@domain1.com firstname.lastname@gmail.com
  phil.experian@domain1.com firstname.lastname@gmail.com
  ... (hundreds of these)

I also made a super simple web UI for myself to edit this file quickly.Gmail seems to be fine with this, emails do not usually end up in spam.

Anyone who’s looking for a great JIRA alternative, I love Shortcut (formerly Clubhouse). It’s the best task management software I’ve used aside from the “no task management software” option. Very snappy, updates in real time, notifications make sense, and no workflow-manipulation shenanigans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Update - Restoration work to restore sites is underway and will continue into the weekend. We are taking a controlled and hands-on approach as we gather feedback from customers to ensure the integrity of these site restorations.I’ve seen failing Kickstarter updates with more information than this.Anyway the title isn’t wrong per se but it might be more informative to say a subset of tenants using Atlassian’s SaaS products are down.If you use any of their products on prem … they are not down. And if you’re not one of the affected tenants then your Atlassian products are fine. At work we have Confluence hosted by Atlassian and it’s up.According to The Register:&gt; We were also told that the incident affects a relatively small number of Atlassian customers: about 400. That&#39;s only 0.18 per cent of the company&#39;s 226,000 customers, which isn&#39;t much consolation to the several hundred who still can&#39;t access their data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in the middle of an apartment search. I was reflecting the other day on how much searching for an apartment has changed over the last 10 years.Conclusion: it hasn&#39;t changed much at all.It&#39;s still necessary to search on a myriad of sites. Most of the time, by the time you inquire, a place is gone. Or the ad was misleading and that &#34;$2000 2BR&#34; is actually &#34;$2000 for the cheapest Studio we have, but we also have 2BR for $3.5K&#34;.Finding places that match my criteria still requires careful inspection of the description. Checking a filter box for &#34;Parking&#34; excludes places that only mention parking in the description.With all of the modernization and streamlining that has happened in other parts of our lives, apartment hunting remains unstructured, messy, frustrating, stressful.Aggregators like Padmapper helped for awhile, but these days, it seems like most listings are posted by scammy middlemen just trying to make a commission on the listing, and now the site actively makes the process even harder.Is hunting for an apartment doomed to be this messy forever? It seems like an area that is ripe for disruption or a better option, but what would it take to actually solve this?---With all of that said, this post is exactly what I needed right now. I&#39;ve been toying with a very similar idea to improve the efficiency of my search process and this is good inspiration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently searching in Berlin and the market has become insane. Here&#39;s a response I got yesterday:&#34;With more than 1200 prospective tenants, it was really difficult for the landlord to make a decision.Unfortunately, we have to inform you that the landlord has decided on other prospective tenants.Thank you for your understanding!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting article: I did something similar but for Zürich (finding a low-price, but good apartment there is almost impossible).I did follow a different approach though, and reverse engineered the APIs of the most common rental listing websites here.I didn&#39;t publish the code (or better said, I didn&#39;t make it public), but it&#39;s similar to yours. Instead of SQLite I used a PostGis database where I stored the apartments with their point to point public transport distance from my office (pre-covid search). I did it in Rust.Whilst the application is not available to the public (yet), all of the libraries I&#39;ve created are now available.I should have both a Rust and a Golang version for most / all of them.On a side note, I did a similar project (scraper + visualizer / search) for finding a job for my girlfriend by scraping LinkedIn, Xing and a couple of other local job posting websites.[0]: https://github.com/denysvitali/sbb-api-rs[1]: https://github.com/denysvitali/homegate-rs[2]: https://github.com/denysvitali/flatfox-rs[3]: https://github.com/denysvitali/go-sbb-api"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The linked tweet doesn&#39;t provide a citation or context for the &#34;helped prevent ~2M deaths&#34; claim. But there is work in this area which suggests that &#34;~2M lives saved&#34; in the last 50 years underestimates the benefits of nuclear power by a lot.One commenter here writes&gt; What is the actual claim here? Nuclear power didn&#39;t prevent any deaths, after all everyone will eventually die for one reason or another. So it must be something like two million people would have died earlier without nuclear power, but by how much?That&#39;s a better way to think about the problem: not &#34;lives saved,&#34; but life-years saved. Calculations of life-years saved are necessarily sketchy, but there is at least one promising preliminary effort [1]. See especially page 22.[1] https://storage.googleapis.com/production-sitebuilder-v1-0-1..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If nukes prevented that many deaths, imagine how many solar + wind will prevent.The point here is that each $10B spent on new generating capacity displaces some amount of coal generation. If you spend your $10B building nukes, it displaces A million tons / year of coal output, if you spend $10B building renewables, it instead displaces B million tons.And B is much larger than A, because a GW of solar + storage is much cheaper than a GW of nuke.The corollary is that each $ diverted from renewables to nukes is not just harmful, but brings climate disaster nearer. Best, of course, would be to stop diverting money to fossils, but all we can do about that is build out renewables + storage as fast as we can. Renewables will be running at 100% at all times, and each kWh produced displaces a kWh of fossil generation.Displaced fossil generation in most markets is methane gas, because methane gas is cheaper and therefore preferred. But! anywhere coal is being used at all, they will prefer to cut coal output because cutting coal saves more money than cutting gas.A particularly good example is Germany, where they cannot get enough natural gas to meet their needs, and are burning coal like nobody&#39;s business. Every last kWh of renewables + storage that can be put on the German grid, provided it is steady-enough output, displaces exactly that much coal.The cost of storage is plummeting even faster than of solar or wind ever did, so there is some short-term sense in delaying storage build-out until it is cheaper, so you can buy more of it. But in the big picture, building out storage at any price is much, much better than waiting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s the main tragedy of the human race is not staying with nuclear and going all in.  Unfortunately the fad of being afraid of nuclear will probably be the downfall of the human race.  We would have had energy solved by the 80&#39;s.  Almost sickening to think about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my youth I once worked for a small local airport near where I grew up. I did a lot of small stuff like mowing lawn between runways and cleaning.One day it was my job to switch out burned out light bulbs from the approach light installations. It was before anyone was risk averse so I only had a ladder to climb up, keep as still as possible while wrangling the cases open, getting the old bulb out and installing the new one.The most terrifying thing was bursts of wind when the whole construction, me included started to wobble.I had quite a bit of an adrenaline rush this day.Good times, but now I feel a bit old.Edit:
German local online newspaper article containing a photo of the approach lighting [0].IATA designation: HOQ[0]: https://www.frankenpost.de/inhalt.hof-stadtrat-beraet-ueber-...Reading about it I learned that it is nowadays also used as a test area for BMW&#39;s autonomous driving.

I have no ability to tell the FAA, &#34;sorry, it&#39;s been delayed, I&#39;ll have an update for you in a few months.&#34;Edit to add: Lest this come off as generic complaining, here&#39;s an example of people dying because the FAA failed to do in a timely manner what Congress repeatedly told them to do:Ten years ago, Section 203 of the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 mandated that the FAA create an electronic pilot records database (PRD), which was intended to improve the timeliness and efficiency of the PRIA records retrieval process by providing hiring operators and DAs with direct access to pilots’ FAA, NDR, and former employer records in a single database. By 2016, the FAA had not yet implemented the PRD, and Congress imposed an April 30, 2017, deadline, which the FAA also missed. Although the FAA has begun phasing in the use of the PRD, the PRD is not yet fully functional; it contains only pilots’ FAA records and is available to hiring operators for use on a voluntary basis.On March 30, 2020, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that outlined PRD functions.https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From a quick look at the article, I can see a few subtle &#34;omissions&#34; or &#34;rants that have easy fixes&#34;. I can&#39;t tell how long the author has spent on Windows (it&#39;s not in the article) so it&#39;s hard to know how much effort they have put in getting adjusted. It takes a really long time to switch platforms and feel comfortable in them, and without spending a long time adjusting, it&#39;s too easy to complain and quite hard to provide a fair review...For a more positive spin, I&#39;ll leave here my own review of Windows after being off the platform for 25 years, spending 15 of those on macOS, and then spending the last year primarily on Windows. TL;DR: I&#39;m quite happy with the switch, but obviously there are many things that could be different/better and some of the issues that the OP highlights are valid.The intro and index: https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html[edit: wording]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can see where OP is coming from but it sounds like he hasn&#39;t allowed him/herself to learn to do things the windows way.You maybe used to coreutils/binutils and piecing together things in bash like a lego but Powershell in many ways allows you to build powerful scripts or compose one liners like with bash except you have access to .NET and any .NET assembly you can load! Don&#39;t even get me started on WMI or GPO.&#34;Windows wasn&#39;t made for me&#34; right... it isn&#39;t made for anyone that wants to use it like a unix system, it is an entirely different OS. Just like you shouldn&#39;t expect Linux to work like windows.It really isn&#39;t a competition. Windows is messy in its own way and that affects its performance as well. If you want to feel like you are in control, windows isn&#39;t for you. If you want to get things done, windows is a mediocre but acceptable platform.The very things that make Linux powerful and controllable like shared library all over the place, package managers, and more make it more fragile and time consuming to administer.I spent at least 8-10 hours a week getting things to work on Linux when I had it as my daily driver for over a decade. The weeks I didn&#39;t do this, it was because I did nothing outside of browsing the web. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoyed  most of that time, and I did feel like I was in control up until distro maintainers decide things for me and my only choice is to beg and plead and be told to fork it if I disagreed.All I am saying is every platform exists for a reason and has issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve actually done kind of the opposite recently.I&#39;ve used Linux a lot in the past, and especially on servers pretty much exclusively - but I&#39;ve always had a Windows PC for gaming and a Mac for everything else for personal use.In the last few months I put together a tiny low power AMD PC (the 35W 8 core 5750GE!) - and I am massively impressed by how well everything works.Proton/Wine and the OSS AMD graphics stack run older Windows games better than Windows 10 or 11 does. The DP MST setup I have just works (unlike on Windows + NVIDIA where it loves to break). Using KDE as a desktop is more consistent as a UI than Windows 11 is.It&#39;s come a long way, and the user experience (as someone who was expecting to dislike it) is seriously improved &amp; seriously impressive.edit: a lot of the niggles I used to hit have just gone away - I don&#39;t get tearing, multimonitor just worked. I haven&#39;t tried disparate DPIs and I expect that would be an issue, but even so... I&#39;m impressed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool. Seeing these beautiful colors I realize how much how I imagine the ancient world is shaped by museum artifacts and photos in textbooks, which show raw and brown/grey/white stones, rusty tools and weapons. I&#39;ve grown thinking about pre-medieval times as a landscape of ruins. It would be like if future humans were picturing our current world as nothing but bombed cities.It&#39;s a really cool project. Now I want a VR game where I could simply walk around ancient cities and watch people go about their day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very curious to see what the long term effects of unionizing will be in Academia. I&#39;m hopeful and optimistic it will improve things in the long run. Yes there will be some unintended consequences but academic life is already very rough if you&#39;re not tenured.Academia likes to cast itself as a true meritocracy. If you work hard and publish good papers you&#39;ll do well. In practice it&#39;s more of a gerontocracy where senior members  can single handedly destroy a young investigators career. (It happened to me and I saw it happen to several people). There is little to no recourse against this.Arguments against unionization from already tenured faculty usually sound like: &#34;If you want to be the best in your field you have to work harder than everyone else. Forming a union won&#39;t change that fact and may even discourage students from working so hard. This might interfere with their career goals.&#34;However, the power structures in academia are heavily skewed and toxic. Individually graduate students have little recourse when they are wronged. Life in academia is hard. You have to work long days, the chance of success is very low. At every stage the probability of getting that next job is very low.A lot of the field agrees that something needs to change, but no one can agree exactly what needs to change or how to get there.  The people with the power are the tenured professors who &#34;won the lottery&#34; and are out of touch with the problems they are causing. They aren&#39;t going to be the mechanism of change even though they hold all the power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a graduate student with a research assistantship position at the University of Washington in the mid 2000s, a few years after they unionized and got a contract with the UAW.By the time I was there, even though it was only a few years after the union struggle, I didn&#39;t hear much about the union, at least in my department.But what I knew it meant was: we had good health insurance, we had a guaranteed minimum stipend, we had the right to actually take vacation during university vacations, and a certain number of sick days. I knew from talking to oother students, that before the union contract, grad students with assistantships didn&#39;t necessarily have these things (it depended on department), and sometimes literally got no vacation or allowed sick leave at all.I was aware of no ways that the presence of a graduate student union harmed the grad students involved -- to the contrary of some suppositions in this thread. Grad student unions exist in dozens of universities, some for years now, so it&#39;s possible to look at actual experiences, not just forecasting supposition. I was also aware of no ways the union harmed research or academics at the university (beyond of course costing them more money to treat the grad students right).I wonder if a few years after I left, most grad students even realized what the union had won for them. The union was not very visible, once the fight for a contract was over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone not familiar with the world of academia, grad students actually have a good bit more power available to them by organising sensibly than you might think. The same is also true for early career postdoctoral research staff. This is because most of the work that actually matters is being done by these individuals, in a very pyramidical structure, but the money stops rolling in without the work that the base of the pyramid is delivering.Tenured professors and others win research grants, and are only as good as their last grant. If they stop running on the treadmill, they won&#39;t get any more grants, as their pitch becomes less compelling than others&#39;.They win a grant, but the actual research work is then done by postdoctoral researchers and grad students. They do the actual work, write it up, and pretty much everything else. Often they even win the grants in the first place. The exception is that when there&#39;s some credit to be gained for the work, the professor will reappear to take center stage and give interviews.If the grad students organise, the wheels could begin to fall off quickly - if projects are delayed, grant payments won&#39;t come through. If they are not teaching classes, someone else has to teach them. If the research isn&#39;t getting done, someone has to speak with funders on calls. Someone has to write reports. There&#39;s more to be done than the professor can do, and they will rapidly end up snowed under, unable to function, and unable to deliver papers on their grant. That will make it harder for them to get their next pet project funded.Unfortunately, many people go into academia believing it to be a bastion of meritocracy where their efforts and skill will be rewarded, and they spend some number of years believing this before they start to realise what is actually going on. Some will make it to be a professor, others become disillusioned and go elsewhere. In my view though, the model is quite broken, and too reliant on a professor claiming credit for others&#39; work without challenge, even though the work of their (hidden) team was the meaningful intellectual input, and some of them would probably be better as the professor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone interested in learning more about partial reprogramming, I recently wrote a review article on the current state of the art: https://www.adanguyenx.com/blog/partial-reprogrammingIn short, we&#39;re still far away from using it in humans (10+ years). Currently, all companies working on this are in pre-clinical stage, with turn.bio as the closest, expecting to go into clinical trials late this year.This tech is exciting but there are still a lot of limitations:- Risk of cancer: this technology is based on the work of Yamanaka in 2006, who discovered 4 factors that can turn any cells into pluripotent stem cells. The work in the OP article basically used the same 4 factors, but only partially, so that the cells became &#34;younger&#34; without losing their identities (i.e. turning into stem cells). This requires understanding the right dosage for every cell type so we don&#39;t go overboard and turn them into dedifferentiated cells which could lead to cancer- Cell specificity, microenvironment, etc.: reprogramming is finicky and the right dosage is dependent on the cell type or the environment around the cells. This is important because you have to figure out the right dosage for each cell type so as to avoid cancer- Delivery: it&#39;s easy to deliver gene therapy to skin cells on a dish, not so much to other cell types or organs in the bodies -- that&#39;s why we have not seen very impressive results when this is used on live normal mice"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based in Shanghai since 2014, I can share some details on why it feels so unbearable to be here right now.Firstly, the totalitarian government have never been good at communicating anything except propaganda. So on one hand we&#39;re inundated with &#34;Go Shanghai!&#34; and how brave volunteers distribute food, on the other hand, we&#39;re completely in the dark about what&#39;s going on. Goalposts are being moved daily, rumors proliferate, and things change every day, adding a lot of stress to an already suboptimal situation.Second, I can confirm that the food situation is extremely bad. We are a family of two, and always been kind of preppers, so we had many bags of rice, pasta, dehydrated veg, frozen meats in our large fridge. Chinese society, en masse, is much more used to just ordering food daily. Many people never cook. It&#39;s cheaper this way (though of course the quality varies). Bigger families with aunties who can cook just used to pop by the local wet market daily and get a bag of fresh produce. Many households might not even have a fridge at all, or have a small one.The government was saying that &#34;there will be no lockdown&#34;, and when the lockdown became imminent, people barely had two days to stock up. Queues, fights, empty shelves everywhere. More stress.A lot of people in our community do not have any food left, and we&#39;ve received two government issued &#34;rations&#34; so far (in 12 days of lockdown): one with 5 tomatoes, and one with 3 pounds of chicken drumsticks, 3 potatoes, 1 head of cauliflower, and a bunch of rotten lettuce. If we did not stock up, we would be starving right now. We donated quite a bit of food to our neighbors already, and many people are actually very close to having no food at all. Getting a delivery is almost impossible, group orders organized by compounds are often ridiculously overpriced, and not always work out. Scams are emerging.Thirdly, I understand the author&#39;s frustration with the guards (&#34;baoan&#34;). Those people never had any formal power, but now they &#34;run things&#34; and, for many, the newly obtained power went to their heads. Violence and abuse is abound. We have PCR tests every 1-2 days, sometimes at 6am, some compounds at 3am. People dragged from their beds and forced to stand in queues.How would you respond to all that?Yes, it has some potential to save lives, but if it was communicated better, if we had more time to prepare, and they could still run food deliveries, nobody would complain that much. It&#39;s terribly mismanaged, and even after we &#34;open up&#34;, I will strongly reconsider staying here. Omicron will return, and I do not want to be here for the next (and next, and next) lockdown."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Chinese, I can say that the situation is worse than it in the article. My brother is a student who lives in a flat and has not eaten for two days and no one has brought basic substances. He can&#39;t leave the flat, he turns to his tutor but his tutor is also forced to stay at home (eating instant noodles every day). We are worried about him but there is nothing we can do, if we criticise the government on chinese Twitter we will be arrested by the police. ಥ_ಥ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; People are finding out that state media exists not for accurate news, but only to spin reality into a narrative that fits the powers higher up.Are people really finding that out only now? I thought that this was generally accepted knowledge even in China, despite the constant fear and propaganda they live with.What&#39;s happening now with the strict lockdowns and zero-Covid policy is inhumane. People are literally prisoners in their own homes and anyone in a position of power will abuse it to avoid hurting their social score. What a fucked up situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really happy to see this on the front page!One thing to keep in mind if you&#39;re interested in joining: the Digital Corps is for early career technologists, so if you have much experience in tech, you might want to apply to USDS (https://www.usds.gov) or 18F (https://18f.gsa.gov) instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Public sector IT was an extremely frustrating experience for me.- incompetent administration (org flow chart, constantly changing paradigms, misnomers (&#34;open source&#34; == we tape together stuff from public git-repositories, push nothing upstream, and outsource lots of core development))- administration&#39;s priorities change with every election (project funding as a flag in the wind depending on current political climate)- red tape everywhere- bureaucrats everywhere- the whole job-stack attracted incompetent people, the kind that values stability over deep understanding and progress. the kind where I thought &#34;man, good that they are working here in [$current_politically_opportune_project] so they can&#39;t do actual damage somewhere else&#34;. this applied for the business administrators, the project managers, the &#34;developers&#34;, the admins, even a large part of the contractors.- &#34;you&#39;re working too fast! haven&#39;t been here for long, eh?&#34;- compliance &gt; securityNever, ever ever ever again. Granted, this was in Europe, maybe the US sucks less in the public sector. I would bet a good amount of money that there is a large intersection of problem spaces among the regions though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like that the Digital Corps exists in theory. I applied many moons ago, I believe during the Obama administration. Service to our country is something I feel is important so I applied to at least see if there was a fit.When I got to the phone screen, I made a point to ask if recreational cannabis would disqualify you from joining and they confirmed that yes, even if it was recreationally used, a positive cannabis result on a drug test would disqualify you.Major bummer, but unsurprising. The entire reason I asked was due to how many posts on HN I’ve seen about government agencies having a hard time hiring tech folks for this reason. I have what I believe to be a decently desirable skillset and a lot of tangible experience working in startups AND enterprise companies, and if I had to guess, would have brought some good value to the team.I hope (but doubt) these policies have relaxed."</p>

Their own storage cost is per-month, so to get the equivalent cost for floppies you need to also divide by the expected useful lifetime of a floppy disk. I did a web search for &#34;floppy disk lifetime&#34; and the internet [1] told me &#34;I’ve seen numbers saying the lifespan of floppy disks is three to five years. But I’ve also seen numbers that claim they can last ten to twenty years or even indefinitely.&#34;If you assume floppy disks have an expected lifetime of 5 years, you can amortise the cost across that time, bringing the cost per TiB-month down to a nice reasonable $3,520.[1] https://blog.storagecraft.com/data-storage-lifespan/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can remember that there was a vibrant community of Flash game developers before the demise of Flash (EOL December 2020, the date of its “demise” is debatable). There’s not really a replacement for Flash and the community kind of fragmented.That said, my impression is that a big chunk of talent from the Flash community went to work on HaXe. These are people who make games and want tools to make game development easier—as opposed to people who get excited about engines, architectural patterns, and programming languages. Just as a general impression, based on people I’ve recognized working with HaXe."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written a couple side project games in Heaps and I&#39;m a big fan.If you&#39;re familiar with Pixi.js, Heaps and it&#39;s language, Haxe, will feel very similar. Haxe is a pretty cool language, it&#39;s similar to TypeScript but compiles to native binaries for almost all major game consoles.Heaps was apparently the framework behind Dead Cells if that says anything about the level of polish you can accomplish with this set of tools."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wish Haxe would just take off in the application development world, it had so much potential to be what Typescript has become with the benefit of transpiling to different languages. We theoretically could have had 1 single programming language for a full application with JS front end, Django server, C++ workers, the best of all worlds."</p>

They may or may not allow whatever arbitrary JS you have on the page. They may even intentionally give you bad data (e.g. hijack the payload to give you intentionally malformed data).edit: even more broadly speaking, there&#39;s additional reasons why you can&#39;t expect to receive these kinds of callbacks: consider what happens if a user loses connectivity between loading the page and them navigating away (e.g. their phone loses service because they went into an elevator before navigating away)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi everyone! I&#39;m the lead developer of Zas Editor. I wanted to share some details about the editor you might be interested in.The text-storage data structure, syntax highlighting and search features are written in Rust, and the UI is written in Swift since we wanted to create a native macOS experience. The Swift and Rust code talk to each other using C FFI, and no, that doesn’t take away the safety features of both languages.We’re using the Rope data structure for text representation, and the tree-sitter parser for syntax highlighting and some smart features like file outline, local renaming and symbol search. All other language features are powered by LSP servers (rust-analzyer and gopls).I’d be happy to answer any questions under this comment or anywhere else in this thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zas Editor developer here. I think it’s important to address a problem a few people have mentioned so far: no data is collected other than your Mac’s serial number, which used to be used for finding how many computers a license is used on (we no longer do that)We’re going to add a privacy policy in the website. We haven’t already done that because we didn’t really expect this much attention within hours of releasing. Honestly, we were expecting few downloads and more technical feedback."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if it really still make sense to develop an editor as a commercial product. This is probably a massive effort, and the revenue is maybe not so large.There is IntelliJ and Visual Studio. IntelliJ is successful, yes, but they have a long history, and the editor is really good. Visual Studio is maybe also successful but I&#39;m not sure how profitable it really was or is.But otherwise? Sublime Text and others were maybe successful at some point but not sure how profitable they really were. If you count the amount of development which went into it vs the revenue.For me as a user, I&#39;m extremely hesitant to use any non-open source editor. An editor is a long-term investment. I would not touch this Zas editor unless maybe in 5 to 10 years when it is widely used by many people or when it has become open source but otherwise not. Yes, it looks nice from a first glance but that is by far not enough.My personal only exception is IntelliJ because it is so good. PyCharm specifically, although I have used other IntelliJ products in the past, starting with the original Java editor, 15 years ago or so, which was heavily praised by some friends.But otherwise, I want to be able to extend the editor easily, also its core itself. I want to be able to support it when the original developer stopped working on it. Or port it to other systems the developer does not care about. Or do some changes the developer disagrees with. Etc. I want to be sure that it is in principle possible to run this in the next 10-20 years. Or not only me. The nice thing with open source is that many people think likewise, and then there will also be others doing such effort, like supporting it on recent systems, adding features, fixing bugs, etc. So then it is a community effort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context in mind, what jumps out to me is a remarkable compositional competence of the algorithm, even when given extremely vague prompts like &#34;happy sisyphus&#34;. The images match the prompt remarkably well with a few notable exceptions like &#34;cottagecore tech-adjacent young robert moses&#34;, where it seemed to have focused on &#34;cottage&#34; rather heavily, not understanding cottagecore as an aesthetic neologism,  and &#34;power bottom dad is for the people&#34;, which definitely got the &#34;dad&#34; part, but it looks like it still struggled to understand &#34;power bottom&#34; (perhaps the curation of training data may have contributed to this). Even if these were curated specifically to match the prompt, what the algorithm was able to do with profiles is amazing (especially bearing in mind that these profiles are meant to be evocative, intentionally idiosyncratic blendings of extremely complex, contextual terms that were written without visual representation in mind, even if they gesture at specific aesthetics)Side note: what might make artists a bit relieved is the fact that artifacting is still pretty apparent even in the curated examples. Fine details or even whole figures sometime devolve into that scrambled topography familiar to AI art. Even in more compositionally competent artworks, the &#34;brush strokes&#34; frequently have identifiable blurs at the margins. Text also seems to be gibberish even if aesthetically coherent. Even still, these are all such minor issues that additional photoshop would be both easy and readily doable.Overall, this is frankly stunning and I&#39;m really excited to see what others come up with. I feel like it&#39;s language and composition ability definitely did not disappoint the hype of its press release."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously, from the AI point of view, this is just amazing and frankly terrifying.OK, I&#39;ll be the guy who brings the snark. It seems that when Silicon Valley tech people create AI, it makes exactly the art you&#39;d expect Silicon Valley tech people to like. I.e. this is very much the style you see in NFTs, or, as someone else said, in Dixit. It&#39;s quirky and stoner-ish, very &#34;transcendental&#34;... for an AI, it&#39;s amazing...For a human, it would be dross.Yeah, yeah, I know, art is subjective, well I like it, how can you impose your tastes on the rest of the world, et cetera et cetera. Sorry, but it&#39;s dross! It&#39;s the kind of work the guy in the art shop up the road churns out, and sells to the ignorant locals in my town. It&#39;s the art equivalent of Visual Basic. (I&#39;m trying to get through to you that in this world, too, things can not just be done, but be done well or badly.)If there&#39;s a lesson on the AI side here (and maybe there isn&#39;t) it is just that these machines are still copying. They were trained on a bunch of art - and you can clearly see the kind of art that was used. Presumably, if it were just trained on Old Masters and Picasso, Dall-E would be mass-producing the stuff I, an intellectual, like.Note the difference, though, with a real artist. A real artist takes as input the real world - Rouen cathedral, the horrors of war in Spain, a Campbell&#39;s soup can - and produces art as output. This takes as input art and produces more art."</p>

    ...
    /^a*b?a*$/ =~ &#34;a&#34; * 50000 + &#34;x&#34;

I think I would favor the:    long_time_re = Regexp.new(&#34;^a*b?a*$&#34;, timeout: 1.0)

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some web apps still in production that I wrote almost a decade ago in Node+Express in the simplest, dumbest style imaginable. The only dependencies are Express and some third-party API connectors. The database is an append-only file of JSON objects separated by newlines. When the app restarts, it reads the file and rebuilds its memory image. All data is in RAM.I figured these toys would be replaced pretty quickly, but turns out they do the job for these small businesses and need very little maintenance. Moving the app to a new server instance is dead simple because there&#39;s basically just the script and the data file to copy over, so you can do OS updates and RAM increases that way. Nobody cares about a few minutes of downtime once a year when that happens.There are good reasons why we have containers and orchestration and stuff, but it&#39;s interesting to see how well this dumb single-process style works for apps that are genuinely simple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was interviewing for software jobs recently, and while I was studying up on the &#34;system design&#34; portion I kept circling around the same insight that Dan Luu writes about so well here.I would sit down at an interview and try to create these &#34;proper&#34; system designs with boxes and arrows and failovers and caches and well tuned databases. But in the back of my mind I kept thinking, &#34;didn&#39;t Facebook scale to a billion users with PHP, MySQL, and Memcache?&#34;It reminds me of &#34;Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster&#34; at https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-... , and the occasional post by https://rachelbythebay.com/w/ where she builds a box that&#39;s just fast and with very basic tooling (and a lot of know-how)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the biggest problem for most developers is not understanding what one computer can actually do and how reliable they are in practice.Additionally, understanding of how tolerant 99% of businesses are to real-world problems that could hypothetically arise can help one not frustrate over insane edge case circumstances. I suspect a non-zero number of us have spent time thinking about how we could provide deterministic guarantees of uptime that even unstoppable cosmic radiation or regional nuclear war couldnt interrupt.I genuinely hope that the recent reliability issues with cloud &amp; SAAS providers has really driven home the point that a little bit of downtime is almost never a fatal issue for a business.&#34;Failover requires manual intervention&#34; is a feature, not a caveat."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh RFPs are an everlasting source of fun in B2B.Like, we&#39;ve received the wrong questionaire once. It contained the question what we would do if armed forces intruded into our secured facilities to seize assets. We eventually settled on the answer &#34;Run or hide, while calling the cops&#34;. At that point the customer noticed their error and it was pretty funny.In other areas, the consulting teams and us are developing some degree of a safe word system. Ask us in operations for something the right way and we can give an annoying answer how nothing is possible due to security policies and compliance and further discussion requires meetings with people with long job titles. And suddenly, deal breakers aren&#39;t that important anymore. And sometimes you can even team up with the customers infosec department this way in order to simplify things into a both more secure and easier path.The best way we&#39;ve found around this is to write white papers for commonly asked questions and topics, like storage security. It&#39;s great for our sales guys to be able to answer common questions with a PDF with a bit of glamour, but with enough incomprehensibility density to look important and to get forwarded to infosec / CISOs. Yes I&#39;m a bit jaded about the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back when I had my own HPC company, we often consulted on RFP specs for customers building clusters.  After a while we started building our own clusters.  A well known large/prestigious university on the East Coast US called us to help with the RFP, and bid.  We did.We found out later that they simply wanted help with the RFP.  They never took our bid seriously.  Small company with a great rep, they preferred dealing with the large companies with meh reps.Another one ... a university somewhere here in Michigan, an alma mater of mine in fact, did something akin to this, but used another vendor as its stalking horse.  We constructed our bid aggressively, and submitted.Later that month, while on vacation with the family in Florida, the purchasing agent called me up.  She wanted me to teach the other companies how to do what we did (much higher density, far better performance, etc.)  I asked why.  She said they liked our solution.  They just didn&#39;t want to buy from us.We&#39;d won the RFP.  But lost the business.Of course, we declined teaching our competitors.  They (the university) were unhappy with that, and didn&#39;t understand why we wouldn&#39;t do this for them.I was then, and still am somewhat, blown away by the complete lack of understanding of how businesses actually work, on the part of the RFP folks, the purchasing agents, etc.Another time, I had a university call us up asking for a bid for something.  I asked if they had a preferred vendor (all do).  She said yes, but state law said they need at least 3 bids before they can purchase.  I asked if our bid would be taken seriously.  She said no.Yeah.  I&#39;ve shared some of these anecdotes with others in this industry, and we all nod our heads.  All of us have run into this before.  Some of the stories are far more outrageous than mine.An interesting tangent:  I currently work for a company whose RFP we won ~14 years ago for storage, but was rejected by the person who was my first boss here, as we (the company back then) were too small.  That&#39;s happened multiple times throughout my career.   Even though our solution was demonstrably superior in all technical and financial aspects, we &#34;lost&#34;.Can be disheartening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some companies even do this for job applications. A manager has a person they want for a role but, because of policy, they must publish it on their employment website, and go through the charade of interviewing candidates, wasting everybody&#39;s time. In the end, their preferred candidate wins."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lovely game!I wonder if it might be a nicer UX if you could choose for the Shift key to be needed to slide circles around rather than to move the selection. In my mind, conceptually, arrow keys are for moving the selection, and tessellating objects &#34;requires more work&#34; so I&#39;d expect Shift to be needed for that - not vice-versa."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty fun. Thank you OP!Little off-topic, though, I love how Wordle kinda opened our eyes to the possibility of doing this kind of games in the web instead off a one-off native app. I recently made a word puzzle myself[1] which some of my friends enjoy playing and there&#39;s no way I would go through the soul-crushing cross-platorm native development ordeal for such a niche little app. But it can live in the web! (and pretty much for free thanks to Netlify). I&#39;m now thinking of dusting and old Objective-C game that I wrote 10 years ago and never released, and rewrite it on web.Idk, suddenly I feel excited about the web, again.[1] https://palabrije.com/en (Sorry for the self-promotion)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a kid, I loved a game called [James Bond Jr.](https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/james-bond-jr/screenshots...) that had these little puzzles that were super fun to do. Some of them were hair-pulling difficult, too. I never saw a modern rendition of those puzzles, so I thought to create one.Eight Colors is the result. The rules are simply, but puzzles do get challenging after few levels.Hope HN likes it! Happy to hear any feedback!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; During last year’s election campaign, Trudeau’s party also proposed a ban on “blind bidding” for houses -- the prevailing system by which offers are kept secret when someone is auctioning a home.This is such a huge deal. Anyone who has had to go through the process of buying a home through a bidding war knows how unfair and one-sided this process is. It take a high-pressure emotional situation, and gives all of the information to one side (the sellers), while leaving the buyer stuck guessing at what the real price for the house is supposed to be. An absolutely horrible process that should be banned. Banning this is such a simple reform. I sincerely hope it happens, though I doubt it it will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know the specifics on Canadian real estate market and the specifics of the problems there, but based on my understanding of the problems facing your neighbors to the south - I feel like it’s almost an attempt to appease citizens by blaming the issue on “foreigners” (always a move that is popular with politicians) to redirect attention from the much more likely cause - massive investments made by hedge funds, private capital, REITs which does not appear to be addressed at all?Thought I do agree that a non-primary-resident investment, whether from citizens, foreigners, or capital should be greatly limited overall and these rules should only loosen to direct investment towards areas that are in dire need of an influx of capital for redevelopment. That is - if it’s not distressed, and it’s not going to be your primary residence - GTFO, you should be last in line to buy.And I say that as former landlord. I just believe that if I was looking to make some money - I could probably do just fine under these conditions. I don’t see an issue of buying a distressed property needing a rehab, and I think doing so benefits everyone.I am getting real tired of society getting ever more dystopian just so that someone can make a buck.https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/r..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Originally released in 1993, the Onyx from SiliconGraphics was an absolute powerhouse. The machines were powered by between one and four MIPS processors (originally the R4400’s) — ranging from 100 MHz to 250 MHz.250 MHz in 1993 is insanity, considering that was the 33 MHz 486 era.&gt; The RAM on these machines were not industry standard [...] and could handle up to 8 GB of RAM. 16 GB in the rackmount version (yeah, there was a massive rackmount version).8 gig of RAM at a time when home users didn&#39;t even have 1 GB hard drives.  16 GB of RAM at a time when a home user&#39;s desktop could read memory at &lt; 100 MB/s.Having those specs then would be like running a 37 Ghz CPU with 16 TB of RAM now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at Rareware in that same era, similarly ridiculous amounts of SGI hardware in the building.  As I recall each artist had an SGI Indigo2 and later on the SGI O2 because the standard artist workstation.  I believe our lead artist used an SGI Onyx.  Programmers had Indy2&#39;s with the internal N64 development boards.There were at least 2 rack mounted SGI machines used for large-scale rendering jobs (ie promotional images, magazine covers etc).  May have been SGI Challenges (I know one certainly was) and were kept off-limits to most staff, at the time they were rumored to cost $250k each."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah yes, good ol&#39; SGI, it always brings a smile to my face reading these old war stories.I wish we could get some insight on the development of the first successful 3D game on PC, Quake by I&#39;d software as there&#39;s a famous picture of John Carmack sitting in front of some SGI workstation with a monitor with a resolution ox 1920*1080( in 1995!)Also, SGI powered most VFX Studios of that era, so many great movies went through those machines before ending up on the big screen.It&#39;s insane how quickly 3dfx, Nvidia and Intel X86 consumer hardware made SGI workstations overpriced and completely obsolete within the span of just a few years. The &#39;90&#39;s were a blast.But still, I&#39;m sad to see SGI go, as their funky shaped and brightly colored workstations and monitors had the best industrial design[1] in  an era of depressing beige, grey or black square boxes.[1] https://preview.redd.it/tt3ziuwt98o31.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e5cc61..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These articles typically come in the form of, I was paying for my brand name when I was number one on organic search. I wasn&#39;t validating any of my other ad spend, I stopped and didn&#39;t see any negative impact, therefore advertising doesn&#39;t work/is a scam.As someone who&#39;s worked in the industry a while, I agree that it&#39;s a sad state of affairs generally but when people extrapolate that this means all advertising is bs it&#39;s just not true. Fundamentally business orders should track results from their ads the same way they look at impact anywhere else in their business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I probably hate ads more than most people but when I hear or see an ad, it kills my willingness to engage with a business. I mean, this isn&#39;t entirely conscious. I was thinking about whether my kid would like those creative boxes from KiwiCo that I heard good things about organically. Then, I heard an ad for them on a podcast, and I noticed a new extra resistance and hesitation to buy anything from them.I don&#39;t want to be a sucker for ads. I don&#39;t want to support businesses that support our ad-polluted world. With my limited capacity to donate directly to creative work (which I&#39;d incidentally rather do as part of a coordinated general public than just unilaterally), I favor donating to those who forgo ads rather than reward or support anything that accepts ads.Now, I&#39;ve hated ads for a long time. But I was still surprised how much I no longer feel fine considering KiwiCo. Now that I heard their ad, I feel like I don&#39;t want to be one of those people who is seen as following ads, and I don&#39;t want to support them. I imagine there&#39;s other products that don&#39;t budget as much for ads that I should go out of my way to seek out instead.So for anyone like me, if you do paid ads, you just harmed your credibility with me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though only in a single industry and an n=1 case, we got to see what would happen if a movie went into wide release with no advertising. Would enough people see the movie poster or listing for what&#39;s playing at the theater and be curious enough to see the movie? Or would the lack of advertising doom it?&#39;Delgo&#39; was released to theaters on over 2000 screens with an all-star cast in December of 2008 and virtually no marketing budget. It averaged roughly two paying customers per showing. More people saw Conan O&#39;Brien making jokes about it on his show than saw it in the theaters. Though critically panned as derivative and several years out of date with its CGI, movies with far worse reviews have done much better. The real difference seems to be that no one knew that it existed.That said, a new Star Wars movie with no advertising likely would still end up with plenty of ticket buyers. Existing brands can much more easily get away with taking their foot off the media buying accelerator but how long could they do it before a slow-down occurred? Seems like Marvel and DC still purchase lots of advertising for their well-known and currently popular franchises. What would happen if they stopped? Not sure if we&#39;ll ever know since they&#39;re unlikely to take that risk."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is always a tough subject for me because everyone seems to have at least an idea of what they want to achieve.When I was younger I had these silly dreams of moving to another country, getting married, becoming a programmer to make games, have my own company and get rich (haha).I did become a programmer and got married, but never left the country or became rich. Now on my 30s I know how limited my options are.I could focus on my craft. But I don&#39;t have the same drive as before.
I could try to progress my career, but I&#39;m already earning good money and I know to earn more I&#39;d have to either start job hopping or study some leetcode to get into a FAANG.
I could try to focus on my hobbies, but you realize very quickly that to get good at anything, you need hundreds/thousands of hours.
I could try to start a company, but I know that&#39;s extremely hard to do and also requires a shit-ton of luck to work out.After all that, I realize that I have no real objectives to strive for. Some of the dreams I realized and they weren&#39;t that satisfying. Some I discovered were not worth pursuing.And now what?In the end, I&#39;m just a blip in the universe and when I&#39;m gone it will be unchanged, the same as if I had never existed. Yet we focus on these artificial goals set by childish dreams, society or life events.What&#39;s the point of it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Growing up, the idea of a career in computing was implausible. The only computing course my school offered was scheduled against doing a full science course, and they had nothing for the 16-18 range. The local night school programming class I signed up for was cancelled because I was the only person who signed up for it. My parents made it extremely clear that the idea that I could ever make money writing software was unrealistic, which meant I was 27 with a PhD in genetics before I jumped ship into software full time.And maybe because of that, I&#39;m pretty ok with things? Every day I&#39;m aware that I could do more. I know people who could take over my job right now who are 15 years younger than me. And that&#39;s ok, because I have achieved so much more than ever seemed possible to me as a teenager, and every time I stare out the window and realise I&#39;m in San Francisco and part of the industry that was so far away when I was growing up I have to take a moment to come to terms with the fact that this is actually reality.I know this article is satire, but I also know that many people hold themselves against standards that are not realistic. Almost none of us have achieved everything that we could be, and that&#39;s just fine. If you&#39;re spending a lot of time troubled by the fact that you feel like you&#39;re falling short of your potential then this is a great time to find a therapist who can help you work through that. It&#39;s ok to want more than you have, but if you&#39;re objectively in a basically good place then you really shouldn&#39;t be constantly aware of that in a negative way. I&#39;m at peace with the fact that I&#39;m never going to found the next unicorn company or be CEO of Google or even write some software that a lot of people care about. Let&#39;s be kind to each other and ourselves about what we&#39;ve achieved, rather than holding ourselves to a model of what we could theoretically be if literally everything had gone our way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I&#39;m not sure what the compensation model for recruiters is, but it seems to encourage bringing in as many candidates as possible over treating them with honesty and respect.From experience dealing with recruiters for the last 25 years they universally lie to both sides to pocket the commission at all costs.I drove 400 miles once to do an interview for a solution architect position. Got there and the company were recruiting an Oracle DBA. The recruiter had plain up lied because I had some Oracle experience on my CV. They assured me they would ream the recruiter and bought me lunch and gave me an Amazon voucher to cover the fuel and time though which was nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very anecdotal, but I have a friend that interviewed at Google for a Remote SWE position - everything indicated that it was remote: the posting, the recruiter and the hiring manager.Now they announced RTO, his manager said: &#34;We&#39;re excited to have you at the office&#34; - he was really confused about this messaging, so they forced him to apply to work remotely (even if he had been hired as such) denied his application on the grounds that this SWE role that requires a lot of cross regional interaction and virtual meetings - requires &#34;intense collaboration that you can only get in an office&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was an engineer at Fast for over a year and wanted to clarify a few points--
- engineers did have access to data and could write their own queries to check revenue (but few people did until the article came out).
- the strategy leadership decided on was to go after massive enterprise sellers which would, in theory, result in step-change functions in revenue. Many people knew about the low numbers but were willing to let the strategy play out for a while. There was a lot of excitement internally around closing the first $1B+ seller
- Internally, the culture was something akin to &#34;toxic positivity&#34; which meant that we weren&#39;t willing to discuss failures or misses in a productive way
- The company spent a lot of money on marketing events including sponsorship deals with the Tampa Bay Lightning and the rumored million dollar concert by the Chain Smokers. People are talking a lot about high engineer salaries but IMO those were far from the biggest problem (possible biased view)The story is a lot more complicated and nuanced than the headlines you read in publications but I will say that Fast was full of really talented folks who I&#39;d be happy to work with again. For me, a big lesson I took away from this experience is the perils of an overly positive fully remote culture. It&#39;s very easy for leadership to hide things from people when information doesn&#39;t easily spread across different organizations"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the most applicable warning for engineers when it comes to the actual work, as opposed to whether one should join a particular startup, is this:&gt; Engineers calculated the load Fast had in needing to serve their traffic. The Fast button was rendered less than 500,000 times per day - rarely needed to ever serve more than a few requests per second.&gt; One of the few warning signs engineers noticed is how Fast spent far more on infrastructure than the scale of the operation would have called for. Engineers sometimes brought up suggestions to scale infra down, and save costs - given there was not much revenue generated.Sounds like the whole thing could have run on a single cheap VM, perhaps with a second one for redundancy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oof, just one of our customers pays about the same as their full revenue, and we&#39;re a cockroach team.The real thing here is they&#39;re not that surprising. A lot of companies with their kind of funding use enterprise sales to force say $5-10M ARR, but there&#39;s only so much VC money can force for a leaky funnel, broken product, and overall incorrect market + fit. I didn&#39;t appreciate this until maybe a year or two ago. Valuation multiples in 50-100X range are super common (and even wackier numbers in seed/a). Think make believe stories like &#34;well with another 12-18mo of growth  this really just a bit over a 30X on some future forward revenue multiple...&#34;. The cash almost always leads to overspending, and it&#39;s highly unlikely the next 2-3 raises won&#39;t blow up and everyone goes home. I&#39;m actually super impressed by the Docker team because they&#39;ve been one of those rare cases of crawling out of that trap, even if with a lot less of the team.We get job candidates with high competing offers for companies I know to be rotten inside, yet there&#39;s only so much I can say. &#34;Our new hires are getting paid from customer revenue and with equity that doesn&#39;t have $50M-$500M of investor thumbs on the scales already cutting you out in 95% of the likely scenarios&#34; generally doesn&#39;t punch through the kool aid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just like the author, I too am quite particular about empty space in my MP3 files.When I was ripping my CD collection, I religiously tagged the MP3 files with ID3v1. Later on, I had some tracks whose titles were just a tad longer than 30 chars so I had to use ID3v2 for those and I noticed the file size grew by _a lot_.Frustrated by this, I opened them in a hex editor and learnt that ID3v1 was a fixed format of 128 bytes, but v2 was variable. I also found out that the software had added a 4KB zero-byte padding to the v2 tag, which was &#34;necessary&#34; because the tag is now at the front of the file, and this padding allows more tag data to be added easily later on.I tried various ID3 tagging software at that time and all of them added a padding. So I learned about the tag format and wrote a tagger myself that didn&#39;t add any padding. It was a great learning experience, and I managed to shave those useless zero bytes from my MP3s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with the FLAC format and it also recommends padding to make it easier to edit metadata. I think libflac reserves 4 KB by default.&gt; PADDING: This block allows for an arbitrary amount of padding. The contents of a PADDING block have no meaning. This block is useful when it is known that metadata will be edited after encoding; the user can instruct the encoder to reserve a PADDING block of sufficient size so that when metadata is added, it will simply overwrite the padding (which is relatively quick) instead of having to insert it into the right place in the existing file (which would normally require rewriting the entire file).-- https://xiph.org/flac/format.html#format_overview"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ripping from cd reserves 0.05% (about 5kb) for metadata. I can imagine some communication breakdown where someone thought they meant 5% (about 500kb) when specifying the number 0.05 with a % next to it. You see percentage mixups all the time."</p>

But it&#39;s improving! (https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/t9nuaz/whats_up_wit...)In the meantime, some of us still use Google to search Reddit, hence https://redditle.comOr for some of us, because Google&#39;s results are increasingly filled with clickbait, &#34;reddit&#34; has been a cheatcode to navigate that. Redditle is for you too!Is it the same as Googling &#34;site:reddit.com&#34;? Yes :DRedditle also supports searching in a specific subreddit with &#34;r/&lt;subreddit&gt;&#34; e.g. &#34;r/webdev guide to vue&#34; would search in r/webdev.GitHub repo - https://github.com/greentfrapp/redditle"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very cool. I&#39;ve always been very disappointed that programming is so utterly dominated by the linear text format. It feels like so much potential for expression and feedback is getting left on the table, making use of our capacity to understand and work with spatialisation, patterns, sounds, colours, dynamics, etc would make a lot of sense.Bret Victor&#39;s The Future of Programming and other talks come to mind - https://youtu.be/8pTEmbeENF4"</p>

That&#39;s what I think... And obviously there&#39;s incredible groups like what openai just did with the drawing technology. But as an individual contributor this person&#39;s incredible.Also I love the relentless exploration of code as an artistic medium."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m only part way through the paper, but what struck me as interesting so far is this:In other text-to-image algorithms I&#39;m familiar with (the ones you&#39;ll typically see passed around as colab notebooks that people post outputs from on Twitter), the basic idea is to encode the text, and then try to make an image that maximally matches that text encoding.  But this maximization often leads to artifacts - if you ask for an image of a sunset, you&#39;ll often get multiple suns, because that&#39;s even more sunset-like.   There&#39;s a lot of tricks and hacks to regularize the process so that it&#39;s not so aggressive, but it&#39;s always an uphill battle.Here, they instead take the text embedding, use a trained model (what they call the &#39;prior&#39;) to predict the corresponding image embedding - this removes the dangerous maximization.  Then, another trained model (the &#39;decoder&#39;) produces images from the predicted embedding.This feels like a much more sensible approach, but one that is only really possible with access to the giant CLIP dataset and computational resources that OpenAI has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;We’ve limited the ability for DALL·E 2 to generate ... adult images.I think that using something like this for porn could potentially offer the biggest benefit to society. So much has been said about how this industry exploits young and vulnerable models. Cheap autogenerated images (and in the future videos) would pretty much remove the demand for human models and eliminate the related suffering, no?EDIT: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few comments by someone who&#39;s spent way too much time in the AI-generated space:* I recommend reading the Risks and Limitations section that came with it because it&#39;s very through: https://github.com/openai/dalle-2-preview/blob/main/system-c...* Unlike GPT-3, my read of this announcement is that OpenAI does not intend to commercialize it, and that access to the waitlist is indeed more for testing its limits (and as noted, commercializing it would make it much more likely lead to interesting legal precedent). Per the docs, access is very explicitly limited: (https://github.com/openai/dalle-2-preview/blob/main/system-c... )* A few months ago, OpenAI released GLIDE ( https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im ) which uses a similar approach to AI image generation, but suspiciously never received a fun blog post like this one. The reason for that in retrospect may be &#34;because we made it obsolete.&#34;* The images in the announcement are still cherry-picked, which is therefore a good reason why they tested DALL-E 1 vs. DALL-E 2 presumably on non-cherrypicked images.* Cherry-picking is relevant because AI image generation is still slow unless you do real shenanigans that likely compromise image quality, although OpenAI has likely a better infra to handle large models as they have demonstrated with GPT-3.* It appears DALL-E 2 has a fun endpoint that links back to the site for examples with attribution: https://labs.openai.com/s/Zq9SB6vyUid9FGcoJ8slucTu"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very similar and would just give you two pieces of advice: (1) buy books compulsively and don&#39;t do your research predominantly online, and (2) make sure you write often, whether or not you publish your work or keep it to yourself. I think the latter is the most important advice for those trying to pursue an intellectual path outside of academia -- if you don&#39;t develop a habit of writing, you aren&#39;t really synthesizing what you&#39;ve learned and developing your thought. Don&#39;t worry if the quality is not great to begin with (and certainly don&#39;t worry that it seems cliched).The other thing I would suggest, if your career and family would manage, is spending time working in the UK. It&#39;s very easy to get a visa if you&#39;re involved in the tech industry and their higher education system for MA/MS degrees and PhDs is very different than the US, both more affordable and better suited towards working life. In the US, the thought is that if you&#39;re doing a PhD, say, it&#39;s a full-time professionalized pursuit under the assumption you will be a professor; in the rest of the world, a PhD is essentially an apprenticeship in writing under a mentor for however long it takes you, often with no aim (i.e. career) other than that writing itself.Personally, I&#39;ve alternated between highly-paid years working in the tech industry and years studying or writing without employment to great personal satisfaction (and managed to help publish a few scholarly anthologies that wouldn&#39;t have happened without someone who didn&#39;t need to rely on academic grants etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t quit your day job - ya gotta pay the rent. And in the meantime, if you gain satisfaction from satisfying your curiosity about myriad things, go with that. It doesn&#39;t have to have an end or a greater purpose. Everybody you know has a head filled with things they&#39;ll never &#34;usefully apply&#34; to the greater world around them: it&#39;s a fact of life. So if you end up on your deathbed with nothing having really clicked for you - no celebrity, no fortune - then that&#39;s how it goes. There is always your family - don&#39;t screw that up. 
The world&#39;s a mess and so are most of the people in it so don&#39;t sweat it. Sturgeon&#39;s Law applies.
But by all means gather friends around you with whom you can have civilized, intelligent conversation - it&#39;s important."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Investing might be an area where you can profit from being the way you are.I am very similar, having read way over 1k books in the last ten years or so, on a perversely wide array of subjects. I’ve also done everything from tinkering with Arduinos all the way to marriage counseling. But I quickly get bored and move on to the next field.An early disciple of CG Jung, Marie Louise von Franz, wrote that the life of our personality type looks like a never ending track of fields sown but never reaped.But while you may never stay long enough on a field to reap its fruit, what you do reap is a very interconnected, multidisciplinary way of understanding the world, which comes to you not so much in the form of explicit knowledge but in the form of a very special “intuition”.That isn’t to say that you are infallible. In fact, you should always be careful to question that intuition and to try to make as much of it as possible explicit, even just to yourself. But if you do that, you have a good chance of being quite successful with a Peter Thiel style of investing.Just always keep in mind your three biggest enemies: The mimetic reflex of wanting to follow the herd and get approval from others. The seductive illusion of superiority or infallibility. And the general tendency of wanting to be right, and of fooling yourself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t need to use Twitter&#39;s JS to show Tweets. If you choose to use their system, you&#39;re subject to their rules. If you don&#39;t like their rules, don&#39;t use their stuff.Calling it &#34;altering the public record&#34; is a little hyperbolic imo. If you want to act as a repository for the public record, you better use your own system. Twitter is under no obligation to retain this kind of stuff on your behalf.I&#39;m not trying to say that this is right or wrong, just that these are the facts of the matter when you engage with a company&#39;s code and terms of service."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see so many people here arguing that by embedding javascript directly from Twitter, you are accepting whatever they choose to make that javascript do. While that is true to an extent, Twitter has provided documentation for this javascript that says that if the Tweet gets deleted, the javascript will simply stop styling your quote of the tweet that you have on your website.By changing the behavior of the javascript, without even updating the documentation, Twitter has broken every rule of being a good distributor of third-party code. In a similar vein, any third party code could at any time do any number of malicious things. Just because I didn&#39;t pay Twitter for the privilege of running their code and just because I embedded their code in my website does not make it okay for them to start distributing malware to modify my website to their liking.There are lots of other malicious things Twitter could have the javascript do. Twitter could start showing ads before and after all quoted tweets. This would also conflict with the documentation and would be malicious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Functionality aside embedding random scripts from twitter seems like a big risk for security and privacy.At a minimum, it should probably be embedded in a sandboxed iframe.Just taking a screenshot, and linking to the tweet, seems like a more robust solution, that won&#39;t randomly stop working, and doesn&#39;t have the same privacy issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple things about the content of this post, that people aren&#39;t talking about. Mastering Emacs by Mickey Petersen is a solid book on Emacs and a good companion to the official manual. Mickey usually has an update to Mastering Emacs not long after a new version is released, which is great. I&#39;m thankful for his many contributions to the Emacs community, and I really enjoyed reading his thoughts on the new features and additions to Emacs 28.Secondly, the breadth of the changes in Emacs 28.1 is staggering, especially considering that Emacs 27.1 was released some 19 months ago. I think it&#39;s safe to say that despite all the hand-wringing about the antiquated email-centric way that Emacs is developed, an impressive amount of work is getting done. Emacs  development is alive and well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wayland support didn&#39;t make it... Oh well it is in version 29.I&#39;ve been using the wayland version with libgccjit many months now from their git repo and it is extremely snappy and stable editor.My strategy to keep all of this together is a nix derivation that compiles the latest master branch with all the plugins. Oh and my config is an org file with clear comments...https://github.com/pimeys/nixos/tree/main/desktop/emacsAll reproducible...Btw. I recommend SystemCrafters video series Emacs from scratch. It teaches how to make a vanilla emacs to work like doom emacs does. It was helpful for me to understand the magic behind doom...https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bB..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been testing Emacs 28 for a few weeks now, as it was reported to improve performance on LSP integration (which was sometimes sluggish for me with rust).I have to say I wasn&#39;t disappointed. It&#39;s now comparatively blazingly fast. I hugely recommend to give it a try if you work in emacs with LSP.Since my distro had not packaged it yet, I installed it from guix instead (package `emacs-next`). It worked like a charm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"USPTO will actually search for this kind of thing (assuming the situation is as-described, which I suspect is not assured). Source: this happened to me -- I wrote an internal doc describing a new product feature. That doc was used both our product documentation team has the basis for user documentation; and by our patent team as the basis for a patent application. When the patent was reviewed, the examiner found the user doc on the internet and rejected the application due to prior art. We had to prove to the USPTO that both were derived from an older doc (by finding the older doc with timestamp and sending it to them with associated legal knobs and whistles)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Identifying the connection between one-way functions and Kolmogorov complexity is truly impressive. But the article oversimplified a few things that may be misleading for someone.1. One-way functions are not all cryptography. Some constructions may need stronger assumptions than one-way functions (we don&#39;t know yet if they do). So this problem is a “Master Problem” only for a subset of cryptography (symmetric encryption, pseudorandom generators, etc.).2. This is not the first “Master Problem” to base one-way functions on. There&#39;s Levin&#39;s complete one way function [1; Section 4.3]. Breaking it is proven to be as hard as any other one-way function, in other words if there exist one-way functions then this is one of them. But Levin&#39;s construction is somewhat artificial (it combines many one-way function candidates to create the “master one-way function”) and is not as surprising since its techniques and formulation are similar to how the usual one-way functions are defined. The connection from the linked article, on the other hand, is very surprising and unusual; it connects one-way functions to a more distant field which (to me) seems to be operating with quite different concepts.It&#39;s also fun to know that similar “Master Problems” exist for other primitives too. For example, for public-key encryption there&#39;s a Complete Public Key cryptosystem [2]. Albeit this one is similar in spirit to Levin&#39;s construction (not as surprising IMO as the linked article), the complete cryptosystem is obtained by combining many other cryptosystems.[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0012023[2]: https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il//eccc-reports/2006/TR06-046/inde..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An even more tantalizing result by the prolific Rafael and Yanyi is the following paper [1] which discusses how to relate the existence of one-way functions to the assumption that BPP \neq EXP (two classes).If you spend the time understanding just the statement of their result in that paper, you get to an eerily small gap between &#34;heuristic algorithms&#34; for a version of the time-bounded K-complexity, and &#34;errorless&#34; versions of it.Their line of research has been even more inspiring than this very well-written quanta article suggests.[1] https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/535.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes sense, intuitively; if I gave you &#34;8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4&#34; (sha256(&#39;hi&#39;)), and you quickly told me its K complexity was 2, I would become skeptical that sha256 was a one way function. (assuming of course you didn&#39;t brute force it)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Matrix demo is close but the facial expressions are still a bit off like the person who&#39;s doing mocap is wearing a mask even if they&#39;re not. It&#39;ll be quite interesting when they finally get those issues resolved and when developers also try to make more unreal (pun intended) looking effects that interact more with realistic looking settings or characters. Having the freedom to make such a disjointed thing in a 3d renderer like how surrealists use to do with oil paints and the like it something underutilized in cinema and games imo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; First off, there’s Lumen—a fully dynamic global illumination solution that enables you to create believable scenes where indirect lighting adapts on the fly to changes to direct lighting or geometry—for example, changing the sun’s angle with the time of day, turning on a flashlight, or opening an exterior door. With Lumen, you no longer have to author lightmap UVs, wait for lightmaps to bake, or place reflection captures; you can simply create and edit lights inside the Unreal Editor and see the same final lighting your players will see when the game or experience is run on the target platform.Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but isn&#39;t this basically a software-based implementation of NVIDIA&#39;s hardware-based RTX?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone that has experience with Unreal Engine give some sort of approximation of what is required to sort of achieve minimum competency as a developer in it? Like, with web stuff, you can get up and running fairly quickly and slowly scaffold your way to more intricate projects... can the same be done with something like this or is the initial learning curve a bit steeper?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t see how this could ever be legitimate. Giving out an unlaunched shitcoin and a t shirt in exchange for the biometric data of people who very clearly don’t understand crypto or biometric data (read: random person in a mall, regardless of country). This is pretty clearly taking advantage of people.My question is, couldn’t you do this fairly without even spending that much money? Say you need 5MM scans to build your database (that you’re going to delete the data from anyway). With shitcoins it’s close to free, but you had to pay a bunch of engineers and marketers. Why not give each person $5 USD converted to their local currency? For $25MM you are actually having a positive impact, don’t get dragged through the mud in articles like this, and it didn’t even cost that much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worldcoin talks about UBI which based on what Sam has said in the past I would take them at their word on. But beyond UBI what WorldCoin is going for is identity.In the nonblockchain world your identity is your Country ID, Passport, etc.In the blockchain world none of that stuff exists and people get uncomfortable when you start asking for it.This leaves a situation where a person is often just represented by a wallet. Well as you may know a person can make dozens or hundreds of wallets.This problem leads to all kinds of weird tricks that crypto projects get up to when trying to verify 1 wallet 1 person. For example in the idea of 1 person 1 vote on a project or for something like an airdrop early in a project where people on a discord get free crypto for being early adopters but you don&#39;t want one person registering with many wallets.Today that might look verification based on a phone number associated with discord or something. Real flimsy stuff.Worldcoin bases it on retina, which I admit creeps me out as well even if it&#39;s just a hash. But I can see what they&#39;re getting at. The need is there, maybe there is a better way.I used to work at crypto startup and we ran into this exact problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a few interactions with employees at Worldcoin. At a high level they&#39;re trying to solve a worthy problem: proof of personhood for crypto.HN is very anti-crypto so I expect any conversation on this topic is an uphill battle. If you&#39;re generally sceptical of crypto, Worldcoin will seem outright useless to you. I tend to believe there are some great ideas embedded in the cryptocurrency world alongside a lot of noise and speculation. Eventually the &#34;signal&#34; and core ideas will rise through, perhaps after a long period of pain.There are a whole class of ideas in crypto that require one wallet/address to correspond to one single person. Like all powerful ideas, there are ways that this could bring great value to the world and unfortunately also ways that this could be horrifically abused. Proof of personhood for crypto could enable verifiable UBI for the world. It could also enable mass surveillance if widely adopted.Given the interesting potential of the idea, someone was going to eventually work on it. Worldcoin should have approached the problem slightly differently. First, testing the concept in lower-income countries has a &#34;colonial experimentation&#34; look to it. Since the idea is controversial, they would have gained more goodwill by initially launching in the EU/North America under the more strict legal frameworks. Second, make the orb look less dystopian. Third, launch with a non-economic use case. Worldcoin won&#39;t solve UBI or inequality in one shot, so why not launch with a lower stakes use case such as an online forum or community that requires proof of personhood to post?Sadly I think because of all the missteps, I can&#39;t see Worldcoin tackling the proof of personhood problem in the longterm. I hope another project comes along and makes an attempt more &#34;sensitively&#34;."</p>
