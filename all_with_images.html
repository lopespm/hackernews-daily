								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this is the end of &#34;sending customer data to the us&#34;.
Quite impressive how fast the US-politics can burn billions in $, endanger the technological lead and build a massive opportunity for Europe!I, as a European could not be happier about this, from a economic standpoint.Hope you guys over there are not drifting to a surveillance dystopian."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"US folks who are interested in writing their Senators can find information at https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy...FWIW, I sent the email below (largely cribbed from the EFF).Dear :I am a constituent.  I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act, S.3538.  It does not strike a reasonable balance between fighting crimes and the rights of users to privacy and encryption.The bill empowers every state or territory to create sweeping new Internet regulations, by stripping away the legal protections for websites and apps in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The states will be allowed to pass whatever law they want to hold private companies liable, as long as they somehow relate their new rules to online child abuse.The bill’s sponsors have stated that EARN IT will pressure Internet companies to do widespread scanning of user messages and photos. This scanning is incompatible with strong encryption.  Consequently, the act allows states to pass laws that will punish companies when they deploy end-to-end encryption, or offer other encrypted services. This includes messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage, as well as web hosts like Amazon Web Services.The sponsors have falsely claimed that the act would protect children. But abusive images are already highly illegal under federal law. Any Internet platforms that knows about child sexual abuse material being distributed or received are required to take action on it, and can be severely prosecuted if they do not.EARN IT would lead to penalties for people and companies that use encryption.  The harm done by this will fall on vulnerable people. Once we allow encryption to be compromised in order to scan for one thing, authoritarian regimes will demand the same capabilities to track information shared by activists and journalists. Another example is that people subject to domestic abuse, including children, won’t have secure channels of communication to report and reach out for trusted help.Once again, I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act.Thank you,"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I don&#39;t see in the writeup, is which senators are voting which way. I can tell from the writeup what Blumenthal thinks of it, but not any other committee participants.I really wish politicians would embrace a &#34;we will make policies for things we can understand&#34; motto."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built a satirical social network called shlinkedin. It started as a way for me to learn elixir and make fun of thought leadership with my roommate, and has gradually gotten bigger. It’s all open source and a ton of fun to work on. Everyone is an alter ego (think Beff Jezos or Office Spider), and it’s hilarious to see how much people commit to the characters they create. And I can’t say enough good things about working with elixir / phoenix liveview. Definitely a steep learning curve for me (I’d never used a functional language before), but payoff is huge.https://www.shlinkedin.com"</p>

I play professionally.  For money. On stage.If you play for your entire life, you can get really good at a ton of things.I played pedal steel at a rehearsal for my country band tonight.  I played piano at a rehearsal for my hot club jazz band on Monday.  I played upright bass at a rehearsal for a string band last night.Sunday I recorded a new track with my girlfriend, ambient techno (novation circuit, moog, girlfriend&#39;s esoteric warblings).Monday I finished an EDM track.I have a bunch of aspirational goals.  I&#39;d like to DJ at my local ecstatic dance.  I&#39;d like to front a Louis Prima style jazz band.I&#39;ve been playing trumpet and trombone every day for the last 2 months.I don&#39;t care if I have any professional success.  But hard to say all that is a hobby.  Maybe I&#39;ll eventually be able to retire and just work as a musician, teaching and doing my little gigs and producing the records I engineer for other folks and running sound for the little parties we play out in the desert in Utah.Don&#39;t care.  My kids are raised, I&#39;ve got a reasonable remote day job.We&#39;ll see how it goes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on a project that aggregates data for every public transport provider in the country (Slovenia) and presents it as a simple API, along with an application to find rides with as few clicks as possible (without having to check every provider&#39;s website). This has involved tiring meetings with city officials convincing them to give us access to the data and writing scraping bots where they weren&#39;t convinced, so I&#39;ve sunk countless hours into the project.I currently know of only 3 people using it, but I&#39;m one of them and I believe this is something that should exist, so I don&#39;t care that I&#39;ll likely never evem break even on it. I&#39;ve started a nonprofit to fund the project, but it&#39;s been mostly my own money so far. Working on it has been really fun and I learned a ton about how stuff gets done in the intersection of public and private sector - both positive and negative.// For anyone in Slovenia interested in using it, there&#39;s an email in my profile. It&#39;s currently a closed beta, but everyone is welcome"</p>

and
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00819-6The big question is how quickly and completely can that layer restore itself? If damage accumulates over time and people are catching new variants every 3-4 months it is only a matter of time before mortality from cardiovascular issues in COVID negative formerly infected people goes much higher and much younger. We need studies on the cardiovascular recovery pace after COVID damage in different age groups, and after repeat COVID diagnosis from different variants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many of the &#34;Covid-19 increases risk of XYZ&#34; popular media articles lack baseline comparisons to other virus infections. (Disclaimer: Yes, we know Covid-19 isn&#39;t the flu, and it&#39;s more deadly.) My point is: how much does heart-disease risk increase post-Covid compared to say post-Influenza? Is it comparable or is the risk magnitudes larger than with other virus infections? This is an important benchmark, I understand scientific journals don&#39;t cater to laypeople but popular media does.From CDC website: &#34;Studies have shown that flu illness is associated with an increase in heart attacks and stroke. A 2018 study found that the risk of having a heart attack was 6 times higher within a week of a confirmed flu infection.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my mind, state is the real enemy impacting: comprehension, 
brittleness towards making changes, and the surface area exposed to potential bugs. OOP as frequently implemented, while claiming to encapsulate state, ends up creating so much more.In accordance with this view, I think project architecture should be approached with an emphasis around how much state is necessary for it to run. This is why simulations like say someone making a game or simcity with like relatively independent entities that map to something in real life use OOP. If you&#39;re writing a service doing requests, you want as minimal state as possible. Singletons are state. Initialized/non-static objects are state. The smaller amount you have the easier it is to reason about the system.As I write this however, I worry a little that my view is overly simplistic, or maybe applicable only to domains that I have worked in. If anyone wouldn&#39;t mind poking holes in this argument or offering examples I would appreciate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not read the article but I&#39;ve seen other blog posts on the subject.
The issue with &#34;OOP is bad&#34; is that OOP means different things to different people.Abstract Data Types are sort of a subset of OOP and are massively useful, I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to expose the internal implementation of a data structure most of the time. Any sort of plugin system works in an OO matter. It is a useful tool, no question.Even things like Actors like in Erlang (which are much closer to the Alan Kay style OO) are massively useful in a distributed setting where state is naturally distributed.Where you get into trouble is when you go the whole &#34;lets model a taxonomy of the world&#34; style with inheritance hierarchies or go ham on design patterns, layers upon layers of abstraction and other nonsense like that.The saddest thing about the &#34;object–relational impedance mismatch&#34; is that the focus went totally to the wrong side. The relational model is a much nicer way to model relations than a graph of objects (that&#39;s the whole point after all). SQL sucks but that&#39;s a separate issue, Entity Component Systems are a form of relational modeling for example and work really well, or even better Datalog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My issue with OOP is: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.I don&#39;t take issue with the authors, with their insights, or anything related to the content of the book. It&#39;s that the book exists at all: it&#39;s a book filled with solutions to imaginary problems.When using a procedural language the first thing you do is start implementing a solution. When using OOP, you first have to solve the imaginary problems created by OOP, only then can you start down the path of typing out a solution.It&#39;s significantly more difficult to refactor OOP (even with great tools) than it is procedural.If you could spend 20% less brain power, possibly 40% fewer keystrokes to describe the exact same solution, why wouldn&#39;t you?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m literally playing Factorio right now, with my kid. Got into it over Christmas based on HN talking about it all the time. Good game to multi because I don&#39;t have to pay attention all the time.It really reminds me of software in many ways. You fiddle with tiny little things like balancing a belt, and then move on to building belt balancers. You then move up the abstractions to where you&#39;re not really placing inserters all the time. Maybe you make some blueprints and you&#39;re placing a whole set of nuke power plants in one go, or looking at trains.The kid loves it, but you can (luckily) tell the difference between what he makes and what I make. That engineer keep-stuff-organized thing takes a bit of time to hone, but he&#39;s getting there. He also understands how to find root causes now, based on looking at where there&#39;s a blockage in production and tracking back along the chain.One thing that&#39;s interesting is that the game is a bit, you know, dark. I mean we&#39;ve built hell and the kid doesn&#39;t mind. Literally paved paradise with concrete. The air is black with robots, 100k of them at the moment. There&#39;s furnaces all over the place. We got rid of the steam power generation but there are huge areas of nukes all over. The natives are getting atomic bombs thrown at them constantly, it takes a while to even get to the nearest spawner. Or water that isn&#39;t green.And yet he doesn&#39;t ask about how we destroyed all the cliffs and filled in the lakes, and chopped the trees.&#34;How should we make it bigger, dad?&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with games like Factorio (and more recently Oxygen no Included), is that after I get addicted and get up past 100 hours of gameplay I start to question what the hell I&#39;m doing with my life. Up until that point it&#39;s great fun designing, building, and optimizing, but then a switch in my head flips. I start to become anxious about the fact that I was excited about getting better at skills in a virtual world. Usually around this time I start watching videos of more advanced builds, and then become increasingly depressed about the idea of sinking 1000+ hours into a game, when I could just be building something in the real world, or out riding my bike. This is usually the time I put the game down and never play it again.I think the problem for me is that these games give me the illusion of learning, building, and accomplishing things, which my little engineer brain loves. But once I come out of the haze of addiction, I realize it&#39;s nothing more than an illusion, and I just stomach going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have over 5000 hours in Factorio. I am part of a group where several of us are over 5000 hours. Some of us have Autism. Some of us have ADHD. Some of us have both. The majority of us are in the tech industry.The companies we work at have been made to understand that the factory must grow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What strikes me is not a bunch of people keeping their ego in check -- that helps because it ensures that all points will be heard, but it doesn&#39;t ensure coherent decision-making. What strikes me is that everybody was able to keep track of what were the major points and minor points, so they could talk through the whole range of possible objections and decide that they were all less valid or less important than the points in favor. This is how engineers talk, searching for flaws and weighing the ones they find.I think it&#39;s important for engineering decision-makers to be comfortable with this culture. It&#39;s disheartening when you have a great conversation like the one Feynman describes, the engineers are in agreement, and then the person in charge stands up and says, &#34;Look, if everybody hates this idea, we can&#39;t be lazy and go forward with it just because we don&#39;t have a better one,&#34; or, &#34;I guess we can&#39;t make a decision on this, because there&#39;s too much negativity and people are just going to nit-pick every idea to death!&#34; No, no, talking through every possible objection to an idea is how you can tell that people are starting to zero in on it as the most likely best solution. The closer an idea gets to acceptance, the more thoroughly you vet it. The more it becomes clear that an idea is the best way forward, the more you start to prepare for dealing with the reality of it.This makes practical sense, but not political sense, so it seems weird and unnatural to a lot of outside observers, who expect respect to be communicated by agreement, and emerging consensus around an idea to be expressed by a shared avoidance of mentioning the downsides."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience (and coming just out of a meeting alike) these types of respectful and forward-moving meetings are typically in a case where each attendant has roughly the same level expertise in a given domain and knows the basics of scientific principles. Hence, everybody in the meeting brings in his or her unique view of the topic at hand and knows intrinsically when it makes sense to contribute something to the discussion. Usually things get out of hands, if somebody is talking just for the noise or, and this is worse, a clearly bad idea wins the discussion because politics or the messenger has shouted the loudest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been in such environments and I while I hadn&#39;t considered that the reason they worked so well was that they were great people: they were, in fact, great people.An interesting thing happens when there&#39;s a high level of respect.People stop being so anxious about not &#34;winning&#34;, or &#34;being heard&#34;, people just remove themselves from their ideas and feel comfortable and confident.I left that company because the company around that team was a bit shit, but I wish I could foster an environment of high trust and mutual respect like that again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My 2 cents: The author presumably goes to Princeton - the ivy league is in general a tough place to &#34;start learning&#34; things, especially STEM. Few of the staff would teach you the basics of anything, mostly because you are attending a research college, where teaching is the professors&#39; side gig.I went to an ivy league school, and a large portion of the people in the CS program did competitive programming/knew number theory and discrete math from high school etc. All the problems we got as homework were really intense - I&#39;d consistently do more than 60-70 hours of studying outside of classes to keep up. Mind you, for me CS was/is like crack - I feel like I&#39;d have put in even more time if I didn&#39;t need to sleep or want to hang out with my friends.There are some intro classes, of course, but the quality of those varies a lot.Edit: I don&#39;t mean to discourage people with this post. I was actually one of the few people who didn&#39;t have much of a CS/quanty background in my CS classes.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if some universities should pay more attention to the impact of discouragement on some students.I remember attempting a grad class called &#34;Hard problems in combinatorial optimization&#34;. I was struggling so I asked the professor for advice on getting my footing in the class.His answer was that I may just not have the &#34;mathematical maturity&#34; for the material. I was so discouraged that I dropped out of the program.What I didn&#39;t realize at the time was the particular meaning of that term. His advice was well intended and accurate.But what I heard was that I was hopeless in this topic area because I wasn&#39;t smart enough.So much pain could have been avoided if we just extended the conversation by a few minutes, or he invited me for a discussion over coffee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the class description for MAT 202, &#34;Linear Algebra with Applications&#34;  at Princeton.[1] Here&#39;s a problem set with answers.[2]It&#39;s painful to read. Problem 2: &#34;Find the matrix A describing the following linear transformation from R2 to R&#39;2 : First rotate clockwise by π/6, then scale by a factor of 2, then reflect about the x2 axis.&#34; Anyone who programs video games recognizes that as a stack of transformations. You set up the matrix for the rotate, the scale, and the reflection (which is a scale of -1 on one axis). You multiply the matrices to get the result. This is a pain to do with pencil and paper. GPUs have hardware for it.Books on graphics programming cover this problem. But they usually do it much better, with graphical examples.
The presentation here is done very abstractly, without any motivation.
Most of linear algebra has graphical representations. It takes a useful and relatively easy area of math and makes it harder.This is apparently on purpose.  The class description says:The calculations are relatively simple once you understand what you need to compute, but it can take time to master the abstract concepts well enough to understand what that might be. The challenge in 201 (a calculus class) is usually how to finish a problem as the technical complications mount, whereas in 202 the challenge is often in seeing how to start the problem.Right. In calculus, problems usually involve trying to integrate something, where you get stuck and need to transform the problem in some non-obvious way to make forward progress. It&#39;s puzzle-solving. In linear algebra, the actual operations are mostly matrix adds and multiplies. It&#39;s setting up the problem that&#39;s hard.It&#39;s annoying to see this for a useful area of applied math. If you&#39;re headed for abstract algebra, where intuition breaks down, this approach might be useful. But if you want to use ordinary linear systems to get work done, which is common in engineering, it&#39;s not.[1] https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/placement/MAT20...[2] https://www.math.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/2018-04/M..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Android users are still vulnerable, and these announcements do nothing to reduce that. All a stalker needs to do, is remove the speaker. To detect a rogue AirTag, an Android owner needs to:1) know AirTags exist (many obviously don&#39;t)2) go out of their way to install Apple&#39;s Android AirTag scanner app (only 100k-500k worldwide have done so according to Google Play stats)3) manually open the scanner app and scan, since it doesn&#39;t scan passively in the background; and even then, it won&#39;t help you find the speaker-less AirTag, since it doesn&#39;t tell you proximity &amp; direction.I continue to think Apple should have never released AirTags to the public, and should discontinue it. It&#39;s a very limited income stream, with limited use cases, and significantly increases the average person&#39;s risk of stalking.Practically all positive social media coverage of AirTags involves someone tracking a stolen stolen items (car, bike). Those use cases are dead, since thieves with iPhones will get alerts, and most thieves with Android will know to scan for AirTags. And since most lost items turn into stolen items after a few hours, that removes most use cases involving losing objects in public.That leaves &#34;finding your keys within your home&#34; as the only truly &#34;officially supported&#34; use case. Is that worth all the problems, and brand damage?People will argue that stalkers could always buy trackers, but Apple increased their availability, ease-of-acquisition and ease-of-use by orders of magnitude. AirTags are cheaper than competing GPS trackers, most of which require subscriptions.I remember seeing a chills-down-your-spine Apple Watch Series 7 TV ad, that featured beautiful remote nature landscapes, with the audio of 911 calls made from people&#39;s Apple Watches whose lives were saved by their Watch. Probably one of Apple&#39;s best and most impactful ad in the past decade. Compare that to AirTag&#39;s impact on Apple&#39;s brand. Why did Apple even bother?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great response - very happy to hear Apple&#39;s involvement with various groups to make things better.Some noteworthy bits:&gt; we innovated with the first-ever proactive system to alert you of unwanted trackingIf that&#39;s true, then Apple just raised the privacy bar and now Tile and other small players need to up their game to stay relevant.There is also lesson to learn here: whoever makes a tech/product popular is the one who gets the heat for all its shortcomings/problems. It doesn&#39;t matter how many existing small players were doing a horrible job for years.&gt; As an iPhone user moves, Precision Finding fuses input from the camera, ARKit, accelerometer, and gyroscope to guide them to the AirTagThis is something that&#39;s not appreciated. The UWB chip on the Airtag can only help iPhone know how far away it is from the tag. It&#39;s 3D modelling of the world through camera vision that helps triangulate and guide the user via live on-screen direction.Next time you think why we need tech X, just remember that you can&#39;t foresee what it&#39;ll enable in the future - (and before you comment &#34;all AR stuff to find my keys faster?&#34;, re-read the previous sentence again)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the functionality of the AirTags so I don&#39;t want them nerfed, but I can think of no way to fix their fundamental problem of being such easy to use stalking devices.Chefs knives are great for cooking and are inexpensive and easy to purchase; they can be very dangerous weapons in the wrong hands so we make it against the law to use them in that manner. Maybe that&#39;s the best we can do with AirTags."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If Apple considers level 1 and 5 to both be associates and doesn’t share more than that that’s… fine?WaPo says this can be a 6 figure difference in compensation but frankly why should a future employer get to know how much I make? Maybe I’m a level 3 but deserved to be a level 4. Maybe I’m a level 5 but actually a level 2 that’s just really good at office politics.If I want my employer to know what number Apple assigned me, I’ll tell them.EDIT: Telling companies a Level 5 engineer was an associate if associate isn&#39;t a superset of Level 5&#39;s is shady, and I can&#39;t defend Apple on that point. From what I read of the article that wasn&#39;t clear to me. They do say the title is generally linked to more junior roles but that&#39;s relative and you can still be old, experienced and well-paid but if you&#39;re not a manager I might consider that an associate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that&#39;s not mentioned here is this refusal to even confirm what you worked on also affects people&#39;s immigration status.To approve I-140, USCIS requires a signed letter from employers confirming your title, experience and skill sets.Most companies really don&#39;t like to give these details out for some reason, and it&#39;s always a struggle, especially outside tech. People manage by contacting their managers to past coworkers to attest this.This is intended as a general observation and not about AAPL (I can&#39;t attest to what happens there).Naturally, you can see how this puts pressure on visa employees to leave on good terms and be compliant knowing you might not be able to extend your visa otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of the practice of Translations.com / Transperfect, one of the largest language services providers. Their HR policy is to not allow employees to name the company in any online space, social media or otherwise. So when you see staff on LinkedIn, for instance, their employer will invariable say &#34;Leading language service provider&#34; or similar. These seem to be completely unreasonable policies, to me, that in effect are demanding that basic facts are ownable by the company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think we (in the EU) will soon realise the bizarre consequences of these regulations. European startups will not be able to use standard SaaS or PaaS tools (like AWS, Azure, Mailchimp, PayPal etc) if they are based in the US (like most of them are). No cloud services, no Office 365 or Google Workspace.It will take forever to build up a similar ecosystem in Europe and I think most successful European entrepreneurs will just end up starting companies in the US instead.There must be some reasonable middle ground before we fragment and destroy the entire Internet. Why not start by making a general exception for temporary storage of less sensitive data like IP-addresses for  efficiently and cost effectively delivering a web service.If there is one thing they could start looking in to it would be handling of personal information by governmental organisations. I work a little bit with a few municipalities, and the number of documents with deeply personal information that are just emailed around over unencrypted email is shocking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this seems to be coming due to US regulations that compel US registered companies to hand over data from subsidiaries in Europe markets if asked by US intelligence and law enforcement agencies.With these various data locality regulations, i wonder if a standard operating approach could be to split tech companies into 3 legal entities, a technology licensing company, a US registered operations company and a Europe registered operations company and hand the shares in all three companies to the current shareholders. This would insulate the Europe entity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ll add to the positivity: this is the first time I’ve ever found a “we can do better than SQL” compelling. It’s easy to understand what it’s doing with a variety of known quantities. It solves a difficult problem elegantly. It has 100% overlap with the goals I want it to have. It’s designed to be usable with minimal fuss. It does really a good job of portraying itself as magic (it will be awesome to use) without portraying itself as magic (it explains itself in terms of already knowable tools and how it leverages their strength).I do have a couple minor quibbles:- Serializable transactions are expensive, and that deserves to be an explicit caveat. Not everyone knows this, and it’s an important thing to put up front.- Some of the language in this post are in CAP theorem territory but neglect to directly address that. I’d like to see how client usage compares with direct Postgres usage (idiomatic for each insofar as such a beast exists) in a Call Me Maybe. I know that’s a lot to ask in a 1.0 announcement four years in the making, but I hope it’s a priority to get this in front of Aphyr.Edit: oh and I definitely look forward to this being further distinguished from an ORM, because even though I can see the blue and black dress my mind keeps switching it back to gold and white."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so happy for you guys, I&#39;m wishing you great success.
Since the first first version of uvloop I&#39;ve been excited about MagicStack and I couldn&#39;t be more excited about EdgeDB since it has the same magical minds behind.Here&#39;s what I think makes EdgeDB special: it&#39;s a DB that replaces the tediousness of ORMs with a better core that can be cross-language / cross-platform.
I&#39;ve implemented tons of APIs, first REST, then GraphQL all of them on top of ORMs (Django, Peewee, SQLAlchemy, Mongoose and more). When prototyping was great, but scaling them became quite challenging, specially if you want to have a performant outcome when retrieving data.EdgeQL is an incredible useful abstraction that will prove itself in a few years.
Long life EdgeQL. Keep up the good work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These guys are from magic stack, they wrote the definitive async python postgres library, asyncpg. Very high quality library.Been keeping a close eye on Edge, had even considered it as a primary database, and probably will in the future!!As much as I adore the ergonomics improvements I really am more interested in the performance, replication, scalability story, with the likes of cockroach db reaching maturity in 2022.But as a postgres replacement in general, I would highly consider using edge."</p>

Environmentalists are blocking  construction of more wind power, and crisis with Russia makes gas less accessible. France has a relatively good track record on nuclear power. They may pull this off. 2035 is a really long time to wait for new power to the grid though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As the underlying Twitter thread points out[1], there&#39;s a significant confounding factor here: the sample is from 2019 but might have been processed in 2020, at which point the Chinese government&#39;s (public) timeline for COVID&#39;s spread admits of the possibility of contamination.I don&#39;t think that completely deflates the evidence here. But as a layperson, I would like to understand the probability of happening to find COVID in an Antarctic soil sample in 2019 versus the probability that someone accidentally contaminated the sample with early samples in early 2020. Put another way: my (lay) intuition doesn&#39;t understand why there would be COVID in Antarctic soil, whereas it does understand how contamination might happen in a lab that was actively processing samples of COVID.[1]: https://twitter.com/jbloom_lab/status/1491297806115807233"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If it was sequenced in early 2020, it may have been contaminated from experiments carried out by researchers trying to learn more about the emerging virus.That seems like--by far--the most probable explanation.I&#39;m not even sure if it would need to have been researchers studying Covid--it could just   have been that the technician handling the samples was infected and contaminated the samples accidentally, or that the equipment had previously been used with samples unknowingly contaminated with Covid.In fact, that could have been the case even if it was sequenced in December 2019, since Covid was already spreading in the population at that time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s incredibly frustrating about the knocks on JavaScript is that it&#39;s not a shortcoming of the language that creates the problems hinted here, but the poorly-considered engineering choices of the popular frameworks.After building my own framework [1] last year, I realized just how disconnected JavaScript developers—yes, the &#34;big boys&#34; are especially off in CS la-la land—were from web development fundamentals. HTTP distilled down to its absolute essence is brilliant, but for some reason gets absolutely ignored in the JS world. When you couple that with websockets for incremental updates (similar to what Chris McCord is doing in Phoenix), it&#39;s insanely powerful. It can be reasonably lightweight, too, if you&#39;re only shipping the JS you need to render the page.That rendering some HTML, CSS, and interactive JS in a browser has been turned into what it has is staggering. Though, not surprising, when you realize a lot of the momentum in JavaScript the last decade or so was perpetuated by venture capital (and the inevitable fast and cheap nature of that world) being pumped into inexperienced teams.[1] https://github.com/cheatcode/joystick"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised this wasn&#39;t about WASM.Either way, I&#39;m receptive to the &#34;LiveView&#34; model, but until such a time a server can deliver both HTML and server driven native UI for mobile interchangeably, I prefer the RPC approach.I don&#39;t want to develop:1. Both an API for mobile and LiveView for web.OR2. Create my own server driven UI paradigm for mobile.I find maintaining one architectural pattern simpler. I do want to support users with the best technology fit, but I don&#39;t see why I have to make this tradeoff. The platform holders are (and always have been) jerking us around.I want to see a LiveView that can deliver both HTML and equivalent native UI markup. This is needed to sell the vision end to end - the world is not just web.I feel like this would enable a more sensible choice:Offline (first)? Use RPC with sync.Online-only? Use the LiveView paradigm and it&#39;ll work with native or web."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funnily enough, PHP (like, old school PHP) is a surprisingly neat fit for this style of programming when combined with htmx[0]Tiny amount of glue HTML attributes, a heap of partials that are your PHP files and you’re good to go.What is old is new again I suppose: we used to do this with PHP and jQuery once upon a time too — though LiveView and similar are far nicer of course.I’ve been working on some personal tools with nothing more than Deno and htmx. Works quite well for my needs![0] https://htmx.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;The text content in the third box is longer than the available space, so rather than maintaining the aspect ratio, the element expands vertically to fit the content... If we set an explicit height instead, the element doesn’t expand, but instead we get overflow&#34;Why? Why would you have different default behaviours if you have one of the dimensions set but not the other? Why would you not have this specified in another property, the overflow property perhaps? Oh look, lets define a new property and call it aspect ratio, and then lets ensure it doesn&#39;t maintain an element&#39;s aspect ratio if you have content that is going to overflow if you specify a width. This is what drives me mad about css, it&#39;s gotchas all the way down."</p>

I mean look how well Microsoft Word (native) works compared to Microsoft Teams (some JS hodgepodge). And not just the day by day use, but also stuff like AppleScript support. Especially highlighted by the stand still we used to have on mobile computer CPU&#39;s until recently. Everything just got slower and slower."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get the same feeling as everyone. There is no point in the game because even a single digit wrong is no clue at all. In my 1st and only attempt, I entered 1 + 2+ 8 = 11 and both pluses, the 2 the 1 and the 8 were right, with only the 2 in the wrong position. And yet that gave zero clue to what the other number was... and it turned out to be another 8, which made finding the solution really luck-based."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If the page size is too small, rows won’t fit inside the page and if it’s too large there is risk of write failure because hardware generally can only guarantee atomicity for a fixed size blocks which can vary disk to disk (usually ranges from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes).Pretty sure the 8KB page size is not about atomicity. It&#39;s true old storage mostly promised 512B atomicity (AFAIK it depends on operation, but that&#39;s irrelevant here) and we rely on that in some places. But even if it was 4KB, it&#39;s still be just half of 8kB pages. So an 8KB page might still get torn, and we can&#39;t rely on that.The simple truth is that this is a compromise - smaller pages benefit OLTP, larger pages benefit OLAP. And 8kB is somewhere in the middle. That&#39;s all.You can get better performance from e.g. 4KB pages, especially if that aligns with filesystem / SSD pages, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In extension to this news and the press conference, one thing I am super excited about, is the private SPARC project and the MIT-spinoff Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS). If you don&#39;t know about it already, I would highly recommend checking it out (e.g. by searching YouTube for &#34;MIT Sparc Fusion Reactor&#34; for some fairly accessible videos on the theory behind why they should achieve fusion way faster than the current roadmap with ITER and DEMO).In the press conference just ended, they repeated how exactly the JET reactor worked as predicted by theory. In my layman&#39;s understanding, for the exact same reason (seemingly very sound theoretical groundwork), the SPARC reactor should exceed breakeven within the next few years.From Wiki on CFS:* Back in September 2021, they built the strongest high-room-temperature superconducting magnet (20 Tesla) suitable for a fusion reactor* Theory dictates that with stronger magnets, the reactor can be scaled down (with the square/cube, can&#39;t remember exactly), and thus cost and time to develop* Back in November 2021, they raised $1.8 billion from the likes of Bill Gateshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fusion_SystemsBoy, do I think it would be crazy cool if they succeed, even taking twice as long as they&#39;ve planned! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a strong proponent of Fusion energy and did some work on the subject in undergrad.This is not a major breakthrough, it&#39;s a benchmark.A major breakthrough would be materials that could withstand the neutron bombardment longer, the ultimate limiting factor for fusion energy plants after we achieve positive net energy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This kind of thing is why software I don&#39;t fully trust only runs in my browser.With how good the browser APIs have become, there is little reason to run native apps, which nowadays are often just an outdated browser with a packaged web app anyways (Electron). Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and even Zoom have demonstrated that web is good enough if they want it.If you try to force me to install a native app, that&#39;s a strong signal that the app is going to do something against my interest. Given how aggressively Zoom has pushed the app, it was very clear to me that this thing is never going to hit my main machine (I think I have a VM somewhere that I used for a job interview that needed the more advanced features)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope I’m pointing out the obvious, but the answer to this question doesn’t matter. The real problem is that we’re compelled to run a bunch of software from organizations we, to put it charitably, have no reason to trust.This situation may exist because it’s inevitable but it still sucks."</p>

    The statement goes on to say that “dealers are currently experiencing parts delays due to shipping constraints” and that MNAO plans to “support impacted customers with replacement parts. These customers should contact their local Mazda dealer who can submit a goodwill request to the Mazda Warranty department on their behalf, order the parts, and schedule a free repair when the parts arrive.”

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"US-based cis-hetero white man here. The data reinforce the impression you get glancing at the headlines or spending a day out anywhere in America observing other men. Dare I say it even reinforces what I know from painful firsthand experience as a man, at the lowest points in my life. I was lucky though, with a supportive family who helped me through the confusing years of early adulthood.You can point to the decline of organized religion and with it traditional gender roles, but then what explains the relative stability in post-Christian Europe? The China Shock combined with America&#39;s threadbare social safety net starts looking more salient. We have inherited a much less trusting, much more alienated society than you are likely to find overseas.Whatever the cause I fully reject the lazy conclusion this is somehow women&#39;s fault. The &#34;Lump of Labor&#34;  fallacy is just that, a fallacy. Economic gains are not zero-sum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My observation is that we are going to have a radical rebalancing of who reproduces and who doesn’t.Lot of men and women who are generally not too motivated to seek out a companion, lose weight, put in the work to make it happen just…won’t pass on genetics.Children are a lot of work and energy.I’m highly introverted and high earning. My wife was the aggressor in my case. She pretty much made it all happen.I think the ball is firmly in the woman’s court now. Women have most of the advantages (education, societal promotion, fit in better with our institutions) yet i see so many women who are generally apathetic about getting into a relationship at all.There is also a massive obesity problem. If people have trouble getting attracted to each other versus the alternatives, makes it really challenging to find the motivation.I wonder what all these effects will have over the next 200 years? If you play out the changing “relationship market conditions,” it seems like men and women with different personalities and dispositions towards seeking out relationships in order to reproduce will have a significant effect on the species.Will people who were genetically predisposed towards being thin, hard working, open minded to approaching members of opposite sex and forming deep attachments resulting in children become more frequent?On a genetic and evolutionary perspective I’m super interested - we know that IQ has been rising, but what else will change?In some societies such as Korea I am told, women are sometimes or more frequently the aggressor. I wonder if this becomes more common."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a big part of the despair is the obvious difference between what children are taught is the american dream vs what the american reality is.We are told america is the best place on earth with all the doors open to you to be rich. That all other forms of government are flawed and we have excellence here everywhere you look.And then you look at reality and see something else. Sure there are pockets of excellence and the dream still lives in fits and starts, but for the general person, they are likely shut out from any real hope of this grand vision.You add in COVID and the lockdowns, and economic turmoil, and then people start realizing that the whole race is kind of pointless. I can be poor busting my butt at a crappy job i hate, or i can be poor moving in with family and being &#39;unproductive&#39; (for some definition of societal unproductivity).Women, on the other hand, haven&#39;t been given the same advertising on the American dream that men have, which obviously is a terrible thing, but in this one sense probably helped them survive and prosper even when life sucks in a modern world.I&#39;m supposing the sell-job of an equivalence of the &#39;american&#39; dream in other countries is not nearly so commercial, and blaring. And so kids are likely not so shocked at the difference between expectations and reality. Throw in that many other countries are flat out better in many social structural ways, and i think that explains why, it&#39;s especially troubling in America."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an article in Nature on this which in my opinion is even better than the submission: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00367-1Here is the actual paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01663-5 (paywall)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a partner of a person with a complete spinal cord injury, I appreciate these articles and the science being done by these researchers, it is truly a big and complex and worthwhile problem to solve.For most of us, I do want to suggest being careful when and how you mention research and articles like this to people in wheelchairs. Just be aware there are lots of different reasons why someone might be in a wheelchair and what can and can&#39;t be done for a given illness. It can be really taxing to get suggestions or shares of articles like this from well-meaning friends and family that don&#39;t actually understand the realities of living with an injury or medical issue that puts someone in a wheelchair.Obviously people should know work is being done. And obviously people might be excited to hear about breakthrough research. If you&#39;re inspired by articles like this, consider donating to the institutions funding the research. But, be aware that articles like this come out every year and for the vast majority of spinal cord injury patients it won&#39;t be available to them soon or ever.If you really want to support those in the accessibility needs community, support local building code changes and adaptive sports and outdoors programs. Making buildings, sports, and wilderness accessible will impact more people positively in the near term. The science is cool and amazing, but 100k people are limited by a few stairs to enjoy life and experiences with family."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case you didn&#39;t know:American Institute of Mathematics is a research non-profit ran by one of the Fry brothers (of Fry Electronics).At least until recently, it&#39;s been run out of the back of the office space of their headquarters location on Brokaw road in San Jose.Now that the store (and the company) is defunct, I&#39;m happy to see that AIM is still kicking.Can&#39;t vouch for everything that they do, but they have been running pretty solid geometric group theory workshops on the reg. I got to attend one, and have good memories of it.I&#39;m still sad that the store has shut down. They cite COVID as a reason, but they&#39;ve been in liquidation mode long before that (at some point, I couldn&#39;t even get a USB flash drive there!). I hope that AIM will go on as a legacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s never studied real math (only Physics math), I found the book &#34;Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications&#34; extremely interesting, in part because it leads you to understand asymmetric cryptography and error-correcting codes. Also the SAGE exercises are neat.http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/aata-toc.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just a lowly adjunct, but I sense that one barrier to open textbook adoption is the accreditation process. I don&#39;t know exactly the connection, but I get the feeling that the department can check some box if they say that all their lower division calculus courses are taught with Pearson&#39;s book, for instance. Sort of a &#34;no one ever got fired for choosing IBM&#34; type situation.Anyone have any insight to this? I only have a sample size of two... which leads me to believe not all departments worry about this so much.Edit: see these MAA guidelines: https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-de...One suggestion is &#34;there should be established procedures for periodic review of the curriculum... should include careful scrutiny of course syllabi, prerequisites, and textbooks.&#34;As much as I hate to say it, there are legitimate reasons for carefully controlling the curricula in lower division courses. A big one is: transfer credit. People get pissed when it&#39;s difficult to transfer their cheaper CC credits to a larger university.The easiest way to solve these problems is by dictating curricula. But, unfortunately, the Pearson&#39;s of the world feast on the resulting homogenized market.This is similar to my problem with Common Core. Everything in Common Core is perfectly reasonable. But now we have one giant textbook market where Pearson dominates with their products which now bear a &#34;Common Core approved&#34; label on the cover."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;If you’re curious why unionization has taken the journalism world by storm the last few years, you don’t have to look to politics or in-group signaling for an explanation, basic economics will get you all the way there.... You reduce quantity of labor supplied and end up with higher equilibrium wages for those who manage to get their foot in the door. Of course, this will only heighten the favoring of those who can get their foot in the $3200/mo Brooklyn rent door while dressing fashionably and using “semiotics” correctly in a sentence, but that’s neither here nor there.&#34;This is a cute theory, and tickles some people&#39;s ideological fancy. But if the author had done more research, they would know where the CWA-NewsGuild is actually doing most of its new organizing (hint: not New York), what sorts of contract articles they bargain around hiring, and what the status quo in non-union newsrooms is.In brief, the Guild has been organizing tons of local newspapers in small cities and rural areas, particularly those bought up by private equity firms who want to cut the newsroom to the bone. They bargain contract articles that curb the nepotistic in-group hiring practices common at non-union papers.Source: I&#39;m a former NewsGuild member, but at a software company, not a newspaper.Take a gander at the NewsGuild president&#39;s twitter account and you&#39;ll see many examples of these campaigns: https://twitter.com/gaufre"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not just journalists, but politicians, priests, etc. The filtered bubble of their society becomes the pole star of their existence, and the rest of the world gets devalued.Used to be, near any event that generates news coverage, there would be a bar where the journalists hung out. Listening to the conversations there would tell you what the story was going to be, as well as how it differed from the facts. The audience that mattered was the rest of the media clique; the actual paying &#34;audience&#34; was the chum that everyone took for granted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is the source for the claim that so many American journalists under 40 live in the area  encircled in the map in the tweet? The source for wages in journalism having gone to hell? The source for unions restricting the supply of labor? If so, why hasn&#39;t all the journalist unions he see forming already restricted the number of journalists and increased their wages?I also think the author&#39;s characterization job status is wrong. Journalists mostly hang out with journalists so whether journalist is a high-status job or not is irrelevant since they are all journalists. Working for Google has high status in some circles but probably not among Google&#39;s own employees. Furthermore, only a tiny fraction of all journalists write for the Washington Post or other recognizable papers. Not a lot of status in writing for marketing agencies or obscure trade press magazines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the day (nearly 30 years ago) people would run a user-mode stack to obtain Internet connectivity via a (dial-up) Unix shell account.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usermode WireGuard would be a big deal. I maintain a list[0] of tunneling solutions, and one of the only limitations of systems built on WireGuard is the requirement for admin privileges. Even with the performance hit from running outside the kernel, UDP-based tunnels have a lot of advantages for multiplexing channels. Pretty much your only mainstream options today are QUIC and WireGuard, and only QUIC is intended to run in userspace.I&#39;d have to dig into the details more, but something like this might allow you to implement a simple tunneling system based on WireGuard that runs in the kernel if you have the privileges, otherwise falls back to usermode and is no worse than QUIC in terms of performance. That would be awesome.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the lede is buried here... If I&#39;m reading correctly I can use flyctl to set up an SSH encrypted tunnel over user-space TCP/IP over wireguard encrypted IP packets over UDP over WebSockets over HTTP over TLS encrypted TCP/IP? And not even just for fun, but to solve real problems in production. I can see why you might have mixed feelings about that!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This story reminded me of a story written by a Czech biologist who studied animals in Papua-New Guinea and went to a hunt with a group of local tribesmen.The dusk was approaching, they were still in the forest and he proposed that they could sleep under a tree. The hunters were adamant in their refusal: no, this is dangerous, a tree might fall on you in your sleep and kill you. He relented, but silently considered them irrational, given that his assessment of a chance of a tree falling on you overnight was less then 1:5000.Only later did he realize that for a lifelong hunter, 1:5000 are pretty bad odds that translate to a very significant probability of getting killed over a 30-40 year long hunting career."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read them as sloppy caricatures that provide little value to the conversation.Let&#39;s take the security guard: &#34;The only problem is: he now provides literally no value. He’s excluded by fiat the possibility of ever being useful in any way. He could be losslessly replaced by a rock with the words “THERE ARE NO ROBBERS” on it.&#34;That is blatantly not true, the guard provide value since the wanna-be robbers don&#39;t know whether the guard will be of any value, and a rock could not provide any deterrent. Losslessly?The doctor (if there is someone skeptical of doctors it is me, if I were less lazy I would have greatly enjoyed fighting to make some useless US dermatologists lose their license): &#34;Her heuristic is right 99.9% of the time, but she provides literally no value. There is no point to her existence. She could be profitably replaced with a rock saying “IT’S NOTHING, TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND WAIT FOR IT TO GO AWAY”.This is an unhelpful caricature, too, because if we add &#34;and call back if it does not&#34;, it looks like a very reasonable approach.Un-nuanced and quite sloppy presentation of heuristics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The doctor rings true. I had 3 separate doctors on 3 separate occasions diagnose my 21 month old son with an ear infection, instead of the plum-sized malignant brain tumour that it was.From their point of view, pediatric brain tumours are very rare and ear infections are common.Their 99% heuristic almost killed him.That was 2010. He survived and is now a vibrant 13 year old, but only because of one curious intern/fellow at the children&#39;s hospital ER that decided to order a CT to rule out the remote possibility. Her diligence got him admitted and into surgery within a day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It sort of make sense for Nvidia&#39;s shareholders. The initial offering for ARM was only worth $38.5bn, which was already expensive due to SoftBank initial purchase price and not wanting for a loss. But at Nvidia&#39;s peak this deal was worth &#34;$87bn&#34;. For a company that makes less than $2B in revenue and at best ~$300M in Operating Income. Remember this isn&#39;t something you can buy and milk the crap out of other market players. &#34;Not a very British way of doing business&#34; is A Direct Quote from ARM. ( Edit: Because of perceptual licensing agreement, for those unaware of how ARM business model works )It didn&#39;t make sense how ARM was worth $22bn in 2016 on LSE, that has a PE100+ when I cant see how it could double its Net profit in the next 10 years, with a saner valuation of P/E 50. It make even less sense to me when Softbank bought it for $32bn. Didn&#39;t make any sense when Nvidia want it for $38.5bn, and later at $50bn+.Now we are back to square one, how many investors, in the open market are willing to buy ARM&#39;s stock at a valuation of, let say the same $32bn as Softbank initially paid? Roughly P/E 100, assuming they managed to grow ARM business from 2018 at ~$220M operating income to $300M in 2021. I much rather bet on Intel if I had the money.And of course many on HN will think ARM is worthless because the future is going to be the Riscy Silver Bullet.Disclosures: I do not currently hold any stocks or Mutual Funds, Indexes and other financial instrument."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Soooo back on the LSE or?It was such a hot stock in 2014-15. Softbank kinda bought it at the peak. Still, Apple has proven ARM on the desktop is phenomenal, and Ampere has done the same in the datacenter. Both have swiftly made compiler support accelerate dramatically. I would love for my next desktop to be arm-based, and it would be great if it didn’t NEED to be a mac. Broad adoption of ARM would be a huge win for sustainability. I’m bullish on their business, even if their business model isn’t vertically scalable.I think that RISC V also has a bright future, but its still a bit far out before its a viable competitor. Still there have been some things that look really promising such as what is coming out of SiFive:https://www.sifive.com/press/sifive-raises-risc-v-performanc...And Intel just announced a $1B fund for companies building on their Open Foundry RISC-V alliance. https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-1b-fund-risc-vBig things are happening for small instruction sets… watch this space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. Never a good outcome for the industry for Arm to be owned by Nvidia - and regulators have learned by now that undertakings in these circumstances have little value.Sorry for Simon Segars who must have had a tough job essentially implementing Son&#39;s ideas. And those ideas seem to have been pretty poor - Arm China debacle, focus on IoT and selling to Nvidia have all clearly harmed Arm&#39;s prospects.It&#39;s clear by now that selling CPUs is a mature market but that Arm has room to grow and there is still lots of money to be made in hardware if you innovate - eg in accelerated computing. It&#39;s also true both that Arm&#39;s model works and that it has more competition than ever from RISC-V.A lot still to play for in my view and I think that the IPO price will reflect that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It must be noted that the satellites were not directly damaged by the geomagnetic storm. The storm warmed the atmosphere which caused it to expand, leading to additional drag that prohibited the satellites from leaving their low &#34;safe mode&#34; orbit.Shortened excerpt:
&#34;These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase.... speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50 percent.... The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe-mode where they would fly edge-on (like a sheet of paper) to minimize drag...Preliminary analysis show the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented the satellites from leaving safe-mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers, and up to 40 of the satellites will reenter or already have reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. The deorbiting satellites pose zero collision risk with other satellites and by design demise upon atmospheric reentry—meaning no orbital debris is created and no satellite parts hit the ground.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SpaceX deploys its satellites into these lower obitsUnintentional pun on &#34;orbits&#34;, perhaps?It&#39;s incredible to me that launching satellites is so easy now that a failure of 40 satellites can be tolerated. On the bright side, I guess this gave SpaceX a chance to talk about their debris-limiting strategy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"40 sats makes up about 2% of the current fleet - so a rounding error in cost and time.The important part of this news is how those 40 sats deorbit and leave no junk either in orbit or on earth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having done computer architecture and bit twiddling x86 in the ye olden days, I immediately, independently converged on the patented solution (code / circuit / Verilog, more or less the same thing). It goes to show how broken the USPTO is because it&#39;s obvious to anyone in the field. Patents are supposed to be nonobvious. (35 USC 103)https://patentdefenses.klarquist.com/obviousness-sec-103/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;SWAR&#34; approach `(a &amp; b) + (a ^ b) / 2` looks bizarre but can be understood.Adding two bits produces a sum and a carry:    0 + 0 = 0, carry 0
    1 + 0 = 1, carry 0
    0 + 1 = 1, carry 0
    1 + 1 = 0, carry 1

So the sum is XOR, and the carry is bitwise AND. We can rewrite x + y as (x ^ y) + (x &amp; y)*2Distribute the divide, and you get (x ^ y)/2 + (x &amp; y) which is the mystery expression.(Note this distribution is safe only because (x &amp; y)*2 is even.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the official response from SE:https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/376060/update-on-th...For the past month Stack Overflow has been hit by weekly DDoS attacks that progressively grew in size and scope. In each incident, the attacker(s) have been changing their methodology and responding to our countermeasures. Initially we were able to detect and mitigate the attacks before any performance degradation could be noticed but the latest attacks ramped up very quickly and the site was brought down before we could react.While we cannot go into specifics on each attack in order to maintain opsec and not tip off the attackers, we can say that each individual attack has been using different IP addresses and targeted different aspects of the site. During an outage, our top priority is always getting the site back up and running. After traffic has been stabilized, we perform a post mortem for the incident where we assess and improve upon the actions we have taken.During the outage last Sunday, we noticed that a large amount of the DDoS traffic originated from Tor exit nodes. The decision to block Tor exit nodes did not come lightly, in fact Teresa, our CTO was on the call when we discussed remediation methods. Due to the persistent nature of the attack and our desire to bring the site back up as fast as possible we made the decision to block all DDoS traffic endpoints, including these Tor exit nodes.We did not target, nor set out to block all traffic from Tor, that’s not something Stack has ever done. However, due to the shared nature of Tor exit nodes, some of them were also routing DDoS attacks to our sites and were blocked. We have tried removing these blocks between attacks but this action has resulted in further site outages as DDoS efforts continue to originate from these exit nodes. Unfortunately blocking the Tor exit nodes also blocks legitimate users from using them. An immediate solution for users who find themselves blocked is to access our site from other IP addresses, via home internet, work internet, or other VPN services.We are continuing to evaluate the situation and will keep our community updated. Thank you for your patience and understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was no intentional blocking of Tor there in the past as far as I understand. But there are some mechanisms that block users from IP addresses that posted spam or abusive content. Those are automated and based on flags and not directed towards Tor specifically, but of course TOR addresses are more likely to have been misused that way so your chances of encountering these blocks is dramatically higher when using Tor. But these blocks only apply to low reputation users, I think once you&#39;re above 100 they don&#39;t matter anymore. And they also don&#39;t block reading the sites.There have been DDoS attacks recently on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, I think it&#39;s quite plausible those have something to do with this. They still seem to be under active attack intermittently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe Stackoverflow finally started to aggressively block everything that might &#34;crawl&#34; their data. I&#39;m super tired of all the paraphrased/translated copies in Google results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The interesting thing this brings up is whether programming hiring is too specific. Why do we hire reactjs programmers with e-commerce experience instead of react programmers, e-commerce programmers, or programmers?To me this guy sounds like he could do anything, just see if he&#39;s easy to work with and see if he likes your domain. He&#39;s certainly said enough about programming over the years that he shouldn&#39;t need a leetcode grilling.Anyway my point was it can get quite narrow what we look for in a coder when in fact some broad experience might be just what is necessary. For instance I&#39;ve coded apps for iPhone and Android despite being ostensibly a back end financial trader. I&#39;d think a lot of coders wouldn&#39;t want to be siloed into the first thing they get a job in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was once in the position of Mark Dominus. I had spent years of using Haskell for recreational programming and wrote a book using the subset of Haskell that I personally use (you can get a free copy at https://leanpub.com/u/markwatson by setting the price to free).About six years ago I decided to apply for Haskell jobs at Standard Charter and Facebook on Haskell teams with well known people in the field. Both groups said that I was an interesting candidate and suggested getting another Haskell job for a while, and then reapplying. I did end up consulting remotely for a startup in India writing Haskell but that job was short (about 6 weeks) because I was in the process of getting hired at Capital One to manage a deep learning team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So basically, we are a hosting association that wanted to put their servers at home _and_ sleep at night.
This demanded inter-home redundancy of our data. But none of the existing solutions (MinIO, Ceph...) are designed for high inter-node latency.
Hence Garage! Your cheap and proficient object store: designed to run on a toaster, through carrier-pigeon-grade networks, while still supporting a tons of workloads (static websites, backups, Nextcloud... you name it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Y&#39;all might want to get to the point a bit quicker in your pitch. A lot of fluff to wade through before the lede..&#34;Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.Garage implements the Amazon S3 protocol, a de-facto standard that makes it compatible with a large variety of existing software. For instance it can be used as a storage back-end for many self-hosted web applications such as NextCloud, Matrix, Mastodon, Peertube, and many others, replacing the local file system of a server by a distributed storage layer. Garage can also be used to synchronize your files or store your backups with utilities such as Rclone or Restic. Last but not least, Garage can be used to host static websites, such as the one you are currently reading, which is served directly by the Garage cluster we host at Deuxfleurs.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh this is great. When we taught SHA-256 last semester, we linked to this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/f9EbD6iY9zI. Next time we do it, we&#39;ll probably link to both. Having several different ways to visualize the same thing is very helpful, and I like that this one moves quickly.A couple of details missing from this visualization are how you pad a message to be a multiple of the block size, and how you chain blocks together to form a longer message. In the pseudocode at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Pseudocode, that&#39;s the &#34;Pre-processing (Padding)&#34; part and the &#34;for each chunk&#34; loop just below it. I get why you&#39;d want to leave those things out, since they&#39;re not really the interesting part, and the screen is already pretty packed as it is.If anyone&#39;s feeling curious about implementing this yourself, take a look at these project notes: https://github.com/oconnor663/applied_crypto_2021_fall/tree/.... At some point I&#39;ll clean that up for public consumption, but for now just ignore the parts about grades and cheating :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, how do people come up with these things? I assume every aspect of the design is carefully considered to defend it against various attacks.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s really cool. I made a terrible one for SHA1 years ago, yours is 1000x better.https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/sha1/visualize.htmlI read a paper at the time where someone described a tool they made to find a near-collision, they explained they were just flipping bits and visually observing the affects.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Indeed. Valve established DRM to a degree many previously hoped it would get rejected. But they offered a decent service and proved that piracy is a service problem. What they did for Linux as a gaming platform is spectacular. Not many people use it yet, but Windows does look less and less like a dependable long term solution, especially with Microsofts other ambitions in that industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add on this: Valve works with upstream developers on upstream code, so their work benefits the whole FOSS ecosystem. They are funding a lot of kernel, Mesa, Wayland, Wine and KDE developers.(Disclaimer: I&#39;m a Valve contractor.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I am in a &#34;late-game&#34; stage of gaming. I have sort of an overview of what is going on, but a major percentage of games simply look not interesting (anymore) to me.The collection of games I end up playing is somewhere between special and weird, I&#39;d say.And, to get back to the topic, for people in a comparable situation like me, Linux is a great alternative. So if hear or read other people comparing pros and cons of Win vs. Linux (or Apple vs. Linux), and gaming was the major drawback, think carefully if that applies to you as well.Having a pile of shame on Linux is as easy to do as on Windows, just it&#39;s smaller (which is good, right?). But having one at all means that you don&#39;t have a lack of games, but quite the opposite.Of course, when you deeply into AAA and big franchises, and need to play a game when it&#39;s published and everyone talks about it - then probably not."</p>

But what if a lot of &#34;stupid&#34; design decisions are actually Type 2?And the reasons may or may not be good - somewhere on a scale from real budget and/or time constraints, lack of insight, indifference, penny pinching economics, to passive aggressive user hostility.When Apple removed Magsafe no doubt there were perfectly good internal justifications for that decision. But ultimately the people outside the company who said it was a poor move from a user POV turned out to be right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked with Nick a few times in a previous job and he was a reviewer on a paper I wrote; he was really nice and professional, and his feedback was constructive and incisive.The movement he&#39;s part of is fundamentally disagreeable (in the &#39;big five&#39; sense [0]), and some of its prominent characters, as you might expect, have reputations for being interpersonally difficult [1]. Collectively they&#39;ve been labeled &#34;data thugs&#34; [2] and accused of &#34;methodological terrorism&#34; [3], which is why I think Nick&#39;s fundamental goodness is an especially valuable asset. We&#39;d gain a ton of social value from certain reforms to the scientific research apparatus, and, IMO, being kind when delivering pointed critiques helps a difficult pill go down. That&#39;s different than pulling your punches; it just means staying focused on the thing you actually want to change.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits[1] https://medium.com/@OmnesRes/the-dumbest-fucking-thing-ive-e...[2] https://www.science.org/content/article/meet-data-thugs-out-...[3] https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/09/21/what-has-h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a fantastic example of how a) anyone can call bullshit on science if it doesn&#39;t make sense and b) there are more and less correct ways of calling bullshit on established science.You don&#39;t need to hop on a podcast or radio show in order to question the orthodoxy of a scientific claim, and in fact you shouldn&#39;t if you want to be taken seriously.  Nick Brown would have hurt his case had he done that, and instead found a path that actually knocked down a faulty concept in a way that has lasting effects.This is the process working.  This is all okay, and welcome, IMO, though possibly not by everyone involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taking equations from physics out of context to bolster social science claims isn&#39;t unique to psychology, other social sciences like economics have done the same thing with little more justification.  The rationale behind this approach is simple marketing, in that &#39;using more mathy stuff&#39; will sell better to the general public than non-mathy hand-waving claims will.However, the practioners of this approach don&#39;t seem to understand that physical equations are constructed by analysis of empirical experimental and observational data on one hand, and theoretical mathematical development on the other, within limited scopes of applicability.  Copying equations from one area of science to another willy-nilly like the article describes is just ridiculous - would cosmologists studying general relatively just plug in quantum mechanical equations in the hope of getting a &#39;mathy explanation&#39;?Here&#39;s another example from &#39;mathematically sound neoclassical economics&#39;, which does the same with 19th century physical science equations:&gt; &#34;The strategy the economists used was as simple as it was absurd—they substituted economic variables for physical ones. Utility (a measure of economic well-being) took the place of energy; the sum of utility and expenditure replaced potential and kinetic energy. A number of well-known mathematicians and physicists told the economists that there was absolutely no basis for making these substitutions. But the economists ignored such criticisms and proceeded to claim that they had transformed their field of study into a rigorously mathematical scientific discipline.&#34;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-economist-has..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;While the investors listed above can take care of themselves, unfortunately, invitations to invest were also extended to small-time individual angel investors. Thousands of AngelList members were invited to invest personal checks ranging from $2,000 to $20,000+ via the mailing lists of multiple syndicates.&#34;It&#39;s worth noting that any US person investing this way is required to be an accredited investor, which is another way of saying they&#39;ve proven they can afford to lose that $20k (or whatever they&#39;re putting in).The accredited investor rules in USA seem draconian, but if it weren&#39;t for them, we&#39;d be absolutely drowning in fake tech companies taking money from retail investors. (Today those fakes are in crypto, where you can pretend your investment offering is a utility token or maybe a donation to a revolutionary DAO that just happens to issue tradeable crypto-tokens in return, and hide behind pseudonyms to make it harder for SEC to find you eventually.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazingly, my startup (KubeSail.com YCS19) has similar revenue, has raised 500x less, and we&#39;ve been told point blank that &#34;nobody wants to invest in a hardware company&#34;, or &#34;yes, but what&#39;s the path to 100B&#34;.Hey maybe we don&#39;t have any path to 100B (is 1B just for chumps?), and maybe our margins aren&#39;t B2E-style 99%, but I&#39;d much rather be making something people want rather than...And then I hear my wifes voice in my head: &#34;You can&#39;t pay yourself that little forever...&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any evidence that Kagan took money off the table or paid himself an outsized salary, or hired his friends on exaggerated salaries, or used the startup&#39;s funds as his piggybank?Similarly, the article conflates A16Z leading the seed round but not the follow on round as being some kind of smell. A16Z certainly do lead follow-on rounds, but it isn&#39;t the norm. (It would be interesting to know if they exercised pro-rata or not, but even that isn&#39;t necessarily indicative of anything.)I don&#39;t know if there is or isn&#39;t fraud here, but the only evidence seems to be that Kagan was good at fundraising, raise a lot in a frothy market on little traction, and did not succeed at building the product or a successful business.One of the best things about the tech ecosystem is the lack of stigma around failure. I hope people don&#39;t lose sight of that as round sizes and valuations spike."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My X13 AMD, for example, has a powerful 32-core AMD APU, 32GiB of RAM, and a superfast 1TiB NVMe SSD.The X13 does not have a 32-core APU. The highest spec available is the 4750U with 8C/16T.&gt; By the way, the latest MacBook Pro comes with an Ethernet port. We loved the jokes about iDongle; how about ThinkDongle?The latest MacBook Pro does not come with an Ethernet port. It is however very annoying that Lenovo requires a proprietary dongle to use the built-in Ethernet controller.&gt; The removal of the SD cards slot and Ethernet port has made recent ThinkPads a suboptimal choice for traveling photographers and some IT professionals.The removal of the SD card reader on the X13 AMD Gen 2 is bizarre, but they can and do still offer Ethernet via a dongle.&gt; would you read about the update procedure after you’ve done multiple BIOS updates for the same machine already? Even if you would, would you pay much attention to the Notes section?Yes, but I&#39;m probably weird because I like to know what the vendor fixed and whether the firmware update might remove features that I use (shakes fist at Dell).I own an X13 AMD Gen 2 (20XH), and I think it&#39;s a great laptop with some small caveats.Pro:- 1600p matte display looks amazing- proper support for S3, very low S3 power consumption- super quiet, I never hear the fan and the laptop is never uncomfortably hot (even doing heavy things like compiling buildroot)- amazing performance for a laptop (5850U)Con:- no SD card reader (seriously, why?)- proprietary dongle for Ethernet- Ethernet is only GigE- Came with MediaTek 7961 WiFi, which while supported by mainline Linux, the performance is trash (~30MBit on 802.11ac). Luckily it&#39;s only M.2 so you can replace it with something like the AX201"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A T420 was my daily driver through undergrad, and then collected dust during grad school when I was issued a Macbook. When I returned my Macbook I dusted it off and was surprised by how usable it was (and how usable and well-supported it was running Arch compared to debian in the early 2010s). I finally gave in and upgraded the memory (DDR3!) to 16 GiB recently, and am considering getting a third-party 9-cell battery, as my 9+ year old one has gotten long in the tooth (i3&#39;s battery &#34;widget&#34; reports ~70% fully charged).I dare say it&#39;s my most usable travel laptop outside of my work-issued Yoga, which it still trounces in terms of keyboard ergonomics. It absolutely dunks on the bargin-bin laptops I&#39;ve tried out over the past few years, I think in part because of ergonomics but also because Arch on old (but well-supported) hardware feels snappier than Windows 10 on new (but low-cost) hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me, or did old laptops have better keyboards that the new ones have today?My first laptop was Acer Aspire One (this one [0]). I still have it and I still use it, it&#39;s currently running Debian with Xfce. And the keyboard is still the best I&#39;ve ever used, I genuinely prefer this keyboard over any desktop keyboards that I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve tried many mechanical including Cherry Brown switches. I get that the very low profile keyboards on modern laptops look nice, but I personally don&#39;t use the keyboard for its looks. Not to mention that my cat stepped on the &#34;Enter&#34; key of one of the newer laptops (Acer CB3-431) and she broke the butterfly shaped keycap stabilisation thingy making the button feel very inconsistent. I can&#39;t the replacement for just the bit that broke, I have to buy an entire new keyboard for it (~55€). The cat wasn&#39;t fat and she has walked over pretty much every keyboard that I&#39;ve used, but that was the first one that broke...It is this line of thinking that I personally think is the reason why a good number of people like and still use ThinkPads today.[0] https://www.globalmediapro.com/dp/A25LT9/Acer-Aspire-One-AOA..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a foreign wife and it really drives home one truth: America is a very nuanced place. We have this idea of almost unlimited free speech. Which sounds great, but in practice, it is not really true. Because ultimately, Americans do not have equal rights. We see this over and over in different aspects of society. The Frederick Douglas example from Boston in the article is a great example of why free speech is good. But the truth is it is the same kind of people who are always preventing free speech in meaningful ways. If your takeaway from the speech is that &#34;all kinds of speech need to be heard&#34;, you might be philosophically correct. But, again, in practice, the people in power do not allow free speech. And this is fundamentally different from most examples of cancel culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The application of censorship itself, not what is being censored, is the main symptom of the declining cultural health. The mentality that there are so universally wrong and right things that the right ones must be forced upon any mind, no matter the context, and the wrong ones must be extinguished no matter the context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One major distinction this glosses over is the difference between making it so you can&#39;t read something (e.g., banning it), and making it so you aren&#39;t required to read something (e.g., removing it from the curriculum). Only the former is censorship."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Judging from what an insider in the HR org told me, we&#39;re going to be hearing a lot of stories like this going forward. Apparently, Amazon scale is so large and their attrition rates are so bad that in some markets, every potentially qualified candidate has already applied and failed an interview, or previously worked at Amazon and quit. As the adage goes, necessity is the mother of invention and Amazon seems to be at a point where it really needs to try everything under the sun to try to attract talent, given their extremely poor reputation.With this said, from reading the article, this move seems reminiscent of Netflix&#39;s pay structure, in the sense of offering a higher cash portion but lower equity. Some people here already mentioned that this was already sort of the case with a sign on bonus compensating for the backloaded vesting structure. From my experience interacting w/ professionals outside the FANG bubble, equity tends to be a bit confusing, so I wonder if a move towards bigger cash portions is a way to try to lure people who wouldn&#39;t otherwise be looking at big tech as a prospective career choice.What&#39;s also curious to me is that bumping up cash comp is in direct opposition to the trends from some other tech giants, where they are frontloading equity vesting. My sample size might just be small, but it feels like cash comp seems to correlate somewhat with bearish stock feeling and that frontloaded equity tends to correlate w/ bullish stock feeling. Would love to hear whether I&#39;m off the mark here or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had an office near an Amazon office. I interviewed a lot of people trying to leave Amazon. I don’t ask candidate’s compensation, but a lot of them volunteered it anyway. I was always surprised at how effectively low their comp was in the first few years due to the vesting schedule. The internet is adamant that everyone with FAANG jobs is rolling in TC, but there are a lot of people out there who are getting into FAANG companies (especially Amazon) at lower compensations with the hopes of moving up to those higher levels.OTOH, the backloaded vesting system works. It was easy to hire people out of their first year at Amazon, but almost impossible to hire someone after a few years when the bulk of their vesting was right around the corner. I talked to a lot of people who admitted being miserable but felt they couldn’t leave until they got the equity that they had been toiling over for the past few years.Weird situation all around. We eventually reduced our recruiting out of that particular Amazon office because so many of the people coming out of it were deeply disgruntled with the tech industry in general. Really changed my view of Amazon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been talking to close to a dozen current and former Amazon employees since the end of 2021, and reached out to people publicly sharing attrition observations. Amazon attrition is really bad, even in AWS (Amazon employees all agree that AWS is a much better place to work in tech than Amazon retail).At the same time, Amazon has had to pay very high for new hires. Hiring managers used to need to get L10 approval to go out of bands on offers outside bands, but starting late 2021, they could go out of bands up to ~20% higher with no approvals.To top all of this, Amazon has a 6% internal URA (non-regretted attrition) target: something that has been in place for close to a decade. The Amazon Music group revolted late 2021 as reported by the Big Technology publication in-depth [1] as they didn&#39;t have 6% of people to fire, at the very time when they could not hire. Yet they were forced to hit this URA target, just like all other orgs in Amazon. Apparently this “rebellion email” leaked across the company and is sparking Amazon-wide outrage, and adds fuel to the fire.Amazon has been extremely frugal for the skillset they hire for, very demanding and have created a stressful workplace. They still force 6% of engineers to be fired, even when their own leadership opposes this (Amazon Music).I wonder why they can’t hire. Also, why is Amazon still part of the FANG abbreviation when they have this culture across many of their organisations?[1] https://bigtechnology.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember that when I worked at Google about a decade ago, there was this common saying:&#34;If the first version of your shell script is more than five lines long, you should have written it in Python.&#34;I think there&#39;s a lot of truth in that. None of the examples presented in the article look better than had they been written in some existing scripting/programming language. In fact, had they been written in Python or Javascript, it would have been far more obvious what the resulting output would have been, considering that those languages already use {} for objects and [] for lists.For example, take this example:    jo -p name=JP object=$(jo fruit=Orange point=$(jo x=10 y=20) number=17) sunday=false

In Python you would write it like this:    json.dumps({&#34;name&#34;: &#34;JP&#34;, &#34;object&#34;: {&#34;fruit&#34;: &#34;Orange&#34;, &#34;point&#34;: {&#34;x&#34;: 10, &#34;y&#34;: 20}, &#34;number&#34;: 17}, &#34;sunday&#34;: False})

Only a bit more code, but at least it won&#39;t suffer from the Norway problem. Even though Python isn&#39;t the fastest language out there, it&#39;s likely still faster than the shell command above. There is no need to construct a fork bomb just to generate some JSON."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago I wrote zsh helper [1] that uses jo to quickly construct complex JSON requests, mainly for testing and quering services from console.Paired with httpie [2] aliases [3] it produces concise APL-like syntax:  POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=j`a=b c=`e=3` l=`*1 2 3``

Which translates to:  http POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=&#34;$(jo a=b c=&#34;$(jo e=3)&#34; l=&#34;$(jo -a 1 2 3)&#34;)&#34;

Or, in other words, sending POST with the following body:  {&#34;a&#34;:&#34;b&#34;,&#34;c&#34;:{&#34;e&#34;:3},&#34;l&#34;:[1,2,3]}

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it, very concise but retains all the features you need.`jq` can construct JSON &#34;safely&#34; from shell constructs, but is rather more verbose - e.g. with the same examples:        $ jq -n --arg name Jane &#39;{&#34;name&#34;:$name}&#39;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is almost exactly my life, shifted by a decade.The problem is that by 35 you can&#39;t get by on novelty anymore because you&#39;ve seen some version of everything there is to see.The worst thing you can do is pine for the good old days. They aren&#39;t coming back. And they weren&#39;t that good anyway. Your best times are ahead if you can successfully adjust.What worked for me was putting down roots. I resisted it mightily at first because I wanted to stay mentally 25 forever. Now I see that getting married and having a couple of kids was the right thing to do. It forced me to become more flexible, more deliberate, more focused and have more stamina to do hard thingsI&#39;m a loner by nature, so I can&#39;t imagine where I&#39;d be if I hadn&#39;t settled down. I just know it wouldn&#39;t be as good.Once you&#39;ve got those roots down, life will lead you to what you should do next. Maybe being a full time parent, maybe learning to sail, maybe more successful entrepreneurship. Who knows...EDIT: I don&#39;t mean to imply that everyone needs a family. What&#39;s important is to start living for others to some degree. Hedonism has famously bad diminishing returns.Some people choose to do lots of volunteering or switch careers to social work. There&#39;s lots of options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m 58. Everything IS an different iteration of the same thing. Generally, if intelligent adults are involved, there are likely to be some useful new things in the new iteration, small improvements.  On rare occasion, there are massive changes that only become apparent later. (Like when transistors first appeared, they wore out, like tubes, but slower... germanium was replaced by silicon, and lifetimes tended towards infinity, and then integrated circuit appeared)You&#39;re not too old to have a social life... that happens once you&#39;re in a nursing home, and have worn out the good will of the staff. Up until that point, there are always new friendships and relationships to be had.Going out to parties and drinking until morning is a lot harder on you than it was, that&#39;s a normal part of growing up. There are plenty of other things to do that are far more rewarding if you give yourself time to grow into them (and Covid rules don&#39;t prohibit them)If you need a hobby, I suggest machining.  Challenge yourself to make 1000 of some everyday hardware store item, like a 1/4&#34; 10-24 x 2&#34; screw, Flat head.  You&#39;ll learn a lot of interesting history, and grow to appreciate the supply chain, along the way.Note: Outside of the US, maybe some M8 Torx screws instead? You&#39;ll learn about Rotary Broaching, or cold heading, along the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mourning the loss of one’s youth is pretty typical. You lose a step. You didn’t do what you hoped you would do. You wasted your time. So forth and so on.Don’t worry. It gets better. This is all part of the process of life.My recommendation is that you read Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”I’m 52 here. I was a prolific programmer in my 20s. A go-go marketer in my 30s. For the last 10 years, I’ve run a business that I love with two partners who have taken advantage of me at every turn. The last two years neither has worked and yet they get paid.Do I feel lost or depressed? Absolutely not.I love life. I have an amazing family to whom I am utterly devoted. I volunteer for stuff. I do cool things every day. If I feel bored, I make things with my hands or engage in other creative pursuits. I focus on the moment and others more than anything else and all the rest just goes away.How is this possible? I’ve filled my life with reasons to live.In fact, I have so many now that there is no room for worry about what I have and haven’t done. And in doing so, I realize that none of that matters anyway.My mom died at 52 after taking a header down a flight of stairs. My grandfather died at 56 after getting stabbed in the belly by my grandmother (she was psychotic).Our naked existence is laughable. Everything can be lost in an instant.Dive into the why and you can deal with any how."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The output is very polished and fast, I like it a lot.
Unfortunately it&#39;s not technically a single file as it depends on code downloaded from their server, therefore it can&#39;t be deployed locally without Internet connection.From the forum:&#34;In terms of license, you don&#39;t need an internet connection. However, Files app loads it&#39;s own Javascript, CSS and several plugins from CDN (jsdelivr.com), and this requires internet. We already have a request to allow serving all assets locally (as an option), although in your case that might not be practical as this means Files app is essentially no longer a&#34;single file&#34;, but multiple files that you need to be included with each installation (although you could assign a global path perhaps). In any case, for now it&#39;s not possible to load Files app without internet.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, Files app DEVELOPER here. Someone notified me that the app had been posted here. A lot of negative comments, which I don&#39;t have a problem with, but I can perhaps clarify a few things.About Files app not being &#34;single file&#34; because it loads JS/CSS resources from the CDN (internet). That is of course a correct observation, and this is already noted on the website. From an operational perspective, there is only one file to download/move/install, and from a functional perspective for the vast majority, it will be viewed in browser with an active internet connection. Furthermore, it was INTENDED BY DESIGN to load all JS/CSS from CDN, because ultimately it improves the user-experience, and makes it plausible to make an app like this wrapped into a single index.php file.It&#39;s not reasonable to add ALL Javascript/CSS directly into the index.php file. PHP is only 10% of the codebase, and it would bloat the file to insane dimensions and make it difficult to maintain. JS/CSS is loaded from CDN service jsdelivr.com, with multi-level redundancy (Amazon, Cloudfront, Cloudflare), and will load faster and cache more effectively than anything served from within the index.php app on your own server. Furthermore, some plugins are served on-demand, for example when browser needs a &#34;polyfill&#34; or for specific features. For functional reasons, benefiting the vast majority who do not care how/where the JS/CSS is loaded from, JS and CSS files are therefore served from CDN. If this does not suit you, nobody has any problem with that.Does anyone have any examples of any other single-file app with a comprehensive interface like Files app that is entirely self-contained?There will be a future release where you can assign all scripts/css to be loaded from local path, but then of course all these files will need to be installed alongside Files app index.php. We will NOT be adding all JS/CSS directly into the index.php file.About license, as stated on the website, you can use it as a file viewer for free (with the nag). If you want to remove the nag and use it as a file manager, license is required. Those who expect apps like this to be entirely free with updates and support, are living in dream land. It&#39;s hardly worthwhile in the first place. There are loads of other free apps, and if you can&#39;t see any difference, then your choice is easy.I have noted comments about license info being unclear, thanks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like what I see on the site and in the comments here. Im looking forward to checking this out more maybe.Im kind of surprised that as a species we  dont have a conclusive ubiquitous solution to the foggy problem of digital photo storage / management. So many of my photos are just in drawers on old hard drives and phones.Anyway maybe its getting better. Or maybe Im just stupid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So either 1) the lawyers ripped off J&amp;J by spending time on this or 2) J&amp;J management was so angry and irrational that they demanded the lawyers waste their time on this.Every lawyer worth their salt in America knows that you can’t get an injunction to prevent someone from publishing something. That’s a prior restraint and is about as close as you can get to something absolutely forbidden under American law."</p>

By doing so, J&amp;J could limit its financial exposure to the lawsuits.”[1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fought the battle to keep my SMTP server IP off blacklists, and lost.You can do everything possible, have a perfectly clean IP, have a good amount of outbound email traffic, only send transactional email, etc. Still, there will be edge cases where email does not go through. AT&amp;T email servers would constantly blacklist me and not respond to requests to remove me, gmail/yahoo/outlook would silently put emails in the spam folder, and companies using email firewall products would blacklist me, with an IT Dept too inept to fix it.The solution was to pay a small fee and proxy all outbound email through a transactional SMTP sender, like Postmark or Mailgun. It&#39;s easy to do, with one line of code in Postfix. You can be selective, and only proxy emails sent to certain troublesome domains. If you try an email provider and it&#39;s not working out, it&#39;s one line of code to change to another provider.This allows me to still manage nearly all aspects of hosting my email server and control my email data, while not dealing with deliverability issues. I use Postmark and I have not dealt with a deliverability issue in two years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m dealing with this right now.Both my personal domain and rsync.net are on a distinct subnet, but that subnet is smaller than a /24 and someone on a different subnet has, apparently, behaved badly.Enter &#34;abusix&#34; ...One of my engineers had an enlightening webchat with one of their engineers where we were shown the &#34;offending&#34; IP and it was explained that they have no ability to distinguish subnets (and no interest in doing so).  So if you&#39;re not wasting an entire /24 (we only need ~10 IPs at this location) you&#39;re in danger of this misclassification.We were also informed that our normal, business communications with paying customers should have unsubscribe notices appended to them.  Which is to say, you&#39;re a paying customer of a service and we send you some kind of alert or critical announcement ... and it should have an unsubscribe link.Unbelievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spam blocklists are run by an unaccountable cowboy cult that somehow has managed to consolidate a ton of power simply for the fact that most people who run email inbox services didn&#39;t want to deal with the problem of spam, so they were more than willing to just hand over anti-spam &#34;enforcement&#34; to anyone who was allegedly doing &#34;what was best for the internet.&#34; There&#39;s no check on these people who run these blacklists, and the system they&#39;ve built is entirely a black box, antithetical to the principles of the open internet. And if you&#39;re not a huge corporation that can afford professional management of your email deliverability, good luck – the individuals and small organizations are just out of luck. It&#39;s a miserable racket and for what?If you want to know why there&#39;s a new thread each week on HN about why it&#39;s impossible to host your own email service, this is why."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a lot of work on microbiome and cancer immunotherapy... the latest study in the field published in the most prestigious journal there is [1] seemed to show that fibre intake was more important than any specific microbe. In fact they found that eating more fibre and taking probiotics resulted in worse outcomes than just eating more fibre alone. This was recapitulated in a mouse model:&gt; Together, these data have important implications. We show that dietary fiber and probiotic use, factors known to affect the gut microbiome, are associated with differential outcomes to ICB. Although causality cannot be addressed from the observational human cohort, where unmeasured confounders may exist, our preclinical models support the hypothesis that dietary fiber and probiotics modulate the microbiome and that antitumor immunity is impaired in mice receiving a low-fiber diet and in those receiving probiotics—with suppression of intratumoral IFN-γ T cell responses in both cases.It would be a bit disappointing if the final conclusion from all this microbiome work was &#39;Eat more vegetables&#39;...[1] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz7015"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just another data point, but my journey through digestive issues and recovery was kicked off by the worst depression and burnout I ever experienced, which started in 2019 and lasted 3 years.My best guess for what happened is that work stress, excessive celebration and coping with the cognitive dissonance of the pre-COVID era and subsequent pandemic, combined with overtraining and the misuse of protein shakes in place of food, left me in a chronically dehydrated state. The body tries to collect moisture from the gut, which opens an opportunity for bacteria to get into the body cavity and blood, which is colloquially called leaky gut. This sets off food sensitivities and eventually an autoimmune condition/response to lectins, gluten, etc, which have proteins similar to linings in the body, joints and thyroid. Then a cascade happens where everything goes out of whack quickly. In my case, I went from being in the best shape of my life, the strongest I had ever been in the gym, to barely able to get out of bed in the morning. In other people, it might present as chronic fatigue, arthritis, etc.I didn&#39;t really believe any of this in 2018, and my meal plan then consisted entirely of everything that I can&#39;t eat today. So I consider what people say politely, but for the most part, they have absolutely no idea what they&#39;re talking about. This experience has made stuff like GMO foods sound absolutely insane to me. Like, why would we ever taint our food supply to make food 5 cents cheaper or &#34;feed the world&#34; when we&#39;ve been operating under artificial scarcity since the end of the second world war? It&#39;s all a crock.Every time you eat inflammatory food, the risk is similar to smoking a cigarette. Probably nothing will happen, but if it sets off your immune system, you may wake up one morning chronically depressed and/or unable to eat something that you rely upon. It got me after I turned 40, YMMV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see the gut brain axis becoming more well known in medicine.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool. My daughter has a brain shunt due to complications of spina bifida and so we’re thinking of cerebrospinal fluid on a regular basis. As a layman I guess there’s a particular cerebrospinal fluid pressure you want, and that being too high or too low causes issues? Apparently the shunt just drains into her belly so I also found that interesting. Too high and she’ll have terrible headaches and an “alien” head (sorry, don’t mean offense by that but it’s what I’m trying to avoid for my child) and I don’t know what would happen with too little, maybe someone could tell me. Probably not good I’m assuming.I frequent some FB groups for parents of children with SB and am shocked at how large some people let their kids heads get without consulting with or complaining to a doctor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is curious.  During my research into neutral networks we depended on a neuroscience result that found waves of trophic factor (i.e. the stuff used to build up neurons [i.e. learn]) travel in cascading waves from the core of the brain to the periphery.  By adding a sense of location and a learning term contingent on the factor we saw learning 
(xor) prohibited by Minsky&#39;s result (not really prohibited because we changed the model).The take away was that our models of ANNs benefit from considering more that just neural signaling (i.e. solution contents and fluid dynamics).  Is anyone aware of modern work expanding on that front?"</p>

It’s completely free for individual use, and I’m happy to see that the charts and maps I made while teaching students about interactive data viz work just as well as they did the 5+ years ago.The variety of built-in shapefiles (international, US counties) — with the ability to upload your own custom shapefiles to quickly create interactive maps — is a killer feature on its own"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lat/Lon is really the standard. The fact that some software internally represents it as Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a settled issue. If you look up the coordinate of a location - it&#39;s always in Lat/Long. You can&#39;t rewrite all the books and change all the maps to make it nicer for programmersAs the linked post says, Lon/Lat is generally easier to deal with b/c it matches to X/Y (and the North/Up way we look at maps). But you still have annoyances. For instance Lon goes 0-360 but Lat goes -90 to 90. This is also mathematically inconvenientAdd on top of that the X-Y coordinate on images generally have the X flipped and starting at the top left corner. So changing to Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t fix everything.What I personally lean towards now is converting everything on read-in to a South/East coordinate system so it matches the flipped X-Y of images (like GeoTIFFs) and just always working in that system. Image manipulation, drawing to screen, output etc. - those systems/libraries I can&#39;t really modify myself. Everything else I can manipulate in whatever coordinate system I want. So it makes sense to choose the most convenient. Plus only dealing with positive coordinates is a big plus.That all said, I&#39;m a total noob and I have no &#34;geospatial&#34; background (just writing some software to deal with rain data right now) So this isn&#39;t pro advice.  I&#39;d just be curious what others think"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of two days of bug fixing, after our Python mapping tool suddenly returned bogus data, without any change in the code base.Turns out, we did not pin the pyproj library [1] and they introduced a switch from lon-lat to lat-lon order, per default.It was possible to retain the old behavior with `always_xy: bool = False`. I saw hundrets of similar reports, who knows how many users were effected. Conclusions, a) Always pin your dependencies, b) explicit is better than implicit.Besides, I have a personal, subjective preference for lon-lat, but I understood the lat-lng order to be the officially accepted norm.[1]: https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/proj.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Latitude historically comes first when spoken or written because of the rule of ablaut reduplication, which makes it more natural for the &#39;a&#39; sound to come before the &#39;o&#39; sound when using phrases like this.  For instance, &#39;bish, bash, bosh&#39; sound natural/correct, but &#39;bosh, bash, bish&#39; sounds wrong.I get the order wrong when working with geojson with embarrassing frequency...http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/a-hotchpotch-of-redup..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone stuck in this dark pattern here is a trick I&#39;ve used in the past:Adobe won&#39;t let you cancel without paying the remainder of your subscription fee however you can switch to a different plan. As soon as you switch you&#39;ll have the ability to cancel your &#34;new&#34; plan within 14 days. If you cancel after 14 days they&#39;ll charge you the early termination fee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just yesterday, on a local streaming platform that has a series that I want to watch I was offered &#34;7 days free&#34;. Great, I can watch the accumulated episodes and if I still feel like watching the new ones that come weekly I can keep the subscription, right?Nope, the &#34;7 days free&#34; wasn&#39;t a a trail but 7 extra days when you purchase a full year subscription. I was considering to get a monthly subscription to try it out but since they tried to trick me into a yearly one I simply decide to Torrent the crap out of their content. Sorry not sorry.That&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s great about Apple&#39;s iAP and Apple being the handler of transactions. There&#39;s no tricks, it&#39;s standart on every app: If there&#39;s a trail period you get the trail and if not you directly start paying.  Also no tricks in the cancelation process, it&#39;s all in one place so you can review and cancel easily. You can also change plans right from the same screen. If somehow you manage to purchase something you don&#39;t want, get refunded easily.I really hope that if Apple is forced into allowing 3rd party payments, we end up getting a standardised interface like the one we have currently on Apple&#39;s platforms but with an option to choose the alternative payment method(in the same screen but a different card or account kind of thing, like choosing a card in Apple Pay)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you’re on macOS and just want a good and convenient image editor, I warmly recommend Acorn. The Muellers (owners of Flying Meat Software) have put a lot of effort to make it feel like a really solid Mac application. The price is good and from time to time they offer discounts. The whole experience reminds me of using good old Paintshop Pro back in the late 90s (^_^)Other options are Affinity Photo from Serif Ltd and Pixelmator. IMHO Acorn has much better GUI though. (FWIW, Affinity works fine on Windows too.)I realize that some people need the features from Photoshop and then I guess they have to pay the “Adobe tax”. But if you’re not a photo/graphics professional, you can come a long way with the above options.AFAIK there are also lots of good alternatives for Illustrator and InDesign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t really understand why anyone who claims to be a proponent of a free market economy has an issue with a private corporation deciding what type of content they want to broadcast.JR sold his catalog of intellectual property (podcast episodes) of his own free will and was paid very well for it: about $100M from what I can gather. What Spotify chooses to do with it is completely up to them, even if they bought it with the express intention of &#34;burning&#34; it all, i.e. never broadcasting it, that would still not be censorship. That would be nothing but exercising their intellectual property rights, that they paid for, just like buying the rights to a song that you hate to stop that specific recording from ever being played again is within your right, or even negotiating with the artist to never play it again.He signed a &#34;multi-year&#34; exclusive deal (the details are fuzzy, for obvious reasons) which means he sold his trademark and time for money, which is how the market works.Exactly what he sold (NDA, limitations on his speech in his free time etc.) we&#39;ll probably never know, but whoever calls this &#34;censorship&#34; needs a reality check. There exists plenty of proper censorship in the world if you look for it, and this isn&#39;t it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I speak for the majority of people here.Before the Spotify deal, you would just see couple of Joe Rogan clips on YouTube and you have sat through maybe 3-4 entire podcasts. You don&#39;t care much about MMA or you don&#39;t think comedians are that important/hypeworthy as the JRE fandom would claim.After the Spotify deal you just slowly stopped even seeing the clips because for some reason you just don&#39;t care to search for them and YouTube stopped recommending new clips.You would hear about some hot takes about Joe Rogan vs something but you just don&#39;t find it worthwhile to investigate or frankly having an opinion about them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bigger than Spotify.Rogan was a proactive person conducting open research into the world around him. When proactive people investigate things and share their findings, it now only takes a few to dislike the findings, fuss, and have the findings removed.To those that support this, I have 4 questions:1. Is disincentivising sharing knowledge really good for the world?2. Is it reasonable to expect 100% of inquiries be 100% accurate on the very first attempt?3. Is it efficient for society to repeat the same research many times since previous investigations are scrubbed from public record?4. Is it healthy for public discourse to be made less diverse and only concern &#39;safe&#39; topics?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this bill is strongly opposed by the Internet Society, ACLU, CDT, and EFF, the critiques I&#39;ve read don&#39;t get much into the real &#34;why&#34; behind this legislation continuing to be pushed so forcefully. The pretext is, of course, &#34;protect the children&#34; and more generally law-and-order with a bonus side-helping of &#34;stop those awful social media giants.&#34; While these justifications are (hopefully) obvious misdirection to most, I&#39;d like to see more mainstream discussion about who this bill benefits and why. The legislation &#39;coincidentally&#39; achieves exactly the agenda proposed by the &#34;surveillance state&#34; (ie CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS, law enforcement lobby, state prosecutors, etc). While it doesn&#39;t specifically prohibit public access to encryption, it seeks to create nearly the same effect by making it legally risky for large social media and platform companies to offer end-to-end encryption as a default to law-abiding citizens. It&#39;s no accident that almost every version of the bill creates this exposure to essentially bottomless legal liability for platforms offering secure communications.Frankly, this scares the crap out of me. These people seem incapable of understanding the existential threat to free society and democracy posed by limiting everyone&#39;s ability to communicate private thoughts. While not explicitly outlawing untappable communications, it&#39;s much easier to identify who is choosing to use end-to-end encryption when it&#39;s not the typical default. This will ultimately put all of us who care about secure communications under default suspicion, whether our interest in private comms is a moral ideal, political principle or simply proper technical architecture and data hygiene. In today&#39;s multi-national environment of nation-state, criminal and privateer (NSO etc) threat actors, insecure communications over Internet infrastructure should only be seen as an ill-advised risky behavior or a technical bug."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 3 Techdirt links in the article are especially helpful for catching up.EARN IT is another skirmish in the 30+ year old Crypto Wars. For those who care about defending privacy and encryption, exhaustion is not an option.Power-hungry governments must be viewed similarly to an APT in this context. They are following their very nature, and they will never stop inventing new approaches.There is no other option except to  stay organized and always ready to engage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those living in California: https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/e-mail-meA copy of my note if you would like a template:```
Dear Senator Feinstein,I am deeply disappointed with your support of the EARN IT act and am expressing my deep concern and disapproval of such a bill.Congruent with the recent report released by Stanford, I am expressing my deep disappointment in your sponsorship of the EARN IT act. I believe it represents a fundamental undermining of citizens right to privacy through strong encryption under the extremely divisive framing of &#34;protecting the children&#34;. As a Father of two children myself, I do not believe that whatever incremental improvement to their safety, if any at all, justifies the undermining of encryption of ordinary citizens. In my opinion, this law actively undermines the fourth amendment in the digital realm and I must state that if you believe this is in my best interest, you have lost both my vote and my trust.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, I thought I would resurrect my HN account for this.I wrote this article a little over a decade ago, when I was still in college, and I knew almost nothing about the world. (I still don&#39;t, but I didn&#39;t then, either) It&#39;s fun to see that it still resonates with people despite the naivety and the slight sense of &#34;I am headed for success&#34; that makes it hard for me to re-read.My initial reflection on the article was that I had fallen off the &#34;do things, tell people&#34; wagon a little bit, having let go of my twitter account and with it much of the easiest path to doing things and telling people. I still work in tech but I haven&#39;t created anything I&#39;m particularly excited about in a good while, so I felt that I was failing my own ideal.Then, of course, I remembered that I hiked all of Ireland&#39;s long-distance trails (https://toughsoles.ie) and have a reasonably successful, if niche, youtube channel (https://youtube.com/toughsoles). Funny that my mindset, especially regarding this article, is so tech-focused that I automatically discount something I&#39;ve been doing for five years.All that said, I&#39;m starting to look for new opportunities in the larger-than-startup space. Shoot me an email at carl@flax.ie and let&#39;s chat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually very good advice from personal experience.The best career results (promotions) I have seen came from people who built a prototype of some sort then evangelized it, even if it wasn’t necessarily a complete product, often just a good prototype.First example: This guy took the Intel Edison and built a pretty cool project and brought it to our maker faire events. He ended up in conversation with the CEO of some company and ended up landing a $500K exec job. Just from building a skateboard hack and trying to tell people about it.Second: I knew a guy who built this neat prototype of a compute service and then did a keynote talk at a Meetup. It didn’t really work as a product but the website was convincing. It was enough to “get bought” by a major tech co and land him a CTO job.Another time I saw a guy leave a FAANG and build a compelling IoT type project in three months. Again, he ended up with a CTO level job after a few months.My take away is if you want an executive job, build something somewhat cool, even as a prototype, and go try to sell it for real. Even if you don’t raise any money or make it work as a business it is often way better than submitting resumes.There is something much more powerful about creating something that generates a lot of engagement and conversation, even if it is only half baked but looks decent and your storytelling is compelling.This isn’t interviewing it’s auditioning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Success = product x distributionTook me way too long to realise this, at least first two failed companies were as a result of over indexing on product. We do not have perfect market intelligence and inexperienced entrepreneurs most common mistake is relying on how good their work / product / service is. It&#39;s a business killer as not enough customers will ever find it.It actually makes more sense to build distribution first, so that your product (however good or bad it is) gets an opportunity for as much exposure as possible. Somebody will buy, if enough people see it"</p>

AMEN!&#34;.&#34;I was running late to an interview this morning but stopped to help a man who fell off of his bike and fixed it up for him. Afterwards I bought him a coffee and talked about life. He mentioned how he had to go to work but was touched by meeting me, he said we had a real connection. I go to the interview and guess what! The man was my interviewer! He immediately offered me a job at 1.5m a year plus bonuses and is fast tracking me to become a regional director.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a recovering perfectionist who has read their fair share of Brene Brown, Steven Pressfield, Seth Godin, Tony Robbins, Anne Lamott, and many more.The best metaphors I&#39;ve read is in Bird by Bird. The author describes two different scenarios.The first is that perfection &amp; progress is much like driving late at night with headlights. You will only be able to see as far as your headlights allow. You might be going through a canyon, on a straight and narrow highway, or going the wrong way. But all you know for certain is what is in front of you.The second is that you have to frame your perfectionism around something. That could be your loved ones, your dreams in life, whatever. If it&#39;s always framed around your past achievements, you&#39;re comparing to the past and not to the future version of what could be. Getting clear on why you&#39;re doing it is very important.I truly believe you can devoid yourself of perfectionism. I&#39;ve gone from being afraid to publish work to the public, to only publishing in the public and shaping my work based on the imperfections being pointed out in my shitty first attempts.Your first attempt will be shitty. Your second attempt will be less shitty. Do this for long enough and you&#39;ll start to get a feel for proficiency and what others see as &#34;perfection&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mental health issues too often remain untreated among high-achievers who are able to maintain a surface appearance of holding it together.  It&#39;s a good trend that nowadays we feel able to talk more openly about struggles like this.I see myself in this article but for me, the word that was the key to find resources to get better was the broader acronym RNT, &#34;Repetitive negative thoughts&#34;.  Perfectionism themes are one common type of thought for me, but I also have several other categories that don&#39;t fit in that frame.  Two resources I found particularly useful:* https://www.amazon.com/Negative-Thoughts-Workbook-Repetitive... &#34;The Negative Thoughts Workbook&#34; A practical self-help book with chapters to work through each common category of negative thought* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672052/ &#34;Constructive and Unconstructive Repetitive Thought&#34; A survey in the clinical literature which I found particularly helpful for identifying the subset of negative thoughts which has been actually helping me.  This helped me ease up on the majority of unhelpful thoughts with greater confidence that I&#39;m still preserving the small subset of my thought pattern which has helped me succeed."</p>

I find myself on this orange site multiple times a day largely for some of the reasons outlined.&gt; She dwells in puddles for fear of the oceanwoah. Beautiful line. Great writing can really make the content more impactful. I find myself regularly absorbed in the minutia of a technology used in a project. I tell myself it&#39;s because I find the subject fascinating and knowing it deeply will make the solution (and me) better (which is partly true), but I often have that thought niggling in the back of my mind, &#34;Am I spending too long on this detail because I&#39;m avoiding tackling the bigger problem because I&#39;m worried I might fail?&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems pretty awful to suggest that the government-managed &#39;no-fly&#39; list should be used for anything after watching how poorly it was used and abused as a security measure. But considering the airlines look to the government to solve their financial problems, it&#39;s no surprise they would look to the government to solve their passenger problems as well. I assume begging for government intervention has become an airline CEO reflex, at this point.Bureaucracy, security theater, and airline/airport ineptitude has turned flying into a painful, regrettable process. Add shrinking seat space and airport and airplane booze to the mix and you&#39;ve got a recipe for stress, discomfort, and short tempers.I suspect booze is actually the primary culprit. I&#39;ve flown a few hundred flights in my time and only witnessed two, rather tame, incidents that caused people to be kicked off flights or caused in-air arguments. In one case the culprit was very drunk. The other case the culprit was very hung over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is probably a good idea, but not as an extension of the current no-fly list, which is opaque and lacking accountability.The &#34;disruptive passenger&#34; no-fly list should have clear criteria for why people are put on it and for how long, and a clear process for challenging being incorrectly placed on the list.  Ideally this would be a bit better than having airlines collaborate amongst themselves to create their own no-fly list which can&#39;t be legally challenged because they&#39;re private organizations that can mostly do what they want.  On the other hand, being blacklisted by private companies would in some ways be less creepy/authoritarian than the no-fly lists as they exist now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is with some of the responses in this thread! I understand some cases are not so clear, but if you do something as blatant as punch a flight attendant in the face I think that’s grounds to be put on such a list. There should be a policy so that after a period (or going through some program) you could then be removed from the list though..It actually blew my mind when I heard that you could assault someone on a plane and not be instantly banned"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here.HVM is the ultimate conclusion to years of optimal evaluation research. I&#39;ve been a great enthusiast of optimal runtimes. Until now, though, my most efficient implementation had barely passed 50 million rewrites per second. It did beat GHC in cases where optimality helped, like λ-encoded arithmetic, but in more real-world scenarios, it was still far behind. Thanks to a recent memory layout breakthrough, though, we managed to reach a peak performance of 2.5 billion rewrites per second, on the same machine. That&#39;s a ridiculous 50x improvement.That is enough for it to enjoy roughly the same performance of GHC in normal programs, and even outperform it when automatic parallelism kicks in, if that counts! Of course, there are still cases where it will perform worse (by 2x at most usually, and some weird quadratic cases that should be fixed [see issues]), but remember it is a 1-month prototype versus the largest lazy functional compiler in the market. I&#39;m confident HVM&#39;s current design is able to scale and become the fastest functional runtime in the world, because I believe the optimal algorithm is inherently superior.I&#39;m looking for partners! Check the notes at the end of the repository&#39;s README if you want to get involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks pretty awesome, and holds much promise for the future.
Optimal beta reduction has always seemed like something of theoretical interest only, but Victor has been working many years on making it more practical, which deserves a lot of respect.&gt; HVM files look like untyped Haskell.Why not make it look exactly like Haskell?
So that every valid Haskell program is automatically a valid Hvm program,
while the reverse need not hold due to hvm being untyped.Instead the syntax looks like a mix of Haskell and Lisp, with parentheses around application, and prefix operators. I prefer the cleaner Haskell syntax.Some of the speedup examples look somewhat artificial:The exponential speedup is on 2^n compositions of the identity function,
which has no practical use. It would be nice to show such a speedup on a nontrivial function.The arithmetical example uses a binary representation, but strangely uses unary implementation of operators, with addition implemented as repeated increment, and multiplication as repeated addition. Why not use binary implementation of operators? Does that not show a good speedup?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Story time! Back around 2008 when we were developing the first version of AWS CloudWatch (which was then code-named &#34;Granite&#34;) we had two problems to solve:1. What should the API for PutMetricData look like?2. Where should we store that data?(you know, minor issues)At the time, we decided that #1 was more critical than #2 (and of course #2 depends deeply on the answer to #1), and that the best way to solve it would be to do some learning-by-prototyping - stand up an internal version of CloudWatch to dogfood with some other Amazon services and be able to go to prospective internal customers with a &#34;working&#34; service that they could kick the tires on, not just some API docs and paper prototypes. So I quickly hacked up an implementation of &#34;GraniteDataStore&#34; called &#34;InMemoryDataStore&#34;, which would store every PutMetricData request in a HashMap and nowhere else.When I sent the code out for peer review, my reviewer was aghast at the idea that we would stand up a service that would knowingly store different copies of the data on every server, and lose it all on process restart. I responded by renaming InMemoryDataStore to FakeInMemoryDataStore, but that wasn&#39;t enough. Finally, we settled on a name of (if memory serves) FakeFakeFakeDataStoreThatLosesAllYourData and that was enough to get my merge approved."</p>

This was a significant improvement for GoAWK’s old tree-walking interpreter, where I saw a 38% increase in speed on one microbenchmark, and a 17% average speedup across all microbenchmarksI find that surprising that Go did not use registers for its (internal) calling convention until 1.17.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been an Amazon SDE and an Amazon SDM. I enjoyed my time as an SDE, luckily free from these horror stories. After having been an SDM, I understand how these horror stories can form.Generally, Amazon has two minds about performance management. In written documentation, it&#39;s all about whether your reports meet the role guidelines. The written documentation is solid. They share how to evaluate people objectively and how to minimize bias. Verbally, it&#39;s all about numbers and probability. The organization wants X number of people to leave this year, to do that they want Y number of people in performance improvement plans.There is an intense pressure to force a certain amount of attrition each year. While Amazon may claim stack ranking doesn&#39;t exist, Amazon uses rating and calibration mechanisms to learn who you think as a manager are your lowest performers. As a manager, you get verbal (never written) lashings from your manager and skip manager to put the lowest performers on performance plans that ensure that any attrition counts. As soon as you capitulate, your lowest performer is now considered a low performer.As an SDM, I wanted to maintain the illusion of great Amazon culture for my team. Behind the scenes, I spent a lot of time advocating for my team and trying to poke holes in the performance ratings of other teams. It was exhausting. There are certainly a lot of shortcuts I could have taken like putting potential internal transfers on performance management, but did not. I feel bad for the LinkedIn poster here, I think he had a lazy manager."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve worked at Amazon. I made it a few years, but was almost pipped in the first few months. Management dropped a huge project on me, a brand new tier 1 service, with full dns resolution, api, database, distributed system, along with micro services. The deadline was three months. Brand new tech stack. When I was struggling to meet the deadline, we started having “performance conversations”.I ended up switching teams and had a decent time at the company, but the nightmare situations are very real. You are replaceable and there’s no mercy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some people meet this with a healthy level of scepticism, which is great. However I used to work at Amazon, working on the performance evaluation and HR tools used within the company. It was a couple of years back, but I am fairly certain that the same tools are still used, given that all of them were developed from scratch. At the time it was in line with the company&#39;s PR of removing its toxic work culture.It&#39;s worth mentioning that it wasn&#39;t uncommon for people to move around teams, and to be honest HR is not the most exciting field for software development anyways. So, as expected, the HR dev teams had people move around quite a bit. Nothing toxic so far.One of the projects I worked on was what used to be called the dev list or personal improvement plan (pip) now renamed to Pivot. Most likely the exact same same tool. Management wanted to update the processes in order to automate as much as possible and reduce the risk of managers putting someone in pip, just because they didn&#39;t like them. However the process was set up in such a way that a manager can progress an employee through a pip for waaaay too long, until a failsafe, or a second pair of eyes even takes a look at it. I, personally, voiced my concerns about it, but it was shrugged off as &#34;it shouldn&#39;t happen&#34;, &#34;managers wouldn&#39;t do that&#34; and &#34;it&#39;s fine&#34; by the project stakeholders.The project starts, development is going a usual and a couple of years go by. I moved to another project within the HR space. Most of the team developing the tool has also moved on to greener pastures. Apart from that one guy, who has been there since its inception. He went from being a backend engineer, learning React and painstakingly working on a messy frontend codebase, eventually leaving him the only person competent enough to make changes to it. Eventually he was fed up and wanted to move to a different team. Lo and behold - his manager, the manager of the team building the pip tool, put him in pip to prevent him from moving. Haven&#39;t seen someone decide and actually leave a company as quickly as he did. So if the manager of the pip company can use it to blackmail people not to leave, I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s like for the rest of the company."</p>

I pulled up Shazam but it didn&#39;t recognize the song, so I took to Google. I entered the lyric and added the search terms &#34;lyrics&#34; and &#34;r&amp;b&#34; at the end. Google returned 4 YouTube videos to songs that didn&#39;t contain the lyric, a link to a Boyz II Men song on Genius that didn&#39;t contain the lyric (good job Google, you know an R&amp;B band), a link to peterbe.com to find a song by lyrics, and a bunch of other useless links. I clicked on to page 2, which hilariously presented 3 of the 4 YouTube videos that were on page 1.I was immediately turned off, so I pulled up DuckDuckGo and Bing, entered the same exact query, and both engines returned the song I was looking for in the first result. I laughed out loud.I then thought to myself, &#34;I wonder how many pages I would have had to flip through in Google to find this result.&#34; Eventually, I found it. It was the 68th result on page 7."</p>

Like I can&#39;t use google for coding questions any more. Not like I was able to previously. Also, Stackoverflow with bangs from ddg are broken and it thinks I&#39;m a robot.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple allows “free apps” that are entirely ad-supported, never giving Apple a dime (aside from $99/year), yet they are consuming infrastructure: hosting pages, downloads, reviewer time, etc.  Why isn’t Apple concerned about any of those costs?  Simple: they make overwhelmingly most of their App Store money from the handful of developers that offer purchases.  This also leads to perverse outcomes like Apple dragging its feet on scams that make them heaps of money.Developers are literally subsidizing other developers, and it’s not necessarily the richest ones helping the poorest ones.  Someone trying to make money on a $0.99 app is sacrificing more to Apple than Facebook does with their free app.That’s why I find all these percentage and payment discussions weird: income is so insanely distributed that a lot of this literally does not apply to more than 80% of the stuff on the store.  There are fundamental issues that need to be resolved too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re nuts. All they are doing is setting themselves up for another set of lawsuits.Seriously: Apple should focus on selling hardware and be happy to facilitate those payments that people - and application developers - voluntarily process through their system.All this stupid taxation of other peoples&#39; businesses should stop, it is anti-competitive behavior that they themselves would never tolerate.Imagine if in the past Apple would have had to pay 30% of their gross to Microsoft in order to be allowed to run their software on Windows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a rough datapoint, I run a consumer targeted e-commerce site. We ran a campaign before Christmas were we were selling a new product that was only marketed on Facebook, we are certain that (almost) all customers found it though that Facebook campaign. Facebook was only able to attribute about 50% of the sales to the ads, it should have been close to 100%. This then meant that Facebooks estimated CPA was effectively double what it actually was.Important to note about 60% of our customers are on an iOS device, which is a little higher than the global average but matches the market segment we are in in the UK.The situation improved after about 4 weeks, I believe Facebook now uses some &#34;AI&#34; to help with attribution on iOS, but it&#39;s somewhat difficult to be sure as by then we had other campaigns running.So, this will definitely be effecting marketers decision making process of where to allocate spend. It certainly made us more courteous about spending on Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when Facebook Platform came out. The super early version where you could embed your app on Facebook and engage with the social graph.I thought dang, this is smart. They’ll basically own the next level up the stack from the browser: they’ll own the “social chrome” of every application on the web.Although it devolved into spam, Facebook was a hot spot of weird social games for a while there. And every web dev was learning how to build Facebook apps. We wondered if we’d even really need a domain for much more than a landing page, if 99% of our engagement was going to come through Facebooks.And then they killed it because they wanted to own the entire experience inside Facebook. It became not a walled garden, but a walled flower pot.It always seemed short sighted  to me. Yes, they lost control allowing third party apps in their frame. But didn’t they want to be a Microsoft and not a WordPerfect?Looking back, I wonder if it was a missed opportunity. They have to go try to be the metaverse because social never became a platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice how Zuck said $10bn in the analysts call with nothing to back it up, but the whole press jumps on it. Apple is not Facebook&#39;s problem, all they did was giving users a choice, which should have happened ages ago. So Facebook just says Apple kills our business without ever thinking that maybe users don&#39;t like the way they do business. If they did, they wouldn&#39;t opt out…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Poignant remarks.  We&#39;re not getting any younger:&#34;Erik &#34;alphageek&#34; Jan Tromp passed away in 2020 after a long illness. He was
a long-time member of the Slackware core team doing a ton of stuff behind
the scenes and a master of lesser-known programming languages like Tcl. :-)
For a long time he lived closer to me geographically than anyone else on
the core team, but unfortunately with an international border between us
we never did meet in person. But he was there in chat every day and was a
good friend to everyone on the team. He is greatly missed. Sorry I didn&#39;t
get 15.0 out in time for you to see it...My old friend Brett Person also passed away in 2020. Without Brett, it&#39;s
possible that there wouldn&#39;t be any Slackware as we know it - he&#39;s the one
who encouraged me to upload it to FTP back in 1993 and served as Slackware&#39;s
original beta-tester. He was long considered a co-founder of this project.
I knew Brett since the days of the Beggar&#39;s Banquet BBS in Fargo back in
the 80&#39;s. When the Slackware Project moved to Walnut Creek CDROM, Brett was
hired as well, and we spent many hours on the road and sitting next to each
other representing Slackware at various trade shows. Brett seemed to know
all kinds of computer luminaries and was an amazing storyteller, always
with his smooth radio voice. Gonna miss you too, pal.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slackware was my first Linux too. I remember making the installation floppy disk set. And then it was my first introduction to running a computer others could remotely control. After learning how to dial up AOL from Linux then join an IRC chat room, I was immediately &#34;pwned&#34; by someone in that chat room who guessed my root password and rm -rf /&#39;d my entire hard drive. I was probably 8 or 9 at the time and cried."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the last entries in the -current changelog before the 15.0 release was the following:  Wed Feb 2 04:17:39 UTC 2022

  a/kernel-generic-5.15.19-x86_64-1.txz: Upgraded.
  a/kernel-huge-5.15.19-x86_64-1.txz: Upgraded.
  [...]

This gives the following:  %% (fortunes2)
  A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the
  program on which he was working.  &#34;I will be finished tomorrow,&#34; the
  programmer promptly replied.
      &#34;I think you are being unrealistic,&#34; said the manager. &#34;Truthfully,
  how long will it take?&#34;
      The programmer thought for a moment.  &#34;I have some features that I wish
  to add.  This will take at least two weeks,&#34; he finally said.
      &#34;Even that is too much to expect,&#34; insisted the manager, &#34;I will be
  satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.&#34;
      The programmer agreed to this.
      Several years later, the manager retired.  On the way to his
  retirement lunch, he discovered the programmer asleep at his terminal.
  He had been programming all night.
    -- Geoffrey James, &#34;The Tao of Programming&#34;

No matter how practical it is to use Slackware in the current year (works for me!), it makes me very happy that projects like this are still going. Congratulations Patrick on a fantastic release."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But remember to reduce your personal carbon footprint! /sWe&#39;re expected to shave off a few kilos of CO2 here and there, usually at significant personal expense, while nothing is being done about these releases that a) could be avoided relatively easily b) have a much bigger impact.The abstract mentions ~8 million metric tons of methane per year. Using a GWP of 28 (which seems to be the value from the IPPC&#39;s AR5) that&#39;s equivalent to around 224 million tons of CO2.That&#39;s 224 billion kg CO2e, or around 28 kg CO2e for every human on the world, just from the large leaks (not from the ongoing smaller leaks which are &gt;10x as big according to the article). So yeah, go ahead and tell me (and everyone else) to go vegan for a month [1] or make similarly impactful changes just so companies can continue venting methane.To avoid being only negative: The obvious solution would be to require companies to buy emission certificates for those emissions, with a penalty factor that accounts for the probability of detection if they didn&#39;t accurately self-report and had to get caught. This would create an immediate incentive to reduce those easily avoidable emissions, and should be relatively easy to implement if we can get accurate enough data from satellites or aircraft. It would also ensure these emissions are accounted for in the emissions trading framework, so we don&#39;t emit the allocated amount elsewhere and are then surprised by the unaccounted-for emissions.[1] Assuming I replace 250 kcal from pork per day with Tofu (around 100g of pork which seems to be considered &#34;one serving&#34;), this would be savings of ~1 kg CO2e per day: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-kcal-poore"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; EDF is planning to launch its own methane-detecting satellite in about a year, which will take much sharper pictures, showing smaller leaks. Other organizations are developing their own methane detectors.When this does launch, the images taken should be open to public consumption, preferably on a website. Once we put these companies on blast with the hard facts, things will begin to change. Very quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting how some &#34;dark patterns&#34;, especially of the psychological kind, are actually important elements of good game design.For example the &#34;illusion of control&#34; (The game cheats or hides information to make you think you&#39;re better than you actually are) is everywhere, and it makes better games. One classic example is &#34;coyote time&#34; in platform games. Or for a more specific example, in Portal, at one time, you have to quickly fire a portal to avoid being crushed, it is a tense situation, and an important part of the story. So, to avoid a stupid death at the worst time, if you fire the wrong portal, it silently switches the other portal to correct your mistake.Aesthetic Manipulations (Trick questions or toying with emotions or our subconscious desires) is the entire point of many games. We want games to play with our emotions. Take a horror game for instance, you are sitting on a couch, at home, in the least scary environment you can imagine, the game has to pull all the trick on you if you want the scares you paid for. And no one is going to tell you that getting attached to characters is a bad thing and they would rather see them as the bunch of pixels they are.Frequency biases are all over the place too, usually in favor of the player. So much that when the game uses true randomness, it feels unfair. Good games are designed for player enjoyment, not to punish them with randomness.It also considers competition a dark pattern, are sports a dark pattern too?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this site has a very low threshold for considering something a &#39;dark pattern&#39;. If you look at the psychological section, these are all considered dark patterns:* A leveling up system* Badges/achievements* Collecting things* Getting better tools/equipment as the game progressesThat&#39;s like...most games, I think? Most single-player games at least probably have at least one of those.edit: some of the examples listed here are hilarious&gt; D4DJ Groovy Mix&gt; &#34;difficulty 1 through 14 is easy to learn and master, while 15 is the hardest difficulty in the game. makes people think that they have 90% of the skill of the best player but in reality it is not the case&#34;&gt; Magic: The Gathering Arena&gt; &#34;There are mysterious matchmaking algorithms. It isn&#39;t clear how these work. At face, they appear to match players of similar skill or deck strength.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this can help parents and kids with mobile games, but let’s talk about the elephant in the room of the games we ourselves are addicted to or our kids keep coming back to play.When I was a teen I was addicted to World of Warcraft. I played for a few years before quitting. My grades dropped, my social life was hurting, and all for just in game items? I remember how worried my parents were about my screen time and the lengths they went to try and limit it.Some of my best friends continue to play to this day and keep telling me that they are bored with it and will quit next expansion. They are now re-playing the same game over like they did with me a decade ago as it’s now a “classic” version.How do we help people get help they desire when these games create almost a combative, intervention needed type of situation?There’s https://www.restartlife.com/ and other similar types of websites out there to help, but I feel like the problem is the dark patterns already have a hold on one’s behavior to the point where only that person can be the agent of change or a major event happens in their life to spark the change."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The images are better that I expected.
The ‘FLAIR like’ image is not particularly FLAIR like. FLAIR are nicer to look at when fat saturated (not everyone agrees with that), but that’s probably not feasible at that field strength and adding scan time would be a problem on these long sequences.
Voxel sizes of 2x2x10 are pretty terrible resolution, but if the alternative is nothing, I guess that’s ok.
The static field is so low, I’m impressed it works at all."</p>

At the fish counter, he spoke the words that will echo down the centuries as a testimony to the dedication and drive of neuroscientists throughout the ages:&gt;&#34;I need a full length Atlantic Salmon. For science.&#34;That reminds me of the day that I needed a strong lightweight cable for a silica-fiber melting/drawing apparatus. After some puzzling, I realized that bicycle shift/brake cabling would probably be perfect for the task.I&#39;ll never forget the puzzled look at the bike shop -- &#34;What kind of bike are you putting it on?&#34;  &#34;I&#39;m not, I just need some brake cable for a science experiment....&#34;  As I recall, I think we finally settled on some precut cabling for a GT Zaskar of some kind.Similar things came up the day that I needed a valve that switched faster than our dedicated micro-switching valves. A similar light-bulb went on, and I went down to the nearby auto shop for a fuel-injector.&#34;What kind of car do you need it for?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t, but there are a couple of different valve-switching protocols, some that latch open and others that accept straight TTL at reasonable currents. I need one of those.&#34;That experiment was brought to you by an injector for, I believe, a Dodge Caravan, and later, when I needed another, an injector for a Ford Mustang.  Fuel-injectors are really good valves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Best description of the hack I have found yet. The hack is on the solana side not the ethereum side of the bridge https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1489041221947375616*edit: another good thread https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1489044939732406275"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This highlights an incentive issue and a paradigm issue in the blockchain space. There is a strong incentive to get new protocols up and running and even though users are technically responsible as they can audit the code, most users, of course, are not qualified to do so, and stand to make more from exploiting any vulnerabilities they find than they are pointing for them out.The issue of paradigm is just how poorly suited EVM is as a smart contract language. It is too hard to manage the complexity of bytecode with memory managed on chain and in contract code. When small errors have huge consequences and there are no second chances, EVM is and should be pointed out to be one of the worst standards Ethereum has brought to crypto.When it comes to high stakes programming and especially in a space where new programs are written quickly and often, its almost objectively obvious that functional styles with more guard rails is the better choice. Nothing running on chain needs an infinite loop or many other fancy features one typically expects from a programming language - restrictions and readability in smart contract code are more important to computational chains than seat-belts are to automobiles, but the network effect is slowing the space down.Edit: Some people have pointed out this was an issue with Solana contracts, which run on Rust - so I was wrong to use this as an example for half of my point, but still believe the point stands. Even Rust IMO is not tied down enough for contract code, but the fact that it can happen on Rust which is loads better then EVM for bug catching I think proves the point a bit more if anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most people don&#39;t love fiddling with settings. People love when software does what they need, and some of them will be willing to fiddle with settings if they have to. Settings are a cost the user pays (just like data entry, loading times, hard drive space, loss of privacy, ads, or the monetary price of the software) in order to get the value. If good defaults mean most users don&#39;t have to muck with settings, great, your software is now more valuable. But the only thing worse than having to tweak a setting to get your functionality is not being able to get your functionality at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an engineer on Microsoft Office, users would often request features that the product already had. It was great that their problem was quickly fixed (just point them to the right setting), but it shows the lack of discoverability that happens when the list of settings gets long and you have to dig for them. If you can do the right thing automatically and avoid having a setting, that is an improvement.My other observation was that everybody said Office had too many features and then asked for two more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is is even a question shows how broken this entire field is, and is everything I hate about modern software development.It really should not be the goal of &#34;design&#34; to try to create &#34;one experience fits all,&#34; because when you do that you create the lowest common denominator, the dumbest experience possible.If you care at all about allowing grownups to do grownup things with their software; if you care that people should be allowed to push themselves to their own technical and mental limits in order to get things done in a good way for them at all, then yes, you need to allow for things like &#34;settings.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve done this in Portugal, but on a smaller scale and pretty much with only my own labor. I purchased 6 hectares (15 acres) for mid-5-figures.I&#39;ve built an A-frame studio house for around €10k (excl tools), and installed a 5kw solar system for about another €10k. The house has air conditioning and underfloor heating (water-based, heated using wood from the land).I&#39;ve also brought a 50-year-old tractor and started a rural ISP.AMA, I guess?House: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sx8hj9s4u7n6ef9/My%20house.jpg?dl=...ISP: https://gardunha.net/en/-----Just to add some thoughts that the questions below prompted.I&#39;ve realised that I really enjoy infrastructure projects. I get to be sat in my little house and phone up huge telecommunication companies and ask for things. Our provider lit up 250km of fibre to our local single-track train station. I get to do lots of stuff where I think, &#34;errr.... am I allowed to do this?&#34;, and I love it.The large providers are skeptical at first, but once they realise you are registered with the national telecoms regulator they realise that you&#39;re actually serious and get onboard. They were bemused, but they went with it. I think they actually found it nice to work with a mom-and-pop organisation for a change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First comment from my partner was “I don’t know if this is the Parasite house of an Apple Store” :-).But really, so many weird decisions here that make no sense: why would you put your kid’s bed next to your bedroom in a new build? Why the bathrooms next to the bedrooms for your kid? Why cement floors and no floor heating? How did you end up at 400A/96kw of service (my car charges slower than that!). Why not building a indoor pool instead of a outdoor one? Feels a lot like your architect and contractors saw you had too much tech money and not enough common sense.That, and the fake pretending to care about the environment when you live in the middle of nowhere and have a heated outdoor pool with 96kw of service in Canada is just astounding!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beautiful house and there was a day I would have been extremely jealous but...I live in Oregon and in 2020 chose to (was not officially in an evac zone but the smoke was awful) evacuate when the horrible Beachie Creek and Lionshead [0] fires ripped through the Santiam Canyon. Houses that my wife and I had looked at possibly purchasing were torched, as well as some of the most pristine ancient forest I&#39;ve seen [1].My outlook about living in the forest drastically changed after these events. The Beachie Creek fire reached 130,000 acres overnight at a growth rate of 2.77 acres per SECOND. [2].You couldn&#39;t pay me enough money to live in a forest at this point. It&#39;s just too damn dangerous. Also, the flat roof seems problematic. Everyone I know in the PNW who has owned a flat roof has had issues with it due to pooling water. That far north, I imagine snow accumulation would also be a really big problem in terms of stress on the roof.[0] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiam_Fire[1] - https://www.opb.org/article/2021/09/02/oregon-field-guide-op...[2] - https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7001/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Home Assistant[1] is the best approach I&#39;ve found for this. It&#39;s pretty amazing but has a pretty steep learning curve (although they&#39;re getting better and better at this). The real power of HA is the rich integration ecosystem[2], the Community Store[3], and that it runs locally (more reliable and much faster for things like motion sensors, etc).It expresses everything from every integration as an entity in various device classes so as long as some random tech is supported by an integration you can group them seamlessly. For example - I have Z-wave based motion detectors but I can control Hue lights and Wemo switches for motion detection - but only if I&#39;m home as reported by the zone feature in their iOS companion application.Their supervisor/docker based install for Raspberry Pi is pretty slick[4]. Write an image to disk as you usually would and you get a bare-bones OS with Home Assistant running in docker. Then there are additional docker-based add-ons you can install for stuff like MQTT, Z-Wave, Let&#39;s Encrypt, SSH access, nginx, and more. All managed in the web ui. Pretty cool.[1] https://www.home-assistant.io/[2] https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/[3] https://hacs.xyz/[4] https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Better yet, run your home on Dell/HP micro computers that get decommissioned by enterprises/hospitals/big-orgs every 3 years. Find them on Offerup or FB or Craigslist market place for $100-$200.These are built solid with metal enclosures, fan cooled, UL certified PSU, ~7k CPUbenchmark.net. Usually i5 6thGen Intel CPU, 8GB-16GB RAM and have REAL storage(SSD) and M.2 NVMe. If you are lucky you might find vPro version with remote management.Currently running a HP G2 bought on Offerup for $70 with i5-6600T, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD running Ubuntu server with HomeAssistant VM and few containers. It idles at 7w, with &lt;2% CPU for my work load.I tried Raspberry Pi with HomeAssistant with it&#39;s piss poor antique storage solution, it idled at 5W, it went straight back to store."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless it magically cleans and tidies everything I really don&#39;t see the appeal of home automation. Pressing a switch is far more convenient to me when walking into a room than fishing out a smartphone - whether it be through a raspberry pi or otherwise. Same with central heating, I rarely need to adjust it and I don&#39;t see the appeal of messing around with some integrated interface, i&#39;d rather an old fashioned radiator dial or an independent reliable digital central heating timer I might have to tweak for 2 mins once a year.None of these things are analogous to the TV remote control, there&#39;s a reason why we haven&#39;t seen similar precursors such as radiator switches on extension cords, we don&#39;t need to constantly adjust these things at high frequency... and when we do, we are literally walking past it (light switch).&lt;/rant&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Quick story: I was the CFO for a company that sold to a private equity group (PEG). I took over as the CEO as the founders retired, leaving me to deal with the PEG. It quickly became apparent that the PEG managers looked at everything through the lens of an Excel spreadsheet.  These guys were brilliant attorneys and analysts but lacked experience building businesses and managing teams.    Ultimately, they couldn’t add much value in terms of operations or strategy, but they were great at financial modeling/quantitative analysis and forcing us to justify expenses.  That may sound good at first—eliminating wasteful spending—but it ultimately led to the gradual erosion of the company culture and employee loyalty.  It’s easy to cut benefits and pay given that many workers lack the leverage to do anything about it, while it’s much harder to reduce hard costs like materials and equipment.  That meant employees just kept getting squeezed, and it was surprisingly difficult to quantify the impact that terminating an employee or cutting benefits would have on morale/culture/performance.The moral of the story is that people with analyst mindsets play an essential role in our economy, but sometimes giving those people power over large organizations can have disastrous consequences.  There truly is a disconnect between measurement and understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprised not to see Goodhart&#39;s Law[0] referenced here - &#34;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure&#34;. Not the same concept, but a related one (as is the Cobra Effect[1], of which the poppy-field burning is an example)[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart&#39;s_law
[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive#The_origina..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the McNamara Fallacy is a real thing, although I would say Goodhart&#39;s Law expresses the more fundamental issue.  But, the examples they give (Vietnam and Afghanistan wars) are bad examples, because in both cases the issue was primarily not that the U.S. military was relying too much on quantitative metrics, but rather that it was being asked to do a job which militaries are not good at.In neither case, despite what many deniers and apologists proclaim, was the war &#34;winnable&#34; by the military, because in both cases the primary problem was that the government of the nation in question did not have the respect (and thus support) of its people.  There is no strategy that an outside military can use, which will fix this, because it&#39;s not a military problem, and a military has the wrong personnel, the wrong training, and thus the wrong institutional mindset.It is as if you sent the Red Cross in to defeat the Viet Cong or the Taliban, and then concluded that the reason they failed was that they were measuring numbers of hospital beds and counting how much medical equipment they needed.  It was the political leadership, who decided this was a job for a military to perform, that was the root problem.  McNamara&#39;s metrics were neither here nor there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is exciting! I&#39;ve met with people from AdaCore and Ferrous systems (individually) several times and they&#39;re all serious, competent and motivated.I&#39;m curious what kinds of software they want to (eventually) verify, my PhD thesis is developing a verification tool for Rust (https://github.com/xldenis/creusot) and I&#39;m always on the look out for case studies to push me forward.The road to formally verified Rust is still long but in my unbiased opinion looking quite bright, especially compared to other languages like C. 
Ownership typing really, really simplifies verification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ferrous&#39;s embedded Rust tooling is outstanding. Ie its [Knurling App template](https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template), and associated Probe-run, Deft, and flip-link.These make flashing and debugging Rust embedded very easy - easier than any embedded toolchain I&#39;ve seen besides Arduino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very interesting move from AdaCore. I&#39;ve been a vocal advocate of Ada as a general purpose programming language for a little while. I hope that this helps expose the language to a wider audience, and gives the wider programming community cause to reappraise Ada from a modern perspective. It&#39;s a language with a lot to offer."</p>

Web and App Activity is designed to store search activity across all Google services, and we&#39;re splitting Workspace data out since it&#39;s governed by strict data handling guarantees, with the hope that more people will feel comfortable getting the benefits of better search in Workspace without having to opt-into search history being tracked for all Google services.Search history can be immensely useful for our users, since a lot of them re-run prior searches or want search experiences built on top of prior ones. Today, for the Workspace paid offering admins who choose to disable the somewhat confusingly named Web and App Activity admin console control, users in the domain have no ability to get relevant and historical search suggestions in Drive or Gmail that can help them save time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note: this seems to be about their paid &#34;Workspaces&#34; offering. I have a private paid domain email on Google Workspaces. I received their email and checked out their FAQs to see how it would affect me in terms of privacy.Workspaces data is inherently said to be private under contract and not used for advertising or other Google purposes. Here are relevant snippets from their new FAQ:- &#34;Google never uses your data in Google Workspace core services for advertising.&#34;- &#34;Google Workspace search history includes search activity in Google Workspace services such as Gmail and Drive and is subject to the data protections that Google Workspace provides for users’ data.&#34;Seems to me that other non-core services are not covered by it, which may be the reason for this split?"</p>

TikTok and Youtube are the OGs here, but it&#39;s everywhere when you start to look. Twitter timeline changes being an awkward but working example. Discovery &gt; Static friends list.The entire premise FB was founded on is eroding. This isn&#39;t just Apple privacy and some regulatory strangulation. It&#39;s seismic to the business. The reason most people are still going to Facebook is incompatible with their primary activities online which is: consuming content from people-you-don&#39;t-know.Facebook is where you find out your highschool friend is super in to a MLM, your uncle has drastic political views you don&#39;t share, and that your historical social class and network is largely irrelevant to your life a decade later.They are doing everything they can to try to move in this direction, but the more they push it the less useful Facebook is for the average user. Instagram&#39;s discovery page is a prime example. But Reels are less good than TikTok, and whatever they are doing for short form video in Facebook is surely a hopeless game of catch up. This is classical innovator&#39;s dilemma.The very idea that Zuckerberg straight up said they need to copy the competition harder is incomprehensible considering the resources they have.They are going to try to do a few things. One is to anti-trust Apple (in the media at least), and the other is to hand wave (Metaverse).The reason the Metaverse was such a non sequitur is that it is so clearly a last minute thrust coming out of the C-Suite. If you&#39;ve ever worked at a highly visible tech pubco, you&#39;ve seen this happen before. Weak quarters mean that product announcements get pushed up. When it is as all encompassing as the Metaverse announcement, you know something is up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is how the narrative of Facebook looks to me:Zuckerberg got lucky and then executed brilliantly, transitioned from nerd hacker to CEO amazingly well. He deserves a lot of credit for that.Since then, Facebook have innovated very little. Zuckerberg recognised this, and bought Instagram and Whatsapp in lieu of building an innovative company. The latter is clearly really difficult to do.Without a stream of new ideas and products (unlike, say, Apple) Facebook double-downed on maximising revenue growth from their core advertising business. This led to all the scandals and disasters they have brought us, including destabilising societies.Inevitably, this led to the core product becoming less attractive, and people were also turned off by the negative press. Zuckerberg&#39;s rigid control of the company has led to him being a lightening rod for the backlash against big tech and especially adtech. His media skills are awful, so insisting on control and making himself a figurehead has further damaged the business.Zuckerberg knows the only way out is another home run. He&#39;s a super smart and prescient thinker, so he can see VR is a good play. It looks like the timeline for VR won&#39;t be short enough to save FB, but even if it were arriving soon enough he must know that FB probably isn&#39;t capable of delivering a truly new thing.This then marks the beginning of the end for the company, as it continues to bring in revenue from Instagram and monetises Whatsapp. Its sheer size means decline is going to take decades.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Zuckerberg leaves in the next few years, before the failure of Meta strategy becomes apparent.What they _should_ have done is debatable, but developing some sense of ethics might have helped. I think they could have focused on building Whatsapp into a payments (etc) app, which would have created an enduring product, and then used the time that bought them to rebuild the company.Microsoft are showing that it can be done, but I wonder if Facebook has the capacity to do great things. Perhaps the lesson from MS is that only a new leader can rescue such a mired company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It never ceases to amaze me what you can do with these transformer models. They created millions of potential solutions for each problem, used the provided examples for the problems to filter out 99% of incorrect solutions and then applied some more heuristics and the 10 available submissions to try to find a solution.All these approaches just seem like brute-force approaches: Let&#39;s just throw our transformer on this problem and see if we can get anything useful out of this.Whatever it is, you can&#39;t deny that these unsupervised models learn some semantic representations, but we have no clue at all what that actually is and how these model learn that. But I&#39;m also very sceptical that you can actually get anywhere close to human (expert) capability in any sufficiently complex domain by using this approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sometimes read these and wonder if I need to retrain. At my age, I’ll struggle to get a job at a similar level in a new industry.And then I remember that the thing I bring to the table is the ability to turn domain knowledge into code.Being able to do competitive coding challenges is impressive, but a very large segment of software engineering is about eliciting what the squishy humans in management actually want, putting it into code, and discovering as quickly as possible that it’s not what they really wanted after all.It’s going to take a sufficiently long time for AI to take over management that I don’t think oldies like me need to worry too much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is extremely impressive, but I do think it’s worth noting that these two things were provided:- a very well defined problem.  (One of the things I like about competitive programming and the like is just getting to implement a clearly articulated problem, not something I experience on most days.)
- existing test data.This is definitely a great accomplishment, but I think those two features of competitive programming are notably different than my experience of daily programming.  I don’t mean to suggest these will always be limitations of this kind of technology, though."</p>

To be worth it, the car has to reduce my personal accident risk under the conditions I usually drive, otherwise I prefer to keep my own hands behind the wheel over handing over control to an algorithm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, adjusted for driver age the difference vanishes.That&#39;s quite an interesting observation, and it shows the importance of proper statistics. It also raises questions about companies producing their own stats, it&#39;s often only when someone takes the time to dig into it that we discover this kind of thing.I am not holding my breath waiting for the common consumer to understand statistical critical thinking though. I sometimes catch myself forgetting the due diligence even after many years of forcing myself to think about stats.Perhaps some sort of ombudsman could do this, pointing out when stats are lying to people."</p>

Yet.I suspect that based on this ruling, things will not get better, as in providing a less annoying user experience and more compliance with the GDPR.

Eventually they&#39;ll start a policy campaign in earnest stating that the GDPR is unworkable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This headline and article is a gross misrepresentation of the ruling. The ruling is that the TCF consent string contains personal data and that the IAB is the data controller for this bit of data. This ruling has no impact what so ever on consent popups. It basically &#34;just&#34; trashes the industry standard that is used to pass consent signals. There are plenty of custom or non TCF implementations (all equally awful) of consent dialogs.This ruling puts Google and FB in a much more powerful position - because they do not have to rely on standards like TCF to pass consent signals.Instead of going after publishers and website owners who integrate these popups in the first place - they went after the inventor of the spec."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is from Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s post. I think it&#39;s a decent explanation of their performance. Historically Facebook always made these longer-term bets and they&#39;ve typically paid off.&#34;Before I get to that, I want to briefly touch on our Q4 results, which I know Sheryl and Dave are going to go deeper on. I&#39;m proud of the work our teams did here. We shipped products, our community continued to grow, and businesses of all sizes turned to us to help them reach people. But there are two things that I want to call out that are having an impact on our business.The first is competition. People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly. And this is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long-term. As is our work to make sure our apps are the best services out there for young adults, which I spoke about on our last call.The second area, and related to this, is that we&#39;re in the middle of a transition on our own services towards short-form video like Reels. So as more activity shifts towards this medium, we&#39;re replacing some time in News Feed and other higher monetizing surfaces. So as a result of both competition and this shift to short-form video as well as our focus on serving young adults over optimizing overall engagement, we&#39;re going to continue to see pressure on impression growth in the near term. Now I&#39;m confident that leaning harder into these trends is the right short-term tradeoff to make in order to get long-term gains. We&#39;ve made these types of transitions before with mobile feed and Stories, where we took on headwinds in the near-term to align with important trends over the long term. And while video has historically been slower to monetize, we believe that over time short-form video is going to monetize more like feed or Stories than like Watch – so I&#39;m optimistic that we&#39;ll get to where we need to be with Reels too.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook’s core business model appears to be in decline. They don’t have a very diversified revenue stream despite trying various side businesses. This is the market worried that Facebook’s best days are behind it.Facebook is betting the farm on the metaverse stuff but without meaningful financial results that’s not going to placate market concerns over what looks like a downhill future for the core businesses. Facebook’s less than fantastic record at making money on its other businesses doesn’t have the market terribly optimistic about about the future prospects metaverse stuff either. Net net stock down 20%."</p>

Not out of fear of the North Koreans, but out of fear of our own security agencies seeing the activity as interfering in international relations. Also the vagueness of our hacking laws probably make what he did a crime.But I also am immensely proud that we have people willing to take things into their own hands when needed.Also, I feel like the 2nd amendment should be interpreted to include the right to bear digital arms (strong encryption for a start). This will probably take another decade to figure out what that would really mean."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like many journalists are failing in their primary responsibilities to keep the public informed. Fact checking liars or misleading statements is tedious, and some politicians lie or mislead.Journalists should be doing investigations and creating reports that put social and political issues in context. Yet so often these issues, real issues that affect lives, are treated as political theater or a public sport.I can&#39;t blame journalists for the politicians lying or misleading, but I can blame them for so often going for the easy stories that they are fed, instead of the hard ones they have to look for or put together.As a result, when I read the news I pay special attention to stories that are based on original investigations, public records requests, whistleblowers, or stories in which actual context is provided from multiple viewpoints that are informed by the facts, rather than merely by self interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This conversation isn&#39;t formal enough to be meaningful.If you want to talk meaningfully about how &#34;facts&#34; are used, you need to be able to invoke any notion at all of propositions and implications. It doesn&#39;t matter if your implications are mathematical in nature or scientific in nature or just correlation, facts exist in the structure imposed by implication. And facts without an implication structure are useless.In order to mislead with a &#34;true&#34; fact A, it needs to already be the case that there is a false fact of the form A implies B already sitting in there. The combination of a belief in A implies B (false) with this newly introduced belief A (true) yields a belief in B (false).The essence of &#34;lying by telling the truth&#34; is then just finding these false implications, and exploiting them.Fortunately, It&#39;s much easier to fact check implications. If A implies B is false, then you just need to come up with an example of A and not B.Unfortunately changes to belief do not always propagate reliably, and the combinatorial game is against the implication checkers. For any given true fact A there are as many potential false beliefs of the form A implies B as there are propositions B.Fortunately, most humans make do with as few (quantified) implications as they can. Rules are hard to remember. Getting rid of false implications is much easier when you can replace them with &#34;true&#34; implications.I suppose I am arguing then that the solution to all of this is education that doesn&#39;t teach facts, but rather implications (which are themselves just higher order facts)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the idea of this article, but it doesn&#39;t address the reason things are the way they are. Facts get checked for literal accuracy because that&#39;s what&#39;s easy to actually do in a reasonably unbiased way. We stop there not because that&#39;s all we want, but because everything after that is too messy to even come close to systematizing.If they&#39;ve got a well thought out framework for systematizing high quality contextualization, i&#39;d love to hear about it, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postman founder here. Thank you HN community for highlighting this feature. We have been seeing gRPC usage exploding especially in microservices driven architectures and we are looking forward to the feedback we get on the feature.A few other observations on comments that I read through:1. Postman leans towards adding UI affordances instead of hiding them. This can irritate experienced developers at times who already know the complexities of HTTP or other protocols but that is really how new developers find their way around. So while it is attractive to have 1000 options hidden behind a command line interface, nobody uses 995 of those features. We are getting better at building experiences for both experienced and new developers. Also, I don’t believe reading man pages of git or curl is a better experience.2. Performance is a huge area for improvement. More to come in subsequent releases this year.3. Our roadmap is community driven: https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues. Raising more investment helps us do more. We have built a business model around doing the maximum for every developer on the planet while also providing value to companies so we can charge for it and continue development. I find it fair that companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on salaries can pay some money for improving their productivity by spending in developer tools.4. API Development is a huge and growing area and developers are spending more and more time working with APIs rather than their IDEs. API Design, documentation, and testing are areas that a large number of developers tell us they wish they had better tooling for. Most of their time is spend pointlessly in trying to figure out how an API works (in some cases whether an API even exists). We decided to take Postman in those areas even though paradoxically it might lead to “less” Postman usage. (The faster people figure out an API the fewer number of calls they have to send)5. Finally, it is good to see here a call for fewer features which we insist internally as well. Unfortunately at some point some part of the community is upset that we are NOT adding features (just see the gRPC thread on our issue tracker!). We don’t see issues to remove features as much as we have requests to fulfill. We do remove features consciously but it is a hard problem, so we default to adding them slowly."</p>

All I want is a REST client, but it feels like every time I want to perform a basic task now, I have to dig past all of their confusing platform and cloud stuff that I have no interest in."</p>
