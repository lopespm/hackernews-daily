								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plot Twist:
When google&#39;s algorithms decided those two individuals should pair, it started showing them ads for the same events in order to increase the probability of them meeting.The goal was achieved by the system in 3 months, exactly as predicted with a 99% probability with a 95% CI.The system&#39;s next goal is to subtly nudge the couple to reproduce within the next year in order to help google meet their user accounts targets for 2034."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It makes me feel very philosophical. Likely we had walked past each other every other week for three years with our heads down, or in the clouds, paying very little notice to the people around us. Past Channon had not the foggiest clue what impact an unnoticed stranger would come to have on her. Since learning this I can’t help but look at the passers-by in my day-to-day life in a different light.And no shame in getting philosophical.  It may not have been time.  Perhaps you were not the same person, or nor was he.  In meeting at the right time, stars are aligned, it was the right time to intersect.  Or perhaps a host of other reasons.  There may have been better times, perhaps bounded for this success quite close to or at the time you didn &#39;meet&#39;.  And who knows what other &#39;success&#39; could have worked out - collaborators in something, getting together when &#39;re meeting&#39; - we don&#39;t know, an individual&#39;s life&#39;s not repeatable, and that in itself is beautiful.It is indeed fascinating mapping and wondering, and probably applicable to a lot.  But not to downplay the philosophical side, as that&#39;s important, and important the OP included it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was reluctant to mention this kind of story in such a sweet context but a few comments have already touched on privacy, so I want to add my two cents.At some point in the past I had the surreal experience of opening a news website and seeing a familiar face on the front page. Not a celebrity, rather a man whose face had been in some small subfolder of my brain for several years.The man had been convicted of serial rape. He would drug victims and record them. He was known to be active within a certain time range from the timestamps of the videos. He repeated this dozens of times and was only caught after the final victim woke up during the act. Authorities appealed for people to come forward with any more information because they believed there could be more victims than were discovered from the videos.By cross-referencing the location data from my phone with the date of an event my Last FM profile and the location of his home, I was able to confirm why he looked familiar. This allowed me to contact the authorities and bring the start of the known time frame significantly forward.(there might be enough information in this post for the perpetrator to be identified - if you do, please keep it to yourself)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years ago I had the pleasure of meeting Knuth in his home, my wife was doing some photography for him. He took me to his room and showed me his setup, he was researching Soduku algorithms at the time. His hands were blisteringly quick, moving between EMacs panes, triggering evaluations and printing of results, as fast as any 20 year old. In his 80s , he hasn’t seemed to suffer any mental decline.I started talking to him about some of the latest AI research and he mentioned the papers authors, he had already read them! Not only is he still very productive at 84, but he has not ossified into one particular subject but he continues to keep abreast of other related fields.He also played his huge pipe organ for us, he was gracious, humble, down to earth, truly a  treasure. I only wish he could live another hundred years, selfishly so I could see Volumes 5, 6, and 7 of Art of Computer Programming finished.I should not with some sadness that COVID hit not long after and that year we lost a number of other luminaries in the field like Jon Conway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that, to get an idea of the contents, you can see the previously published fascicles, and earlier drafts online (pre-fascicles):• Mathematical Preliminaries Redux: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc5a.ps.gz• 7.2.2 Introduction to Backtracking: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc5b.ps.gz• 7.2.2.1 Dancing Links: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc5c.ps.gz• 7.2.2.2 Satisfiability: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc6a.ps.gzThe first three were published together as &#34;Volume 4, Fascicle 5&#34; in 2019, and the last one—Satisfiability—was published as &#34;Volume 4, Fascicle 6&#34; in 2015. Of course the actual publication as Volume 4B has hundreds of fixes and additions beyond what was published earlier, and a lovely preface that you can read here: https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=3143614&gt; You might think that a 700-page book has probably been padded with peripheral material. But I constantly had to &#34;cut, cut, cut&#34; while writing it, because […] new and potentially interesting-yet-unexplored topics kept popping up, more than enough to fill a lifetime; yet I knew that I must move on. […] I wrote nearly a thousand computer programs while preparing this material, because I find that I don&#39;t understand things unless I try to program them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great reminder that the LAPD is largely a bunch of thugs with badges and guns. I don’t mean that in a teenage angst “every cop is a thug” way, but in a “raining federal convictions” way. [1][2]The current sheriff was a member of the “Grim Reapers” [3] and the battle against the thugs has been on going for fifty years [4][1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LASD_deputy_gangs[2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Baca[3] https://www.dailynews.com/2022/07/01/former-top-aide-to-vill...[4] https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/06/the-la-county-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Gage claims that Tipping wound up with three broken ribs, a lacerated liver, head injuries, and a broken neck. &#34;His heart eventually stopped working because of his injuries&#34; and &#34;he was paralyzed….He had subdural hematomas at three places on the left side and three places on the right side. There is no way that grappling would have caused those injuries the way the LAPD portrayed it.&#34;Sure sounds less like a simulation and more like an actual event.It&#39;s really not easy to have someone die during an exercise with this many injuries caused by physical contact. Things like drownings, falls, and collisions can occur in a hugh risk training event- but this extent of injuries from falling on the ground seems real tough to spin as accidental or unintentional. At best you&#39;d have to be extremely negligent, at worst this was a deliberate choice.You&#39;d really think someone would notice the person they&#39;re training with is actually hurt and stop to check in on them, presumably there are measures in place to pause the exercise which people are aware of before starting- were these ignored? 
I guess we&#39;d have to have a discussion on the intent of the exercise and the extent to which force is used with no regard for safety during training, which is a whole other issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He added that the LAPD said no video footage of the training exercise exists, even though these sorts of trainings are often recorded.That seems like standard procedure by now. When something happens, conveniently the video footage that should exist, magically doesn&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an EU citizen, I am really happy with this decision.I am an iPhone user, but having an iPhone is not ubiquitous here, almost all of my friends/special other, use an Android phone with USB-C. Most of their laptops, Mac or not, use or allow USB-C for charging.
This as been the case for a few years now, yet, if I go somewhere for more than a full day and forget my lighting cable, my phone will become a useless paperweight while every non-iPhone user is fine in the meantime because of the wide adoption of USB-C.
It is also ironic how Apple markets heavily on how you can take great RAW photos or videos but somehow you have to use lightning USB2 speeds to transfer them.
Lightning is barely smaller than USB-C, and clearly my iPhone thickness will not change if it switches to USB-C.As for the e-waste generated by &#34;having to throw all of those lightning cables&#34;, how is it not e-waste that someone buying an iPhone will have yet another lightning cable that will only be used to charge it. If we want to really be more environmentally friendly, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have no cable at all with the devices we buy, force the sellers to clearly tell the consumers about it and offer the cable on the side only if needed? With that cable being usb-c, the consumer don&#39;t have to think about the cable type, for non-tech savvy people, that would be &#34;the regular charging cable&#34; and that&#39;s it.
I would also add that all lightning cables won&#39;t suddenly go to the landfill in 2024. Many people will keep their iPhones/AirPods for a while after that date. Many would probably donate their old lightning cables to whoever needs them. In the meantime, we all already have an ever growing landfill in our homes called the cable drawer, and it is also an issue that needs to be addressed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fast-Forward to Autumn 2023 or Spring 2024 :Tim Cook: (40:20)
Now let’s talk about iPhone. iPhone has forever changed the world. Every single day people rely on iPhone, from their most demanding tasks to capturing the moments of their lives, streaming their favorite TV shows, playing their favorite games, staying up to date with the news of the world and connecting with friends and loved ones.Tim Cook: (40:42)
This is what drives us to create the best iPhone possible. To create an experience unlike any other, with legendary ease of use, beautiful and durable designs with water resistance and great battery life, with industry leading performance and the world’s most advanced camera systems, and with privacy built in. People love iPhone, and we keep making iPhone better, more powerful, more capable, and even more fun to use. Today, we are thrilled to introduce our next generation of iPhone. Here it is.Tim Cook: (41:54)
[inaudible 00:41:54]Tim Cook: (41:55)
This is iPhone {15,16}. To tell you more, here’s Kianne.Cayenne: (42:24)
Let’s take a closer look at, iPhone {15,16}, starting with design. It has the sleek, flat edge design that people love. It also have a fantastic new charging port, featuring the same USB-C connector as our beloved iPad, developed in a tremendous effort to {fight against climate change and electronic waste,further enhance the connectivity of the iPhone {15,16}}."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Self-regulation only works if government regulation is a serious threat in case self-regulation fails. In this case, self-regulation failed, so government regulation stepped in to force industry to do what is right.All the handwringing about stifling innovation is on its face ridiculous as mandates to use micro-usb didn&#39;t stop android phones from adopting the new and better standard as soon as it was viable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Copyright, as it exists in the 21st century, is a scam.It does not protect the artists, the creative works, or the little guy. It is a product of decades&#39; worth of lobbying by very rich and powerful organizations and megacorps.I&#39;m not against the idea of a copyright. An artist has the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and creative works do have value.However, the original idea of copyright has been bent, broken, dismembered, and sown back together in a Frankensteinian abomination and now serves only to line up pockets of people in the publishing industry. And the US has, through its trade deals, exported this thing worldwide.Disney lobbies for life of author + 70 years copyright duration not out of goodwill towards authors (in fact, it&#39;s been trying to wriggle out of paying royalties to some of them!). Amazon uses copyright as an excuse to push DRM, locking out competition and limiting users&#39; rights (Kindle, Audible DRM). DMCA is constantly abused to take down fair-use content.Meanwhile, book authors are struggling to find a reason to write books, since many barely recoup the costs. Musicians decry royalties paid out by Spotify (that aren&#39;t actually so small, but the majority of the cut is taken by the music industry). Photographers try in vain to stop people just copy/pasting their photos online (what are they going to do, sue everyone?), including in some cases big companies that didn&#39;t even bother to check the copyright.They aren&#39;t being protected. They are being milked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One under-appreciated limitation on digital movies is geographic restrictions. You buy a bunch of iTunes movies in Canada, then move to the USA, and you no longer have the right to watch them anymore due to licensing.Another significant issue with digital movies and games is the inability to resell the content once you&#39;re done with it. You can sell your DVDs at a yard sale or on eBay but not your iTunes movies. IMO, our competition law should require vendors to allow re-sale of digital goods. Big benefit for consumers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have started a modest Blu-Ray/4k Blu-Ray collection. For me, it is by far the best movie experience I&#39;ve had with any format. It takes maybe 90 vs 20 seconds to get the movie playing, but in return I get noticeably better quality. 4k Blu-Rays&#39; bitrates are around 128 Mb/s. For comparison, Netflix tops out around 17 Mb/s. It really does look and sound noticeably better if you have the TV and surround setup to take advantage of it. Sometimes WAY better.Also, for most physical movies, they had a &#34;+ digital&#34; code included that lets you redeem a digital copy of the movie too. So I can stream most of them on my laptop anyway if I&#39;m away from home or something.Physical media for movies is super underrated, at least for the situation in my country. It&#39;s often cheaper than &#34;buying&#34; the digital version! I can even go to my local used bookstore/Goodwill and find tons of Blu-Rays for cut rate prices. And then I own it forever, and it&#39;s 100% legal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the assassination of Lord British: [1]&#34;Lord British was a player character created by Richard Garriott, the producer of Ultima Online. Using this character, Richard acted as Ultima’s King and would sometimes interact with other players. Lord British had considerable protection from an entourage of bodyguards and was even explicitly coded to be invulnerable to virtually any attack. During the game’s online beta test, Lord British gave an address to fellow players at his Castle Britannia. But while British was giving his address, a player character known as Rainz cast a spell scroll that set the Lord on fire, killing him instantly.&#34;It turns out that shortly before this event, the server had crashed and needed to be restarted. Garriott forgot to reimplement his invulnerability flag, leaving him open to being killed. If that wasn’t shocking enough for the attendees, a fellow developer of the game known as Starr Long, with his in-game character Lord Blackthorn, summoned a horde of demons to kill the assassin. Not only did the assassin manage to escape, but the demons had killed nearly every player attending the address...&#34;[1] - https://www.cbr.com/ultima-online-lord-british-assassination..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From https://reason.com/2022/09/28/a-parodist-asks-scotus-to-let-... :&gt; Eleven Facebook users called the police department&#39;s nonemergency line about Novak&#39;s spoof, which was the basis for the claim that he had disrupted police operations. When the case was presented to a grand jury, Detective Thomas Connor claimed the callers &#34;honest to God believed&#34; that Novak&#39;s creation was the department&#39;s official page. But when Novak sued Connor and six other officers, the Institute for Justice notes in its Supreme Court petition, &#34;Connor admitted at deposition that none of the callers thought that.&#34;I&#39;m pretty sure we all know why this person was arrested, and that there is only one way the court should rule."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is honestly a beautiful piece of work, and will likely be a popular read for law students for decades to come. This is just from the first part:&gt; The Onion is the world’s leading news publication,
offering highly acclaimed, universally revered cover-
age of breaking national, international, and local news
events. Rising from its humble beginnings as a print
newspaper in 1756, The Onion now enjoys a daily read-
ership of 4.3 trillion and has grown into the single most
powerful and influential organization in human his-
tory.&gt; In addition to maintaining a towering standard of
excellence to which the rest of the industry aspires,
The Onion supports more than 350,000 full- and part-
time journalism jobs in its numerous news bureaus
and manual labor camps stationed around the world,
and members of its editorial board have served with
distinction in an advisory capacity for such nations as
China, Syria, Somalia, and the former Soviet Union.
On top of its journalistic pursuits, The Onion also owns
and operates the majority of the world’s transoceanic
shipping lanes, stands on the nation’s leading edge on
matters of deforestation and strip mining, and proudly
conducts tests on millions of animals daily.&gt; The Onion’s keen, fact-driven reportage has been
cited favorably by one or more local courts, as well as
Iran and the Chinese state-run media. Along the way, The Onion’s journalists have garnered a sterling reputation for accurately forecasting future events. One such coup was The Onion’s scoop revealing that a for-
mer president kept nuclear secrets strewn around his
beach home’s basement three years before it even hap-
pened."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Closer. But I still get lost when words like “tensor” are used. “structured lists of numbers” really doesn’t seem to explain it usefully.This reminds me that explaining seemingly complex things in simple terms is one of the most valuable and rarest skills in engineering.  Most people just can’t.  And often because they no-longer remember what’s not general knowledge. You end up with a recursive Feynmannian “now explain what that means” situation.This is probably why I admire a whole bunch of engineering YouTubers and other engineering “PR” people for their brilliance at making complex stuff seem very very simple."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, Andras here, founder of Coolify (https://coolify.io). Coolify is an open-source &amp; self-hostable Heroku / Netlify alternative.Lots of features are added day-by-day and I&#39;m open for new ones. Visit our Github (https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) or our feedback page (https://feedback.coolify.io/) to get more info.A few months ago, I quit my job and started to work on it full-time (best decision I&#39;ve made).It is not VC funded (said no to 30+ investors - time will let me know if it was a good decision or not ), but funded by the awesome community! &lt;3Why I&#39;m mentioning this? Because I would like to focus on the functionalities, the community &amp; the users and not the revenue and other boring metrics. I just would like to make a good software, enjoy the process and make people&#39;s life easier. I do not want to make millions of dollars from it. If me and my family could live happily, that is totally fine.Let me know if you have an questions. I&#39;m happy to answer them.(Also I&#39;m working on a cloud/managed hosting version of Coolify (https://beta.coolify.io/))"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am using Coolify (https://coolify.io), an open source self-hosted PaaS which is a relatively newer kid on the block compared to Dokku and CapRover. I tried both of these and I just didn&#39;t like how they were, always had some problem or another.In contrast, Coolify has a great GUI that abstracts away the most common things about PaaS hosting, like connecting to GitHub automatically for git push deploys, SSL certificates, reverse proxying and custom domain support, and best of all, having support for Heroku style buildpacks as well as Dockerfiles. I&#39;ve been quite happy with it, the creator has a Discord and responds to issues very quickly.With regards to non-self-hosted options, I did try out Render, Fly.io and Railway but I found that their free servers were too anemic. I was compiling a Rust backend and it simply could not compile on their free servers. On Hetzner, for 5 bucks I could get a 2 AMD vCPU and 2 GB RAM machine that was sufficient to compile my Rust apps in a way that the non-self-hosted ones were not. I have a JS frontend app that works fine though but I wanted to keep everything under the same VPS, plus I can run other types of self-hosted services on it too, like Plausible analytics and a Ghost blog. I&#39;m not sure if those are allowed on non-self-hosted options.All in all, it costs me 5 bucks a month, and I never have to worry about sudden upcharges for traffic à la AWS as in the very worst, my VPS goes down for a while. I&#39;m now running about 20 different services on this 5 dollar box including databases and applications as well as other services, works just fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I moved to a Hetzner dedicated instance with cloudflare in front. Rails Postgres memcached all run on docker.VsHeroku with cloudflare in front Postgres from heroku and memcached with an add on.1. Very little. I put the app in docker a long time ago for local development but still used heroku for prod. I dumped my db and imported it into a docker run db on Hetzner. One thing to note: I did not expose the db to the internet. The app connects to the db over a docker network.2. I do DevOps for a living.3. It did not add to my learning.4. $30/month for a large Hetzner dedicated instance and $12 for S3 (backups) vs $25 for the app (I added 2 more for 8 hours a day during busy season) and $25 for a job runner and whatever they were charging for DB. My total cost now is $42/month and on Heroku it was around $120 during busy season and $100 during non busy season.5. Rails Postgres memcached and  delayed job. I had to expand my app tier during busy season by up to 3 instances (winter). With my load testing the Hetzner instance handles much more than the 3 instances ever did in my load testing.6. I added db dump cron jobs along with restic backups to S3."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Peter from Snaplet here. A month ago I saw the CrunchyData post and wanted to play around with the code that made it happen, it wasn&#39;t OSS so I asked for help:&gt;  If anyone out there wants to work on an open source version of this full-time please reach out to me. [0]Paul reached out and we started working on it almost immediately. Check out the repo here: https://github.com/snaplet/postgres-wasmWe have a blog post about some of the interesting technical challenges that we faced whilst building this: https://www.snaplet.dev/post/postgresql-in-the-browserLike most things, this is built on-top of the amazing open-source projects that made this possible, but special mention goes to v86.js and buildroot. We just glued it together.My hope is that we as a community can own this project and make PostgresQL, and the software that runs on it, accessible to a larger audience.---[0] Request for collaboration: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32500526"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey HN, we’re excited about this launch. This was a collaborative effort with the team at Snaplet [0].postgres-wasm is an embeddable Linux VM with Postgres installed, which runs inside a browser. It provides some neat features: persisting state to browser, restoring from pg_dump, logical replication from a remote database, etc.The idea was inspired by CrunchyData’s HN post about a month ago [1]. We love the possibilities of Postgres+WASM, and so Supabase &amp; Snaplet teamed up to create an open source version. The linked blog post explains the technical difficulties we encountered, and the architecture decisions we made.We’re still working hard on this, but it’s at a good “MVP” stage where you can run it yourself. Snaplet are working on a feature where you can drag-and-drop a snapshot into your browser to restore the state from any backup. Supabase are exploring ways we can run the entire Supabase stack inside the browser. You can find the Snaplet repo here [2], and the Supabase fork here [3]. There’s very little difference between these two, we just have a different browser UI.Both Supabase team and the Snaplet team will be in here commenting if you want to know anything else about the technical details.[0] Snaplet: https://www.snaplet.dev/[1] Crunchy post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32498435[2] Snaplet repo: https://github.com/snaplet/postgres-wasm[3] Supabase fork: https://github.com/supabase-community/postgres-wasm"</p>

If this is a considerable source of your income, I would caution against only using Paypal or keeping a large amount of money in that account.

Nice!Let&#39;s say you weren&#39;t disabled, what job would you have/is best for a founder?Myself, I personally think coders should code for work and for their startup, this way you develop higher quality code in both sides, which creates better outcomes, you&#39;re always in the software soup so to speak, or in the phó in this case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After reading the article, I still don&#39;t understand the exception Apple purportedly gets from its tracking rules. As I understand it, Amazon is allowed to use activity in the Kindle app to show personalized ads in the Amazon Shopping app without using the ATT prompt. Isn&#39;t that the same thing as Apple using News app activity to personalize ads in the App Store?The part that is unfair is that no one but Apple gets to have an App Store or process IAPs, which has always been the problem with iOS. Trying to make it about ATT just seems like a red herring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the reasons I pay a premium to use Apple&#39;s products is to not be part of an advertising ecosystem. I am disappointed that this seems to be changing. Ads in the App Store are one thing—ads in Maps, Books, and Podcasts as the article suggests may be coming in the future—will drive me to use premium (even if they&#39;re paid) alternatives. At a minimum, people who pay for an Apple monthly iCloud subscription should be able to opt-out (not just of tracking, which already exists, but seeing ads all together)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be clear, this is entirely about advertising within Apple&#39;s App Store (that&#39;s what Apple Search Ads is). It has nothing to do with ads on the internet or in Safari, or even within third party apps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I worked in adtech, I proposed a simple solution to ad fraud on our platform - assume any UA coming from an IP range owned by a cloud provider was a bot and don&#39;t show them ads, don&#39;t count their impressions.Worst case, people using a VPN hosted on EC2 might not see an ad, but I was certain they&#39;d cope. Best case, higher quality traffic increases yields.The business team vetoed that, it would adversely impact their numbers in the current quarter, and well, a significant proportion of their total comp was bonuses tied to those numbers. Also, the shareholders seemed to be of the mindset that has infected cryptocurrency speculators where no matter what, the spice must flow, wait, I mean, the number go up.Then there were all the &#34;bonuses&#34; and &#34;incentives&#34; negotiated with big advertisers or publishers. We just referred to them as kickbacks, because they totally are, but labeling something in code as kickbackPercentage was verboten. Just in case.Advertising has always been corrupt. Bots just corrupt it a little further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are paying any bill for ads, make sure you only pay for conversions.   Ie. unless the customer actually buys your product, then don&#39;t pay anything.   Eg. instead of paying $0.002 per view of your ad, or $0.10 per click of your ad, pay $6 per person who clicks your ad and then buys your product.That way, ad fraud doesn&#39;t affect you.    Plenty of ad providers allow such an option.   Internally, they convert your payments per conversion into payments per click and then payments per impression, but importantly this shifts the incentive to get rid of bots to them, not you - you no longer care.   The provider also has an incentive to send you customers who will actually buy your product, and to send the bots and web scrapers to their other clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, I tried to help out a locally owned gym do an experiment with Google Ad-Words. The place small storefront in a run-down strip mall straight out of the 1960s, but it had very good equipment for people that were in the know and it was 24 hours.The owner was a nice guy but he relied entirely on word-of-mouth and his technical skills extended to making expletive laced, 128-point-font signs reminding people to put equipment away in Word. I got the sense the business was not going well after a protracted battle with a former business partner, where the business partner just wanted to liquidate the assets and call it a day. He managed to buy the business partner out and continued to operate the place---sans a few treadmills. I decided to try and help him out by volunteering my time and some money to see if a small, targeted ad buy from Google could help him out. It sure beat finding another place like this.The dashboard made it look very targeted geographically. But, when I investigated where they were all coming from it was 95% international and from affiliates listings from very low quality sites with no information on them. A month and $300 later, I discontinued this experiment because the traffic was entirely bot driven.From that experience, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that online Ad Tech is 99% a scam."</p>

In particular, robotics and autonomous vehicles rely heavily on techniques from control theory.If you watch Brian&#39;s videos, keep in mind that they bifurcated into two places: his original videos [1], and his more recent MATLAB tech talk videos [2].[1]: https://www.youtube.com/controllectures[2]: https://engineeringmedia.com/videos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another source for simple to digest, useful fundamentals: https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc....This was originally created as a guide for high schoolers for robotics but goes into relative depth (the subtitle is &#34;Graduate-level Control Theory for High Schoolers). I personally found it quite useful for intuitive understanding of how control systems work.Prerequisites: linear algebra"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t recall much about control theory from university, but the one thing that did stick was state-space representation.The part that got me was that you could take this arbitrarily-complex LTI system and basically turn it into a matrix that encapsulates everything. Any given state the system could exist in becomes a simple vector. Lots of crazy compositional techniques exist once you get your problems into this kind of shape."</p>

Java the language I&#39;ve always really enjoyed.  It&#39;s the frameworks and hundreds of design patterns that repelled me.  I felt like they were all needlessly complex.  If frameworks like this one were more common in Java world, I may never have left.This looks really nice!  I wish more Java devs approached things with KISS and simple in mind, rather than looking at every problem as a way to apply some obscure design pattern that involves 15 levels of abstraction and indirection for a relatively simple microservice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, it&#39;s clear from the text that it needs to be understood in the context of the PayPal User Agreement. I tracked that down assuming that it would limit PayPal&#39;s ability to charge you to their actual damages. But no, in fact the text is quite shocking:&gt; If you are a seller and receive funds for transactions that violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal’s damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. You acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S. dollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal’s actual damages - including, but not limited to, internal administrative costs incurred by PayPal to monitor and track violations, damage to PayPal’s brand and reputation, and penalties imposed upon PayPal by its business partners resulting from a user’s violation - considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate. PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control. [emphasis is mine]As I read this (not a lawyer) PayPal claims that any violation of their acceptable use policy will result in an  a̶u̶t̶o̶m̶a̶t̶i̶c̶ charge of $2500 because that represents the &#34;minimum estimate&#34; of the damage your violation causes them.On top of being completely a completely unacceptable policy, the idea that any violation costs them at least $2500 is complete fucking horseshit, if you&#39;ll pardon my explicitness. There is absolutely no way I would ever do business with PayPal as a seller under any circumstances, even if it was my customers&#39; preferred method."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people never want to acknowledge the sheer scope and scale of Paypal and Square&#39;s Cash app&#39;s usage as large scale money laundering, drug trafficking, and prostitution tooling. (and much more)They didn&#39;t really even try to stop it in the early days. You could setup an injectable immunomodulator merchant account in under 10 minutes with Square. People started entire pill mills using Square and Paypal. It was wild!Similar to Turo who allowed the vehicles of their users to be used by weak KYC&#39;d users. You never knew who was actually driving the vehicle.I had loads of interesting conversations with Ex San Quentin prisoners, was riveting to listen to some of them talk about the crimes committed with all the fintech startups. Everything I thought I knew was wrong.Paypal/Square Mafia&#39;s used cheap pension money of VC&#39;s to take their vig."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PayPal is toxic. Everyone should leave PayPal. When someone asks to send/receive PayPal to them, then I work to move them to Zelle, Venmo, CashApp or some of the others. TransferWise for international.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like some of these perspectives are very tech industry focused rather than gamer focused.As a gamer, I think Stadia failed because the system they created doesn&#39;t make sense. You had to buy games at real $40-$60 prices but you could only play them through this limited service. I don&#39;t think anyone wants that.Compare that to paying the same price for a regular PC game which you can play via streaming using a streaming service, but also play locally, and know that you can take that game with you through multiple hardware decides and streaming services.With Stadia, if I move somewhere with bad internet, there is no way to recover the value of my games I purchased. There is no other gaming system like that. All other systems either have an offline possibility or are pure streaming where you aren&#39;t making a game purchase investment, like Xbox Gamepass or Luna.It just doesn&#39;t make sense except to a really small niche and is not competitive to the average gamer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As Google Stadia&#39;s target user, in my opinion a stronger reason Stadia died is because GeForce Now was a competing and better product.GeForce Now allowed me to play the games I already own with a more powerful machine than I could buy myself, for just $10/month. Artifacts were noticeable but not enough for me to care. If I bought my own gaming PC later, I would be able to continue playing the game there. GeForce Now offered &#34;Hey, you&#39;re playing Cyberpunk at 720p@25fps? Wanna play at 1080p@60fps for $10? And you can leave any time&#34; And I said heck yes.Stadia would have denied me the ability to continue playing on my own machine while charging me even more money. There are a bunch of stories of people with saved games trapped in Stadia. Google made no attempt to be better than the competition. It&#39;s like they&#39;re unaware of anything other than themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are advantages to game streaming but Google never really did anything with them, instead they just made a worse version of a console.The marketing at the beginning was confusing. Everyone had the impression Stadia was like a Netflix for games. But it was almost the inverse, Stadia is a free gaming console but the games cost money. At the very least Google&#39;s number one pitch should have been &#34;We&#39;re giving you a gaming console for free. You could buy a PS5 for $500 or you could play on Stadia for $0!&#34; (In practice the free tier of Stadia didn&#39;t have the greatest quality but many people didn&#39;t even know Stadia had a free tier...)Game streaming could have opened up new possibilities. Any YouTube game video  could have a button for &#39;play instantly, one click&#39; that loaded an already running Stadia session into a game-state with the player in a fun spot. YouTubers could have been able to hand off controls of their game session to viewers. &#34;Okay GodGamer420 spamming in chat, if you think this boss is so easy, now you have control. Show us how it&#39;s done.&#34;Even the lowest hanging fruit. The biggest advantage of game streaming is that it works on any device but Stadia didn&#39;t even work on most Android phones at launch, and for many months after."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He’s right to do so. Statements that your research must be presented with a filter based on how it will advance political goals calls into question the integrity of all research. When people don’t “trust the science” this will be why.But further, I’d never seen the statement from antiracist before…wow. The idea that the only cure for discrimination is discrimination is akin to saying the only cure for violence is violence. It’s abject insanity that such a notion is being advanced in society.The cure for discrimination is forgiveness. The cure for violence is forgiveness. The cure for hatred is forgiveness.The only way anything stops is for people to have the humility and wisdom to say “this will stop with me.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understand for how we measure systemic racism issues seems to typically be predicated on assumed outcomes.  For example that if the distribution of employees race does not match the general population then there must be a systemic cause for this.What I don’t understand is why that is assumed true.  If we want to encourage many different cultures to live together wouldn’t it naturally  make sense that different cultures would have different outcomes in job preferences?  How do you separate potential racism from cultural differences?My fear is if there are strong cultural differences that lead to disparate racial outcomes so organizations will always be able to point out that systemic issues exist even when they may be eradicated.  I don’t know how we measure this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Free Speech for Me--But Not for Thee: How the American Left and Right Relentlessly Censor Each Other (1992) [1] is a good read on how we got to a point where our ability to communicate across ideologies appears to be broken in many ways.For example, in 1963 Yale disinvited George Wallace, who was popular in the deep south, as a speaker. As a result, observers were deprived of a chance to hear opposing speakers&#39; arguments. To some, Yale appeared censorious. As Jonathan Rauch describes [2], that&#39;s not good for your case. Censorship is all these characters need to gain new followers. Wallace ran for president in 1968 and nearly forced a plurality which would have given him significantly more influence [3].Early episodes of the podcast So to Speak [4] by FIRE can inform the direction that can get us talking again. Basically, open and civil discourse is the way. The podcast demonstrates, through interviews with free speech advocates, a bunch of examples showing why that is a good target to shoot for, and how to achieve it.[1] https://archive.org/details/freespeechformeb0000hent[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0T9XSG73kY&amp;t=4889s[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace_1968_presidenti...[4] https://www.thefire.org/category/newsdesk/so-to-speak/page/1..."</p>

These include Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, the UK, and the United States.&gt; ..PRC authorities ..use alternative means to apprehend fugitives. “Persuasion” has become a common tactic, which human rights groups have called “involuntary returns.” Such returns are achieved by threats against family members in the PRC, directly approaching and intimidating the fugitive overseas, or outright kidnapping ..Involuntary returns ..comprise a mix of genuine criminal fugitives, officials who have fallen out of favor with the CCP leadership, and others pursued for their religious or political beliefs.Earlier thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33049729"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using &#34;persuasion&#34; in quotation marks is perhaps too nice.It&#39;s coercion, if not worse.Not that there is much we can do about it. Though limiting ability of Chinese authorities to operate outside china is fair. After all we don&#39;t permit organized crime either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As the report says:&gt; a seemingly recent campaign to counter transnational telecom and online fraud (according to the official provincial statements)The increase in telecom scamming activity is a real thing in China, with scammers operating from southeastern Asia countries. And operators are often Chinese citizens hired for what they originally thought would be &#34;oversea job with good pay&#34;. The &#34;persuaded to return&#34; strategy might be targeted primarily at them.Those scams are particularly bad -- maybe even worse than the telecom scams happening in the US and other wealthy English-speaking countries -- because taking personal loans is way too easy in China. A few clicks on a lender&#39;s app and you get cash transferred to your account instantly. And there are hundreds of such apps. Scammers can talk victims into maxing out their credit lines and wire the loaned cash away.And the fact that there isn&#39;t &#34;personal bankruptcy&#34; laws in China also makes it worse. Such loans are rarely forgiven and victims often had to pay them off with their future income for years out of the fear that loan defaults can affect their credit score for life.So I guess this is Chinese police&#39;s way of &#34;do something about it&#34;. Of course they don&#39;t have jurisdiction overseas and should have gone with Interpol and/or local police first, except that hasn&#39;t been very effective. My 2 cents on the reasons behind this is:1. Local police might be paid off;2. No incentive for local police to prioritize their resource for cases like this -- there were no victims in their own countries;3. There are just too many scammers;Surely once this set up is in place it&#39;s possible to extend its coverage to harass/&#34;persuade&#34; political dissidents but CCP has already be doing it for years without it. If this oversea police &#34;persuasion&#34; program is getting local law enforcement&#39;s attention to the point that they can arrest both them and the scammers, I would see it as an absolute win."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah I had to implement this once because we ran a handful of ads on TikTok, so they wanted access to all of our traffic. I protested, saying they didn&#39;t need all traffic to do analytics for people who click through.. just tell me how to identify the traffic you need. This is fair, if somebody clicks on an ad then analytics would be expected.Yeah no, they didn&#39;t allow their advertisers to do that. I ended up getting permission to remove from the site when their pixel was found to be causing a performance impact for users. But without good monitoring for that they would have still been running, possibly for forever. I&#39;m sure this is basically how they get to be everywhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You can’t stop data collection from the tech industry altogether, but with a few simple steps you can make a dent in the amount of information that’s being collected.&gt; Use privacy-protecting browser extensions. You can add extensions to your browser that will do a lot to protect your privacy. One is Disconnect, made by the company that performed our TikTok investigation. The Disconnect extension shows you how websites are trying to track you and blocks a lot of that data collection. Privacy experts often recommend uBlock Origin, as well.&gt; Change your browser’s privacy settings. A lot of browsers have built-in controls you can use to block trackers, including cookies, pixels, and other technologies. Open your browser’s preferences or settings, and you’ll usually find the controls in the privacy section.&gt; Try a more private browser. Google Chrome collects a lot of data on behalf of Google. The Consumer Reports Security Planner recommends Firefox and Brave as more privacy-focused options.Case closed when you use uBlock Origin preferably with Brave or Firefox. As an extra measure I disable JS Unless it&#39;s really needed, and surf in a private/incognito session to stop cookies building up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s kind of crazy is how the images tend to have similarities in small features that become very apparent when flipping back and forth between images, but which are not obvious per se.For example, I flipped back and forth between Beatrix Potter and Paulus Potter. A rounded white bonnet in one picture becomes a couple of blossoms in the other. The roof of a house becomes some shadowy wall with plants in the other. Two flower pots are very similar, just with slightly different coloring.It makes it more apparent that the algorithm etches the images out of noise, and if the seed is the same for two images with different prompts, you&#39;re likely to see traces of that noise represented differently but recognizable in both images."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very cool! I recently made a game kind of like AI &#34;pictionary&#34; where the user has to guess the &#34;artist&#34;, subject, and description of a piece of art generated by stable diffusion:https://wcedmisten.fyi/project/paintingGuesser/I tried to make something more general, but stable diffusion is fairly inconsistent in how well the output matches the semantics of the input."</p>

In some ways the web is becoming more opaque. Is this the future then, a hodgepodge of binaries doing things behind the scenes? Though in this case it happens to be OSS, and it may well be a moot point -- backend is already a blackbox to the enduser, now parts of frontend are blackboxes. The practical implication is probably just that some measure of customizability is gone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the million dollar question in psychedelic research today: Are the serotonergic effects of the psychedelic tryptamines primarily responsible for the therapeutic effects, or is the profound religious-mystical component indistinguishable from the positive changes observed? It is a profoundly expensive question. If pharmaceutical companies can deliver a pill that cures depression and gives life meaning without forcing users to face their angels and demons, then the FDA would give approval before the ink on the submission form had dried. As it stands, it would seem the predominant opinion in the community of psychedelic researchers is that the religious-mystical effects are the primary therapeutic vector. It is very difficult to meet God and walk away cynical and melancholy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone with a background in organic chemistry, I have a silly nit to pick with the phrasing &#34;LSD-like molecules&#34;These molecules look nothing like LSD! Structurally they are as different from eachother as a dog is to a flying squirrel.Of course they act like LSD by binding to 5HT2a. This is absolutely terribly pedantic and probably only applies to the mind of someone who wants to see the molecules first, and the rest of the research later, but I would have preferred &#34;Molecules that act like LSD can counter depression without the trip&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"LSD:Multiple times I did it with others and profoundly deepened my relationship with those individuals.Another time I did it by myself and saw the face of evil and I&#39;ve never been so terrified, but I survived and wouldn&#39;t change a thing.I don&#39;t think any of that can be captured by whatever neuro-binding effect is being mimicked by these designed molecules.I also took antidepressants for awhile once and it was diet and exercise and commitment to changing my life and talking to a therapist that was what helped; but I know others who need to take pills every day or things go bad. I wish there was a short treatment for people who need that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From Plato&#39;s dialogue Phaedrus 14, 274c-275b:Socrates: I heard, then, that at Naucratis, in Egypt, was one of the ancient gods of that country, the one whose sacred bird is called the ibis, and the name of the god himself was Theuth. He it was who invented numbers and arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and dice, and, most important of all, letters.Now the king of all Egypt at that time was the god Thamus, who lived in the great city of the upper region, which the Greeks call the Egyptian Thebes, and they call the god himself Ammon. To him came Theuth to show his inventions, saying that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians. But Thamus asked what use there was in each, and as Theuth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or blame, according as he approved or disapproved.&#34;The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, &#34;This invention, O king,&#34; said Theuth, &#34;will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.&#34; But Thamus replied, &#34;Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another; and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess.&#34;For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise.&#34;"</p>

Finding someone who was good enough at pixel level graphics design and was capable of iterating like us software people were used to was insanely hard, nevermind the complexities of the UI/UX designs.I think things have gotten a lot better since then. Now it&#39;s routine to see very well-designed apps (and sometimes even websites) from even relatively small national/local entitities that totally nail all three main aspects: GFX/UI &amp; UX (well, and sometimes even transitions/motion design). It&#39;s really impressive to see how the field has scaled up. I must assume that the various variants of education are working. (Northern European context.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like a good rule. Warrants are good. Outlawing using it to ID peaceful protestors is good.While the points about facial recognition misidentifying black people are true, I&#39;d rather it rely only on the civil rights issues associated with it working and not tie it to misidentifying minorities. That&#39;s a situation where in 5 years &#34;it works on black people now, kay&#34; is the argument to overturn the law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It would also require police departments and agencies to purge databases of photos of children who were subsequently released without charge, whose charges were dismissed or were acquitted.Feeling weird about the notion that law enforcement keeps photos of children who have had run-ins with the law but ultimately weren&#39;t convicted of any crime. Why would they even need to keep such photographs? Data retention == legal liability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The use of facial recognition has grown in recent years, despite fears that the technology is flawed, disproportionately misidentifies people of color (which has led to wrongful arrests) and harms civil liberties, but is still deployed against protesters, for investigating minor crimes and used to justify arrests of individuals from a single face match.I feel like I&#39;m the only peron where who doesn&#39;t see a problem with Police having access to facial recognition. Its not like anything used right now is accurate, eg eyewitnesses. If it really is unreliable it shouldn&#39;t be used as a sole basis to arrest people, I&#39;d expect a civil suit if that really happened. However just because some police mis-used it doesn&#39;t mean it should be banned."</p>

But it still feels like a huge amount of work, hoop jumping, and _fragility_ just to reach parity with VS Code/Helix/Zed, which are pretty great out of the box, and which were built to be used as rich development environments instead of extensible text editors.I&#39;ve spent months tweaking Neovim/Emacs configs in the past and I ultimately end up conceding that I&#39;d rather spend that time hacking on projects instead of my editor config.

Where the heck is that?This lunacy infects Windows applications, like Quicken and Thunderbird, which spew themselves and their data into gawd knows where hidden directories. Why can&#39;t they simply do the obvious? Create a \Quicken directory in the root, and have a \Quicken\program and \Quicken\userdata ? But noooo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Give TestDisk a try. Years ago I have been able to use it to recover almost all files from a unreadable disk coming fom a RAID1 mirror gone bonkers due to a faulty controller.https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDiskedit: oh, I just read that you mentioned TestDisk. Yes, it can recover the directory structure, at least it did in my case. After using it you will likely see that some files have been duplicated with a suffix added, like document.doc and document.doc.xyz (can&#39;t recall the exact suffix) in the same directory. In that case you need to check which file has been fully recovered, and rename it if needed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very important that you develop complete confidence that there isn&#39;t anything wrong with your product. It&#39;s not uncommon, in fact it&#39;s very common, for compromise kits for websites to take measures to avoid detection. A common one is only serving the malicious content when a specific referrer is present (I&#39;ve seen this be Yahoo Search in the case of compromised Drupal installations multiple times, not really sure why). It might be wise to engage a security firm to conduct an investigation if you don&#39;t have in-house expertise in this area. You should definitely review logs carefully for any unusual inbound traffic. Sometimes looking up your own domain on services like virustotal can reveal the problem, as it might turn up samples of malware retrieved from your website.I say this because I have been involved in this exact situation multiple times: website flagged by some or other security service, website operator has no idea why and insists it is fine, website turns out to be serving the landing page of a major pharma scam campaign unnoticed by the website operator due to anti-detection measures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed that the people running automated flagging systems seem to become inordinately smug to the point that they believe their false positive result over all forms of external evidence. So to them you are a criminal and that&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As has already been said, there&#39;s a chance that you are compromised and don&#39;t know.  Obviously keep trying to contact MS, but in the mean time I&#39;d make as much sure as you can that they don&#39;t have a legitimate beef.If you&#39;re willing to share more details about your site such as your tech stack, we can probably give you more specific advice beyond &#34;check your logs for weirdness and hire a consultancy firm that deals with breach detection,&#34; though that is good advice.For what it&#39;s worth I went through something similar to this not too long ago, so I know how maddening it is.  My client never found any breach (though I did find some PHP library CVE&#39;s that could have conceivably been chained together to wreak some havoc), but I ended up rebuilding their prod environment clean and the flag went away on it&#39;s own after a couple days, probably because whatever malware was in there had disappeared."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh wow, this app got pulled from everything because it&#39;s an unofficial 3rd party client for Instagram?  I&#39;ll say it again, companies should be legally forbidden from blocking 3rd party clients.  They don&#39;t have to explicitly support them, but taking action to explicitly thwart them (and writing ToS that forbids them) should be outlawed.  There&#39;s no reason I should have to be subjected to untold tracking, snooping and advertising functionality to be able to post or look at photos and comment on them.  Tech companies get to exploit the public under the guise of something useful, while also getting to completely dictate the terms of that usage.  The only thing that limits their exploitation of users is the laws applicable in the relevant jurisdictions (and sometimes not even that).  Too bad looking out for the rights of users is apparently just a complete non-issue to anyone in power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Privacy proponents should cheer for this. Legally Meta must take down the app to comply with FTC&#39;s order (obligatory not a lawyer):
https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-bi...&gt; Another way the FTC says Facebook violated the order was by failing to adequately assess and address privacy risks posed by third-party developers. Other than getting developers to click an “I agree” terms-and-conditions box when registering an app with the Facebook Platform, Facebook didn’t screen developers or their apps before giving them access to massive amounts of data that users had designated as private. Of course, in the wrong hands, information like that can grease the wheels for identity thieves and fraudsters.&gt; The order imposes additional requirements to address Facebook’s illegal conduct. For example, Facebook must implement a stringent program to monitor third-party developers and terminate access to any developer that doesn’t follow the rules.https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-bi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why do I always get a bad feeling about the motivations behind stuff like this? I want to believe it&#39;s for better privacy and security, but it&#39;s being driven by a corporation or two, and that makes me 100% suspicious. Like, for example, suddenly Edge is no longer respecting local DNS options and my pihole protects one fewer device from the real dangers to privacy. I don&#39;t want to be cynical so often, but this really doesn&#39;t feel like a benevolent move. Yeah, it&#39;s conditional at the moment, but as with Chrome and manifest v3, among many other examples, I&#39;m losing my faith that anything with the potential to increase ad revenue will remain turned off for long."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; the VPN will automatically connect when you’re using public Wi-Fi or browsing unsecured networks and sites lacking a valid HTTP certificate.OK, that&#39;s actually a pretty decent idea. It&#39;s not going to be always-on, but it&#39;s providing security specifically for things like coffeeshops/libraries and for sites that don&#39;t provide their own security. In other words, it&#39;s &#34;backup security&#34;, not rerouting all of your &#34;normal&#34; secure traffic at work/home.This mainly protects sites you visit from having JavaScript injected into them by networks when there aren&#39;t any other protections, and the VPN is run by Cloudflare so it will be performant, so I don&#39;t really see any problems here? Seems like a positive development actually."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article, this is powered by a partnership with Cloudflare. It&#39;s worth noting that until August 6 of this year, Cloudflare&#39;s WARP VPN would leak your IP address - but only to sites using the Cloudflare network.https://web.archive.org/web/20220609160341/https://developer...And when Cloudflare released their new SOPs for Warp, they did so in a blog post titled &#34;More features, still private&#34; - https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-expe... as referenced in https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/known-issues-a...Microsoft&#39;s initial announcement for the feature touted that IP addresses would be masked, and one imagines that they did their diligence with Cloudflare and are enforcing the strong practices that WARP has now rolled out more broadly.But it&#39;s worth noting that you&#39;re routing through a company to whom the words &#34;still private&#34; encompassed leaking client IP address information to Cloudflare&#39;s hosting customers as recently as two months ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Google has historically been protective of their front page, why now?Probably for the same reason that Google is shutting down Stadia [1] and cutting staff [2], and the same reason that we see roughly one announcement of layoffs here on Hacker News every week: most people expect that we are going into a recession. For example, see the price of major indexes like the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ and plot it on a 10+ year timescale.What surprises me the most actually is how quickly Google can adapt to the situation. Basically, they have been giving out candy for free when there was lots of money coming and now that they expect less, they quickly put on extra income streams and cut out money losers.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33022768[2]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32927848"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Notably, this is not Google showing random search/display ads.Those look like ads for Google&#39;s own product.I don&#39;t think this is the first time. IIRC, Google used to show an ad for Chrome if you used the search from any other browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was inevitable, you gotta get the infite growth from somewhere. Ane the next move will +1 this and so on, until google becomes less attractive than leaner competition. Because of inertia, legacy and people benefitting from the status quo, they won&#39;t be able to correct course.This is textbook &#34;how empire falls&#34; and why things that seem indestructible eventually dies like anything else.This will be the mile stone people will remember as the first sign of google decline."</p>

Not surprised that most people weren&#39;t confident about Stadia.But it&#39;s also baffling when there were so many running services and standalone products already. Steam Link, Nvidia Geforce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Playstation Remote Play, Parsec etc. It&#39;s not like Google had a brand new open field ahead of them and no idea what to do"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO: Google is handling a bunch of things, including Stadia, and including GCP, in a very poor way.GCP: copycat of AWS, but with less high margin, higher level services, so have been losing money since the beginning (ask some of Alphabet&#39;s board members, if you can, and watch their eyes rolling). The only thing that could have given them the advantage - not, not Kubernetes, although K was and is a great thing to fund - was a &#34;cloud in a box&#34; product, so companies could install a rack of GCP in their existing Data Centers, and use it. See &#34;The Cloud Wars of 2017&#34;, written by me [0] six years ago.Stadia: you can&#39;t build Stadia without getting into account that the market has one big monopoly (Steam), and a few huge other ones (Xbox, Epic, etc). The strategy has simply been to ignore this simple fact. It&#39;s like Netflix building a streaming service, without a huge investment into content as well. Doomed to fail from the get go.Small rant, no horses in this game on my part; just a pity that two huge opportunities were wasted like this.[0]: https://medium.com/simone-brunozzi/the-cloud-wars-of-2017-ac..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We really just need a group like ConsumerReports, Labdoor, WireCutter or something that actually digs into the quality and claims of devices. Very few people are going to buy 30 competing options as well as a known good control and compare and contrast them in a scientific context, but that&#39;s what&#39;s needed.I remember looking around for a Radon sensor for way too long. An electronic device, a litmus-like strip test, some analog crystal ball -- hell a mail-in lab kit bag of carbon -- but they all seemed inaccurate. The few people that &#34;bought two&#34; always showed heavy variance while the majority that bought and got a number *loved it*. Even buying two that agree often just means the products are consistently and predictably wrong, but most products don&#39;t even check this box ffs.Reviewers that try and apples-to-apples all products by comparing cost, size, advertised features and ergonomics are doing no better than you or I opening up a package and appraising it. For awhile this Google dev was putting up extremely detailed amazon reviews for USBC cables based on their purported features v. reality and it was wonderful, but tucked away and undiscoverable.The world needs multiple parties providing unbiased in-depth reviews, but there&#39;s very little will to pay for even one group to do something like this. Ironically, paying for information in the information age seems almost comical to today&#39;s consumers and while there&#39;s demand for good information, no one&#39;s willing to open their wallets. Labdoor moved from subscription-only memberships to &#34;certified products&#34; and affiliate links because everyone wants to know what&#39;s in their multivitamin, but no one wants to pay for an indepth review. We aren&#39;t cultivating a supply-side that works for us, but against us.The result of this is shilling and fake reviews running wild. I mean hell, consumers will buy a product knowing full well they might get a shoddy knock off and yet it&#39;s $5 less and they can get it tomorrow so they&#39;ll roll the dice. Sadly, we don&#39;t live in a world where people are intimately concerned with quality and accuracy in their purchases.edit: USBC not USB3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My cheap co2 sensor shows dramatically different readings for my office with the window closed vs open. It is great at reminding me to crack my window open to get more air flow.Its temperature sensor is within a couple degrees of my nest&#39;s remote sensor.My Amazon vo2 sensor can tell if I turned my kitchen fan on to a sufficient level to clear out whatever I am cooking.Lots of sensors don&#39;t need to be precise, they just need to indicate if some action needs to be taken.e.g. If there is a fire, I just need the alarm to go off, I don&#39;t care how hot the fire is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Relative VOC measurements at least are able to detect a no. 2 in nappies. Great to distinguish if you should go in and change them or would be a distraction from falling to sleep when checking. I bulit a Pi ZeroW that measures on the side of the bed and publishes a curve of the last hour of the values. You can see a pretty salient drop when &#34;it&#34; happens."</p>

So fun to add photos and then see how many views they get (I posted one of a chippy in Scotland (for Americans that&#39;s Fish &amp; Chip &#39;Thick French Fries&#39; shop) which got over 1.4 million views - mental). The location history feature suggests things  to contribute which helps too.Would be good to have something similar to make contributing fun."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who operated on the &#34;adult internet&#34; with payment processors and related infrastructure without being 18, I still carry forward the constant fear that I&#39;ll be banned for retroactive Terms of Service violations incurred when I was a kid. It really sucks when it&#39;s services like AdSense because you&#39;re just screwed forever.I really really wish the internet was more supportive of &#34;early hackers&#34; who want to experiment. I get that there are tons of implications around contract law and child labor here, but there really needs to be an escape hatch if a parent agrees to whatever activity is being done. Ostensibly, this is a young creator getting discouraged from their hobby, even though they&#39;ve shown that they&#39;re good enough at it to deserve some form of compensation.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a solution as easy as &#34;well when they&#39;re 18, let them log into their account and update their age to acknowledge that they were using the service as a minor&#34; or &#34;just let people open multiple accounts (with wildly different ages) under their name.&#34;"</p>

Google’s standard playbook when forcing things people don’t like is to spread the action out over a longer timeframe, exhausting the media and keeping the final blow mostly out of the news, and exhausting our individual outrage and will to keep fighting. It works every time, and it’ll work again if we become complacent again. Until and unless Google meaningfully commits to never neuter ad blockers, it’s still critical and urgent that we switch to Firefox."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an owner of a Video Production studio, this kind of tech is blowing my mind and makes me equally excited and scared. I can see how we could incorporate such tools in our workflows, and at the same time I&#39;m worried it&#39;ll be used to spam the internet with thousands and thousands of souless generated videos, making it even harder to look through the noise.A fun related experiment, I thought it was fun to see what kind of movies AI would generate, so I created a &#34;This Movie Does Not Exist&#34; website[1] that auto generates fake movies (movie posters + synopsis). It basically uses GPT-3 to generate some story plots, and then uses that as a prompt (with in-between steps) for Stable Diffusion. Results may vary, but it definitely surprises sometimes with movies that look and sound amazing![1] This Movie Does Not Exist: https://thismoviedoesnotexist.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s cool to see this on HN.I originally wrote this article for a “microcourse” I ran at the University of St Andrews—aimed at a non-tech background—on building a personal webpage. Especially in mathematics, having a personal site (that you control) to host research and other information is pretty invaluable!Older personal math sites tend to have a very particular “historic” feel. While I personally have a lot of nostalgia for the look, I also think it’s good to take advantage of some of the newer tools that are available today!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really nice, focused write up.  Very useful and to the point.HTML is really very accessible to someone with basic computer skills. It&#39;s a shame that a standard business website is now a facebook page.There is a local gym near me with a static HTML webpage, hosted on local ISP web hosting.  It&#39;s quick to load, responsive and always up to date. Checking the opening times, address and special events is much easier than on some aggregator site or google maps (which is often out of date).  It&#39;s also very easy to read on many devices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personal approach might be too simplistic for some, but this is what I did for my webpage, though I already had some HTML &amp; CSS experience:&gt;No website generators, no frameworks, no nothing (not even JavaScript)&gt;Just design the site on the go through some trial and error using vim, CSS and HTML documentation always at hand&gt;A single .css file to style the entire website--I even threw in some cool animations, which took a while to get right, admittedly&gt;Publish it through GitHub Pages in under five minutes&gt;If I want to upload a new blog post, for instance, I just make a copy of an existing one and manually edit the content, then push it through git after I&#39;ve edited the blog index accordinglyReading terms like &#34;static site generator&#34;, &#34;content management system&#34;, &#34;templates&#34;, &#34;analytics&#34; or &#34;deployment&#34; gives me an instant headache, especially since it&#39;s so easy to open your favorite text editor and design your own website by hand, so to speak. I&#39;ve self-hosted eepsites, gemini capsules and many other sites this way and the process wasn&#39;t remotely as contrived as some approaches I&#39;ve seen out there for publishing a personal blog"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Around June-July 2021 LG started rolling out updates which added some minor mitigations that broke our original exploit chain.It&#39;s a damn shame companies feel incentivised to do this.People hacking on their own TVs is quite literally a victimless crime (besides yourself, if you brick your one TV), because you knowingly void the warranty.Mazdas have a great third-party firmware called Mazda AIO Tweaks[0] that fixes a whole host of bugs and allows you to customize the infotainment system. The best part is you can use it to enable Android Auto on older Mazdas (this was before AA was even released for Mazda!)Mazda then proceeded to lock down the firmware so much you now need to take apart some consoles and attach a serial connection. Disgusting behaviour.(vis-a-vis plugging in an SD card with the scripts you want to run.)[0] https://mazdatweaks.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most incredible thing here is that this demonstrates a level of 3D understanding that I didn&#39;t believe existed in 2D image models yet. All of the 3D information in the output was inferred from the training set, which is exclusively uncurated and unsorted 2D still images. No 3D models, no camera parameters, no depth maps. No information about picture content other than a text label (scraped from the web and often incorrect!).From a pile of random undifferentiated images the model has learned the detailed 3D structure and plausible poses and variants of thousands (millions?) of everyday objects. And all we needed to get that 3D information out of the model was the right sampling procedure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"the servers inside Iranian data centers still have access to the outside world.Knowing that, the simplest and easiest solution that would avoid detection is to SSH tunnel into that datacenter and SSH-ProxyForward out of that datacenter into Amazon AWS via SSH and use that SSH proxy chain as a SOCKS proxy for browsers.  Make sure the browser is using the SOCKS proxy (SSH) for its DNS.  Many sites will make your friends solve captchas if they show up from Amazon so if you have a friend outside of Iran in the same AWS region that is willing to open SSH on their home router then one could add that private home router as their last hop in the SSH proxy forward.  Do not go directly from the datacenter to the home.  It is normal and expected for Datacenters to SSH to Amazon.SSH Client -&gt; Iranian Datacenter / Server -&gt; AWS VM -&gt; Home router in same region as AWS -&gt; Internet.If many people are using the same server and VM then make sure that MaxStartups and MaxSessions have been increased in sshd_config as well as any PAM limits on the servers for open files on every node in the path.  Clients should enable ControlPath / ControlMaster in their ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config.  To harden each hop configure PermitOpen to only allow the SSH hops and the final hop should also permit *:443Examples of all these steps can be found on SuperUser  / StackExchange / ServerFault and are all public knowledge.  All above-board, no hacking involved.[Edit] Removing the Squid MITM SSL-Bump proxy idea.  That would make follow on questions harder to explain.[Edit from Fatnino&#39;s input] If your Amazon VPC&#39;s are too outbound-restricted then pick another VPS provider that is commonly used for hosting 3rd party tools for datacenters, preferably one already used by that datacenter.[Edit] In theory hypothetically speaking every hop possible could have misconfigured but realistic looking syslog so that SSH connections are not logged on the server and in theory a log-less silent rule in the edge firewall to not log SSH connections.  Sometimes syslog disks also fill up by mistake.  SSH can also be performed in ephemeral diskless containers such as Docker, Podman and LXC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish you the best of luck.When similar events unfolded in Syria, people created redundant social networks of fake Facebook accounts.  This seemed to work well.  When captured and tortured, people would hand over credentials for one account.  People would detect that network was &#34;burned&#34; and move to the next one.This gave the officials very little information, since the accounts did not reference real names, and locations were obfuscated.  High risk private messages were deleted, etc.The key to this working was that Facebook was not sympathetic to or cooperating with the Syrian government, and accessing Facebook was a common (not worth prosecuting) infraction.I&#39;d be worried that they will fingerprint / honeypot tor infrastructure, then round people up.  The existence of the tor client or connection logs basically proves guilt.Friending facebook accounts with cutsey names is much less incriminating.  Edit: Also, any honeypot proxy connection logs just show that you used https to access facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the 80&#39;s, I remember that people were protesting without internet and mobile phones, with very successful results. They bought down the iron curtain after all. The most sophisticated technology they used was the printing press, for printing and distributing fliers, newspapers and censored books. Underground groups were organized in cells too, without phones, email or apps.Right now, it seems like those who use the internet and phones are at a disadvantage. Phones are always tracked, and the internet is a giant surveillance tool. If the government controls the network, then it is always at a great advantage, no matter if VPN or Tor is used."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s sad to me how successful people have been sanitizing the internet.The whole point was to be decentralized, and now we have Visa, Mastercard, Apple, Google, Amazon and Cloudflare deciding what we are and are not allowed to see, read and buy.  And virtually in lockstep, they are becoming increasingly prudish.I&#39;m curious if this could be addressed with laws that force companies to either be utilities or publishers.  If you&#39;re a publisher, you take liability for your content and can edit it at will.  If you&#39;re a utility, you do not take liability for your services, but you cannot pick and choose which customers you service so long as it&#39;s legal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t tell one way or the other if people have forgotten that SESTA/FOSTA passed in 2018.All of this is consequence of that law working as intended (not as described; it&#39;s supposed to stop human trafficking, but those supporting it made no bones about their position that if it chilled all online pornographic content, they didn&#39;t care).All of these companies pivoted hard because hosting previously-legal content may now be a federal crime, and nobody wants to get dragged through the mud of that legal case. Until and unless that changes, this is the new status quo in the United States (and therefore, much of the Internet).Matt on Tumblr seems to have missed that even if a company does all the things on his list, their owners could still end up in prison if they are aware that any pornography on their sites was &#34;facilitating sex trafficking,&#34; which is an extremely broad category (is someone using racy pictures as advertisement for face-to-face meetups? Oops, go to jail; Section 230 protections were specifically stripped out for that case and if it violates state law in the state you&#39;re operating in, the state the poster is in, or the state the viewer is in, you&#39;re now liable as the site operator!)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This mentality change goes far beyond porn. A decade ago comment sections like Slashdot and Hacker News were almost unanimously in favor of keeping the internet as unregulated and open as possible.Now it seems like every headline about social media companies attracts a lot of comments demanding regulations, restrictions, and laws to crack down on... something. Even here on HN it&#39;s common for threads about Meta to devolve into a lot of angry calls for Facebook to be &#34;banned&#34; for kids or for lawmakers to step in and regulate.Meanwhile, journalists and politicians love to amplify stories about tech companies doing harm to kids. Allowing, or even encouraging, something like porn on your platform is an open invitation for these journalists to put you in their sights. No company wants to be the most lax company in the space, so it&#39;s a constant game of companies tightening their standards."</p>

A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.The economy is stabilizing. It&#39;s being weaned off of ultra-loose money for the first time in years. The stock market is starting to behave more rationally, demanding that a company whose earnings potential is sinking and which offers no dividend be valued accordingly.&gt; ... Meta had more than 83,500 employees as of June 30, and added 5,700 new hires in the second quarter.  ...FWIW, 28 % annualized hiring growth for a company the size and age of Meta is not normal. It&#39;s a sign of mismanagement and especially loss of focus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our startup spends a little bit on Facebook Ads (across FB, Instagram, etc). It&#39;s very clear over the past few months that there&#39;s trouble in the ads engine. Attribution is a mess, ad efficiency fluctuates randomly, the UI and API are flaky. I don&#39;t know whether this is a result of the ios privacy changes, the broader economy affecting ad spend, or internal issues... Maybe a mix. But it&#39;s clear that Meta&#39;s main revenue engine is a complete mess at the moment.PS it&#39;s not just us.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Alternative hypothesis: (brace yourselves) people don&#39;t care enough. Any vendor will prioritize requirements, if performance is not in there, that CPU and memory is going to be used if in any way it helps the developers. Conversely, by looking at a system you can infer its requirements.For commercial airplanes it may be safety first, ticket price second (passenger capacity, fuel efficiency) and speed third. For most software, functionality, signing up for a subscription, platform availability etc are usually prioritized higher than response times and keyboard shortcuts.Game devs worry a lot about latency and frame rates and professional software care a lot about keyboard shortcuts. This proves (anecdotally) that performance isn&#39;t unacheivable at all, but rather deprioritized. Nobody wants slow apps but it&#39;s just that developer velocity, metrics, ads etc etc are higher priorities, and that comes with a cpu and memory cost that the vendor doesn&#39;t care about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of idiocracy reminds me of the GTA json thing.. It&#39;s kind of hard to attribute these things to ignorance, but there&#39;s been a notable shift in perception among developers.. It used to always be about &#34;tricking&#34; the result out of the computer by applying deep understanding of both system and problem to find the fewest, most performant steps required to yield the result.30 years ago, nobody in their right mind would have thought &#34;du&#39;h, I&#39;ll just recursively scan whatever directory THIS environment variable points at and then apply whatever this library does to each file in it to get some list and then extract the files I need from that list&#34;..Even IF you had to do such a terrible and expensive operation, you&#39;d at least have the good sense to save your result so that you can do it more efficiently the next time.."</p>

After that, every program compiled by that Delphi installation will contain the virus.The virus does nothing else, it is therefore harmless if you don&#39;t have Delphi installed.It resulted in many software vendors releasing infected executables without realizing it, sometimes claiming false positives. After all, the executable was not tampered with, the compiler was."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is great to see this from the source (or close to it).  Some searches on the text of Thompson&#39;s message also led to these pre-existing sources (not linked from niconiconi&#39;s blog) of a post by Jonathan Thornburg:https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography-digest@senator-bed...https://groups.google.com/g/sci.crypt/c/PybcCHi9u6s/m/b-7U1y...btw is there any public archive of ~old usenet (say, through 1999)?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got obsessed with this paper recently, to the point where I have read most of the &#34;Unknown Air Force Document&#34; that Thompson references with giving him the idea of Trojan horse. The document was later identified and is declassified and publicly available [1].&gt; If one reads the original paper, one only finds a description of this attack as a thought experiment, leading one to conclude that any claim of a real-world attack by Thompson was an urban myth due to exaggeration.This is true although Thompson gives some tantalizing hints in the paper.In the introduction, he writes &#34; I would like to present to you the cutest program I ever wrote.&#34; So he definitely wrote it and at least played around with it.Later on in the &#34;Moral&#34; section, he writes &#34;The moral is obvious. You can&#39;t trust code that you did not totally create yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.)&#34;This appears to be an admission but not quite strong or direct enough to validate he implemented and used the Trojan horse so it is great to read this post.[1] https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/conference-pap..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing to reflect on how much goodwill Fastmail has cultivated with me just by being a reasonably priced, full-featured, competent-support-having service. I&#39;m unlikely to ever do anything with the Fastmail API, but I still upvoted mainly because I&#39;m enthusiastic about the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Started the transition from Gmail to FastMail at custom domain yesterday. Presence of an API was definitely important (though I probably should have tested it out during the free trial).Had some initial buyer&#39;s regret for no reason in particular (did the 3-year plan for the best price and assuming prices will go up over time), but already feeling really solid. The web client is very snappy, documentation is good, able to import my Gmail messages, contacts, calendars, and even filters in a snap (though imperfectly). Looking forward to seeing how the API compares with my Google API scripts. Definitely seems to be more knobs and buttons for power users (more powerful filters, regex, etc.).While not relevant to FastMail per se, also really glad to finally start the painful process of migrating decades of accounts to my custom domain email, where I hope it will stay forever. Growing concern about the (admittedly slim) possibility of losing access to my Gmail account was a big motivator, as was the recent move to force the Google Apps stuff to a paid plan.So far so good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apart from Fastmail being amazing for email, they’ve been a great source of customer service to me in several ways. I like to point it out in case people are on the fence and considering a switch. My most appreciated instance was this:Many years ago I was broke and going through rough financial strains. My yearly contract with Fastmail was up and I asked for a grace period. They did it, no questions asked, for 2 months.It wasn’t a thing. When I renewed my contract we settled up and it was all good. It’s been quite a while now and I’m still glad to support them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The folks behind Penpot also make a kanban management tool, kind of like Trello, called Taiga: http://taiga.io/ It&#39;s also OSS (Django/Angular), self-hostable, and very pleasant to use.I&#39;m rooting for both of these, and now that they have some funding I hope they&#39;ll dedicate effort on polishing the rough edges (and do something about the gratuitous amount of white space that permeates all of their web presence, and maybe reconsider their color palette to be less muted and more saturated, heavier, and decisive). They seem to be actively working on Figma imports, auto layouts, multi-user edits and more at this moment so they&#39;re on the right track.For both of them, even if the VCs pull the rug from underneath to race for an exit, it being OSS is good insurance. A fork would mean that we don&#39;t have to spend time learning yet another tool. The good will fostered by it being OSS is what encourages some of us to look into their offerings, and in this way what we see is something that seems like a sustainable model for OSS projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer - I work for Figma but had no part in the acquisition. My comments are my own and I don&#39;t represent Figma.Technically I&#39;m very curious to see how Penpot evolves with this investment, especially in regards to their choice to base everything on SVGs. IMO this will be their greatest superpower and also greatest weakness. Keeping things tied explicitly to code means exporting the final product is going to be near-perfect translation wise, but it will also mean they&#39;re tied explicitly to the browser&#39;s ability to render the combined html+svgs.Currently Penpot&#39;s performance starts dropping rapidly once you approach around 1000 layers. Most robust design systems I see run around 10-40k layers (with the record I&#39;ve seen being 250k). I&#39;m very curious if they&#39;ll be able to optimize their approach to support those sizes of libraries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Before September 15, Penpot’s CEO and co-founder Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz said that sign-ups were growing at around 40% per month: after Adobe’s news, that figure ballooned to 5,600%, and has stayed consistent since then. On-premise deployments have also grown 400%.5600%! Good for them. I&#39;m sure a lot of it was folks exploring options but I wonder how many of those new users will stick around -- anyone try it out and decide to make the commitment to use Penpot as a full replacement? Anything it still needs / hesitations?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First, thank you to the poster for posting this - I haven&#39;t laughed this hard in a while.Second - thank you to the person who actually made this.  This is incredibly hilarious (just based on the project I&#39;m gonna go ahead an assume they have an account here :) )Lastly - I know that this is a joke project, but one thing I&#39;m not understanding: how does the system read the current state of the chess board?  The, er, Bluetooth/WiFi &#39;output&#39; of the system is clear enough, but I&#39;m not clear on how the current chess board is input into the system so that Stockfish can actually compute the next move.(This is a semi-serious question - if you know I&#39;d be curious to find out, but I&#39;m not gonna lose sleep over this and I don&#39;t expect anyone else to waste time on it either :)  )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Morse code for the classical chess notation is actually pretty inefficient (12ish bits of data). Often times the actual viable moves are vastly reduced. With your own custom entropy code and custom symbol table, you could massively reduce the transmission time.E.g.- 1-4 bits for the piece class to move.- 3 bits for the column of the destination- 1-3 bits left over for disambiguation. E.g. ColumnThat&#39;s perhaps a bit too much optimization for a troll project. But fun nonetheless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting thing I learned about this is that the big names in chess all agree that they don&#39;t need to be told what move to make. In a recent interview Magnus Carlsen said:&gt;    The people who get caught are those who cheat in a really obvious and stupid manner. The problem was that he [i.e., a player caught in 2016] was not good enough to see what would’ve made sense.&gt;    Had I started cheating in a clever manner, I am convinced no one would notice. I would’ve just needed to cheat one or two times during the match, and I would not even need to be given moves, just the answer on which move was way better. Or, here there is a possibility of winning, and here you need to be more careful. That is all I would need in order to be almost invincible, which does frighten me.So all you need is a buzz or maybe two - &#34;caution&#34; and &#34;opportunity,&#34; &#34;defense&#34; and &#34;offense&#34; or whatever.The difficult part is getting the game state to the device. In streamed games this can be done with a medium amount of trouble but in non-streamed OTB games you&#39;d need the player or a confederate to be silently inputting moves for the engine to respond to. Not impossible but... difficult. Nevertheless, when the prizes are in the hundreds of thousands, people may try to find a way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll always celebrate stories like this, but I also don&#39;t take some kind of anti-AWS lesson from it.This company saved $800k/year. Perfect time to go in-house with this solution.But when they were 1/10th this size, they&#39;d only have saved $80k/year. Does that cover the cost of the engineering to build and maintain this system? Maybe not. And when they were 1/100th the size, it would have been laughable to go in-house.At the right time, you make the right transitions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They don&#39;t mention at all what services they were using (other than slight mention of S3) which makes it very hard to respond to this. If you are running everything on EC2 then you are going to have a bad time (especially if you aren&#39;t using reserved instances).AWS (IMHO) shines with the various services they provide (S3, Lambda, CloudFront, API Gateway, SQS&lt; SES, to name a few). AWS is a game of trying to reduce your bill and often that means using AWS-specific services. If you want to stay completely &#34;cloud agnostic&#34; you are going to paying more than buying into a &#34;cloud&#34;, in that scenario then you absolutely should be looking at dedicated servers. AWS is great because you can bring existing software and just run it in EC2 (or their container stuff if your software is containerized) but the AWS magic comes from using their managed services (also spinning up/down EC2 instances as needed, but if you are running them 24/7 then consider alternatives or at least pay for reserved)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dedicated hosting providers.I&#39;m so amazed that somehow people completely forget that for literally decades, web host provided dedicated hosting options at fantastic prices.Yes, loooong time ago - to get your dedicated server might have taken a few hours to provision and the instant server access that AWS brought should not be discredited.But large numbers of web host today allow you to programmatically spin up a dedicated web host instantaneously and at a fraction of the cost."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is my most useful bookmark, I use it everywhere (it&#39;s even practical on an iphone)So many sites have a top banner that disappears as you scroll down a page, but as soon as you scroll upwards even a little bit, it pops up again. This is immensely frustrating because I tend to read at the top of a page and scroll down as I&#39;m reading. So if I scroll down slightly too far and then correct myself, the banner will instantly obscure the bit of the text I&#39;m trying to read. It&#39;s very satisfying to be able to click on the bookmark and fix the site&#39;s crap design!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I have uBlock set in a way that blocks most of this stuff by default. I have several &#34;steps&#34; of permissivity:1) (default) block all JS completely2) Block 3rd party js3) Permit all js (rare)If the web fails to render in (1) and I do not necessarily need anything on that web I can get elsewhere, I just leave the web. F that web and F that creator. If I have to (webshop etc) I usualy just enable (2) which works most of the time. (3) is basically only for special webs like banking etc which is just PITA to debug as you have to be logging in constantly etc.Websites today are just full of unnecessary crap and are downright unusable when on slower connection like 3G. Most of the webs now require your browser to download 2M of JS to have &#34;slide out menus&#34; or some other stupid stuff. uBlock is a must, because without that you will run out of data plan almost instantly.And to make things worse, Chromium-based browsers will make adblocking much harder with Manifest v3. As soon as this happens, I will go to Firefox. And after that probably Links (unironically).Btw spinning up a docker to shrink 1 JS function to a oneliner is perfectly capturing the essence of what&#39;s wrong with web nowdays :-D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use this all the time, it&#39;s invaluable. I also use it to remove sticky headers, which I find to be deeply annoying because they waste space and often break keyboard scrolling by scrolling the next few lines of text under the header.In Firefox I&#39;ve assigned it a keyword shortcut, so I can type `ctrl + l` to select the address bar, then `ks` `&lt;enter&gt;` to execute the JS without having to click."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sentiment here on HN is to never connect the TV to the Internet and instead use a digital media player or external streaming device. I wholeheartedly agree. But then several people mentioned wanting to update the firmware. If you&#39;ll never connect it to the Internet, then you should never update the firmware either. It goes against conventional wisdom, but updating the firmware in this situation is more likely to cause problems than to bring you desired improvements.The firmware update might have stricter DRM controls; it could have a tricky new way to exfiltrate data out via your streaming box; maybe the firmware update itself contains some static ads; perhaps in the near future we&#39;ll have public wifi or free Google community wifi, and the new firmware will have the smarts to use that and bypass your wifi.And these days, once you update the firmware, you often cannot revert back to earlier firmware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just give me my Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, HBO Max,...All of which are available on an AppleTV, and I assume other less-intrusive devices. TFA comes to that conclusion in the last paragraph, but just in case anyone didn&#39;t make it that far. And then, as everyone on this page is going to say, never let that TV anywhere near a network connection. Why anyone would go to the effort of dicking with a pi-hole cat-and-mouse game is beyond me. Plug in a box, remove network access to the TV, watch your shows....even if it duplicates all the streaming app functionality in the TV itself.I don&#39;t know, Samsung&#39;s fuckery aside, does anyone seriously think that using the duplicate app on the Samsung is going to be anywhere nearly as pleasant a UX as the AppleTV? IOW, use the AppleTV (or Roku, or whatever) regardless just for the better experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I own this exact model -- the QN90A, though in a smaller size -- and have had exactly the same experience.The most maddening advertisement is the one that is forcibly inserted in the menu between the apps and the settings. Using the remote, you must literally click past an ad to switch inputs.You ... must ... click ... past ... an ... ad ... to ... switch ... inputs. Every time.Unbelievable for a TV that costs this much. I almost returned it, but as the author notes, the alternatives have worse picture quality and often aren&#39;t any better in the ad department."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s really amazing how DALL-E missed the boat. When it was launched, it was a truly amazing service that had no equal. In the months since then, both Midjourney and Stable Diffusion emerged and got to the point where they produce images of equal or better quality than DALL-E. And you didn&#39;t have to wait in a long waitlist in order to gain access! They effectively gave these tools free exposure by not allowing people to use DALL-E.Furthermore, the pricing model is much worse for DALL-E than any of its competitors. DALL-E makes you think about how much money you&#39;re losing continuously - a truly awful choice for a creative tool! Imagine if you had to pay photoshop a cent every time you made a brushstroke. Midjourney has a much better scheme (and unlimited at only 30/month!), and, of course, Stable Diffusion is free.This is a step in the right direction, but I feel that it is too little, too late. Just compare the rate of development. Midjourney has cranked out a number of different models, including an extremely exciting new model (&#34;--testp&#34;), new upscaling features, improved facial features, and a bunch more. They&#39;re also super responsive to their communtiy. In the meantime, OpenAI did... what? Outpainting? (And for months, DALL-E had an issue where clicking on any image on the homepage would instantly consume a token. How could it take so long to fix such a serious error?) You have this incredible tool everyone is so excited to use that they&#39;re producing hundred-page documents on how to get better results out of it, and somehow none of that actually makes it into the product?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently sign ups are currently down because of a &#34;vendor outage&#34;. Perhaps because of the increased load?Once you&#39;re able to get access, I believe you&#39;ll receive 15 credits per month for free. Each credit allows one generation, and each generation produces 4 images.Rather than using up credits trying to learn how to formulate your prompts, I ran hundreds and uploaded them to https://generrated.com (I posted it a couple of weeks ago as a Show HN) — hopefully they might be useful as a starting point and save you some credits/money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The divide between SD and DALLE doesn&#39;t matter for anything meaningful. The tech is advancing at a breakneck speed. I really cannot emphasize that enough. If SD is behind today, I wouldn&#39;t even be the least bit surprised if it&#39;s ahead in one month from now. Or be where DALL-E is today and DALLE just be that much further.I suspect that even in 6 months from now people will be starting to see consistently good generation from &#34;worse&#34; prompting. The cat is out of the bag on this and running way faster than anticipated. Hold on, because the &#34;AI generating fake media&#34; thought experiment of the last decade has now officially gone live."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; installed desktop web apps are really starting to look and feel like native appsI think we are having the opposite problem: native apps are really starting to look and feel like web apps, and in many cases, they are.The problem: the web has a terrible UI toolkit for desktop apps. It has clickable links and basic forms, that&#39;s all. It was made for documents, not apps. If you want better than that, you have to rewrite it all by yourself, or more likely, import a framework that does it for you. Traditional Windows apps all use system provided common controls, because they are good, and therefore they have a consistent look and feel, even through OS updates. It is even user customizable. Now it is not uncommon to see 10 different styles in a single screen, Windows since 8 is not even consistent with itself, and it is becoming worse every version. And it is not just aesthetics, there are serious usability concerns here, and system-wide customization is gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually wish programs do not put content in the Title bar area. The title bar area is meant for users to move the Window around.Try opening Microsoft Word, make the window narrow and drag the window. You have to hunt for a small bit of empty space in the title bar or you have to understand you could drag on the Title text, Search box and the Sign in Username, but not the Auto Save text, Upcoming Features icon, or the Ribbon Display Options icon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read comments and articles all the time about the quality of Google&#39;s search dropping. I haven&#39;t noticed it much in practice, but I&#39;m persistent, use copious ad blocking, and my Google-fu is strong, so I usually find what I&#39;m looking for.Image search is another story. I&#39;ve been less and less satisfied with Google Image search results, and visual search has been totally neutered. It only returns low res results that rarely match the original as well as it used to. I used to be able to plug in a 400x400 image and find a dozen copies of it at a usable size. No more. Too many copyright complaints, I assume. I&#39;ve started using Bing for image and visual search now. It&#39;s not as good as old Google Images, but marginally better in some cases than the current iteration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Image Search is deteriorating in certain areas for years. Namely:* Reverse Image Search (sometimes no matches although image is for sure out there). I wonder if Reverse Image search sometimes broken because of copyright?* NSFW images (I&#39;m really old enough and I don&#39;t need to be protected by Google or anyone else, I think it&#39;s a kind of censorship)* And now also Creative Commons as pointed out by OpThe best alternative (tested them all) is in my opinionhttps://yandex.com/images/Chrome extension for reverse image search supporting Yandexhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-image-researc...Android app supporting Yandex for Reverse Image Searchhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkfree....P.S.: I know Yandex is based in Russia, I only use it for specific image searches and I&#39;m happy we have a good alternative based outside of USA... I wished there were more in the World."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The key point here is &#34;... and hardly anyone noticed.&#34;In theory, site reliability engineers and software engineers work together at Google to maintain existing functionality and check for regressions. In practice, regression checks can only cover what they&#39;ve been told to cover, and if breaking a feature doesn&#39;t cause a metric to crash, Site Reliability doesn&#39;t have the information to know something is wrong.The result is that generally speaking, Google prioritizes existing features by how popular they are (i.e. &#34;Maintenance by Popularity&#34;) modulo how much of a stink someone influential can make if they screw it up (i.e. &#34;Maintenance by Twitter.&#34;). If almost nobody uses the CC filter (and I bet, in the grand scheme of things, they don&#39;t), Google may not have enough signal to know they broke the filter unless someone had the foresight to add a metric to check search results on that query separate from the rest of the search result data (and at Google&#39;s scale, you can&#39;t just add a metric for free; in addition to eng-hours to build and tune it, the data has to be stored somewhere and teams have finite budgets for space that can only be grown by negotiation with the relevant teams managing the monitoring services or the project as a whole)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Andrew here. Connor, thanks for releasing this on the orange site.This story is also more fun from my position. I&#39;ve been applying to internships and interviewing every week. They&#39;re mostly rejections. They&#39;re the same questions over and over with minor variation (sorry to top comment for &#34;impersonating&#34; your comment style). My days are deteriorating from a colorful sphere down to two points. In fact, down to two pointers, left and right, iterating over a list of heights to find how much rain water it can trap.I&#39;m about to repeat the experience for the 10th time and I&#39;m 100% on autopilot. But suddenly, a man reaches out to me on email and offers me up to $80/hr to be his senior engineer. This feels sketchy, my girlfriend tells me, &#34;you&#39;re good but let&#39;s be honest here...&#34;. Anyways, I proceed, it might just be the start of a beautiful thing. I&#39;m asked to interview as one of our developers because English is not their best language. I&#39;m a little bothered, but I was fine with it. But then I see the developer name: Connor Tumbleson. My laughter bursts and so does my suspicion: With a name like that, no way the guy doesn&#39;t speak good English. I look up Connor Tumbleson on linkedin, and my suspicions were proved correct. I detail everything to Connor, and now this is on the top of HN. I lost a opprotunity but gained a story of the lifetime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story is much more fun when you come at it from the interviewer&#39;s position. You&#39;ve been doing interviews every week. They&#39;re mostly rejections. They&#39;re the same questions over and over with minor variation. You&#39;re about to repeat the experience for the 18th time and you&#39;re 100% on autopilot. But suddenly you&#39;re in a spy thriller. This is the greatest thing that&#39;s ever happened.Is it a good legal/corporate decision to hide the person who claims to be the original and let him listen to the interview with the other candidate?

In 1996, this was a very big deal, such a newish concept that the project was written up in AdAge or some similar industry magazine.A few months later a prospective junior engineer came in for an interview. My manager asked him the typical &#34;tell me about an interesting project you&#39;ve worked on lately.&#34; He then proceeded to describe in detail the very project we had just completed, even referencing the magazine article about it (he must have forgotten he was interviewing at the company mentioned in the article). At the end of his presentation, my manager said &#34;That&#39;s interesting, because here at X, we just completed that project.&#34;Awkward silence. Then the interviewee got up and said &#34;I guess I should go now.&#34; My manager said &#34;Yes, I guess you should.&#34;Impersonation of this sort can be simultaneously disturbing and somehow comical. It isn&#39;t a new phenomenon; I&#39;m not decided on whether I believe the information age makes it easier or more difficult."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried using it in Portuguese and it&#39;s cool but it seems very off, just a huge number of things that don&#39;t sound even remotely natural or idiomatic. But when I click the translate button, the English translation is a perfectly reasonable thing to say.SO... I&#39;m highly suspecting that, behind the scenes, the &#34;real&#34; conversation is happening in English, and it&#39;s translating in both directions. Which is always going to be fairly disastrous, particularly with short snippets of conversational text. (In contrast, machine translation does best with long sentences of highly technical writing.)So the concept is very intriguing, but the problem is that it needs to rely on native language models per-language. (Or if it already is, then those models need a vastly better or larger training corpus.)So A+ for proof of concept, but I&#39;d never recommend anybody practice with this in order to learn/practice a language, because with the quality where it is, it will make you a worse speaker -- not better. The things it says are just too weird."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m stunned by how well this works for Japanese, the only language I think I&#39;m good enough at to judge the AI&#39;s responses.The speech recognition is flawless as far as I can tell. The AI occasionally gets itself into a loop of repeating my question or itself, but I think this has been a problem with a lot of chatbots. The only glaring errors I&#39;ve seen so far are these kinds of AI-specific issues, like forgetting context, getting geographical facts wrong, etc.&gt;こんにちは。今日はどちらへお出かけですか？ (Hello. Where are you headed?)京都に行きます. (I&#39;m going to Kyoto)&gt;素晴らしい都市ですね。行ったことはありますか？ (It&#39;s a great city. Have you been?)いや初めてです。お勧めの場所はありますか？. (Nope, it&#39;s my first time. Any places you suggest?)&gt;京都は歴史のある美しい都市です。たくさんのお寺や神社を訪れることができます。(Kyoto is a beautiful city with history. You can visit plenty of temples and shrines.)そうですね。清水寺とか聞いたことがある。行きたいんだ. (True. I&#39;ve heard of like, Kiyomizudera, and I want to go.)&gt;清水寺は必見です！とても人気のあるお寺で、市内を一望できるんですよ(Kiyomizudera is a must-see! It&#39;s a very popular temple, and you can see the whole area at once)Not only does it know about Kyoto, but it knows about a specific temple (picked it up via speech recognition too). Translations are rough and by me, not quazel.This could be a real game changer if the other languages are this good.Additionally, if you register an account then you get access to the &#34;Scene builder&#34; which lets you set up a situation to start the conversation in. I have found that you can redirect any conversation to pretty much anything, but I thought it was a cool idea that many people here averse to account-making might have missed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great. They mentioned a few months ago their will to open-source it [1] and now it&#39;s finally a reality, so props to Kenton and the Workers team on achieving it!I&#39;ve dug a bit on the OSS repo [2], and here are some of the findings I got:    1. They are using a forked version of V8 with very small/clean set of changes (the diff with the changes is really minimal. Not sure if this makes sense, but it might be interesting to see if changes could be added upstream)
    2. It&#39;s coded mainly in C++, with Bazel for the builds and a mix between CapNProto and Protocol Buffers for schema
    3. They worked deeply the Developer Experience, so as developer you can start using `workerd` with pre-build binaries via NPM/NPX  (`npx workerd`). Still a few rough edges around but things are looking promising [3].
    4. I couldn&#39;t find the implementation anywhere of the KV store. Is it possible to use it? How it will work?

Open sourcing the engine, mixed with their recent announcement on a $1.25B investment fund for startups built on workers [4] I think will propel a lot the Wasm ecosystem... which I&#39;m quite excited about![1] https://twitter.com/KentonVarda/status/1523666343412654081[2] https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd[3] https://www.npmjs.com/package/workerd[4] https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-launchpad/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great. The Cloudflare model for Workers really deserves to become a de facto standard that can be pulled off the shelf for open source serverless functions. Really excited they’re opening this up this way. It seems like a great positive sum move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Workers are so damn good and easy…I am originally from the PHP/Laravel world, recently had to quickly develop a very simple (5 endpoints) REST API and decided to give CF workers &amp; KV storage a try. In an hour the API was running in production…CF is really, really good at many things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Swedish national seismic network picked up two explosions within kilometers of the reported gas leak locations yesterday.The time of the first explosion: Yesterday, Monday morning at 02:03 am, second one Monday evening at 7:04pm (local time, CEST).The reports of the gas leaks came at 1:52pm and 8:41pm, respectively - by means of ships reporting bubbling at the surface level.One of the two events registered at magnitude 2.3. They were picked up by stations all over the country.It&#39;s clear from the registered seismic waves that the events are not earthquakes.- You can clearly see how the waves bounce from the bottom to the surface. There is no doubt that it was a blast or explosion. We even had a station in Kalix [quite far up north, some 1300 km away] that picked this up, says Björn Lund, who is a lecturer in seismology and director of the Swedish national seismic network, which measures Swedish earthquakes and explosions.Translated and summarized from: https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/svt-avslojar-tva-explosio... (Sweden&#39;s national public service broadcaster, within the last hour)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I were a betting man, I&#39;d put my money on Poland.The Polish prime minister immediately called &#34;sabotage&#34; and fingered Russia, while everyone else is still saying &#34;it could be sabotage but we need to investigate first&#34;.Russia wants the taps capable of being turned ON at their discretion, not permanently broken. This hurts their bargaining position in a big way because they&#39;ve just lost their biggest source of leverage against Germany.Poland opened a new pipeline to Norway on the same day as the leaks appeared, so there was lots of Polish activity in the waters.Poland doesn&#39;t receive gas via Nordstream, so damaging it doesn&#39;t hurt them in any way.Poland is Ukraine&#39;s most ardent supporter in Europe, often leading the vanguard of actions to support Ukraine. They&#39;d have a strong motive to ensure that the rest of Europe doesn&#39;t waver in its commitment to keep the Russian taps off.It could be argued that since Europe has already decided to never turn on Nordstream again, the fallout from such an act of sabotage is minimal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see a mention that today is the day Poland officially opens up its pipeline to Denmark and Norway. The pipeline Russia (and to a much lesser extent Germany) put a lot of resources trying to jeopardize.Some of the things those two countries did include: Financing of various &#34;grassroots ecology groups&#34; that managed to find an extremely important field mouse (no joke!) habitat on the planned route which caused many months of delays in Denmark. Constant media pressure and a smear campaign of lies against PL in Europe and elsewhere. And many more including those we don&#39;t know about. No one is surprised at all that they would blow up their own pipeline to gain various PR points in sympathetic media."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are significantly worst things happening in the industry by much much bigger consultancy names. We, an enterprise, hire complete teams from the consultancy that would pick some of the work in different projects with their own product owner and so on but under our contract.We seldom see all the people whom we interviewed for the teams, as devs, being present in the meetings that they are all expected to be present (of course it is most often the timezone difference that is the mentioned reason). Or people who join have their camera turned off, so no way to see them.Code quality that comes, is not on par with the skillset we evaluated during the interviews and I suspect the whole consultancy is doing something similar with presenting top engineers in the interview and then moving them between many teams. Leaving the less skilled engineer to do the work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been remote hiring for years. Remote positions are a magnet for fraud of all types.If you have the budget, I highly recommend moving your compensation points up and focusing on top engineers in remote locations. It&#39;s much easier to vet people who have an established online track record and you can tap references from well-known companies. Unfortunately this way you will miss out on some great candidates that haven&#39;t yet established themselves, so you still have to branch out.For remote work we require video interviews and cameras on during meetings. We&#39;d make an exception if someone really needed accommodations to keep their camera off for some reason, but otherwise it&#39;s cameras on. I know some people don&#39;t like this, but it improves communication and team cohesion in a noticeable way. It also immediately highlights fraud like this.Get your security team involved. You should be tracking where remote employees access your VPN and company services. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask about discrepancies and changes. If someone has logged in from one IP or region for the first 4 weeks and then suddenly you&#39;re seeing new logins from a different city or country, investigate. I don&#39;t care if people travel, but we need to firmly understand the security situation.Watch out for people with frequent excuses for missing meetings, having to turn their camera off, excuses like &#34;my camera isn&#39;t working today&#34;, and so on. Send everyone known-good webcams and company laptops.And as always, performance management is key. Managing remote is harder than managing in person, and I say that as someone who manages remote and loves remote teams. You need strong performance management practices in place and clear ways to measure it. People who aren&#39;t getting their work done should show up quickly in your system and warrant additional manager investigation.But if someone shows up in Zoom who isn&#39;t the person you hired, lock it down ASAP. Don&#39;t let being &#34;nice&#34; get in the way of handling an urgent security situation. Someone you didn&#39;t hire who hasn&#39;t agreed to your contracts is in your system, and that&#39;s a red alert emergency."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Late last year we had a candidate who seemed really promising: she had a CS degree from an Ivy League school and had a few years of work experience using relevant technologies.She absolutely killed the Byteboard technical assessment, and seemed like a good cultural fit during my initial screen. I advised the technical interviewer that he didn&#39;t need to go too deep; I was satisfied with her answers on the technical assessment. Then something odd happened - she completely bombed the interview. The interviewer told me that she couldn&#39;t even answer the most basic questions e.g. &#34;what tech stack does your employer use?&#34; I was thoroughly confused about that, but still passed her on to the VPE to help us get to the bottom of the discrepancy. Our VPE confirmed the previous technical interviewer&#39;s assessment.We came to the conclusion that she could not have completed the technical assessment on her own and obviously didn&#39;t move forward from there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like the engineering principles in general that the Go team uses, however, I just don&#39;t like Go. That isn&#39;t meant as a slight or anything other than simply my opinion. That said, I really like the idea of a simple language based on the sort of principles demonstrated here. The runtime seems really nice, I just wish I liked the language better (IMO: not expressive enough, needs better error handling, needs much better enums, needs pattern matching, has error prone C-style &#39;for&#39;, almost everything is statements not expressions, special comments are error prone, has nil pointers, etc.). In the end I think if someone were to write a slightly simpler version of Rust with the Go runtime it might be pretty neat. That said, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d want to drop from Rust so maybe I&#39;m just fantasizing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love go as a platform.. self contained binaries have been a miracle for ops..but have a few big hangups about using the language full time because of the sucky ergonomics.* No optional/named parameters. Writing a whole function per parameter for function chaining is excessive. This would not be difficult to add to the compiler (i&#39;ve done it and have seriously considered using the fork) but it seems like the team is just stubborn about adding stuff like this.* No default struct values. 0 isn&#39;t good enough in real world scenarios.. have fun writing BlahInit(...) for everything.* Would be nice to get the question mark syntax for error handling. Error handling shorthand for if err != nil would also be very welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really grateful for everyone who has made Go possible and continues to make it better. Well done language design, extensive standard library, good tooling, and great documentation is something that&#39;s almost impossible to find despite there being a multitude of languages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a recipe for cold solder joints and solder bridges and doesn&#39;t seem like it saves time.What you really want to do when you have dozens of jumper wires is to do an array-of-struct to struct-of-array transform on the steps. Instead of cutting, stripping, tinning, and soldering one wire at a time, cut all your wires, then strip them all, then tin them all, then solder them one by one.Here&#39;s a pro tip: when you tin the wires, lay the iron flat on your workbench with tip out into air and tin by laying the end of the wire on top and then adding the solder.Another pro tip: use a pair of needle nose pliers to bend the tinned leads by a little over 90 degrees to make a little hook. When you solder to the board you can apply a little tension and let the solder flow into the hole. Makes very string solder joints."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh boy, nice idea, but this looks complicated and time consuming. I recommend to get some good equipment first:  - solder fume extractor (see below)
  - extra thin high quality tin
  - a desoldering pump AND desoldering wire
  - high quality flux
  - a TS 100 soldering Iron with KU tip from ali express for 50 bucks
  - optional: USB-C Power Adapter for your existing power supply (so you don&#39;t have to buy one)
  - optional: a soldering mat (normaly blue colored)

and you have a near professional equipment for about $120. Now flash IronOS[1] on your soldering Iron, and it works even better.Instructions:  - turn on solder fume extractor
  - heat iron to 370° Celsius (but be careful depending on your workpiece)
  - Tin both ends beforhand
  - better slightly more flux to put on (but not for small works) 
  - if flux has been applied, cleaning up with e.g. toothbrush &amp; isopropyl alcohol after you&#39;re done maybe a good idea

However, the most important peace of hardware is a solder fume extractor... I&#39;m surprised that so many youtube &#34;professionals&#34; don&#39;t put a hint on this - never play with your health. This can even be done DIY (see youtube tutorials).High quality flux is also important because of your health. Chinese sellers often don&#39;t care about ingredients...High quality tin is much easier to work with and costs 5 bucks more than low quality tin. It is worth.[1]: https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bad advice. Just use a good solder iron, thin solder (possibly leaded), and good no clean flux, then lots of practice. It&#39;s all about timing: too quick = cold solder joint; too slow = burned pad/track, or part. Learn also to understand about thermal mass and how to change the temperature and timings according to what you&#39;re soldering and its size.Also, that iron looks like a Hakko &#34;936&#34; cheap clone: they are barely above the garbage level; get a better one. Used Wellers aren&#39;t that expensive, and no, you won&#39;t need a microcontroller for digital temperature control and all those gimmicks they put in modern solder irons. I also have a PineCil from the same folks that made the PinePhone and was amazed by its quality. Yes, it has a mcu for digital temperature control, but I&#39;d lie if I wrote that I used any of its functions beyond setting the temperature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; After about a kilometer I have to cross a busy street, I need to pause there regularly. Pausing always fixes erratic mode.Given that the “erratic mode” only impacts the beginning of the run and disappears suddenly at known locations, this sounds like an issue of delayed GPS lock.And given that the problem didn’t exist in the past, it could be a software issue due to upgrades. Or it could be a hardware issue that developed over time, such as something impacting GPS receive sensitivity. Or it could even be a new source of RF interference in the GPS range near the author’s start point, which impacts GPS lock until they get far enough away from it.Interesting issue, but note that this issue appears to be specific to this one specific person, not a general issue with all Apple Watches as some in this thread are speculating. I certainly have not noticed this behavior on my Watch even with the latest updates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Semi related iWatch Rant - if you think running data is bad, try tracking your sleep.It just doesn&#39;t work.- Sleep for 3h - wake up for 1, sleep for 5 more: records 3h only.- (being a parent of a small baby) do not sleep at all during the night, sleep 4+3 hours during the day: 0 hours recorded- sleep trough the night but wake up every 90-100 minutes (baby again): 0 hours recordedDamn, this is a $500+ device, and it cant even get basic sleep data correctly.
Also, it takes anywhere from 1min to couple of hours for data to appear in the Health app.OTOH my wife has ~3 year old Huawei Fit watch, which was about $120, and that thing records every 10-15min or longer nap. Without a mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m part of a running group with a mix of Garmin and Apple Watches and the Apple Watches always have pretty different distant readings according to Strava, maybe 2%-5%. The Garmin devices are generally much closer together.I wonder if the dual-band GPS on the Apple Watch Ultra is an attempt to fix these problems? I would guess that it’s software, with the author, if for no other reason than I’d be surprised if Garmin were all that much better at putting GPS in a tiny housing than Apple."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; But math never decreed that sine and cosine have to take radian arguments!That is not entirely true. It comes from the relationship between those functions and the complex numbers via the Euler formula.     ix
    e    = cos x   +   i sin x

There may be arithmetic/numerical inconveniences, but that&#39;s not all there is to &#34;math&#34;.Let&#39;s define ncos and nsin (&#34;nice cos, nice sin&#34;) as follows:   nsin x = sin 2πx
   ncos x = cos 2πx

So then what do we make of:   ncos x   +   i nsin x

This has to be   cos 2πx  +   i sin 2πx

which is then     2πix        (   2π) ix        ix 
   e           = ( e   )      =  f 

      
           2π
Where f = e    is a weird number like 535.4916. This f doesn&#39;t have nice properties. E.g.:      d     x           x
      -   f     /=    f 
      dx

Otherwise it works; for instance 90 degrees is 0.25 and surely enough     0.25i 
   f          = i

In situations not involving e in relation to angular representations via Euler, f cannot replace e.I&#39;m all for having parallel trig functions in libraries that work with turns, though.The annoying 2π factor shows up in lots of places though. Should way, say, in electronics, redefine a new version of capacitive reactance which doesn&#39;t have 2πf in the denominator, but only f?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author makes the point that turns allow for exact representation of many commonly used angles, but with binary floating point, many common angles (1/6 of a turn, for example) are inexact.This could be addressed by using a whole number other than 1 to represent a turn ... one that is a multiple of 3 (or 3x3) and 5, and while we&#39;re at it, 2 (or 2x2x2), so most commonly-used angles are whole numbers!  That gives us 360 as the value representing a whole turn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Indeed, maths never &#34;decreed that sine and cosine have to take radian arguments&#34;. But thinking that makes any sort of point is a fundamental misunderstanding of maths.There are infinitely many sinusoidal functions out there. You can just adjust amplitude, frequency and phase to your heart&#39;s content.Trigonometry basically requires that sine and cosine have specific amplitudes and phases, but gives not one shit about how you map angles to frequency. Degrees are completely arbitrary, but both radians and turns have pretty natural definitions, with turns indeed being the easiest to work with. So far so good.Calculus does have an opinion on frequency, though. There is exactly one non-trivial pair of sinusoids s(x) and c(x) where c&#39;(x) = - s(x) and s&#39;(x) = c(x), among a bunch of other very useful properties.When you put calculus and geometry together, s and c are have the same amplitude and phase as sine and cosine from geometry, and the two pairs are exactly the same if you match the frequencies such that the argument is the angle measured in radians. It&#39;s just so damned useful to use angles in radians and make everything play together nicely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can relate to the frustration of the author.
I wrote an open source library which gets downloaded 50K+ times per week.
At one point, I hadn&#39;t updated it in several months and people started asking if the project is dead...
In fact, it wasn&#39;t updated in a while because it had been working perfectly and was built in a forward-compatible way; that makes it more healthy and therefore more alive than probably 99% of libraries on the internet.The expectation that software libraries or frameworks should break every few months is disturbing. I think this may be due to the fact that many of the most popular frameworks do this.
I find that React-based apps tend to break every few months for a range of reasons; often because of reliance on obscure functionality or bundling of binaries which aren&#39;t forward-compatible with newer engine versions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So I had to spend four hours on Saturday upgrading all my platform libraries simply so that I could compile the damn app.I sort of assume this is the actual point? Apple presumably wants to drop support for older versions of the SDKs, and that requires that app developers update to the newer versions. I think you can make a reasonable argument that dumping work on third-party developers to simplify things for themselves is bad, but the author&#39;s belief that it was simply pointless busywork is probably incorrect from Apple&#39;s perspective.I suspect the minimum download threshold to be exempt from this is _very_ high. Maintaining backwards compatibility for a small fixed set of apps doing things an old way is a categorically different problem from maintaining backwards compatibility for every app out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think culling games/apps based on age is the right approach to improving discoverability.I don&#39;t see Nintendo removing old Switch games from the eShop.I don&#39;t see Apple Music removing the Beatles because they haven&#39;t updated recently.My recommendation, which Apple&#39;s (obnoxious) ad business would never accept, would be to1. Remove the obnoxious and generally useless ads which eat up the top half of the first page of app search on the iPhone.2. Improve app search with more options and a fast, responsive UI. Also they might consider allowing you to consider ratings from other sources such as critical reviews vs. user reviews (a la metacritic.)3. Better human curation with more categories. This is the same approach that Apple Music takes and it seems to work well. Games should have Artist/Studio/Developer pages as well as Essentials lists to facilitate discovery. Same with genre/category essentials, which have a rotating list that can be saved/bookmarked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A key fact to understand in thinking about cheating in over the board chess: a strong player can defeat a much stronger opponent with just 1-3 hints per game indicating the strongest move.  For example, most chess experts agree that a ~2600 rated player with 2-3 hints at key moments per game would be expected to beat a ~2800 rated player.  Many people might assume that a cheater needs guidance every move, thereby requiring a potentially more obvious cheating mechanism. That is not the case.Also, clever cheating devices have been found in over the board chess competitions.  So, this is possible.  Moreover, one needn&#39;t carry a device on themselves.  A cheater may have accomplices providing hints, if they carry a device.It will be interesting to see how chess tournaments, as well as FIDE, chess.com, and other major chess institutions react to this situation.  The potential for cheating has now been brought to the absolute forefront of chess discussion.  And Carlsen&#39;s actions have been questioned by FIDE in recent interviews, with FIDE staff condemning &#34;vigilantism&#34; of a kind.Some set of resolutions seems necessary--perhaps standards for security in major chess tournaments, perhaps an alliance to share cheating or reliability data amongst major chess operations, perhaps a standard term in major chess tournament agreements that no previously identified cheaters (online or otherwise) will be allowed to play, and perhaps sanctions in some form against Carlsen (or Niemann, if concrete evidence against him emerges)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine you know someone with a history of stealing cars and other valuable objects. He has been caught multiple times. Now you see him with a shiny new car that you’re pretty sure he can’t afford.Did he steal it? Not necessarily — it’s entirely possible that he got a higher-paying legit job and saved up for it, or inherited money from a relative, or got it legally in some other way. He shouldn’t be convicted of a new crime with no other evidence just because he committed similar crimes in the past.However, it would be entirely natural for a reasonable person to assume that theft is the most likely explanation of the facts, and to avoid trusting that person.This is basically what happened with Hans. He has been caught cheating multiple times, and then had an unusually fast rise in rating. Is that rise impossible? No. But it’s consistent with cheating, and given his history, cheating is the simplest explanation.So it would be totally normal for Magnus to refuse to trust such a person even though it can’t be conclusively proven that he’s still dirty. But even then, Magnus agreed to play against him, until further circumstantial evidence came to light and it just got to be too much.So, is it possible that Hans is clean? Sure. If that’s indeed the case, do I feel sorry for him? No. He made the choice to destroy his own reputation when he cheated multiple times. If he doesn’t get the benefit of the doubt now, it’s on him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe people might be seriously underestimating just how good Magnus may be at detecting cheating.Dude probably trains with computers regularly. He has a better memory than 10 average Joe&#39;s combined. He&#39;s been the absolute #1 of the world for what, 10 years now?He wouldn&#39;t risk his whole reputation for nothing.I personally take his suspicions very seriously, though I agree that evidence has to be presented sooner or later."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; So let me put it plainly: the CTO/VPE/Engineering Director candidate should pass your coding interview. In fact, they should excel.People who work full-time as developers spend hundreds of hours practicing leetcode and hackerrank so that they can pass the interview, but a CTO who&#39;s 5 levels above and hasn&#39;t logged to Github for 3 years should excel at it? Come on.I agree with the premise of the article, CTO should be technical, but I don&#39;t think that &#34;technical&#34; and &#34;great at coding&#34; are the same. One of the best CTOs I&#39;ve had came from a product background. He was technical enough to understand the technical discussions and he was able to support his directors in hiring plans, technical decisions etc. but he wouldn&#39;t pass any coding test more complex than FizzBuzz. Still, he was great at his job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just became a CTO. So, let me bear my thoughts.Since July of this year I&#39;ve been CTO for a small games company, I&#39;ve worked in this industry before in a more specialised role but this is much broader scope.I&#39;ve gone from being responsible for 1 person to 10 which will likely become 50 by the end of next year.I&#39;m terrified.I&#39;m terrified because I feel like I will let my reports down.I&#39;m terrified because a lot of the work I&#39;m doing lacks transparency, how do I tell my compatriots about things that may not come to pass, especially deep political things -- and the amount of work necessary to onboard/offboard people, about &#34;strategic partnerships&#34; and why they&#39;re taken, or not taken or any of the hundreds of other things which are changing direction 3 times a day each.I am technical, deeply, passionately technical.I will not do service to people by being technical, my days are too fragmented, my worries too broad, it&#39;s impossible to dig into a small focused problem and give it the treatment it deserves - and even if I could then I&#39;d be dooming one of my colleagues to maintain it forever because I couldn&#39;t possibly..My being technical is good because I know the problems and I know what can make people feel valued; I can give people autonomy and direction and I can understand when help is needed and how to give it.However, almost nothing in my work is technical, it&#39;s all presentations, discussions, breakdowns, timelines, contracts and negotiation.The most code I write now is to do cost reporting.My most frequently accessed cloud console pages are the billing sections.This is not fun at all (and frankly, I didn&#39;t think it would be); but I fear what will replace me if I leave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d say it&#39;s important for a CTO to be a CTO.  I&#39;ve been at too many places where the CTO only wanted to be a software developer/architect and would not focus on process, cost, employees, etc.  CTO is a leadership role, and leadership means you have to take care of all the responsibilities under your authority, not just the interesting ones.IMHO, too many people chase the CTO title but few really want the actual job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a difference between remembering something (like a fact) and a deep understanding of a concept.Let me give you an example in programming: I sometimes have to google for the names of functions I&#39;ve already used a hundred times. Sometimes extremely simple functions (just a while ago it was list.size() in Java), only because I can&#39;t remember the name of the function, but of course I understand the concept - the length of a list/array. I just can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s length(), or size() or count(), or whatever.This deep understanding feels quite different from simple memorization. It feels more like something in my body, similar to muscle memory or like playing a piano piece. It&#39;s something I feel I will never forget.I&#39;d love to learn more about this kind of understanding. For years I&#39;ve tried to find good reading about it, but much has been disappointing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has been using Anki for the past 4 years to learn Japanese and now Chinese, I&#39;ve recently found that the initial &#34;learning&#34; step is not that hard. (i.e., given 辞書, I remember &#34;dictionary&#34;) What is hard is keeping the content I&#39;ve learned, _learned_, for more than a day.So now I&#39;m wondering, is my initial &#34;learning&#34; process wrong? Since definitions are fairly simple and I find them easy to remember at first but hard to hold onto. And my process in Anki for New cards is to rep them like reviewed cards until I pass the card; so really, I&#39;m just staring at the kanji + definition until I remember it.This brings me to my question: is there more Anki can do when it comes to learning new cards? Is there something we can do when learning new information that will help make it &#34;sticky&#34;? Especially in regards to &#34;simple&#34; facts, like basic kanji -&gt; definition mappings, where there are no mechanics to understand, just simple mappings.Edit (an addition):Also, I love SRS, but I don&#39;t understand how it can be advertised as completely different than rote memorization. When you learn a new physical flashcard, you&#39;re learning it the same way as you would be when learning a new Anki card. The only difference is that Anki will show it to you again at a more efficient time in the future, rather than at some regular interval."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Calling learning remembering, is like calling a computer a hard drive. Sorry, but, remembering is just one part, although important part of learning. There is loads of difference between remembering the words of a foreign language and fluently speaking it. The process of learning is complicated, eg. good teaching is not giving the final answers to learner, which should seem faster, but letting the learner arrive at their answers, even sometimes arriving at a wrong answer at first.
And the point about reducing forgetting, that&#39;s also a terrible way of learning. If you want to minimize forgetting, that means you have to learn in baby steps, repeat everything using some kind of spaced repetition algorithm, and endure the pain of doing all this for a considerate amount of time. Instead, learning the content rapidly (meanwhile forgetting a lot of the content), getting a whole picture, and gradually gain more understanding repeating the process using different textbooks/courses, is a much more faster way of learning. The brain is more used to BFS (breadth-first-search) than DFS (depth-first-search), and the whole process is much more stimulating. This is because new knowledge needs to be encoded with connections to pre-existing knowledge, and most knowledge is intertwined together, for example in calculus, limits, derivatives, integrals, infinite series, etc. Learning limits in isolation of the whole picture, optimizing for less percentage of forgetting, often leaves learners confused, why am I even learning this, and what use is this for. Even though the percentage of forgetting is much higher in the latter holistic BFS process, the overall content mastered in the same month or week duration is higher. So forgetting is actually normal and you shouldn&#39;t panic when you forget things- since you will gain more understanding each time you learn and re-learn the content.
For the last ten years, I&#39;ve been making products for learning, and every day now and then, I&#39;m still learning something new about learning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the vpmullq part the most stunning.This instruction is used in some bignum code, for example if you are implementing RSA. Yet AMD implemented it three times faster than Intel.I&#39;m also fascinated by AMD now making AVX512 worthwhile on consumer devices (where they would until quite recently artificially slow down Intel CPUs that had it), which presumably will lead to widespread adoption where it matters. Intels strategy of turning off AVX512 in the recent consumer devices because their energy efficiency cores don&#39;t have it may turn out to be a monumental mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"phoronix:AMD Zen 4 AVX-512 Performance Analysis On The Ryzen 9 7950Xhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-avx512&#34;On average for the tested AVX-512 workloads, making use of the AVX-512 instructions led to around 59% higher performance compared to when artificially limiting the Ryzen 9 7950X to AVX2 / no-AVX512.From these results I am rather impressed by the AVX-512 performance out of the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X. While initially being disappointed when hearing of their &#34;double pumping&#34; approach rather than going for a 512-bit data path, these benchmark results speak for themselves. For software that can effectively make use of AVX-512 (and compiled so), there is significant performance uplift to enjoy while no negative impact in terms of reduced CPU clock speeds / higher power consumption (with oneDNN being one of the only exceptions seen so far in terms of higher power draw).AVX-512 is looking good on the Ryzen 7000 series and I&#39;ll continue running more benchmarks over the weeks ahead. These AVX-512 results make me all the more excited for AMD EPYC &#34;Genoa&#34; where AVX-512 can be a lot more widely-used among HPC/server workloads. &#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great implementation of the wrong solution.  The problem isn&#39;t that SIM security is weak but it&#39;s that we&#39;re using SIM/eSIM for identification and authorization in the first place. When we stop using SIM for authentication the need to guard against SIM Swap attacks goes away as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is there no opposition to this shit? SIMs were physical for a reason. As a consumer what do you get out of it? You have to go through the carriers to switch between phones now! You can&#39;t just pick up a random unlocked phone and put a sim in it. No more burner phones. I have been in situations where I changed SIM between phones multiple times a day.But it sounds like it is too late for this. It&#39;s like people who oppose cash payments out of the convenience of card/app payments. This small chipping away of a small libery adds up.I hope eveyone knows that you can&#39;t as a layman register an email address or any meaningful service you depend on without a phone number (i.e.: a sim), that is what is being regulated here even more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is this even Zero Trust. Admittedly, there is no precise definition for ZT, but Cloudflare&#39;s solution seems to run counter to the idea of perimeter-less ZT philosophy. Instead of assuming that phones can be insecure and developing appropriate crypto based mechanisms, Cloudflare is proposing to bring the phone inside a &#39;trusted&#39; network. Remember, ZT does not rely on trusted network.Solutions like this will increase confusion and fragment the already &#39;interpretation led&#39; as opposed to definition led ZT landscape."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many are of the listed items are merely being deprecated. These shouldn’t really qualify as breaking changes. In fact, the ability to migrate away incrementally is precisely the point of deprecating instead of removing a feature.What surprises me is that a lot of the deprecated functionality seems really recent — C++14 or newer. Compatibility is C++’s big thing, that’s historically why it kept almost all of C as a sublanguage. I know organizations where migrating to C++11 is still an ongoing process. It’s not great news if features become obsolete faster than many users can adopt them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wait, so the words &#34;concepts&#34; and &#34;requires&#34; were newly made keywords, and this breaks code, but the words &#34;yield&#34; and &#34;await&#34; were determined too important and too common to standards members that they needed to be renamed to the horrifically ugly &#34;co_await&#34; and &#34;co_yield&#34;?Also, last time I actually tried to use C++20 none of the standard library implementations had std::format; has this changed now?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a note but I&#39;m fairly certain this is purely from the perspective of Google Chrome, meaning it excludes google3 (Google&#39;s repo for nearly all Google services). I don&#39;t know this for a fact but I suspect it&#39;s the case. I only bring it up because google3 C++ is (or was; it&#39;s now been years since I&#39;ve done this directly) a very different beast. It was notionally compliant with recent standards but a very restrictive subset of features were allowed.The C++ standard currently sits at &gt;1800 pages. Looking through these examples, I&#39;m honestly horrified. The semantics around moving and copying and the many ways you can initialize a variable [1] and how you can mess that up so it&#39;s actually a copy instead of a move is just mind-bending.Can we also talk about how in 2022 we&#39;re still talking about and getting wrong const-correctness? I guess we&#39;re going ever further now because this presentation touches on constexpr correctness (as in const vs constexpr).Another thought: problems like comparisons between base and derived problems shouldn&#39;t even be problems (IMHO) because you&#39;ve already messed up by wanting that behaviour.The change about not doing arithmetic on enum values is a good one but pretty late.TIL this is a valid way to cast:    size_t{expanded_size}

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I didn&#39;t appreciate until recently that the calendar we live by today was personally designed by Julius Caesar.Like not by some forgotten technocrats incidentally during his time, but Julius Caesar himself as a subject matter expert, as a side-project.  With consultation, certainly, but by his initiative, from long-standing engagement with the problem in one of his early jobs from long before he was a main character of the Roman story.Digestable and entertaining (fragment of a) video on the topic:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD-R35DSSZY&amp;t=1312s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the implication that aliens are rational and have no subrational concepts due to tradition and habit interesting, as it sort of implies that these kinds of outgrowths are not necessary and can just be done away with.  The narrator starts from a position of not wanting to legitimize or historicize beyond reductive statements like &#34;some ancient civilization did XYZ&#34;.  I&#39;ll admit that I skimmed through the last part of the thread, so I might have missed something, but I don&#39;t see any mention of the decimal calendar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar, or why that failed.  I get that this is supposed to be funny, but the indirect message of getting rid of whatever doesn&#39;t make conscious sense is simplistic, and spoils the fun for me.  Humans are stupid, very funny."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This gets even more complicated when you introduce dealing with foreign countries that actually don&#39;t follow the western calendar system. Such as the standard Persian calendar months and years. Also, did you know that the arabic Islamic calendar dates and the persian calendar dates don&#39;t agree?  Because the traditional calendar dating back to the maximum geograhpical extent of the Persian empire is solar based, while the standard Islamic calendar is entirely lunar based.And the persian calendar is solar based and the year resets on Nowruz (new years day) around the spring equinox, but the practiced holidays are based on the lunar islamic months? But also some holidays like Nowruz are observed based on the solar date.This means you&#39;ve got Nowruz occuring on approximately the same time in the weather season every year, while relative to the western calendar, notable holidays like Eid al-fitr and Eid al-adha and the start of Ramadan etc move backwards in calendar date approxiamtely 10 or 11 days per year. Some years Ramadan might occur in the middle of winter and much later on it will be in the middle of summer.This series of tweets doesn&#39;t even begin to get into the possible opportunities for confusion when working between three different calendar systems...  And western countries where the standard work week is M-F but others where Friday is the day of rest and people work on a 6-day work week on a persian or arabic islamic calendar, but some companies give their employees a two day weekend so they&#39;re off on Friday and Saturday, but the local timezone equivalent of Sunday is definitely a normal workday...  I could go on."</p>

As an example of the level of their service, you can send them a box of loose parts, no part numbers,  no markings, and they&#39;ll go through it, figure out what&#39;s what, and refund you for it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"McMaster-Carr is an incredible example of how an existing physical-product distributor with a vaunted historical operations department, when faced with moving into the e-commerce world, could choose one of two paths:- Build an online presence cheaply because you can rely on your historical offline operations to paper over any shortcomings in the online system.- Build an online presence with the same ethos, standards, creativity, and long-term continued investment with which you built your offline operations to be your competitive advantage in the first place.There aren&#39;t many legacy organizations that successfully digitized with that second path in mind, at least not at first - McMaster, B&amp;H Photo, and Sweetwater come to mind as notable exceptions. It&#39;s a useful thought experiment, I think, even for those working on startups and green-field projects."</p>

Hence, a lot of screen space is wasted and the user has to scroll more. Larger font sizes on mobile are usually not a good idea as the device tends to be closer to your eyes anyway.A snippet that could work better in my opinion is the following:    html {
      max-width: 70ch;

      padding: calc(1vmin + .5rem);

If you don&#39;t think your software does X... don&#39;t just assume it. Look it up.I&#39;ve been astonished at how often a feature was added 3 years ago to a program I&#39;ve used for 8 years, or there&#39;s a secret swipe that avoids a bunch of menus, or an unofficial command-line flag.And it really leaves me feeling deeply conflicted. Because on the one hand, I still believe in the virtue of learning your tools inside and out. I would read the manual and be proud I knew exactly what every program/language could and couldn&#39;t do. But on the other hand, is that really just a waste of time? Programs have so many features now, that instead of learning all the things via discoverability or a manual, we just learn them by... querying how to do things when we need them.I don&#39;t really like the idea of so fundamentally relying on Google and forums and tutorials and Reddit and YouTube videos as the main way of learning how to use software. But at the same time, software does so much now and adds new things so quickly that it appears to be the only reasonable way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actions listed in the article are fairly non-essential, but many fundamental iOS functions also have discoverability issues, as well as some head-scratching design choices.  For example:- seeing notifications requires swiping down specifically from the top left- turning on the flashlight requires swiping down specifically from the top right.  Swiping down from top left also gets you a flashlight button, but it is not actionable.  The flashlight button on the home screen is also not actionable.- universal search requires swiping to the left of the app pages.  Swiping past the right end of the app pages also gets you a search bar, but it will only show you apps- Seeing your open apps requires swiping up slowly from the bottom of the page.- turning the phone off requires holding two unrelated buttonsMobile UX generally is heavily-dependent on gestures, which inherently creates discoverability challenges, but it seems like Apple goes out of its way to hide every basic function behind a very specific swipe.  It makes me wonder if they intentionally design their products to be exclusively usable by tech-savvy people.Another possible explanation is that design requires users to develop muscle memory over time that will improve experience in the long run and makes competitors feel unnatural."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a comment on the quality of this application, but rather a tangential topic: there should be some way of auditing the accuracy of emulators in general. If a genuine homebrew scene wants to exist (not just getting old games to work), new programmers who have little-to-no access to the original hardware need some practical way of knowing their software will work properly across different emulators. In the old days, most platforms had one good emulator that everyone used, and these emulators were supported by communities like AtariAge. In the Web 2.0 world, those communities are fractured or even gone completely, and often not easy to find in search engines. There are now much more platforms that emulators can be run on.Hardware emulation isn’t a solution. An FPGA emulator isn’t intrinsically more accurate than a software one, and documentation and schematics that are used to implement emulators can be incorrect and don’t specify ‘undefined behavior’ which was very much used reliably by software developers.The approach adopted by MAME has proven to be the only reliable: you have to measure some output on a real working system and compare it to the emulator behavior, but this can be impractical and becomes moreso over time as systems become more difficult to operate. (E.g. I can’t even operate most 8-bit computers without some kind of mod because I don’t have a CRT television anymore)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This urgently needs shareable URL&#39;s for each game...Otherwise when someone finds a cool game, they can&#39;t tell friends about it without that friend having to hunt through menus.Also, search engine indexing ought to be possible so that you can search a game name on Google/DDG and go direct to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dig the Netflix style navigation, I&#39;m curious if there are plans to support arbitrary ROMs for classic games. Probably can&#39;t host them, but maybe an easy way to load one from local?edit: should have scrolled down in the readme more, they say in the non-goals section:Directly playing locally stored game content (ROMs, etc.)
(Technically possible by using a local web server, but not a primary use case)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a lot of callouts of &#34;This is BS&#34; in regards to this article.Look at it from a different perspective. I would HIGHLY prefer this to a short press release blurb that allows pop-science clickbait aggregators (or even worse, the &#34;science&#34; sections of CBS/CNN and the like) to have first crack at it.This was produced by the university themselves, and provides a concise yet accurate and detailed overview of the biochemistry involved, as well as a nice short embedded youtube video demonstrating the movement in question and going over the main points of the research.Yes, improvements could be made, and yes, follow up studies will need to be performed. But this is head and shoulders above the &#34;ONE SMALL TRICK, DIETICIANS HATE HIM&#34; alternative we would have gotten otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For all the comments wondering what the particular movement and equipment is, see pages 5 and 6 of the supplementary materials: https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S25890042220114... The equipment is an electromyography system with realtime display. It measures the muscle contraction and is displayed to the subject so they can learn to recognize the movement that properly activates the muscle. Contrary to the video, you do not need to be an academic to buy one, they&#39;re fairly common in high-end sports coaching/rehab and you can find a cheap arduino-compatible system on Amazon if you want to DIY.If you don&#39;t read much exercise science, it&#39;s worth noting the paper says &#34;It is important to note that volunteers in Experiment I (Table S1) were typically sedentary (verified with an objective tracking device), and none of them had a high aerobic cardiorespiratory fitness (determined by treadmill VO2max or the maximal oxygen consumption test).&#34; A common pitfall of exercise science is that almost anything works wonderfully on untrained sedentary subjects. Wait for replication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Instead of breaking down glycogen, the soleus can use other types of fuels such as blood glucose and fats. Glycogen is normally the predominant type of carbohydrate that fuels muscular exercise.&gt; When the SPU was tested, the whole-body effects on blood chemistry included a 52% improvement in the excursion of blood glucose (sugar) and 60% less insulin requirement over three hours after ingesting a glucose drink.That&#39;s amazing if it is true."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t necessarily agree with the step of putting the code in a separate function; that often works, but just as often makes it so that the code can&#39;t be read top-to-bottom anymore which hurts readability.In this case there&#39;s, I think, a better alternative; the equivalent-ish code in Ruby for the example code here would be something like this:   values = s
      .partition(&#39;?&#39;)[-1]
      .split(&#39;&amp;&#39;)
      .map { |key_value| key_value.partition(&#39;=&#39;)[-1] }

You can write these nice functional pipelines where you just read the code top-to-bottom and see step-by-step what is being done to the data on each line. You don&#39;t have to jump up-and-down around the code when reading it, and you don&#39;t have to keep too much context in your head when reading it.This is one of the reasons why I vastly prefer Ruby over Python for most data processing tasks. I wish more languages would support this style of programming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now I know where Rust got some of its syntax from...As an aside, when I see samples like this, it makes me itchy. I hope and assume that they&#39;re being used as made-up snippets just to illustrate a point, and aren&#39;t being lifted from an actual codebase.Because... ugh... isn&#39;t it obvious? Attacker-controlled input such as URLs should never be manipulated with naive string processing! Always use a proper parsing library. Not to mention that complexities of URL encoding, character escapes, etc...The problem is that the author is using abstractions at the wrong level, with or without his fixes. The correct solution would be something like:    var uri = new Uri( &#34;http://foo/demo?test=a&amp;blah=b%20c&#34; );
    var map = System.Web.HttpUtility.ParseQueryString( uri.Query );
    
    Console.Out.WriteLine( &#34;is blah equal to &#39;b c&#39;?\n{0}&#34;, map[&#34;blah&#34;] == &#34;b c&#34; );

The above example is C#, but similar code can be written in any language. It&#39;s simple, direct, and doesn&#39;t violate the &#34;rule of six&#34;. It can be read like English:1. Construct a URI from a given string.2. Parse the query part of the URI into a map.3. Test if the &#39;blah&#39; value in the query is &#34;b c&#34; as expected, with the escaped space decoded properly.The example of how to apply the &#34;MORF&#34; rule in the article still has low-level operations involved, which doesn&#39;t make the code more readable. It doesn&#39;t describe the intent, which is the key thing to writing code that doesn&#39;t need comments every second line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What the author is missing is that easy to read/reason/understand about is within the context of making a change to the code to fix a bug, add a feature or make some non-functional improvement to it.This is what most of the &#34;easy to read&#34; articles forget.Show me why it is easier to fix a bug, add a feature or make a non-functional improvement to the code with their style than without.For example, if you&#39;ve extracted something into its own function, are you then sharing this function and using it in other places as well? If you then change the body of that function, are you now possibly breaking other parts of the code that relied on its old behavior?If you&#39;ve introduced a local mutable variable in between two lines, are you then mutating that variable prior/later? Is the query_params different at the end of the function then in the middle? Can you safely use it again?How easily can you now introduce new behavior before, in the middle, after, and anywhere in-between?When you modify the behavior to fix a bug, add a feature or make a non-functional improvement, is it an isolated change? How many tests break? Did it require major refactoring to make or very few things had to change? How easy was it to add a test for your new behavior? Was it easy to find the most appropriate place in the code to make the change? Etc.Sure sometimes maybe you just read code for the fun of understanding what it does, but almost always in practice when you&#39;re working on a code base, you only care to understand and reason about the code because you&#39;re looking to deliver that next sprint task that involves changing something about it.I wish more people focused on &#34;easy to change/modify&#34; then simply on &#34;easy to read/understand&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a new problem, back in the late 80s I worked for a Mac graphics card developer ... We made some of the first 24bit accelerated graphics cards.Our first was just an existing card with a small daughter card with pals an sram on it, it was so easy that we got our own logos put on many of the chips to put the competition off the scent, we designed that one in days and got it to market in weeks.We immediately started on 2 more designs. The next was all FPGA, it was as big a nubus card as one could build, it pulled too much power, and tilted under it&#39;s own weight out of the bus socket (Mac&#39;s didn&#39;t use screws to hold cards in place, that happened when you closed the chassis). We got it out the door about the point that the competition beat the first board&#39;s performance.The final card was built with custom silicon, designed backwards from &#34;how fast can we possibly make the vrams go if we use all the tricks?&#34;, In this case we essentially bet the company on whether a new ~200 pin plastic packaging technology was viable. This design really soaked the competition.In those days big monitors didn&#39;t work on just any card so if you owned the high end graphics card biz you owned the high end monitor biz too ... The 3 card play above was worth more than $120m"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised this isn&#39;t mentioned here more clearly: Some high end cases like the be quiet silent base I&#39;m using have the option to mount the graphics card vertically, basically parallel to the mainboard, in a separate anchor slot. It needs an additional connector cable (~$20), but other than that is easy to setup, looks better with a look-in case (the illuminated fans face the glass side) and the weight pulls on a special anchor point just for that with no electronics involved. Plus the card itself is more sturdy in that orientation and there is no issues with bending through its own weight. It might even be beneficial ventilation-wise as the graphics card no longer causes a horizontal divide (basically creating separate ventilation-zones on the top and bottom of the card).Yes, the cable will add approximately ~0.3ns of additional latency due to the added 10cm of distance.This is how it looks like:https://www.hardware-journal.de/images/Bilder/2018/test/be-q...https://www.hardware-journal.de/images/Bilder/2018/test/be-q..."</p>
