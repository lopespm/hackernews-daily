								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been an Amazon SDE and an Amazon SDM. I enjoyed my time as an SDE, luckily free from these horror stories. After having been an SDM, I understand how these horror stories can form.Generally, Amazon has two minds about performance management. In written documentation, it&#39;s all about whether your reports meet the role guidelines. The written documentation is solid. They share how to evaluate people objectively and how to minimize bias. Verbally, it&#39;s all about numbers and probability. The organization wants X number of people to leave this year, to do that they want Y number of people in performance improvement plans.There is an intense pressure to force a certain amount of attrition each year. While Amazon may claim stack ranking doesn&#39;t exist, Amazon uses rating and calibration mechanisms to learn who you think as a manager are your lowest performers. As a manager, you get verbal (never written) lashings from your manager and skip manager to put the lowest performers on performance plans that ensure that any attrition counts. As soon as you capitulate, your lowest performer is now considered a low performer.As an SDM, I wanted to maintain the illusion of great Amazon culture for my team. Behind the scenes, I spent a lot of time advocating for my team and trying to poke holes in the performance ratings of other teams. It was exhausting. There are certainly a lot of shortcuts I could have taken like putting potential internal transfers on performance management, but did not. I feel bad for the LinkedIn poster here, I think he had a lazy manager."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve worked at Amazon. I made it a few years, but was almost pipped in the first few months. Management dropped a huge project on me, a brand new tier 1 service, with full dns resolution, api, database, distributed system, along with micro services. The deadline was three months. Brand new tech stack. When I was struggling to meet the deadline, we started having “performance conversations”.I ended up switching teams and had a decent time at the company, but the nightmare situations are very real. You are replaceable and there’s no mercy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some people meet this with a healthy level of scepticism, which is great. However I used to work at Amazon, working on the performance evaluation and HR tools used within the company. It was a couple of years back, but I am fairly certain that the same tools are still used, given that all of them were developed from scratch. At the time it was in line with the company&#39;s PR of removing its toxic work culture.It&#39;s worth mentioning that it wasn&#39;t uncommon for people to move around teams, and to be honest HR is not the most exciting field for software development anyways. So, as expected, the HR dev teams had people move around quite a bit. Nothing toxic so far.One of the projects I worked on was what used to be called the dev list or personal improvement plan (pip) now renamed to Pivot. Most likely the exact same same tool. Management wanted to update the processes in order to automate as much as possible and reduce the risk of managers putting someone in pip, just because they didn&#39;t like them. However the process was set up in such a way that a manager can progress an employee through a pip for waaaay too long, until a failsafe, or a second pair of eyes even takes a look at it. I, personally, voiced my concerns about it, but it was shrugged off as &#34;it shouldn&#39;t happen&#34;, &#34;managers wouldn&#39;t do that&#34; and &#34;it&#39;s fine&#34; by the project stakeholders.The project starts, development is going a usual and a couple of years go by. I moved to another project within the HR space. Most of the team developing the tool has also moved on to greener pastures. Apart from that one guy, who has been there since its inception. He went from being a backend engineer, learning React and painstakingly working on a messy frontend codebase, eventually leaving him the only person competent enough to make changes to it. Eventually he was fed up and wanted to move to a different team. Lo and behold - his manager, the manager of the team building the pip tool, put him in pip to prevent him from moving. Haven&#39;t seen someone decide and actually leave a company as quickly as he did. So if the manager of the pip company can use it to blackmail people not to leave, I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s like for the rest of the company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google searches for React and node.js exceed searches for Ruby on Rails by 100% and 50%, respectively [1]. Some people have used this to argue that React/node are more popular than Rails. But I wonder if perhaps this discrepancy appears in Google Trends because it takes more google searches to accomplish the same thing in React/node versus Rails. I feel the Rails ethos of &#34;convention over configuration&#34; allows me to accomplish the same objective with less googling.[1] https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=31&amp;date=today%2..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to write Rails professionally for many yearsThis comparison isn&#39;t a good one. Rails is an all-encompasing framework.If you compare Rails to something like Nest.js, there&#39;s not much you&#39;re missing. Nest is one of the best application frameworks I&#39;ve used in any language, and it comes with all this stuff you say JS doesn&#39;t have.---EDIT: To clarify (because it is confusingly named), NestJS is a framework modeled after Spring Boot for TypeScript + Node:https://nestjs.com/Not to be confused with Next.js, which is a framework for building SSR React apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I&#39;ve gathered, over the years, is that the people who dislike Rails because it makes a lot of decisions for them think they&#39;re just too cool for that. It insults their programming ability. OK, I can see that. So, go ahead; have it your way. But while you&#39;re still writing thousands of lines of boilerplate in both the front and back ends, and getting your types sorted out, I&#39;m done with my app, and moving on to the next one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Last night I watched a YouTube video that had a song in the background that I hadn&#39;t heard but really liked. I pulled up Shazam but it didn&#39;t recognize the song, so I took to Google. I entered the lyric and added the search terms &#34;lyrics&#34; and &#34;r&amp;b&#34; at the end. Google returned 4 YouTube videos to songs that didn&#39;t contain the lyric, a link to a Boyz II Men song on Genius that didn&#39;t contain the lyric (good job Google, you know an R&amp;B band), a link to peterbe.com to find a song by lyrics, and a bunch of other useless links. I clicked on to page 2, which hilariously presented 3 of the 4 YouTube videos that were on page 1.I was immediately turned off, so I pulled up DuckDuckGo and Bing, entered the same exact query, and both engines returned the song I was looking for in the first result. I laughed out loud.I then thought to myself, &#34;I wonder how many pages I would have had to flip through in Google to find this result.&#34; Eventually, I found it. It was the 68th result on page 7."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just gonna throw this out there as I&#39;m noticing it more and more at this point since switching languages.What the actual F has happened to google search results for programming issues?I used to be able to google a question and get, more or less, a right answer from a forum or stack overflow.Recently, many coding tutorial websites have clearly figured out how to hack googles pageranks and now instead of one &#39;right enough answer&#39;, its 5 clone &#39;tutorial&#39; websites, with all the same crappy answer that isn&#39;t actually what I was asking. Like I can&#39;t use google for coding questions any more. Not like I was able to previously. Also, Stackoverflow with bangs from ddg are broken and it thinks I&#39;m a robot. No answer except to go to SO directly and search."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just as I saw this link a notification popped up on my Pixel phone:&gt; Trending: &#34;Turkey inflation rate&#34;
&gt; See search resultsI&#39;ve already put a lot of effort into purging as many categories of Google spam notifications from my phone as possible, but they just keep adding new categories that I have to track down and opt out of individually. And the only way to silence them from the notification itself is to block all notifications from that app/service.I paid good money for this phone — just stop with the OS-integrated spam! It&#39;s a never ending game of spam whackamole with Google these days. I guess various product owners are incentivised to increase &#34;engagement&#34; or whatever, but right now they&#39;re just increasing my engagement with Apple&#39;s product pages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m shocked those defending the Apple tax aren&#39;t considering the fact that businesses are just offloading that tax onto consumers making things artificially more expensive for iOS users. Even worse, when you do this you can&#39;t communicate why this is the case or tell people you can use the web for cheaper so users feel like you&#39;re just scamming them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple allows “free apps” that are entirely ad-supported, never giving Apple a dime (aside from $99/year), yet they are consuming infrastructure: hosting pages, downloads, reviewer time, etc.  Why isn’t Apple concerned about any of those costs?  Simple: they make overwhelmingly most of their App Store money from the handful of developers that offer purchases.  This also leads to perverse outcomes like Apple dragging its feet on scams that make them heaps of money.Developers are literally subsidizing other developers, and it’s not necessarily the richest ones helping the poorest ones.  Someone trying to make money on a $0.99 app is sacrificing more to Apple than Facebook does with their free app.That’s why I find all these percentage and payment discussions weird: income is so insanely distributed that a lot of this literally does not apply to more than 80% of the stuff on the store.  There are fundamental issues that need to be resolved too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What people want is to stop being forced to pay Apple’s 15-30%.Alternative payment processors were never going to accomplish that, as this case shows. You can make Apple accept alternative payment processors, but that doesn’t really change the price they set for using their store.Unless you want to abandon a free market economy, a government can’t force a company to provide a certain service at a certain price. Squeeze one spot with regulation and a company will extract more revenue from another. Squeeze everywhere and a company will leave the market.What they should do is force Apple to allow competing stores.Apple can keep it’s 15-30%… if it can compete at that level. If not, it will have to adjust, by either offering something more compelling to developers or charging them less. And if Apple can’t do well enough, and pulls back from its app store, then, well, iPhone users will still have the stores of all those stronger competitors to choose from.We don’t have to wonder what a platform with a competing sources for software looks like. We have a bunch of them, and they seem to work well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a rough datapoint, I run a consumer targeted e-commerce site. We ran a campaign before Christmas were we were selling a new product that was only marketed on Facebook, we are certain that (almost) all customers found it though that Facebook campaign. Facebook was only able to attribute about 50% of the sales to the ads, it should have been close to 100%. This then meant that Facebooks estimated CPA was effectively double what it actually was.Important to note about 60% of our customers are on an iOS device, which is a little higher than the global average but matches the market segment we are in in the UK.The situation improved after about 4 weeks, I believe Facebook now uses some &#34;AI&#34; to help with attribution on iOS, but it&#39;s somewhat difficult to be sure as by then we had other campaigns running.So, this will definitely be effecting marketers decision making process of where to allocate spend. It certainly made us more courteous about spending on Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when Facebook Platform came out. The super early version where you could embed your app on Facebook and engage with the social graph.I thought dang, this is smart. They’ll basically own the next level up the stack from the browser: they’ll own the “social chrome” of every application on the web.Although it devolved into spam, Facebook was a hot spot of weird social games for a while there. And every web dev was learning how to build Facebook apps. We wondered if we’d even really need a domain for much more than a landing page, if 99% of our engagement was going to come through Facebooks.And then they killed it because they wanted to own the entire experience inside Facebook. It became not a walled garden, but a walled flower pot.It always seemed short sighted  to me. Yes, they lost control allowing third party apps in their frame. But didn’t they want to be a Microsoft and not a WordPerfect?Looking back, I wonder if it was a missed opportunity. They have to go try to be the metaverse because social never became a platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem isn&#39;t just Apple&#39;s action on IDFA. It&#39;s that Facebook seems to be so poorly managed on some fronts that its reactions, rather than mitigating problems, has caused further harm. For example - in a rushed effort to get their privacy issues in order, they are deactivating the live facebook integrations of customers based on cursory/mistaken/possibly machine-based readings of their privacy policies.They did that to us yesterday: https://shared-crater-f3a.notion.site/Facebook-is-Breaking-A...We spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on facebook app ads per month. We can deal with IDFA giving way to more aggregated attribution (we don&#39;t want to track individuals - we just want to measure if the ads we paid for led to sales). But facebook breaking our app in production because they can&#39;t be bothered doing their job properly is very serious. It can&#39;t be solved by reducing ad spend, only by removing their SDK from our app.If this is also happening to many other developers right now, that, more than the Q4 results or the IDFA issue itself, could be causing the drop in the share price.In fact, if you look at the Q4 results, the earnings miss was more because of growth in G&amp;A (which grew by 3 percentage-points of revenue if I&#39;m not mistaken)  than because of a top-line slowdown. And if you read the comments as to what made G&amp;A grow, it&#39;s &#39;legal costs&#39;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Poignant remarks.  We&#39;re not getting any younger:&#34;Erik &#34;alphageek&#34; Jan Tromp passed away in 2020 after a long illness. He was
a long-time member of the Slackware core team doing a ton of stuff behind
the scenes and a master of lesser-known programming languages like Tcl. :-)
For a long time he lived closer to me geographically than anyone else on
the core team, but unfortunately with an international border between us
we never did meet in person. But he was there in chat every day and was a
good friend to everyone on the team. He is greatly missed. Sorry I didn&#39;t
get 15.0 out in time for you to see it...My old friend Brett Person also passed away in 2020. Without Brett, it&#39;s
possible that there wouldn&#39;t be any Slackware as we know it - he&#39;s the one
who encouraged me to upload it to FTP back in 1993 and served as Slackware&#39;s
original beta-tester. He was long considered a co-founder of this project.
I knew Brett since the days of the Beggar&#39;s Banquet BBS in Fargo back in
the 80&#39;s. When the Slackware Project moved to Walnut Creek CDROM, Brett was
hired as well, and we spent many hours on the road and sitting next to each
other representing Slackware at various trade shows. Brett seemed to know
all kinds of computer luminaries and was an amazing storyteller, always
with his smooth radio voice. Gonna miss you too, pal.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slackware was my first Linux too. I remember making the installation floppy disk set. And then it was my first introduction to running a computer others could remotely control. After learning how to dial up AOL from Linux then join an IRC chat room, I was immediately &#34;pwned&#34; by someone in that chat room who guessed my root password and rm -rf /&#39;d my entire hard drive. I was probably 8 or 9 at the time and cried."</p>

      The programmer thought for a moment.  &#34;I have some features that I wish
  to add.  This will take at least two weeks,&#34; he finally said.
      &#34;Even that is too much to expect,&#34; insisted the manager, &#34;I will be
  satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.&#34;
      The programmer agreed to this.
      Several years later, the manager retired.  On the way to his
  retirement lunch, he discovered the programmer asleep at his terminal.
  He had been programming all night.

No matter how practical it is to use Slackware in the current year (works for me!), it makes me very happy that projects like this are still going. Congratulations Patrick on a fantastic release."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But remember to reduce your personal carbon footprint! /sWe&#39;re expected to shave off a few kilos of CO2 here and there, usually at significant personal expense, while nothing is being done about these releases that a) could be avoided relatively easily b) have a much bigger impact.The abstract mentions ~8 million metric tons of methane per year. Using a GWP of 28 (which seems to be the value from the IPPC&#39;s AR5) that&#39;s equivalent to around 224 million tons of CO2.That&#39;s 224 billion kg CO2e, or around 28 kg CO2e for every human on the world, just from the large leaks (not from the ongoing smaller leaks which are &gt;10x as big according to the article). So yeah, go ahead and tell me (and everyone else) to go vegan for a month [1] or make similarly impactful changes just so companies can continue venting methane.To avoid being only negative: The obvious solution would be to require companies to buy emission certificates for those emissions, with a penalty factor that accounts for the probability of detection if they didn&#39;t accurately self-report and had to get caught. This would create an immediate incentive to reduce those easily avoidable emissions, and should be relatively easy to implement if we can get accurate enough data from satellites or aircraft. It would also ensure these emissions are accounted for in the emissions trading framework, so we don&#39;t emit the allocated amount elsewhere and are then surprised by the unaccounted-for emissions.[1] Assuming I replace 250 kcal from pork per day with Tofu (around 100g of pork which seems to be considered &#34;one serving&#34;), this would be savings of ~1 kg CO2e per day: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-kcal-poore"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; EDF is planning to launch its own methane-detecting satellite in about a year, which will take much sharper pictures, showing smaller leaks. Other organizations are developing their own methane detectors.When this does launch, the images taken should be open to public consumption, preferably on a website. Once we put these companies on blast with the hard facts, things will begin to change. Very quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting how some &#34;dark patterns&#34;, especially of the psychological kind, are actually important elements of good game design.For example the &#34;illusion of control&#34; (The game cheats or hides information to make you think you&#39;re better than you actually are) is everywhere, and it makes better games. One classic example is &#34;coyote time&#34; in platform games. Or for a more specific example, in Portal, at one time, you have to quickly fire a portal to avoid being crushed, it is a tense situation, and an important part of the story. So, to avoid a stupid death at the worst time, if you fire the wrong portal, it silently switches the other portal to correct your mistake.Aesthetic Manipulations (Trick questions or toying with emotions or our subconscious desires) is the entire point of many games. We want games to play with our emotions. Take a horror game for instance, you are sitting on a couch, at home, in the least scary environment you can imagine, the game has to pull all the trick on you if you want the scares you paid for. And no one is going to tell you that getting attached to characters is a bad thing and they would rather see them as the bunch of pixels they are.Frequency biases are all over the place too, usually in favor of the player. So much that when the game uses true randomness, it feels unfair. Good games are designed for player enjoyment, not to punish them with randomness.It also considers competition a dark pattern, are sports a dark pattern too?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this site has a very low threshold for considering something a &#39;dark pattern&#39;. If you look at the psychological section, these are all considered dark patterns:* A leveling up system* Badges/achievements* Collecting things* Getting better tools/equipment as the game progressesThat&#39;s like...most games, I think? Most single-player games at least probably have at least one of those.edit: some of the examples listed here are hilarious&gt; D4DJ Groovy Mix&gt; &#34;difficulty 1 through 14 is easy to learn and master, while 15 is the hardest difficulty in the game. makes people think that they have 90% of the skill of the best player but in reality it is not the case&#34;&gt; Magic: The Gathering Arena&gt; &#34;There are mysterious matchmaking algorithms. It isn&#39;t clear how these work. At face, they appear to match players of similar skill or deck strength.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this can help parents and kids with mobile games, but let’s talk about the elephant in the room of the games we ourselves are addicted to or our kids keep coming back to play.When I was a teen I was addicted to World of Warcraft. I played for a few years before quitting. My grades dropped, my social life was hurting, and all for just in game items? I remember how worried my parents were about my screen time and the lengths they went to try and limit it.Some of my best friends continue to play to this day and keep telling me that they are bored with it and will quit next expansion. They are now re-playing the same game over like they did with me a decade ago as it’s now a “classic” version.How do we help people get help they desire when these games create almost a combative, intervention needed type of situation?There’s https://www.restartlife.com/ and other similar types of websites out there to help, but I feel like the problem is the dark patterns already have a hold on one’s behavior to the point where only that person can be the agent of change or a major event happens in their life to spark the change."</p>

We describe an ultra-low-field brain MRI scanner that operates using a standard AC power outlet and is low cost to build.”This is fantastic. What a sentence to get to write."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The images are better that I expected.
The ‘FLAIR like’ image is not particularly FLAIR like. FLAIR are nicer to look at when fat saturated (not everyone agrees with that), but that’s probably not feasible at that field strength and adding scan time would be a problem on these long sequences.
Voxel sizes of 2x2x10 are pretty terrible resolution, but if the alternative is nothing, I guess that’s ok.
The static field is so low, I’m impressed it works at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Edit: This post was intended as a reply to https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30209618 , presently below&gt; The lead author, Dr. Craig Bennett, wanted to get something fresh, so he headed in to the grocery story first thing in the morning. At the fish counter, he spoke the words that will echo down the centuries as a testimony to the dedication and drive of neuroscientists throughout the ages:&gt;&#34;I need a full length Atlantic Salmon. For science.&#34;That reminds me of the day that I needed a strong lightweight cable for a silica-fiber melting/drawing apparatus. After some puzzling, I realized that bicycle shift/brake cabling would probably be perfect for the task.I&#39;ll never forget the puzzled look at the bike shop -- &#34;What kind of bike are you putting it on?&#34;  &#34;I&#39;m not, I just need some brake cable for a science experiment....&#34;  As I recall, I think we finally settled on some precut cabling for a GT Zaskar of some kind.Similar things came up the day that I needed a valve that switched faster than our dedicated micro-switching valves. A similar light-bulb went on, and I went down to the nearby auto shop for a fuel-injector.&#34;What kind of car do you need it for?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t, but there are a couple of different valve-switching protocols, some that latch open and others that accept straight TTL at reasonable currents. I need one of those.&#34;That experiment was brought to you by an injector for, I believe, a Dodge Caravan, and later, when I needed another, an injector for a Ford Mustang.  Fuel-injectors are really good valves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Best description of the hack I have found yet. The hack is on the solana side not the ethereum side of the bridge https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1489041221947375616*edit: another good thread https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1489044939732406275"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This highlights an incentive issue and a paradigm issue in the blockchain space. There is a strong incentive to get new protocols up and running and even though users are technically responsible as they can audit the code, most users, of course, are not qualified to do so, and stand to make more from exploiting any vulnerabilities they find than they are pointing for them out.The issue of paradigm is just how poorly suited EVM is as a smart contract language. It is too hard to manage the complexity of bytecode with memory managed on chain and in contract code. When small errors have huge consequences and there are no second chances, EVM is and should be pointed out to be one of the worst standards Ethereum has brought to crypto.When it comes to high stakes programming and especially in a space where new programs are written quickly and often, its almost objectively obvious that functional styles with more guard rails is the better choice. Nothing running on chain needs an infinite loop or many other fancy features one typically expects from a programming language - restrictions and readability in smart contract code are more important to computational chains than seat-belts are to automobiles, but the network effect is slowing the space down.Edit: Some people have pointed out this was an issue with Solana contracts, which run on Rust - so I was wrong to use this as an example for half of my point, but still believe the point stands. Even Rust IMO is not tied down enough for contract code, but the fact that it can happen on Rust which is loads better then EVM for bug catching I think proves the point a bit more if anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most people don&#39;t love fiddling with settings. People love when software does what they need, and some of them will be willing to fiddle with settings if they have to. Settings are a cost the user pays (just like data entry, loading times, hard drive space, loss of privacy, ads, or the monetary price of the software) in order to get the value. If good defaults mean most users don&#39;t have to muck with settings, great, your software is now more valuable. But the only thing worse than having to tweak a setting to get your functionality is not being able to get your functionality at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an engineer on Microsoft Office, users would often request features that the product already had. It was great that their problem was quickly fixed (just point them to the right setting), but it shows the lack of discoverability that happens when the list of settings gets long and you have to dig for them. If you can do the right thing automatically and avoid having a setting, that is an improvement.My other observation was that everybody said Office had too many features and then asked for two more."</p>

Why the bathrooms next to the bedrooms for your kid? Why cement floors and no floor heating? How did you end up at 400A/96kw of service (my car charges slower than that!). Why not building a indoor pool instead of a outdoor one? Feels a lot like your architect and contractors saw you had too much tech money and not enough common sense.That, and the fake pretending to care about the environment when you live in the middle of nowhere and have a heated outdoor pool with 96kw of service in Canada is just astounding!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beautiful house and there was a day I would have been extremely jealous but...I live in Oregon and in 2020 chose to (was not officially in an evac zone but the smoke was awful) evacuate when the horrible Beachie Creek and Lionshead [0] fires ripped through the Santiam Canyon. Houses that my wife and I had looked at possibly purchasing were torched, as well as some of the most pristine ancient forest I&#39;ve seen [1].My outlook about living in the forest drastically changed after these events. The Beachie Creek fire reached 130,000 acres overnight at a growth rate of 2.77 acres per SECOND. [2].You couldn&#39;t pay me enough money to live in a forest at this point. It&#39;s just too damn dangerous. Also, the flat roof seems problematic. Everyone I know in the PNW who has owned a flat roof has had issues with it due to pooling water. That far north, I imagine snow accumulation would also be a really big problem in terms of stress on the roof.[0] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiam_Fire[1] - https://www.opb.org/article/2021/09/02/oregon-field-guide-op...[2] - https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7001/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Home Assistant[1] is the best approach I&#39;ve found for this. It&#39;s pretty amazing but has a pretty steep learning curve (although they&#39;re getting better and better at this). The real power of HA is the rich integration ecosystem[2], the Community Store[3], and that it runs locally (more reliable and much faster for things like motion sensors, etc).It expresses everything from every integration as an entity in various device classes so as long as some random tech is supported by an integration you can group them seamlessly. For example - I have Z-wave based motion detectors but I can control Hue lights and Wemo switches for motion detection - but only if I&#39;m home as reported by the zone feature in their iOS companion application.Their supervisor/docker based install for Raspberry Pi is pretty slick[4]. Write an image to disk as you usually would and you get a bare-bones OS with Home Assistant running in docker. Then there are additional docker-based add-ons you can install for stuff like MQTT, Z-Wave, Let&#39;s Encrypt, SSH access, nginx, and more. All managed in the web ui. Pretty cool.[1] https://www.home-assistant.io/[2] https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/[3] https://hacs.xyz/[4] https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi"</p>

Find them on Offerup or FB or Craigslist market place for $100-$200.These are built solid with metal enclosures, fan cooled, UL certified PSU, ~7k CPUbenchmark.net. Usually i5 6thGen Intel CPU, 8GB-16GB RAM and have REAL storage(SSD) and M.2 NVMe. If you are lucky you might find vPro version with remote management.Currently running a HP G2 bought on Offerup for $70 with i5-6600T, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD running Ubuntu server with HomeAssistant VM and few containers. It idles at 7w, with &lt;2% CPU for my work load.I tried Raspberry Pi with HomeAssistant with it&#39;s piss poor antique storage solution, it idled at 5W, it went straight back to store."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless it magically cleans and tidies everything I really don&#39;t see the appeal of home automation. Pressing a switch is far more convenient to me when walking into a room than fishing out a smartphone - whether it be through a raspberry pi or otherwise. Same with central heating, I rarely need to adjust it and I don&#39;t see the appeal of messing around with some integrated interface, i&#39;d rather an old fashioned radiator dial or an independent reliable digital central heating timer I might have to tweak for 2 mins once a year.None of these things are analogous to the TV remote control, there&#39;s a reason why we haven&#39;t seen similar precursors such as radiator switches on extension cords, we don&#39;t need to constantly adjust these things at high frequency... and when we do, we are literally walking past it (light switch).&lt;/rant&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Quick story: I was the CFO for a company that sold to a private equity group (PEG). I took over as the CEO as the founders retired, leaving me to deal with the PEG. It quickly became apparent that the PEG managers looked at everything through the lens of an Excel spreadsheet.  These guys were brilliant attorneys and analysts but lacked experience building businesses and managing teams.    Ultimately, they couldn’t add much value in terms of operations or strategy, but they were great at financial modeling/quantitative analysis and forcing us to justify expenses.  That may sound good at first—eliminating wasteful spending—but it ultimately led to the gradual erosion of the company culture and employee loyalty.  It’s easy to cut benefits and pay given that many workers lack the leverage to do anything about it, while it’s much harder to reduce hard costs like materials and equipment.  That meant employees just kept getting squeezed, and it was surprisingly difficult to quantify the impact that terminating an employee or cutting benefits would have on morale/culture/performance.The moral of the story is that people with analyst mindsets play an essential role in our economy, but sometimes giving those people power over large organizations can have disastrous consequences.  There truly is a disconnect between measurement and understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprised not to see Goodhart&#39;s Law[0] referenced here - &#34;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure&#34;. Not the same concept, but a related one (as is the Cobra Effect[1], of which the poppy-field burning is an example)[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart&#39;s_law
[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive#The_origina..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the McNamara Fallacy is a real thing, although I would say Goodhart&#39;s Law expresses the more fundamental issue.  But, the examples they give (Vietnam and Afghanistan wars) are bad examples, because in both cases the issue was primarily not that the U.S. military was relying too much on quantitative metrics, but rather that it was being asked to do a job which militaries are not good at.In neither case, despite what many deniers and apologists proclaim, was the war &#34;winnable&#34; by the military, because in both cases the primary problem was that the government of the nation in question did not have the respect (and thus support) of its people.  There is no strategy that an outside military can use, which will fix this, because it&#39;s not a military problem, and a military has the wrong personnel, the wrong training, and thus the wrong institutional mindset.It is as if you sent the Red Cross in to defeat the Viet Cong or the Taliban, and then concluded that the reason they failed was that they were measuring numbers of hospital beds and counting how much medical equipment they needed.  It was the political leadership, who decided this was a job for a military to perform, that was the root problem.  McNamara&#39;s metrics were neither here nor there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is exciting! I&#39;ve met with people from AdaCore and Ferrous systems (individually) several times and they&#39;re all serious, competent and motivated.I&#39;m curious what kinds of software they want to (eventually) verify, my PhD thesis is developing a verification tool for Rust (https://github.com/xldenis/creusot) and I&#39;m always on the look out for case studies to push me forward.The road to formally verified Rust is still long but in my unbiased opinion looking quite bright, especially compared to other languages like C. 
Ownership typing really, really simplifies verification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ferrous&#39;s embedded Rust tooling is outstanding. Ie its [Knurling App template](https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template), and associated Probe-run, Deft, and flip-link.These make flashing and debugging Rust embedded very easy - easier than any embedded toolchain I&#39;ve seen besides Arduino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very interesting move from AdaCore. I&#39;ve been a vocal advocate of Ada as a general purpose programming language for a little while. I hope that this helps expose the language to a wider audience, and gives the wider programming community cause to reappraise Ada from a modern perspective. It&#39;s a language with a lot to offer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello hello, PM for the feature checking in here. amf12&#39;s reply is quite on-point. Web and App Activity is designed to store search activity across all Google services, and we&#39;re splitting Workspace data out since it&#39;s governed by strict data handling guarantees, with the hope that more people will feel comfortable getting the benefits of better search in Workspace without having to opt-into search history being tracked for all Google services.Search history can be immensely useful for our users, since a lot of them re-run prior searches or want search experiences built on top of prior ones. Today, for the Workspace paid offering admins who choose to disable the somewhat confusingly named Web and App Activity admin console control, users in the domain have no ability to get relevant and historical search suggestions in Drive or Gmail that can help them save time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note: this seems to be about their paid &#34;Workspaces&#34; offering. I have a private paid domain email on Google Workspaces. I received their email and checked out their FAQs to see how it would affect me in terms of privacy.Workspaces data is inherently said to be private under contract and not used for advertising or other Google purposes. Here are relevant snippets from their new FAQ:- &#34;Google never uses your data in Google Workspace core services for advertising.&#34;- &#34;Google Workspace search history includes search activity in Google Workspace services such as Gmail and Drive and is subject to the data protections that Google Workspace provides for users’ data.&#34;Seems to me that other non-core services are not covered by it, which may be the reason for this split?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What crazy to me is how hard to parse the email was. I could hardly make heads or tails of it, and I&#39;m no dummy. It almost seemed intentional, and now it makes sense.Even manually setting this feature once you understand it I can&#39;t do either!So first you might land here:https://support.google.com/a/answer/11194328#zippy=%2Chow-do...Then the instructions say:&gt; You can enable or disable Google Workspace search history:&gt;   * Go to the My Activity page.&gt;   * Click Other Google activity and then Google Workspace search history.&gt;   * Click On or Off.But this is wrong! When you follow the link the &#34;Google workspace search history&#34; is hidden in a hamburger menu in the top left. You have to click that to open the menu, THEN you can click on &#34;Other Google Activity&#34;. But on THAT page there is no setting called &#34;Google Workspace Search History&#34;.  Just the old &#34;Web &amp; App Activity&#34;So what, I have to set a reminder for after 3/29/22 to come back to this screen? Madness!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is something else going on around FB.Almost all activity online has shifted away from the Social Graph to a Content Graph. Almost nobody wants to see what their friends are doing online anymore. In a lot of ways it can be cringey. People just want the latest, catchiest content. TikTok and Youtube are the OGs here, but it&#39;s everywhere when you start to look. Twitter timeline changes being an awkward but working example. Discovery &gt; Static friends list.The entire premise FB was founded on is eroding. This isn&#39;t just Apple privacy and some regulatory strangulation. It&#39;s seismic to the business. The reason most people are still going to Facebook is incompatible with their primary activities online which is: consuming content from people-you-don&#39;t-know.Facebook is where you find out your highschool friend is super in to a MLM, your uncle has drastic political views you don&#39;t share, and that your historical social class and network is largely irrelevant to your life a decade later.They are doing everything they can to try to move in this direction, but the more they push it the less useful Facebook is for the average user. Instagram&#39;s discovery page is a prime example. But Reels are less good than TikTok, and whatever they are doing for short form video in Facebook is surely a hopeless game of catch up. This is classical innovator&#39;s dilemma.The very idea that Zuckerberg straight up said they need to copy the competition harder is incomprehensible considering the resources they have.They are going to try to do a few things. One is to anti-trust Apple (in the media at least), and the other is to hand wave (Metaverse).The reason the Metaverse was such a non sequitur is that it is so clearly a last minute thrust coming out of the C-Suite. If you&#39;ve ever worked at a highly visible tech pubco, you&#39;ve seen this happen before. Weak quarters mean that product announcements get pushed up. When it is as all encompassing as the Metaverse announcement, you know something is up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is how the narrative of Facebook looks to me:Zuckerberg got lucky and then executed brilliantly, transitioned from nerd hacker to CEO amazingly well. He deserves a lot of credit for that.Since then, Facebook have innovated very little. Zuckerberg recognised this, and bought Instagram and Whatsapp in lieu of building an innovative company. The latter is clearly really difficult to do.Without a stream of new ideas and products (unlike, say, Apple) Facebook double-downed on maximising revenue growth from their core advertising business. This led to all the scandals and disasters they have brought us, including destabilising societies.Inevitably, this led to the core product becoming less attractive, and people were also turned off by the negative press. Zuckerberg&#39;s rigid control of the company has led to him being a lightening rod for the backlash against big tech and especially adtech. His media skills are awful, so insisting on control and making himself a figurehead has further damaged the business.Zuckerberg knows the only way out is another home run. He&#39;s a super smart and prescient thinker, so he can see VR is a good play. It looks like the timeline for VR won&#39;t be short enough to save FB, but even if it were arriving soon enough he must know that FB probably isn&#39;t capable of delivering a truly new thing.This then marks the beginning of the end for the company, as it continues to bring in revenue from Instagram and monetises Whatsapp. Its sheer size means decline is going to take decades.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Zuckerberg leaves in the next few years, before the failure of Meta strategy becomes apparent.What they _should_ have done is debatable, but developing some sense of ethics might have helped. I think they could have focused on building Whatsapp into a payments (etc) app, which would have created an enduring product, and then used the time that bought them to rebuild the company.Microsoft are showing that it can be done, but I wonder if Facebook has the capacity to do great things. Perhaps the lesson from MS is that only a new leader can rescue such a mired company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It never ceases to amaze me what you can do with these transformer models. They created millions of potential solutions for each problem, used the provided examples for the problems to filter out 99% of incorrect solutions and then applied some more heuristics and the 10 available submissions to try to find a solution.All these approaches just seem like brute-force approaches: Let&#39;s just throw our transformer on this problem and see if we can get anything useful out of this.Whatever it is, you can&#39;t deny that these unsupervised models learn some semantic representations, but we have no clue at all what that actually is and how these model learn that. But I&#39;m also very sceptical that you can actually get anywhere close to human (expert) capability in any sufficiently complex domain by using this approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sometimes read these and wonder if I need to retrain. At my age, I’ll struggle to get a job at a similar level in a new industry.And then I remember that the thing I bring to the table is the ability to turn domain knowledge into code.Being able to do competitive coding challenges is impressive, but a very large segment of software engineering is about eliciting what the squishy humans in management actually want, putting it into code, and discovering as quickly as possible that it’s not what they really wanted after all.It’s going to take a sufficiently long time for AI to take over management that I don’t think oldies like me need to worry too much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is extremely impressive, but I do think it’s worth noting that these two things were provided:- a very well defined problem.  (One of the things I like about competitive programming and the like is just getting to implement a clearly articulated problem, not something I experience on most days.)
- existing test data.This is definitely a great accomplishment, but I think those two features of competitive programming are notably different than my experience of daily programming.  I don’t mean to suggest these will always be limitations of this kind of technology, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have felt since day 1 that &#34;autopilot is better than the average driver!&#34; is the most misleading fact/statistic in the industry.The &#34;average driver&#34; involved in an accident includes drunk drivers, road ragers, habitual speeders, teenagers, people driving in bad conditions (rain, snow), people driving without sleep and several other risky groups that most people buying Teslas aren&#39;t part of.

I sometimes catch myself forgetting the due diligence even after many years of forcing myself to think about stats.Perhaps some sort of ombudsman could do this, pointing out when stats are lying to people."</p>

It was a way for these companies to fight the GDPR with a war of attrition.  I&#39;m glad you see with this round hasn&#39;t worked... Yet.I suspect that based on this ruling, things will not get better, as in providing a less annoying user experience and more compliance with the GDPR.  Instead I predict another round of pseudo compliance and a more annoying user experience.  Eventually they&#39;ll start a policy campaign in earnest stating that the GDPR is unworkable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This headline and article is a gross misrepresentation of the ruling. The ruling is that the TCF consent string contains personal data and that the IAB is the data controller for this bit of data. This ruling has no impact what so ever on consent popups. It basically &#34;just&#34; trashes the industry standard that is used to pass consent signals. There are plenty of custom or non TCF implementations (all equally awful) of consent dialogs.This ruling puts Google and FB in a much more powerful position - because they do not have to rely on standards like TCF to pass consent signals.Instead of going after publishers and website owners who integrate these popups in the first place - they went after the inventor of the spec."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is from Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s post. I think it&#39;s a decent explanation of their performance. Historically Facebook always made these longer-term bets and they&#39;ve typically paid off.&#34;Before I get to that, I want to briefly touch on our Q4 results, which I know Sheryl and Dave are going to go deeper on. I&#39;m proud of the work our teams did here. We shipped products, our community continued to grow, and businesses of all sizes turned to us to help them reach people. But there are two things that I want to call out that are having an impact on our business.The first is competition. People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly. And this is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long-term. As is our work to make sure our apps are the best services out there for young adults, which I spoke about on our last call.The second area, and related to this, is that we&#39;re in the middle of a transition on our own services towards short-form video like Reels. So as more activity shifts towards this medium, we&#39;re replacing some time in News Feed and other higher monetizing surfaces. So as a result of both competition and this shift to short-form video as well as our focus on serving young adults over optimizing overall engagement, we&#39;re going to continue to see pressure on impression growth in the near term. Now I&#39;m confident that leaning harder into these trends is the right short-term tradeoff to make in order to get long-term gains. We&#39;ve made these types of transitions before with mobile feed and Stories, where we took on headwinds in the near-term to align with important trends over the long term. And while video has historically been slower to monetize, we believe that over time short-form video is going to monetize more like feed or Stories than like Watch – so I&#39;m optimistic that we&#39;ll get to where we need to be with Reels too.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook’s core business model appears to be in decline. They don’t have a very diversified revenue stream despite trying various side businesses. This is the market worried that Facebook’s best days are behind it.Facebook is betting the farm on the metaverse stuff but without meaningful financial results that’s not going to placate market concerns over what looks like a downhill future for the core businesses. Facebook’s less than fantastic record at making money on its other businesses doesn’t have the market terribly optimistic about about the future prospects metaverse stuff either. Net net stock down 20%."</p>

Not out of fear of the North Koreans, but out of fear of our own security agencies seeing the activity as interfering in international relations. Also the vagueness of our hacking laws probably make what he did a crime.But I also am immensely proud that we have people willing to take things into their own hands when needed.Also, I feel like the 2nd amendment should be interpreted to include the right to bear digital arms (strong encryption for a start). This will probably take another decade to figure out what that would really mean."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like many journalists are failing in their primary responsibilities to keep the public informed. Fact checking liars or misleading statements is tedious, and some politicians lie or mislead.Journalists should be doing investigations and creating reports that put social and political issues in context. Yet so often these issues, real issues that affect lives, are treated as political theater or a public sport.I can&#39;t blame journalists for the politicians lying or misleading, but I can blame them for so often going for the easy stories that they are fed, instead of the hard ones they have to look for or put together.As a result, when I read the news I pay special attention to stories that are based on original investigations, public records requests, whistleblowers, or stories in which actual context is provided from multiple viewpoints that are informed by the facts, rather than merely by self interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This conversation isn&#39;t formal enough to be meaningful.If you want to talk meaningfully about how &#34;facts&#34; are used, you need to be able to invoke any notion at all of propositions and implications. It doesn&#39;t matter if your implications are mathematical in nature or scientific in nature or just correlation, facts exist in the structure imposed by implication. And facts without an implication structure are useless.In order to mislead with a &#34;true&#34; fact A, it needs to already be the case that there is a false fact of the form A implies B already sitting in there. The combination of a belief in A implies B (false) with this newly introduced belief A (true) yields a belief in B (false).The essence of &#34;lying by telling the truth&#34; is then just finding these false implications, and exploiting them.Fortunately, It&#39;s much easier to fact check implications. If A implies B is false, then you just need to come up with an example of A and not B.Unfortunately changes to belief do not always propagate reliably, and the combinatorial game is against the implication checkers. For any given true fact A there are as many potential false beliefs of the form A implies B as there are propositions B.Fortunately, most humans make do with as few (quantified) implications as they can. Rules are hard to remember. Getting rid of false implications is much easier when you can replace them with &#34;true&#34; implications.I suppose I am arguing then that the solution to all of this is education that doesn&#39;t teach facts, but rather implications (which are themselves just higher order facts)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the idea of this article, but it doesn&#39;t address the reason things are the way they are. Facts get checked for literal accuracy because that&#39;s what&#39;s easy to actually do in a reasonably unbiased way. We stop there not because that&#39;s all we want, but because everything after that is too messy to even come close to systematizing.If they&#39;ve got a well thought out framework for systematizing high quality contextualization, i&#39;d love to hear about it, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I have also been frustrated with the direction Postman has taken, I have a great alternative to suggest, if the only thing you want to do is fire requests on demand easily and do not need automated testing.The VS Code Rest Client extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.re... is great for testing and debugging APIs.You create a &#34;my_request.http&#34; file that contains something like  POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
  content-type: application/json

  {
    &#34;name&#34;: &#34;sample&#34;,
    &#34;time&#34;: &#34;Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT&#34;
  }

First line is the method and url, then headers, then a newline, then the request body.Hit ctrl+alt+p, the request is sent and you see the response in a side pane. Everything is encoded and decoded properly.You can organize your tests under multiple files and folders.I cannot recommend this extension enough, it has made my life so much easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postman founder here. Thank you HN community for highlighting this feature. We have been seeing gRPC usage exploding especially in microservices driven architectures and we are looking forward to the feedback we get on the feature.A few other observations on comments that I read through:1. Postman leans towards adding UI affordances instead of hiding them. This can irritate experienced developers at times who already know the complexities of HTTP or other protocols but that is really how new developers find their way around. So while it is attractive to have 1000 options hidden behind a command line interface, nobody uses 995 of those features. We are getting better at building experiences for both experienced and new developers. Also, I don’t believe reading man pages of git or curl is a better experience.2. Performance is a huge area for improvement. More to come in subsequent releases this year.3. Our roadmap is community driven: https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues. Raising more investment helps us do more. We have built a business model around doing the maximum for every developer on the planet while also providing value to companies so we can charge for it and continue development. I find it fair that companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on salaries can pay some money for improving their productivity by spending in developer tools.4. API Development is a huge and growing area and developers are spending more and more time working with APIs rather than their IDEs. API Design, documentation, and testing are areas that a large number of developers tell us they wish they had better tooling for. Most of their time is spend pointlessly in trying to figure out how an API works (in some cases whether an API even exists). We decided to take Postman in those areas even though paradoxically it might lead to “less” Postman usage. (The faster people figure out an API the fewer number of calls they have to send)5. Finally, it is good to see here a call for fewer features which we insist internally as well. Unfortunately at some point some part of the community is upset that we are NOT adding features (just see the gRPC thread on our issue tracker!). We don’t see issues to remove features as much as we have requests to fulfill. We do remove features consciously but it is a hard problem, so we default to adding them slowly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postman is so incredibly bloated and slow these days. All I want is a REST client, but it feels like every time I want to perform a basic task now, I have to dig past all of their confusing platform and cloud stuff that I have no interest in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Refusing service when the user does not consent to non-essential data sharing is illegal in the EU, and it also breaches Google Play&#39;s developer agreement. WiFi scanning is not essential to navigate with an app, and the least they could do to follow the law is to gracefully degrade the service if the user does not consent to share data about nearby devices, such as disabling traffic predictions.Of course Google&#39;s lawyers will argue that this data is in fact required for navigation, the same way some banks in the EU now claim &#34;legitimate interest&#34; when they send you a message about their credit card promotions with winnable prizes, after you&#39;ve explicitly opted out from all marketing communications."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not related to Google maps, but just today I got tired of the Amazon app sending me &#34;you might like this deal&#34; notifications and dug into whether it&#39;s possible to disable them.You can, but if you do, Amazon will no longer send Amazon &#34;Smile&#34; micro-donations to whatever charity you&#39;ve selected: https://i.imgur.com/wNAkUAT.jpeg .I can&#39;t say that this is underhanded, but it does cast into sharp relief the fact that Amazon is a $1.5 trillion dollar company that generates upwards of $3B in yearly profit, and they&#39;re jerking you around, dangling the pennies they would otherwise send to a charity, unless you let them feed you product recommendations in OS notifications.  (If you just disallow the entire Amazon app from sending notifications, as far as I can tell they still give the charity whatever 0.5% cut.)So I have to choose between 1) allowing them to send me product recommendations, 2) a poor UX because I don&#39;t get any notifications at all, or 3) just not sending the charity any of the scraps of my Amazon transactions.  I chose 3 and cut the charity a larger check than usual."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I&#39;m not sure if this change to Google Maps has been or will be widely rolled out, you may want to look into what GrapheneOS is working on with their Google Play compatibility layer [1]. It basically lets people use Google&#39;s services inside Android&#39;s standard app sandbox. That means they don&#39;t get access to privileged system APIs and can only access what the user chooses. It can also be used without a Google account.GrapheneOS is working on a way to redirect the Play services location APIs to an open source implementation of those APIs which uses standard Android location APIs [2]. 
It&#39;s expected to be available in an upcoming release [3].[1] https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play[2] https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Loc...[3] https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1486182874567122945"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who don&#39;t know, &#34;Riddim is the Jamaican Patois pronunciation of the English word &#39;rhythm&#39;. In the context of reggae and dancehall it refers to the instrumental accompaniment to a song and is synonymous with the rhythm section... A given riddim, if popular, may be used in dozens—or even hundreds—of songs, not only in recordings but also in live performances.&#34;The actual riddim sounds completely uninteresting to my American ears. But the novelty and catchiness obviously connected to millions of people at the time.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddimhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjw7m-BKmQ8"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love my Framework. Barring Apple&#39;s recent move away from the touchbar it&#39;s honestly the first machine I&#39;ve been excited about in 6 or so years. The build quality is great, love the simplicity and design of the expansion ports, and the repair/upgrade-ability is huge. It&#39;s gotten me back into using Linux as a daily driver.I really hope they stay true to their vision and that this means expanding it into other consumer product lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We’re not ready to share what the next products are just yet, but this funding unlocks categories even more ambitious than our first one. We have a detailed plan in place for the next two years and napkin sketch ideas going out a couple of decades.It&#39;ll be really interesting to see where they go next. Given that they&#39;re already in computer and custom board space, I&#39;d make a guess that it&#39;s going to be routers - similarly embedded devices and they&#39;d make a great option for replaceable parts (i.e. WiFi, connection options etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Frameworks are really good. However, the chips inside are disappointing, IMO.I was considering the i5 1135g7 Framework with 16gb of RAM. A friend of mine bought it, and it&#39;s idle power draw is of 8-9W with Gnome 3 and Firefox open.I decided to get a laptop with a 5800H and an RTX 3070 instead. My power consumption as I&#39;m typing this comment right now is of 7W with a dozen tabs and an IDE, messaging, etc... open. That is despite a 46% larger screen, and a much faster, unlocked TDP, 8 core CPU.That&#39;s a real shame, IMO. Combined with a 55Wh battery, it&#39;s quite problematic, and was a deal-breaker for me."</p>

What if you could ride one of these filaments?Or what if they&#39;re like the exhaust trails of an FTL vehicle/body? Or something inter-dimensional?Knowing they&#39;re very far away, are we looking for them closer to home? Can they even be observed with such clarity if they were closer to us?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My Tesla will allow me to engage autopilot in a school zone, obeying the adjustment I’d set on speed limit - while using, not the correct school zone speed limit, but the non-school time speed limit. It would allow me to go 30 mph over the school zone speed.How can Tesla claim self driving if the car can’t read a sign that says - speed limit 25 mph during school hours, and properly adjust? Humans just look around to determine if school is likely in session by the number of cars in the parking lot during normal school hours, or they know the school calendar.How does a self driving car make that determination? Query the school district website for the school, identifying their bell schedule and tacking on a buffer ahead and behind? Assume a school schedule that’s M-F? What if it’s a religious school that operates Sun-Thursday? Now the car has to determine which religious sects obey which calendar? Is it different in each country?Just another example of a massive hurdle self driving cars have……And another recall that should be issued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was rear-ended in Colorado when I didn&#39;t do a rolling stop. Had a road-rage incident when the other driving was livid that I would stop under thoose circumstances.My dad (when gowing up) was pulled over for a cop for doing a california stop in Colorado. The police officer let us off, because we had california plates.When I got my Tesla, it was immediately evident that _no one_ travels the speed limit. They travel 5-10mph over it on anything other then a local road. or they drive way under it.This is the problem with our mental model - FSD/Autopilot has to co-exist with human drivers - and human drivers don&#39;t follow the law. FSD/Autopilot has to exist in a world where roads do not follow standards, lines are not marked, deer jump in front of cars, people do California stops (it&#39;s called that for a reason), cars have accidents.Computers, today, change none of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actual implementation is a little more nuanced than always roll or never roll, with seven conditions required to avoid coming to a complete stop:  1. The functionality must be enabled within the FSD Beta Profile settings; and

  2. The vehicle must be approaching an all-way stop intersection; and

  3. The vehicle must be traveling below 5.6mph; and

  4. No relevant moving cars are detected near the intersection; and

  5. No relevant pedestrians or bicyclists are detected near the intersection; and

  6. There is sufficient visibility for the vehicle while approaching the intersection; and

  7. All roads entering the intersection have a speed limit of 30 mph or less.

  If all the above conditions are met, only then will the vehicle travel through the all-way-stop intersection at a speed from 0.1 mph up to 5.6 mph without first coming to a complete stop. If any of the above conditions are not met, the functionality will not activate and the vehicle will come to a complete stop

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know a few upper-middle class small business owners (all non-retail sectors) whose businesses weren&#39;t substantially affected by the pandemic, but who basically got a free handout as part of the program.Two mentioned how they were initially hesitant to apply for money, but then worried that if they didn&#39;t, their business could take a downturn after it was too late. Then as long as they spent the money on payroll (which they had to pay for anyway), they didn&#39;t have to pay it back, even if their business didn&#39;t show any losses. I shudder to think of how much the bigger players yanked out of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US lacks the state capacity to tell who was going to have trouble with COVID-19 closures, and who wouldn&#39;t, so a whole lot of money just had to go to people that had no need for it whatsoever.Regarding PPP, every local tech staff augmentation company got a few months worth of payroll out of it. For those of you not in the know, their model involves hiring developers at $x an hour, and then placing them at large enterprises for $x+y, often for years at a time, as those companies would rather have contractors than employees.So where does the money go? Straight to the owner&#39;s pockets, as lockdowns only changed staffing needs in a very small number of companies. So if your sole proprietorship staffing company employs 25 of those developer-contractors for, say, 180k and a couple of HR staff, you could get million dollar &#34;loan&#34;, that would be forgiven in a few months, as you didn&#39;t fire any of them.Needless to say, the people in charge of that kind of company were very happy about the PPP program."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I understand it, the reason an HIV vaccine has been so difficult to create is that HIV mutates so easily. I understand the basics behind how mRNA vaccines are generated, but I don&#39;t understand why this approach would be expected to have any more success in evading the high mutation potential of HIV than other vaccine types. After all, it was even a concern with new coronavirus variants that the original Moderna vaccine would be less effective against them (and, indeed, while the original vaccine is still highly effective against all variants, my understanding is that it is less so than the original variant). And SARS-COV-2 mutates much less easily than HIV.Can someone with more knowledge explain the thought process behind this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember growing up being terrified of HIV/AIDS. The idea of something being permanent and transmissible via sex, and literally dismounting your immune defense to all other diseases on the planet...To this day it still terrifies me, even though the treatments have become so good.Each year it seems there are new stories about HIV research, and progress keeps being made. I pray for positive results and am really amazed. We have a lot to be thankful for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if we&#39;ll see HSV also addressed by this new wave of mRNA vaccines, or if it&#39;s just not top of mind for companies and researchers due to its &#34;mostly benign&#34; nature. At least until one&#39;s immune system starts to weaken with advanced age and it starts to cause all sorts of problems, but perhaps by then it gets swept under the &#34;problems of aging&#34; rug."</p>

It got so bad that we had to have someone review all e-mails he sent to customers.We had regular &#34;improvement plan&#34; meetings with him, but after a year of paying him, we had to let him go.  As part of the exit interview we went back and looked at his interview e-mails, and compared them with his current e-mails.  So we asked him:&#34;During the interview, all your e-mails were great!

If your recruiting channels are good, most of your candidates are going to be honest and good intentioned.But interview enough people, and you&#39;ll start encountering people trying to abuse remote work. They&#39;re not interested in contributing to your company. They&#39;re only interested in collecting paychecks while they do as little work as possible for as long as possible. They might already have a full-time job or other remote jobs, or maybe they&#39;re just trying to travel the world and do a &#34;four hour workweek&#34; thing where they answer e-mails once a day and phone in a couple hours of work at key times during the week.The common theme is that they aren&#39;t really interested in fighting too hard for the position. As soon as the interview or job turns out to be something they can&#39;t just talk and smile their way through, they&#39;re out, just like this:&gt; I think my last update for a while: as soon as HR got on the call with him, before they could get through their first question, John said the words “I quit” and hung up the calls. He has since been unreachable!!Always makes me wonder how many dysfunctional companies are out there letting deadbeat remote employees collect paychecks and do as little work as possible because nobody cares enough to press the issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Practices like this are hilariously common in the industry.Right out of college I accepted a job offer at a small consulting company on the east coast. They promised they would give me free housing at their luxury apartment for the first few months and give me all the training I need to excel in areas of my interest. I flew across the country and found out the whole thing is not as advertised. Their luxury apartment had piles of unwashed dishes and flies in the kitchen and piss on the bathroom floor. They had bunk beds in each room and I slept with three other dudes from wildly different backgrounds. My first night, this guy from Turkey assured me that everything is going to be fine, that he was shaking in fear for the first couple nights but he soon learned that if you work with them, they get you what you need. At the same time, another guy from Chicago was telling me how I need to look out for myself because the company likes to steal money from your paychecks.The next day, I learned that &#34;working with them&#34; meant going through their &#34;resume revision&#34; process. Turns out, there was a network of consulting companies like this one, each creating fake experiences for one another. Fresh grads who clearly have never coded anything of significance became senior engineers with 5 years of experience. The resulting resumes looked real stacked, filled with keywords that recruiters love. Furthermore, during live interviews, they actually placed someone with actual technical knowledge behind the laptop camera to basically write out all the answers on the whiteboard while the candidates read out the answers.Some of the people there loved talking about how so and so got placed at prestigious companies and became hugely successful in their career. Most of them knew what they were doing wasn&#39;t the most ethical thing to do, but not many complained given their visa status. Also, they were actually really grateful to get a developer job that pays ~$40k. They were just regular people.I personally didn&#39;t need visa support, and I had the luxury of being able to fall back on my parents. So about a week after I flew over, I gathered my things and left. It was an interesting experience overall, one I&#39;m glad I could experience.My 2c for interviewing: always look up key phrases you see on resumes and see if identical copies show up. It&#39;s usually a giveaway sign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like a Miele. That menu can be exited (the image where it says &#34;Software Update&#34;, the tiny bit on the right... that&#39;s a scroll bar of multiple options including the ability to exit this menu), but it does imply that the dishwasher is already connected to Wi-Fi and that it has determined that there is an update available.There are few times that a dishwasher is interacted with, if not when you go into the menu to start it then when? It&#39;s just asking &#34;Do you want to do this now?&#34; if not that is fine (the menu can be exited), but now you know to do it later.Alternatively as the dishwasher clearly is on Wi-Fi already (the only way it would know there&#39;s an update), one can use the Miele@Home app to perform the update at a more convenient time.I have a Miele dishwasher, it is connected to Wi-Fi (on a VLAN with other white goods, outbound connections to certain domains only). The Wi-Fi is useful... the dishwasher auto-doses the powder, rinse aid, salt, etc... and can let me know the levels of those. In addition it tells me when the cycle is done. Performs updates, etc. There&#39;s a Home Assistant integration too, but I&#39;ve not done that (my VLAN setup prevented it!).PS: If you&#39;re of the opinion that a dishwasher doesn&#39;t need to be on Wi-Fi and you wouldn&#39;t connect it... then great, that&#39;s another way not to be asked to do an update. This dishwasher isn&#39;t going to ask to connect to Wi-Fi, it&#39;s something you choose to do (something that takes a degree of determination I might add)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it weird that the more tech becomes like this the more I feel checked out?I don’t want smart devices, nor do I want to be online 24/7. However it’s hard to escape this reality. My thermostat (in apartment) recently reset due to a power issue and I had to have maintenance over to do its configuration again. They had to come twice because after setting it up they have to figure out how to connect it to Wi-Fi for a software update.Before this apartment I lived in one where all the appliances were straight out of 1950/60. They were retro af but they worked without any issues for the time I lived there. Here I’ve had issues every month."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart devices are overly complex. The entire point should have been to make devices work for you, but now when you buy a ‘smart’ washing machine, it requires you 30min of setup. Downloading apps, connecting it to wifi, providing GPS location etc. why? What’s the point. We need devices that make life simpler. Straight out of the box."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I went car shopping this year in the new market and found that that if you want more a &#34;dumb&#34; car (UX occurs primarily outside of a touchscreen, no internet, no geolocation) you lose all potential for any nice non-smart features. So no heated/powered seats, no power windows, the material of the interior is refurbished from a spirit airlines airplane, etc.I think manufacturers are hoping that certain aspects of the modern auto become &#34;can&#39;t live withouts&#34;, e.g. bluetooth, which helps them smuggle all the other more marginally useful, security and ux intrusive features into your model. Now as others have mentioned, these unwanted smart features might actually be required by law/regulation/tax-credit/legal-dept, so it&#39;s not bad programming/design but &#34;design by committee&#34; that&#39;s dooming our chances of a good dumb car.I wonder how well my car will age when miscellaneous sensor all over the car start failing. It used to just show a light on your dashboard, now I wonder if I&#39;ll be grounded - stuck in park - or hounded by incessant bells repeating the same spurious warning over and over again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our Volvo doesn&#39;t let you adjust the volume when you&#39;re in reverse.  That means if you&#39;re backing out of the garage and the music is blaring -- you can&#39;t turn it off!The Volvo UI pops up an almost full-display warning when it can&#39;t connect to the phone over bluetooth on startup.  This UI takes priority over the rear camera.  So I guess it&#39;s better to hit Timmy and his puppy when I&#39;m backing out, so long as I know my phone&#39;s not connected!The Volvo&#39;s headlights have &#34;smart&#34; auto-adjustments.  That means I can&#39;t leave the high beams on, or force it to stay on low beams.  It will decide for me!  I think maybe I can disable this... somehow.So smart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I hate about &#34;car discourse&#34; like this is the apparent blindness to public transportation. Trains, bikes, buses, and street cars solve almost every problem that the author complains about.The only outstanding problem, however, is that American infrastructure has been deliberately designed solely around the car. Those who suggest alternative modes of public transportation are immediately written off as &#34;impractical&#34;. Discourse ought to be centered around democratizing and diversifying the ways people can get around, not on how one ought to &#34;make dumb cars&#34;."</p>

Monopoly profits drive a political empire where people at the top think up something random, and it gets built.* Google has customer contempt. They started with brilliant people who were used to being smarter than everyone else. They also started in algorithm-driven markets like search and ad-words, where everything was statistical and individuals didn&#39;t matter. They&#39;ve lost the smarts and the ethics, and they&#39;re in a bit of a hole. I think they&#39;ve reached the end of the growth line.* I know nothing about Apple. Too secretive.* Microsoft has a bunch of cut-throat teams, competing with each other. Their technology is middling. However, they&#39;re the only one of the bunch you&#39;d want to partner with for B2B.* ... except for Amazon, which is hyper-customer-focused, and has a track record of successful forward-looking projects.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good and thorough article. The author got down to brass tacks pretty quickly and brings up interesting hypothesis about $MSFT.That said, I do have one gripe:&gt; To oversimplify Notion to its demographics, it is Office 365 for people below age 35.I recognize this is an oversimplification, but even so, it seems like a stretch. Notion is a decent product, and I have used it for a few small-scale team projects in uni (mainly for Kanban-related stuff) - but to call it a replacement for O365 is an exaggeration at best.Yes, you can have pretty, nested documents in Notion and that&#39;s great, but a tabular database in Notion is by no means a replacement for Excel or even Google Sheets. The velocity that is afforded by Excel in terms of formulas is unmatched and there&#39;s a reason it has yet to be unseated as the kingpin of modern finance.Most young people I know use a combination of Discord + Google Suite to collaborate. I am aware this is slightly anecdotal, but I am also having a hard time imagining myself as a founder and then asking my CFO to use Notion to prepare investor pitches.Source: Am 23 :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, as a developer, Microsoft is a company with deep roots in compilers and operating systems. All of the business empire started from these two foundations. 
Since its inception till today, Microsoft has been producing some global products every decade. And then making these products unbeatable in the global marketes. 
Be it Windows, Office, Exchange, Developer tools &amp; Compilers, Web Servers, XBox, Azure, Teams etc. You just name it and Microsoft is right there in almost every field with profitable products. 
A lot of people don&#39;t like the traditional Microsoft products but all of the products just work and are being used for tens of millions of customers around the globe every day. 
Any Software company with ability to create profitable products every decade is a killer company. That is the secret souce Microsoft has.As a developer just imagine about a company which gives you a developer tool to make a web application, using the company&#39;s provided compiler, which then can be deployed on a company&#39;s provided webserver and can store some data on company&#39;s provided database which is running on company&#39;s provided operating system.The company also happens to provide end-to-end tools for running a company of a 5 people to a company of 500,000 people.This is Microsoft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Similar things happen surprisingly often in companies.  Many intense arguments can be diffused by first being specific about what we agree upon.Just to add to this, one strategy from the rationalist community that I rarely see practiced is to &#39;taboo&#39; certain words.  For example if two engineers are arguing about a solution not being scalable, taboo the word scalable.  They both re-explain their POV without using the word scalable at all.  It often works like magic and they quickly reach a shared understanding."</p>

We would go look at it once in a while.   Really eerie that out in this peaceful prairie was a horrific weapon just sleeping and waiting.  Ready to go at all times.  Pointed at folks on the other side of the planet nobody in the prairie knew or would likely ever meet.After the Cold War they were decommissioning them.  While driving out there I was waved down my an APC and some soldiers.   I pulled over, they asked me to wait with them.A couple convoys of more soldiers drove by, trucks, then a big convoy with a big white truck.I asked “Was that the real thing?”   The soldier said “They don’t bring us ALL out here unless it is.”They thanked me for waiting and told me I could go after one more group when by."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The full version of Brin and Page&#39;s classic paper &#34;The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine&#34; [1], which describes the early architect of Google and is an interested read in its own right, literally has &#34;Appendix A: Advertising and Mixed Motives.&#34; Highlights include:-&#34;We believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a
competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm. &#34;- &#34;We expect that advertising
funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.&#34;- &#34;A better search engine would not have required this
ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it
could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer
advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the
advertising supported business model of the existing search engines.&#34;To be clear: the &#34;we&#34; in these quotes are the founders of Google.[1] https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-...As an aside, I&#39;ve been reading a bunch of academic papers about early web crawlers and search engines. It&#39;s a fun and interesting subject. Mercator [2] (which became Alta Vista) is another early search engine and one of the few that discusses its architecture in detail.[2] https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-173.pdf"</p>

Nowhere in the text does it actually talk about &#34;above&#34; and &#34;sidebar&#34;, that is just an interpretation that the author made up about what &#34;buying a better position in the search results&#34; would mean. Given the context of the times, it was clearly not a statement about layout but about actually reordering the &#34;organic&#34; search results based on payments and without marking those boosted results as ads."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m usually a defender of the single screen on the Model 3/Y, but on this, the author is right: the new UI (v11) is terrible compared to the previous one (v10).Not only does it hide commonly-used safety-relevant functions behind extra taps in sub-menus (as detailed), it was apparently done to free up space to offer a &#39;dock&#39; of app buttons - three permanant and three &#39;recently used&#39;.  I struggled to choose three apps I needed enough to fill the permanant spaces - and certainly don&#39;t need quick access (when I&#39;m driving!) to Netflix, or games, or whatever is popping up in &#39;recently used&#39; today.  I would like the driver profile menu to be quickly available, but alas that&#39;s been hidden too.It&#39;s a total cluster-f*ck that makes no logical sense when considering the need of drivers, and I hope they listen and revert at least this aspect of the UI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The problem isn’t really that complicated: originally the defroster icon was visible on the bottom. With the latest December 2021 update it is now hidden behind the temperature indicator. Tapping the temperature brings up a sub-window with the defroster icon.&#34;Even after reading that, I had to look at the pictures again, and read the paragraph again to find where you are supposed to tap. When they simplified the UI, they also removed the degrees symbol and the fan.Seeing as how 60-70 are both reasonable temperatures in Fahrenheit and speeds in miles per hour, it is not at all clear at a glance what that number means.(Disclosure, I work for GM)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The manufacturer changing the UI of a car after you bought it should be illegal or at least highly restricted.I think many of us have been incensed by UI changes in software we use for our daily work, and that&#39;s already bad enough; but IMHO this really crosses a line.There were jokes when Apple changed the scroll direction, comparing it to the steering wheel of a car suddenly working opposite to what everyone is used to; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible to do that with a Tesla or other modern car, but it&#39;s disturbing that we seem to be headed down that path. What an absurd reality.The icons-only UI is also a huge regression; would it really take much extra effort to add a text label? I know people often mention localisation when it&#39;s brought up, but much of the world knows English, this is an American car sold in English-speaking regions, and changing the text in software is much easier than a separate part with different printing.(I drive a 50-year-old land yacht that&#39;s received many upgrades, but all under my control; so my perspective may be slightly biased...)"</p>

You should almost never transfer ERC-20 to a smart contract. You instead use approve to give the smart contract permission to withdraw, then call the function you want to receive and tell it to make the withdraw (the contract will internally call transferFrom)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since no one seems to think about how this could have prevented, here is a simple way, which I&#39;ve applied to lots of things in life, not just cryptocurrency transfers:- If you&#39;re making a transfer somewhere with a large amount, do a small transfer first and verify it&#39;s working. Confirm at the receiving end before moving big sums.- If you&#39;re calling a contract, try it with a small amount first. Verify the parameters multiple times, and verify the return values multiple times.- If you&#39;re doing something with a huge sum of money, do it in steps instead of all-at-once. Fees won&#39;t be as big since you&#39;re already dealing with a huge sum of money anyways- Verify verify and verify that everything went alright with the small sum before trying to do something with a big sum- If you&#39;re tired, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you got some sleep- If you&#39;re rushed, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you&#39;re not rushed, have a tea and think about it- When in doubt, verify it and don&#39;t be tired- If you&#39;re not an expert, have someone who is do verification above for you"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based. Nullius in verba [1]. The whitewashing of censorship is accelerating the erosion of trust in the institutions, and it&#39;s refreshing to see a long-standing institution take a bold stance.[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullius_in_verba"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see the root cause of all this debate as a failure in scientific communication.When it comes to complex scientific decisions with significant impacts on the public, nuanced and detailed justifications are required. Instead, we often get simple declarations written by PR departments at juvenile reading level. This spawns chaotic and poorly conducted debate in all walks of life.What is required is a robust and transparent framework for honest analyses of topics. 
For example, if the CDC has a specific recommendation, They should provide an outline of the arguments, counter-arguments, assumptions, and supporting data for each part.It seems that the status quo is to completely ignore any arguments against a given recommendation. This suffocates any honest discussion in the crib. It also suggests to some that the justifications are not robust enough to survive the light of day. If you cant show your work, people will be skeptical that you did it all.This is applicable to any science based public policy, but especially obvious to covid policy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue that plagues us is a lack of trust in long-standing societal authorities.We can&#39;t follow the entire scientific proof chain for every piece of information we encounter, because we don&#39;t have time.So we rely on authority to some extent, whether that be peer review, government, independent bodies, etc.We need to be able to trust that these bodies are telling us the truth and aren&#39;t seeking to mislead us. Because when we start to doubt them, we then inevitably elect alternative bodies, simply due to limited thinking capacity/time - as explained above it&#39;s impossible to do otherwise, no-one derives from first principles every opinion they hold.The best way, _overall_, to convince someone to do something, is by clearly explaining to them the positives and negatives and letting them come to their own conclusion.It doesn&#39;t always work, and there are specific situations (e.g. someone is holding a gun to your face) in which the cost/benefit analysis is very different - in such a situation, the short term is all that exists, the long term effect of misplaced trust is irrelevant - you simply have to neutralize them.But in general, I&#39;m absolutely sure that education over coercion is the correct approach for society.Because if you force them, sure, you&#39;ve got a short term win, at the long term cost of trust. What is the long term cost of lost trust?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is handy, but the good news is that if you&#39;re dealing with anything made in the last 30-40 years, it&#39;s all but guaranteed to have the ETRTO measurements marked on it somewhere.Practically speaking there are two rim diameters you&#39;ll likely come across on all but old, &#34;unusual&#34; or high end bikes:559mm: the ubiquitous &#34;26 inch&#34; mountain bike tire. Has largely fallen out of favor on high end mountain bikes, but there are zillions of bikes with 559mm wheels and frames sized for them out there. On high end mountain bikes, largely displaced by 29&#34; or 27.5&#34; setups.622mm: &#34;700c&#34; road rims or &#34;29 inch&#34; mountain bike rims. Nearly universal on modern road bikes. If you have something else on a new road bike, you probably already know it.Other sizes you might find in the wild:630mm: The largely obsolete &#34;27 inch&#34; road rims. uncommon on new bikes, but you&#39;ll still find plenty of them on older bikes. Not even the slightest bit interchangeable with 622mm. Usually, you can&#39;t even switch to 622mm rims on frame built for 630mm because the brakes won&#39;t reach 4mm closer to the axle. Easily mistaken for 622mm if you aren&#39;t paying attention.584mm is the &#34;27.5 inch&#34; mountain bike standard that splits the difference between 26&#34; and 29&#34;. If you have this, you probably know already.Once you&#39;ve got the rim diameter right, the tire width is pretty straightforward: if it looks right, it is right. It&#39;ll be pretty obvious that a &#34;29 inch&#34; mountain bike tire doesn&#39;t go on a road rim, even if the diameter on both is 622mm. If you have needs under which that doesn&#39;t apply, you&#39;re probably already aware of them.You can put hooked tires on straight sided rims safely (I have), but likely not the other way even if you could find dedicated straight sided tires.Tubulars are a while &#39;nother animal, about which I know nothing :-)ETRTO made it much, much simpler to get the rim size right when all of the various standards had different names to different people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html  has (i think all?) of the edge cases you&#39;re going to encounter in any bike made after about 1925."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heh. Even in bicycle-rich countries like Germany and the Netherlands, these numbers are somehow still tricky. I guess it doesn&#39;t help that they are often hard to read and a lot of the numbers are actually redundant.So yeah, useful! And my compliments for the neatness in your data privacy approach.At one point I just took the old tyre into a bicycle repair shop and asked for the proper replacement, and the person who sold me one even managed to get the wrong one (they replaced it for the proper one afterwards of course). It used to be that most normal use bicycles all had the same tyre, and only racing bikes had those weird French style ones, but newer bicycles tend to have fatter tyres (which is not a bad development for sturdy day-to-day bicycles laden with groceries, an adult cyclist, and a child in front or behind the cyclist)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is extremely common. In their 30s, people get married, have kids, and move to the suburbs. Finding and keeping friends in your 30s is quite a challenge.Some tips:- move to a city - things are much much easier in a city as people are more transient, groups aren&#39;t as established, and new people arrive all the time- it sounds like you have some friends - ask them if they have any friends in your area you should meet platonically- the easiest way to make friends is an activity: you mentioned a hobby, but it can be anything - a running group, the gym, board games, etc. The more non-nerdy, the more likely you are to find non-nerdy people- if you&#39;re like me, you struggle to make friends because it&#39;s not &#34;easy&#34; like it was in college. Friends in your 30s take work: reaching out, texting, scheduling, planning, etc.- it sounds like you&#39;re not in therapy. So let me be the first to tell you that you&#39;re depressed (that &#34;apathy&#34; you&#39;re feeling is depression). Which is fine, it happens us all. But go to therapy because that&#39;s how you solve that. Just try it for a month, no pressure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;they&#39;re all full of lonely developers and other socially awkward people - short guys looking for girlfriends, unattractive/aging women looking for husbands, etc.&#34;So...people like you?
you sound really judgemental man.Since you have no friends(so nothing to hold you where you are, right?), and apparently a good source of income, I&#39;d advise you to go remote, travel, try digital nomadism, go to meetups, meet other travelers, maybe try coworking spaces? hacker houses/airbnbs with people from lots of different places?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have often been told im good at making friends and I think you can make them anytime, anywhere, anyhow, the first thing to focus on is your personal mindset and build from there:  1. Just say yes. When someone asks for anything, say yes, no matter how big or small (help them move out, look after their dog) This will put you into novel situations.
  2. Show genuine interest in things. Ask why, learn more, dig deeper, keep conversations going by trying to share anything you think is slightly relevant.
  3. Dress up. Wear things that stick out, even just a bit, a funky shirt, a nice bright pair of socks, use these to add flare to a standard dark blue and grey world, people will reflect back and be interested in you.
  4. Pick one new thing you want to master (not online) my advice here for all round great friend activities - Rockclimbing, Pub Quizes, Boardgame nights, Cycling, Pottery. Each of these almost always need another person to make them work and that helps you grow your confidence.
  5. Don&#39;t work so hard. Tell your boss you wanna slow it down, try and do 4 day weeks, give back some commitments, take a pay cut. Don&#39;t quit just slow it down and give your head some space.

I&#39;m 35, I just quit my /Director of Product role at a successful startup because I wasn&#39;t happy. I&#39;m about to go to Thailand to learn how to become a yoga teacher, not for a career but for a disciplined adventure that will deeply enrich me and is nowhere near a computer! You can do it! Put a plan in motion.HN Believes in you! :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the comments here are focused on the question of why you would prefer an app to calling. The author&#39;s point is a great one though, and something I&#39;ve wondered a lot. Why should I create an account to order a pizza? The app should reduce friction even from the very first order. Instead it adds, and adds for every order... Got to go look up coupon codes! On the phone I just ask the guy what their best deal is in a large cheese and garlic knots and he gives it to me. The app or website should make my life better but instead it&#39;s harder.Worse, the app pretends to be an unrelated party when something goes wrong. &#34;Sorry, you need to call the store. Look up their number, it&#39;s on the website.&#34; For me it doesn&#39;t add anything to the transaction, it only takes away.The literal only reason I use the pizza app at all is for chains where I have no idea which store delivers to me. Rest of the time I&#39;ve gone back to calling. Much faster that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is the happy path. It has a lot more possible sources of error/time consumption than the app and there are many benefits to the app.1. The line is busy. The app is next to never busy.2. The line has static and you are not heard correctly. Especially problematic for delivery or complicated orders. Or they may get your name wrong. My first name is common and my last isn&#39;t great over the telephone.3. You have to remember what you ordered each time. Apps let me quickly re-order.4. You cannot easily pre-pay (irrelevant if you have cash, but if you are like me and wish to never use cash again, having to pull out the card is annoying rather than just grabbing the pizza).5. Most places now seem to be on DoorDash, so you can just order from there and avoid the additional friction. You also know you can get excellent customer service from DoorDash while a new restaurant is an unknown."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My local pizza place in Seattle has moved the technology the other way. Here’s the dialog when I call.  “Pagliacci Pizza, how can I help you?”
“I’d like to order a pizza”
“Sure thing. Is this John Smith?”
“Yes”
“Do you still live at 1234 Main Street”
“Yes”
“Would you like to order the same thing you did last time?”
“Yes”
“Ok, it’ll be there in 20 minutes”Even better, while you talk to the store you called, the order goes into some sort of pizza load balancer and gives the order to the least busy store with a good drive time to your house.I’d seriously like to buy/have a beer for/with whoever designed it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with your general point that the search quality has gone down, quotes doesn&#39;t even always work anymore to get exact results.Looking into your suggested example: That turned out to be interesting and unexpected.So, the exact string you put here was &#34;David, we have been expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place, David, is where dreams are born&#34;, which is what you get when you copy the text from the website. It&#39;s correct that it doesn&#39;t work on Google searching for verbatim.The actual DOM of the snippet looks like this:    “David, we have been &lt;br&gt;expecting you - this is what you have
                           been searching for - this place, &lt;br&gt;David, is where dreams are born.”

If you take any snippet of text that doesn&#39;t do a line-break, it seems exact searches do work, like &#34;expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place&#34; or &#34;deep and melodious when it spoke&#34;.If you do take a snippet that does a line-break, then it cannot find anything, like &#34;David, we have been expecting you&#34; or &#34;this place, David, is where &#34;It seems that Google as unlearned how to treat different type of whitespaces, especially when the author/software has introduced manual line-breaks via the &lt;br/&gt; HTML tag.I&#39;m sure they have at one point introduced some &#34;quality filter&#34; that gives higher score based on how well the markup is made by the websites, for one reason or another, and eventually it got so &#34;improved&#34; or established that even if it&#39;s the only relevant hit for a human, the computer simply ignores the result for low scoring, since the markup is not 100% correct."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an Intel Realsense camera, which sometimes reports the error &#34;Failed to recconect&#34; (there being a typo in the drivers) [1] - that&#39;s a pretty unique error, so in combination with the product name that should be a very easy keyword search, right? Especially if I throw in some quotation marks, to make it clear I want a literal match?Yet when I search for realsense &#34;failed to recconect&#34; Google, in its infinite wisdom, returns pages that contain neither realsense nor recconect [2]. They offer me a supreme court opinion, a review of a car dealership, and a facebook church service.Correcting the spelling of a query is one thing - but also completely ignoring other keywords? Even when there are pages available that match the query? [1][1] https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/5ff27fca... [2] https://imgur.com/a/okYV5V2"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was looking for a specific person recently and searched:
&lt;name of person&gt; CanadaI guess they were pretty obscure so Google in all their wisdom displayed the results for Canada, with the entire name struck through. Fantastic. Defaulting to the most generic term in a query to the point of absolute uselessness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the past maintainers of minikube here. Minikube, while targeted towards Kubernetes developers, also provides all the features you&#39;d want here. It also takes away most of the pain from virtual machine management w/ native hypervisors.If you&#39;re looking for customizability (boot image, docker version, container runtime), minikube is probably your best bet. It even comes with some rudimentary file-sharing and port-forwarding primitives, but it isn&#39;t as batteries-included as Docker desktop. On the other hand, you have full ssh access to the VM to do whatever you want (+startup scripts, etc.)Awhile back, I wrote up a comparison of all the Docker Desktop Alternatives.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been exploring 2 alternatives (podman and colima) to replace my normal docker workflow, which is just building and running containers locally, sometimes with docker-compose. I started with podman but had issues with 2 main pieces of my workflow: docker-compose (or podman-compose) and shared volumes (with `run -v`). Switched over to colima and those worked out of the box for me (&#34;brew install docker; brew install docker-compose; brew install colima; colima start; docker run ...&#34;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is strange, in a way, since the series does not present an obviously alluring portrait of creative collaboration. Its principal locations are drab and unglamorous: a vast and featureless film studio, followed by a messy, windowless basement. The catering consists of flaccid toast, mugs of tea, biscuits and cigarettes. The participants, pale and scruffy, seem bored, tired, and unhappy much of the time. None of them seem to know why they are there, what they are working on, or whether they have anything worth working on. As we watch them hack away at the same songs over and over again, we can start to feel a little dispirited too.Are you kidding me?? This is probably the most inspiring part of the whole show! This is how you create things. It&#39;s a long, &#34;unglamorous&#34; slog full of dead ends, muck &amp; mire, and discovery. This is what gets an artist excited - the oeuvre in gestation, the birthing pains, the grim determination depsite not knowing whether you&#39;re pursuing genius or madness! Gets me fired up every time.The completed creation is usually a bit of a downer, like when you finish a good book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you ever played in a band, even if it&#39;s a middle-aged-friends-with-minimal-talent one, you&#39;ll enjoy Get Back immensely. It looks so real. Even if you weren&#39;t in a band, but in some other kind of a team of peers, you&#39;ll enjoy how group dynamics plays out. I still didn&#39;t manage to watch part 3, but first two are pure gold."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beatles fan since 1963 here. Easily the best thing I&#39;ve ever read about them. All the mind-reading, which I generally hate in profiles like this, is pretty well justified by context. For anyone creative, Peter Jackson&#39;s &#34;Get Back&#34; can be both heartening and devastating: the former because it reminds you that a lot of creativity is sweat equity, and the latter because holy shit, they just had it like no one else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an observation that goes back to at least Cicero.[1]Cicero on the primary goal of oratory:&#34;As, therefore, the two principal qualities required in an Orator, are to be neat and clear in stating the nature of his subject, and warm and forcible in moving the passions; and as he who fires and inflames his audience, will always effect more than he who can barely inform and amuse them...&#34;Cicero describes the problem the OP reports:&#34;But let us return to Calvus whom we have just mentioned,—an Orator who had received more literary improvements than Curio, and had a more accurate and delicate manner of speaking, which he conducted with great taste and elegance; but, (by being too minute and nice a critic upon himself,) while he was labouring to correct and refine his language, he suffered all the force and spirit of it to evaporate. In short, it was so exquisitely polished, as to charm the eye of every skilful observer; but it was little noticed by the common people in a crowded Forum, which is the proper theatre of Eloquence.&#34;Nuanced communication not working at scale, 2100 years ago.[1] https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9776/pg9776-images.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever articles like this about communication crop up, I like to remind people of Wiio&#39;s Laws[0] - from 1978:    1. Communication usually fails, except by accident.
    2. If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage.
    3. There is always someone who knows better than you what you meant with your message.
    4. The more we communicate, the worse communication succeeds.
    5. In mass communication, the important thing is not how things are but how they seem to be.
    6. The importance of a news item is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
    7. The more important the situation is, the more probable you had forgotten an essential thing that you remembered a moment ago.


Just to reiterate, these laws are over 40 years old, predating any kind of social media or internet-based communication - and they&#39;re still 100% valid.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As another example, Amazon teams communicate product launch requirements via a future press releases including a FAQ (per description in the book &#34;Working Backwards&#34;). Its a communication intended for the masses with a built-in disambiguation addendum.Our natural languages uses incremental inquiry to disambiguate context as opposed to using strong protocol. In &#34;Working Backwards&#34;, it&#39;s the communicator&#39;s job to solicit questions from co-workers via pain-staking detailed reviews in meetings (&#34;Bezos scrutinizes every single sentence&#34;). I think of it like constructing a representative survey of ambiguity, and then putting answers in the FAQ that help increase clarity. The more detailed and representative your survey, the more helpful your questions/answers will be to communicate nuance.With regard to disambiguating through protocol, Organizations evolve jargon to increment protocol, which probably increases semantic alignment somewhat as group size scales. If you read about the history of language, the Rebus principle created protocols of formal alphabets; protocols like grammar gave us formal writing rules. Protocols like TCPIP let our computers talk. Protocol creates more rigid commitments for communication, but also increases potential semantic alignment. As a thought experiment, if we learned to dynamically and deliberately develop jargons en masse, it might create the channels to disambiguate context and communicate nuance at scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been reading some variant of this, for many years.One of the reasons that I hated being a manager, was because the job involved a lot of sitting around, waiting for stuff to happen.I couldn’t work on my own projects (because I was on paid work time), and it would have been irresponsible, in the extreme, to put myself into the critical path (because it was no guarantee that I would be able to reliably work). I sometimes tasked myself with projects for work, but they were almost always ignored by my company, and that hurt.I’ve heard that being a soldier in a combat zone is long hours of idleness, punctuated by short periods of terror and stress.That pretty much describes my time as a manager, without the “terror” part (and the bullets and explosions).It sucked.I now work at home, on my own technical tasks. I get a lot done. My personal productivity is through the roof.I take a lot of breaks. Sometimes, I even nap.But I don’t have a time clock. I will often start coding, at 6AM (sometimes, before I even get in the shower, after my morning exercise), and will continue to code, until I hit the sack. I often test my software, while I’m sitting in bed, and will enter issues, from my iPad.When I have a problem that I’m chasing, or I am in the middle of a big implementation phase, I can work for many hours, straight. I will barely come up for air, and I feel absolutely exhausted, when I finally step back (nap time!).I’m not particularly concerned about a measured life. I get a lot done; far more than I ever did, when I was being paid.And I’m having a blast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Valuable prospective, but (as is the gist of half my comments here): People are even more different than you think.RescueTime wrote a similar post, but +100 data:https://rescuetime.wpengine.com/work-life-balance-study-2019...Look at the second histogram. The average is roughly aligned with OP’s summary, but there is huge variance. These comments have already devolved into people telling each other they are lying, or about to burn out - all I ask is humility in the face of our messy shared reality.Thank you for listening to my TED Talk, I guess"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article resonated with my experience as as software developer.At my first place, a small outsourcing shop, employees were required to log daily activities so hours per day roughly fit to 8 and 40 per week. From the beginning and unlike most of coworkers, I measured my time precisely with https://github.com/Klaster1/timer-5 and soon understood that doing 8 hours per day doesn&#39;t happen much and often involves staying late, so instead I simply adjusted the reported numbers to look plausible. In four years, I only received positive feedback on my productivity. What was the management thinking, I have no idea, just like the article says, this was a farce all around.When I changed the company, the habit to measure productivity stuck. Nowadays, I start working somewhere at 9 and finish at 18, and result is still the same - honest 8 hours of work activity per day happen at best once a month, the average week sums to 30-34 hours. Code-related activities never take more than 3-4 hours per day, that includes both coding and reviews. I get the impression that some of my colleagues might spend more time on the job, but low productivity was never a topic of my performance reviews, management seems content with what they get."</p>

This allows us to evolve Black&#39;s style without too much disruption to users that want consistency. The default style is updated yearly.Thanks to our maintainers for orchestrating the efforts, especially to our most recent reinforcement Batuhan (@isidentical) who was responsible for our match statement support!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So True !
After 25+ years of coding, I know one thing. I STILL don&#39;t know how to &#34;code correctly&#34;.And apart from a few gifted individuals (Rob Pike, Fabrice Bellard Bobby Bingham [ffMpeg team] etc) I&#39;m HIGHLY suspicious of ppl and programmers who claim &#34;they can program correctly&#34; and that &#34;this xyz is the correct way/stack/method/arch&#34;.Background:CS grad, start coding at around 13 (thank you dad !) I am well versed in C,C++,PHP,Go,TypeScript and to a lesser degree Java and a few bits and bobs in between F#,Haskell,LISP...The above is not to brag (not that it&#39;s brag worthy after 25 years you bound to pick up a few tools) just to put it in perspective.On Code quality:
I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s easy to agree/identify the &#34;extreme cases&#34; the VERY VERY BAD CODING and the very very GOOD CODING. But most of the coders and codebases falls somewhere in between where the code-quality-water quickly gets murky.PS2. Oh and on &#39;code reviews&#39;: It would be cool if code-reviews were done &#34;anonymously&#34; i.e I should not know until the very end WHO wrote the code. Helps to keep any personal biases at bay - my 2cents.The best thus far advise I&#39;ve seen on code-quality guidelines is from a comment on HN:&gt;I try to optimize my code around reducing state, coupling, complexity and code, in that order. I&#39;m willing to add increased coupling if it makes my code more stateless. I&#39;m willing to make it more complex if it reduces coupling. And I&#39;m willing to duplicate code if it makes the code less complex. Only if it doesn&#39;t increase state, coupling or complexity do I dedup code.Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11042400Sure I might just be a dumb idiot or completely not gifted in the &#34;art or science&#34; of coding. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coding is a highly subjective and creative endeavor. &#34;Clean code&#34; is akin to &#34;well written&#34; for writers. Sure, you can analyze and even be able to define some good practices, but because we are always creating something new that has never done before, and the field is infinitely complex, no rules can be set in stone and applied across everything.In my opinion there&#39;s nothing wrong with calling code clean, we don&#39;t have to analyze every line of code we write. There&#39;s just too many things to consider and viewpoints to take, we&#39;d be trapped in analysis paralysis forever, as you can continue it to no end. There&#39;s never a point where the analysis will be &#34;done&#34;. You just have to be able to recognize when the analysis reaches a point of diminishing returns, and when moving on is the better option. Sometimes just calling it &#34;clean&#34; is enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Uncle Bob Martin definition of &#34;clean code&#34; from his book &#34;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship&#34; is a set of rules that absolutely are not at odds with one another. If you follow them you will end up with code that&#39;s really nice to read and easier to maintain, and, most importantly, that you can confidently change.There&#39;s a decent summary here - https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988c..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are so many topics that one might consider &#34;foundational&#34; in computer science. While this (what I would call the Data structures and algos) is one approach, you could also:-- start with binary and work your way through hardware and logic gates-- start off with theory like turing machines, first order predicate logic and work your way up-- start off with a hello world, and slowly iterate over programming (in a post internet world, this is especially popular) with loops, if/then statements and so onBut, perhaps aging myself, this book is close to my idea of the traditional introduction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Commenters in this thread are making a lot of generalizations about tax structures and so on, but it important to keep in mind this is a special case at a number of levels.  Pittsburgh has an unusually large number of bridges.  These bridges were built during times of relative wealth when the local steel and related industries were doing well.  Since the decline of American industry Pittsburgh has scaled way back and had to rebuild itself as a medical and technology center.  This recovery is mostly a success story, but the infrastructure cannot be maintained.  For example, the greater Pittsburgh area has some of the first suburban areas to be completely abandoned with services withdrawn, Penn Hills being a poignant example of this.  Obviously no bridges should be coming down, but there is a real problem here of how to build and maintain a modern city that is smaller than the older one that it replaces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its stuff like this that scares me. Pittsburgh claims to have more bridges than any other city in the world.[0] You&#39;re driving around here, and you cross little ones without noticing. I hope I&#39;m not ever near (or using) a collapsing one. The rivers are big here.[0] https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-30187252Edit: not bridge related, but a sinkhole opened downtown over 2 years ago, also swallowing a bus: https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2019/10/28/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lot of talk about the Federal government need to step into a city and manage the bridges.Cities have (often highly) paid inspectors to do just that, inspect bridges and make recommendations, and issue warnings.  As noted by PascLeRasc et al. the degradation of the bridge has been reported to the city.As for funding through Federal government, my experience has always been:The resident pays their Federal tax.  The Fed takes their administrative cut.Fed allocates remaining funds to the State. The State takes their administrative cut.State allocates remaining funds to the City (or county).  The city takes their administrative cut.City allocates remaining funds to contractors to fix the bridges.Put it in an other way, humans value things exponentially more when their own sweat went into the things, than if it was just given to them.  By coming at State level, residents have a closer connection and understanding where the money came from, and would demand higher accountability.Just my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is nice initiative and any attempt to make mathematics more accessible is a  value added to society in my book. However, saying you will learn &#34;mathematical thinking&#34; by watching 1.5 hours of passively watching, even Professor Tao, is quite an overpromise. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a subject that requires more hands on practice and thinking than math, especially higher level math, so this is more along the lines of edutainment. So in my mind, how valuable this course is depends on what this content replaces for you. If watching this series replaces something distracting then its great, but if it replaces actually doing problems and working out proofs, then it&#39;s not worth it.Finally there&#39;s a celebrity aspect to Masterclass that&#39;s a bit strange. Like these guys are famous, and because they&#39;re famous, they are the most worthy to teach you something.Some series you should check out that are free and IMO provide much better value for time:Academy of Achievement: https://achievement.org/
* Some good lessons with Eric Lander, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Demis Hassabis3B1B: https://www.3blue1brown.com/Numberphile: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching the trailer, makes me think that people who may enjoy this series will also enjoy a book called &#34;Aha&#34; by Martin Gardner (from probably 40 years ago)[0].It has a lot of amusingly illustrated insight problems that show you how thinking about a problem differently simplifies getting to the answer a lot.  It&#39;s probably aimed at advanced teenagers, but in fact the lessons there are some that even many adults probably have not come across before.  I mean, I haven&#39;t watched the Masterclass, but I imagine Terrence Tao isn&#39;t teaching multimanifold group theory or something anyway, so this is the kind of insightful more daily-math problems he&#39;s helping people to understand how to think about.[0] search your favorite, ahem, LIBrary GENeric source of books to find it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first reaction to this blog post was kind of negative because Master Class is not free. I watched the teaser video and it&#39;s actually pretty inspiring. As someone who has done undergraduate Computer Science level Math, but completely forgotten most things about Math except for simple Algebra, I am going to try this.The cost is €16/month which is cheaper than Netflix. I just cancelled my Spotify recently so this is affordable for me right now.EDIT: The problem I see with Master Class as a subcription service is... if you watch Master classes on everything you are getting a broad education rather than a deep dive. I guess it&#39;s more for entertainment though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Unfortunately twitter is going the direction of quora, pinterest, facebook, and mediumDon’t forget Reddit. Reddit’s login pop-ups are more aggressive than Twitter’s for me.&gt; Now you can perhaps read ten tweets or replies to a linked tweet without an account before the same thing occursPerhaps an unpopular opinion, but I don’t think any company is obligated to provide unlimited access for free without an account. If you’re trying to scroll deep into conversations or someone’s Tweets, it’s reasonable to expect that you’d need to become a user of the website.The only login-wall that doesn’t make sense to me is Medium’s, as the site is primarily designed as a publishing platform rather than a community platform. Forcing users to create an account to read a blog post isn’t a great way to generate wide viewership of your blog posts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently quit Twitter (almost[0]) and have been much happier ever since.It seems (to me) that the way Twitter increases &#34;engagement&#34; is to show you the tweets that will upset you the most, so that you can either reply with an angry thing of your own, or furiously &#34;like&#34; other angry responses.I tried to unfollow a lot of people who tend to post about controversial topics but Twitter keeps showing me their tweets or similar ones from other people. It also insists on showing me things that are popular but that don&#39;t concern me (such as sports).There doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to see only the tweets of the people you follow. And even if there was... random thoughts and bits from people I don&#39;t know are seldom interesting, and very unnecessary.At some point I thought I was addicted to Twitter; but it turned out it&#39;s the easiest addiction to get rid of.[0] &#34;Almost&#34;: I didn&#39;t delete the account: I just logged out and stopped using Twitter completely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember walking around a trade show in the early 80&#39;s and doing something similar.  It was a &#34;HP Microwave Symposium&#34; and aside from lots of good talks and papers, the exhibit hall had lots of high dollar HP (later Agilent/Keysight) RF test equipment.  One of the items on display was a HP8566 spectrum analyzer which had a (primitive by today&#39;s standards, but) &#34;smart&#34; display capable of drawing vector graphics, time-linear graphs, and text.  After using one on my own for a while, I had become curious about the display so I had learned everything that I could about it.  So down on the exhibit hall floor, I walked up to the instrument while the sales guy was proclaiming how great it was (which was true) and I entered eight lines of code (about 30 keystrokes).  Then I pressed the button to view trace C (which most people still don&#39;t know about) and up popped a rolling blinking text display of my name.  Most of the people nearby were impressed, but since the instrument was no longer displaying the RF spectrum that the sales guy was talking about, he said; &#34;I know how to fix that.&#34; Then he walked over and pressed the green &#34;Instrument Preset&#34; button, which the HP documentation said would always restore the instrument to a known starting point.  When the display did not change, the sales guy yelled at me; &#34;WHAT DID YOU DO?!?!?&#34;  (My program was in Trace C of display memory, which is not initialized by the Instrument Preset function.)  So after watching him panic for a moment, I walked over and swapped traces B&amp;C (shift-key followed by the swap A&amp;B button).  Now my program was in trace B (and blanked) so the screen returned to normal.  Everyone was relieved!  So just before walking away, I swapped my program back into trace C, viewed trace C, and hit the green preset button again.  As I walked to the next exhibit, I saw him cycle the AC power to the instrument in frustration."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My FBI file was for hacking into my school district&#39;s AS/400 that handled my school&#39;s attendance and grading system.  Somehow using a public IP address with no access restrictions allowed a clear telnet path in from home.  Compounding username and passwords that were all the same for every employee.  I didn&#39;t change a thing, just LOLed and told someone.  Bad mistake. 
This was the late 90s.Oh well, 2 week suspension and kicked off the computers for less than a year.  A nice conference with FBI, police, my parents, IT and school administration.  Fun times.I learned my lesson to not talk about such things because their egoes were too fragile.When they decided to give students in their website design class ftp accounts on the district wide web/email server running an ancient version of Debian, they didn&#39;t disable the shell, just added a login script to a menu for pine, etc. for people who telnetted in, which I&#39;m sure the sysadmin was proud of.  However, a few fast CTRL-C&#39;s broke out of his script menu loop and got me a shell, and they didn&#39;t shadow protect their password files.  Ran it through john the ripper and had half the district&#39;s e-mail passwords in a default dictionary file including the root pw in a few minutes.  LOLed and never told anyone about that.Good times, the 90s...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A person I know studied in East Germany in the early 80s via a very limited exchange program. After the wall came down, she requested her Stasi file.It was fascinating what was in the file - lots of misunderstandings and misinterpretations. For example, she was upset when the Challenger exploded, and this mystified the Stasi informers who had previously identified her as a pacifist (in their minds, the Shuttle was 100% military).Similarly, she was trying to research what happened to a relative who had remained in Germany in the late 30s, and whether she had died of natural causes or been sent to the camps. The Stasi file was filled with speculations on the details of this &#34;sleeper agent&#34; with whom she was trying to establish contact.All this to say that from the mindset of a spy, everything is spy-craft. Everyone&#39;s world-view shapes their interpretation of events and reality itself. Was the shuttle a military venture? Partly. Was it also a tool for science? Yup. But the functionaries who looked at her data in the heat of the cold war certainly couldn&#39;t see those distinctions.For what it&#39;s worth, she was able to get her Stasi file, but has never been able to get a copy of her FBI file."</p>

All it takes is one &#34;tough&#34; agent trusting their gut feeling/algorithm based on your browsing history and shopping habits to put a target on your back and you are done.EDIT: Replacing &#34;if there&#39;s any truth to it&#34; by &#34;assuming it&#39;s true&#34;.

I also save myself several hundred a month in third party cloud provider fees to host the same services and can reboot upgrade or repair anything whenever I want, but in general no more maintenance than cloud servers . I also never end up with exciting bills when experiments are forgotten about.You pretty much get all the pros and cons of home ownership. For me it is mostly pros. Also keeps me dogfooding all the same practices I recommend to my clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A very weird thread that degenerated into: &#34;PaaS vs self-hosted/self-owned hardware&#34;.I&#39;m pretty sure most people sysadmin&#39;ing their Linux servers are actually doing it with rented dedicated servers.  TFA btw specifically mentions: &#34;don&#39;t manage physical hardware&#34;.  Big companies like Hetzner and OVH have hundreds of thousands of servers and they&#39;re not the only players in that space.They don&#39;t take care of &#34;everything&#34; but they take care of hardware failure, redundant power sources, Internet connectivity, etc.Just to give an idea: 200 EUR / month gets you an EPYC 3rd gen (Milan) with shitloads of cores and shitloads of ECC RAM and a fat bandwith.And even then, it&#39;s not &#34;dedicated server vs the cloud&#34;: you can have very well have a dedicated server and slap a CDN like CloudFlare on your webapp.  It&#39;s not as if CloudFlare was somehow only available to people using an &#34;entire cloud stack&#34; (whatever that means).  It&#39;s the same for cloud storage / cloud backups etc.I guess my point is: being a sysadmin for your own server(s) doesn&#39;t imply owning your own hardware and it doesn&#39;t imply either &#34;using zero cloud services&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When my SaaS app started scaling, I saw how badly cloud can be priced if you have even slightly unusual use-cases. It occurred to me that instead of spending ~$600/mo on GCP, I can invest in a $3000 PowerEdge server with much better hardware, run it out of my home office, and it pays for itself in less than a year.Running your own server is an investment that doesn&#39;t make sense for everyone. If you can get it, it is better than you might imagine. Being in full control--the master of your own destiny--is so liberating and empowering. It feels the difference between constantly ordering Lyft/Uber/riding with friends, vs. owning your own car.Not to mention, again, my hardware resources are so much better. This one server can run multiple profitable SaaS apps / businesses and still have room for experimental projects and market tests. Couldn&#39;t be happier with my decision to get off the cloud."</p>

It&#39;s like being told your gonna learn how to draw an owl you start with some ovals and then you have a completed owl.Low level stuff has always been interesting to me, I just have no clue how one would even get started with it, or who would even pay me to work on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is it that closed source drivers are the norm rather than the exception for hardware companies?People need to buy your hardware to use your drivers.Meaning driver development is a cost.  The revenue comes from hardware sales.  You&#39;re usually offering the driver to the public for free on your website anyway.  Why not simply open source it?If you open source your driver, community developers could potentially give you free help -- e.g. porting to Linux, getting into the mainline kernel, fixing bugs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a lot of fancier note taking tools but I keep going back to Zim. Been using it for years for private offline note-taking for work. I use quick notes and journal shortcuts many times a day to quickly jot down a followup note/idea/question in meetings. It&#39;s also my GTD system with tasks plugin. Love that it&#39;s just text files so I can manually edit them, version control, sync in private cloud service, etc. Never worry about losing my data.There are a few quirks I&#39;ve gotten used to over the years though:- Pasting code will be garbled or auto-create tags unless you use the source view plugin or paste verbatim.- Takes a little configuration out of the box to get just right, system dependencies, links opening in right browser, plugins, shortcuts, fonts. But once you get streamlined it just works.- The syntax feels a little strange to me but I rarely need to edit raw files. I could also export to Markdown if I ever wanted to migrate.My last tip, templates are awesome. I have ones for all kinds of things, like interviewing, 1-1s, and architecture design outline."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is time to give a shout out to my favorite note taking app: Trilium https://github.com/zadam/triliumPros:  1. Data is saved in SQlite. I am at 33k notes and it springs open instantaneously.    
  2. Notes can be arranged into arbitrarily deep tree. Single note can be placed into multiple places in the tree. (Think soft-links)     
  3. WYSIWYG support (CKEditor)   
  4. Tags, advanced scripting features    
  5. Other ususal wiki stuff like backlinks, note-map etc

Cons:  1. Electron.    
  2. Data is saved in SQlite, not plain text."</p>

But any language will work.Examples..lets see.  I add todo items from anywhere (including phone) with email. I use Blitzmail on the phone and an IMAP script on the computer to send myself a tagged email, then I have another script to check and parse and add them to Zims &#34;Journal&#34;My personal website is in Zim. I have a short one-liner to update it to my server; but I also teach at a college. I learned just enough of the Canvas API to also update certain pages of it to my class webpages. Also another one to update the Slides I make in Zim as well.Etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dislike this kind of consensus-building rhetoric and I don&#39;t like seeing it on the front page of HN. By all means present critiques of crypto/web3, but don&#39;t make false claims along the lines of &#34;all right-thinking people agree that X is a scourge upon the earth&#34;.It&#39;s equivalent to starting a conversation off with a loaded question - a useful tactic if you&#39;re trying to score points, but not likely to lead to anyone learning anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like many people back then, I also found the whole proof-of-work / blockchain concept to be interesting from a theoretical computer science / distributed systems perspective.But these days, I can&#39;t help but think that we&#39;ve inadvertently created a paperclip maximizer without even bothering to create an AGI first. Humans are the AGI, and we&#39;re going to happily use more and more energy to play this stupid game for as long as it looks like there&#39;s a profit to be made, even if the global outcome is to our own detriment.If we want this mess to go away, we need to find a way to change the incentives globally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it strange that people keep promoting that YouTube documentary. Ignoring tone issues, there is a lot of cherry picking and other logical fallacies. For example, he talks about how terrible Tether is and then completely ignores USDC. He also claims that none of the popular blockchains can scale, but Solana is frequently in the top 5 most popular cryptocurrencies.It seems to me that people that do an hour of research are polarized hard. Either love it or hate it. The more time you spend understanding the space the more nuanced it becomes. Many are using the technology to facilitate scams and overpromising, but that doesn&#39;t make the technology fundamentally useless or bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also read Florian Mueller’s excellent analysis here: http://www.fosspatents.com/2022/01/35-us-states-and-microsof...&gt; Epic&#39;s appeal is very much alive. Apple will use its market power and money to get support from all sorts of &#34;friends of the court&#34; as well, possibly even ridiculous astroturfing organizations. But it won&#39;t be able to counterbalance the support Epic received from 35 states, Microsoft, the EFF, and America&#39;s most cited and most authoritative antitrust law professor. It will probably be easy to see for the Ninth Circuit that those who support Epic do so because it&#39;s the right and necessary thing to do, while those who will support Apple are just going to have reasons to do Apple a favor.Update: The U.S. federal government has now filed a brief as well:&gt; The United States enforces the federal antitrust laws and has a strong interest in their correct interpretation. The United States files this brief, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 29(a)(2), to address errors in the district court’s analysis of the Sherman Act, which, if uncorrected, could significantly harm antitrust enforcement. The United States takes no position on the merits of the parties’ claims.Further analysis on the government’s brief specifically: http://www.fosspatents.com/2022/01/biden-administration-back..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really care about Epic (because they are far from being a dream company you are likely to sympathize today - they hardly care about anybody&#39;s rights actually, just about their own revenue) but once I have an iPad/iPhone I want alternative browser engines, terminals, emulators/VMs and being able to write and run an app of my own without having to even inform (let alone pay) Apple about this. I also believe 30% is too much for an app developer to pay the device manufacturer anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple&#39;s 30% revenue cut is absurd rent seeking behavior. Good on these states. Let&#39;s keep it going and continue to dismantle similar systems at other companies.Apple can continue to mandate Apple payment options are as an option in every app, but let&#39;s watch as that 30% drops to nothingness once they face real competition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes company legal teams can be the most accessible way to draw attention to something like this, and I don&#39;t mean in a combative way. They&#39;re very risk conscious, they see a &#39;10+ years of building a heavy metal community, gone like a puff of smoke&#39; in terms of risks, both of bad publicity but also if you were to somehow litigate because of the damage to your business or project. Often they have an email address that is manned because they have to respond to legal requests of various types.You can potentially request all your data (and data about the hack) and let them know why, maybe reach out asking how you can get law enforcement involved and who you should contact after you&#39;ve made a police report. It&#39;s not a threat, but it get it on somebodies radar. If you express how devastated you are there is potential for them to help. They also have a lot more latitude than any kind of helpdesk (especially at the scale of Facebook, and the users/customers facebook has).They&#39;re also well connected with-in an organization because they have to sign-off on all kinds of projects and risks.I think `patio11` has amazing advice is a similar vein[1].[1]: https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768?lang=... (I think he has a longer version/reference, but I can&#39;t find it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Probably not the advice you&#39;re looking for, but looks like you have a blog also and am assuming that some/many of your subscribers also look at your blog. So, you may want to use your blog to spread the word about losing your page so that your subscribers know what&#39;s happening and you don&#39;t lose many of them.In addition, while you should keep looking at ways to recover your FB page, but you may want to take this opportunity to create a more traditional forum of your own.You may want to look at AVSForum.com, Home-Barista.com and others for ideas on how to structure very successful traditional review/forum sites and while it may be more effort initially as you&#39;ll have to build it yourself, in the long run it may be more fruitful for you.Either ways, Good Luck!!"</p>

We do all of this today at my company, except where we can&#39;t - for example, a lot of our vendors don&#39;t offer FIDO2 2FA or webauthn, so we&#39;re stuck with TOTP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real crux of the issue is the long-tail of applications which were never conceived with anything but network-based trust. I&#39;m certain the DoD is absolutely packed with these, probably for nearly every workflow.The reason this was so &#34;easy&#34; for Google (and some other companies, like GitLab[1]) to realize most of these goals is that they are a web-based technology company - fundamentally the tooling and scalable systems needed to get started were web so the transition were &#34;free&#34;. Meaning, most of the internal apps were HTTP apps, built on internal systems, and the initial investment was just to make an existing proxied internal service, external and behind a context aware proxy [1].The hard part for most other companies (and the DoD) is figuring out what to do with protocols and workflows that aren&#39;t http or otherwise proxyable.[1] https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/cloud-iap-context-aware-ac...[2] https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/10/02/zero-trust-at-gitla..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our corporate IT folks have a Zero Trust Manifesto in which there are enrolled devices (laptops that remote SREs can carry around), there are enterprise applications, and there&#39;s connectivity between these (e.g., tunnel pairs). SREs often need to write scripts that operate on sensitive production data from the enterprise applications, but must do this work directly on an enrolled device.Pre-Zero-Trust days seemed safer. Copying production data to a laptop wasn&#39;t allowed. Instead, each SRE had their own Linux VM in the data center, accessible from home and able to run the scripts (with connectivity to the enterprise application). This prevented a whole class of realistic attacks in which a laptop (while unlocked/decrypted) is taken by an adversary. Admittedly, in return, we&#39;re protected from a possible, but less likely, attack in which a Linux VM is compromised and used for lateral movement within one segment of the enterprise network. (An enrolled device has to be in the user&#39;s possession; it can&#39;t be any machine, Linux or Windows, in the data center or office.)The only people who love this are our enterprise application vendors. Our bosses are paying them a TON more money to implement new requirements where, in theory, all possible types of data analysis can be done directly within the enterprise application. No more scripts, no more copying of data. No more use of Open Source. And, of course, people from these same enterprise application vendors advise the government that Zero Trust must be a top priority mandate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Naomi Wu seems to upset a lot of people. She makes things, and was accused by the publisher of &#34;Make&#34; magazine of being a fake, with some guy doing the actual work. She replied by posting long, detailed videos of her making stuff. An hour of cutting aluminum extrusions with a chop saw and putting together a frame. Soldering PC boards. Eventually, the guy apologized.One of the useful things she&#39;s done is to put up lots of videos of her running around Shenzhen. There aren&#39;t enough ground-level videos of the working parts of Chinese cities. There&#39;s extensive coverage of Tokyo, by comparison. It&#39;s interesting to see the high-density housing blocks and street-level activity. (The &#34;let&#39;s increase housing density&#34; crowd from Strong Towns should watch those videos.) People who&#39;ve met her report that she knows Shenzhen very well, down to the back alley level, where some unmarked door leads to an important factory. She&#39;s toured the electronics markets of Huaqiangbei. (I miss the days when Silicon Valley had electronics parts stores.)She&#39;s done some nice technical work. Her main thing is 3D printing, and she came up with the first angled 3D printer that worked reliably. The print head moves in a plane 45 degrees from vertical, and the base surface is a belt, which advances the workpiece one layer at a time. So it can produce objects continuously, or very long objects if you add support rollers. Others had made prototypes of such machines, but the properties of the belt and print head are touchy to make that work right. She got it all working, and it&#39;s now a product, with her picture on the box.At various times she&#39;s pushed on GPL compliance, mask quality, and other issues of interest to the tech community.She wears skimpy outfits sometimes. So what? That&#39;s most of Instagram. Unlike most Instagrammers, Wu has something original to say. Sometimes with a biting wit. I gather that it&#39;s more biting in Cantonese."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For any Westerners here who seem to have a hard time understanding why this is wrong:Look at an even more women-oppressing culture such as that of Afghanistan under the Taliban. Women are required to cover their faces in public. Why? For &#34;modesty.&#34; What it boils down to is that if women show their faces it could have a negative effect on men (sexual attraction).A lot of people where are shaming her for being essentially immodest in her quest for female empowerment. A face is not immodest. A boob is not immodest. It is not sexualized because it is just a body part. It takes a man to do the sexualization, so the sexualization isn&#39;t the boob, but a man&#39;s who is doing the sexualization. A baby does not sexualize the boob (it&#39;s food). They get conditioned to it by society and culture as they grow older (a culture that sexualizes it).Sub out face in Afghanistan with boob in America and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s the same picture. While we should pat ourselves on the back for being so progressive as to allow women to show their faces in public, we haven&#39;t quite gotten to the point where it&#39;s ok to show boobs in public. And yes, some women prefer to wear burkas, just as some women prefer to hide their boobs in public.The point is that those restrictions on women shouldn&#39;t be dictated by the actions or effects they have on men. Instead, men should either change their viewpoints or control their own sexualization so that women don&#39;t have to accommodate. These immodest views come from those who sexualize women, and because that&#39;s out of the control of women so they should not be forced to accommodate something out of their control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh... while talented, she is constantly pushing the boundaries of taste and the YouTube TOS to gain subscribers.She pretends to be some women&#39;s rights activist when she&#39;s really just a purveyor of some weird type of titillation. Yes the algorithm is capricious, yes its arbitrary, and yes YouTube is evil. But she&#39;s clearly making a bust of herself naked. I&#39;m sure if I put my balls on YouTube they&#39;d be more than demonetized.I have no problem with her personally, I also don&#39;t find her interesting at all... but it is what it is. YouTube probably needs to classify videos more finely grained so that we can distinguish between types of videos and match tolerances for blue content to advertisers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first job out of school was at a dot-com in Vegas in the year 2000 initially as the network administrator. Susan was the Director of Marketing. My first interaction with her was typical assisting someone with some issue or another, but I noticed her book shelf was full of very technical books, and it turned out she was a Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert and I was just a simple MCP (I was new to Windows NT, my background was in Netware). I was about 22 and she was about 40, and it was very intimidating at the time, especially after I learned she was Susan Thunder.While the company was downsizing (dot-com bust) the CTO told me to batten down the hatches while Susan was being laid off. I told him that I&#39;m fairly confident she knows more about NT than I do and that I didn&#39;t think I could do enough to secure things, so we more or less shut things down for the night.I sort of remember the whole company being scared of her in general. I don&#39;t know why though, she was always very nice to me and seemed pleasant in general. It was an overreaction to shut down the network that night, Susan never attempted revenge. In hindsight, she was probably an adult that understood that companies fail and it wasn&#39;t personal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;&#34;&#34;
One could imagine a very imperative “cluster operating system,” like the above, which exposed primitives like “allocate 5 CPUs worth of compute” or “create a new virtual network,” which in turn backed onto configuration changes either in the system’s internal abstractions or into calls into the EC2 API (or other underlying cloud provider).
&#34;&#34;&#34;There is a name for this: Single System Image. There is no need to write the operating system layer - Linux works well.I built a SSI. Each grid can host several apps, &#39;gridapps&#39;. As priorities change during the day, an operator can rebalance resources using a bash-like shell. Each gridapp has (1) core nodes, which need to keep running, and (2) scale nodes which can be started and stopped. Nodes can be configured so they are taskset-bound to an individual processor, or sharing a processor between several nodes. There are equivalent primitives for memory and persistent storage. Commercial, 1000 cores.The author contrasts this with K8s by saying that K8s is declarative. This is not the important distinction. My system had declarative configuration, and did a fitting at startup.The key difference is motive. The design above is the natural choice when you build a grid computer from first-principles.K8s is designed to solve a different problem: scaling up the traditional model of programming. Here, a developer writes an algorithm on their workstation. The deployment circumstances and interactions with other systems are an afterthought. Often this developer does not deploy the code themselves, this is done by another team who don&#39;t understand the internals of the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Disclaimer: I have never used k8s, so cannot assess the factual accuracy of this piece.)If Kubernetes hasn’t yet incorporated this article into their documentation somewhere prominent, they should. This is an excellent, and crucial, piece of documentation: providing a mental model and explaining key design decisions. All complex systems should have a document like this one. As a newcomer, this is what I want to read first.Bravo, author. I hope you get rewarded."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not mentioned in this writeup, is the added complexity of not using IPv6 inside.IPv6 has an on-demand, probabalistic-unique unroutable address assignment model called ULA and it was made for something like this. Instead of NAT and the like, this framework could have been using semantic address models in the bits of the IPv6 address space, and delivered V6 to the edge.But they went v4 only, and acquired all the growing pains of making that work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I generally enjoy my AirPods. They are occasionally quirky, but most of the time they really do “just work” for me. The annoyances are annoying when they happen, though.The strangest part is that the annoyances aren’t getting any better over time. At first I assumed that they were growing pains of an early product launch. Yet now we’re years into the AirPods experience and they continue to be just as quirky as when I first got them.Apple seems so hot or cold on fixing their own bugs. Certain bugs get rapidly patched in the next iOS or Mac software release. Other bugs languish for what feels like forever. Do Apple execs just not use AirPods? Are they using a different configuration or hardware combination that doesn’t have these bugs? Have they just trained themselves to overlook the bugs because the workarounds have become a reflex? I can’t imagine working at any tech company where one of the flagship products had such a high rate of annoyances without having a lot of engineers diverted to replicating, diagnosing, and fixing it ASAP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s weird to me how many people are like &#34;yeah but every other bluetooth is worse&#34;. I have Airpod Pros and experienced every one of these issues and many more on the regular with them, but my several years old now Bose QC 35II never have any of these problems, still last like 5 times as long on battery after years of recharge cycles, interact better with two simultaneously connected devices, have better signal range before dropping out, and I can control the damned volume without trying a dozen times to get Siri to wake the fuck up because airpods have no built-in volume controls and Siri&#39;s voice activation is worse than terrible.The Airpods are set to connect automatically to my macbook when I wear them AND THEY DON&#39;T. EVER. And then calls on my iPhone will stupidly decide to connect and route audio to airpods that I&#39;m not even wearing while they are just sitting on my desk when the phone was literally moments before using the handset speaker for a video. Know what bluetooth device does not have these problems? You guessed it, the one not made by Apple. Like...come on.I really want to like airpods, but they&#39;re just not good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a few more:- Airpods sometimes do not charge when in the case. Usually need to pull it out and put back in again.- Knowing what airpod(s) and case are charging. The UI on the phone, the open the case sliding window, the widgets, and the case light itself are not very useful.- Spatial audio working on some apps but you&#39;re not usually aware if it&#39;s on until you tilt an ear one way to confirm.- Out of ear detection sometimes doesn&#39;t work well and will drain the respective airpod.- No preference list of what devices should have precedence over others. Especially when working on 2+ devices.- Hand-off calls is a weird UX. Why would I answer a phone on my iPhone by default when it&#39;s clear I have airpods connected and being used?- The transparency / noise cancelling dance. Not sure if there&#39;s a preference, but it feels random which one is on by default. Always do a double check at the gym or when running as outside noise sounds loud.Still the best headphones and experience in my opinion and have enabled me to achieve a hell of a lot more because of them. Easily worth the price for how much I use them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nice. This is a simple, straightforward design, and a reasonably convenient form factor.Two biggest limitations are RAM and wireless interfaces, or rather lack thereof. This thing has less RAM than my router (admittedly a $70 box), and has neither WiFi nor BT. It does not seem to have many GPIO pins, too.With the amount of RAM installed, it&#39;s mostly a handheld terminal, and maybe a handheld console with emulators for old games.While this is admirable as a proof of concept, I suspect that moving the price point up to, say, $30 could give a much more useful and hacker-friendly device.I greatly appreciate the split keyboard and the replaceable NiMH batteries, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In China we buy second-hand Redmi 2 for 60RMB each (roughly $9.5). Can be bought in quantities. Fully functional with 2GB RAM+16GB eMMC, and battery, touchscreen, WiFi, Bluetooth, camera, and even 4G support. It&#39;s not built from scratch like this one, but if you are just looking for something cheap, then this price is insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have never understood people who mourn the death of the &#34;old&#34; internet because I do not feel I have lost it. Particular communities come and go, as they always have, but I have found that the I can find the same sorts of gathering places for the same kinds of people I always have - in about the same numbers too.The thing that has changed is that a huge swath of new people have come online and, though some of what brought them online is wider access to connectivity, a lot of what brought them online are new kinds of communities. They showed up for social media and most of them just aren&#39;t that interested in the things that made up the &#34;old&#34; internet.I put &#34;old&#34; in quotes because people have kept and maintained the parts they love. You can still play MUDs, you can still visit BBSes, people still run Hotline servers[1]! Many of these communities have changed because the world has changed: lots of people who played MUDs in 1990 have moved on to other online games, but lots have not! Critically - tools have continued to be developed. You can use IRCCloud (and be told it makes you a bad IRC&#39;er), you can play MUDs on your phone, etc. These communities have changed with the times and improved for it.My sense is that the absolute number of people who are involved in these communities has dropped, but not actually by that much? Maybe half as many people play MUDs now as they did at the peak - but it&#39;s a steady half. I think of it like the communities around vinyl or around film photography: less central than they once were, but healthy and vital.I am really glad that people who were not online at all during their peak are discovering these older forms. We have kept them for good reasons. But don&#39;t call it a comeback, they have been here for years.[1] https://hotline.fandom.com/wiki/Clients"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sure hope that&#39;s right. It was the best feeling in the world to stand up an Apache server on my Amiga, and later my little FreeBSD server, and see my friends viewing the website I was hosting on my dialup connection. It wasn&#39;t pretty, it wasn&#39;t elegant, and it certainly wasn&#39;t fast, but it was mine. I made that. From installing the server to writing the HTML, I owned that service from end to end and had completely freedom to do whatever I wanted with it.That&#39;s what I want the Internet to look like for my younger family and friends. It&#39;ll probably never happen exactly this way, but I can picture someone running an IPv6-only service on their phone to impress their friends. I know what their smile would look like because that was once my smile, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this article doesn&#39;t address the reason why people moved away from the &#34;old&#34; Internet --- most people only care about their _content_ not the particular technology that backs it.In the old times, you could only host content if you were really good with the technology. The people who had websites were people who knew how to set up and run a web server, and to compose the HTML content that was being served. Similarly, communities who ran BBS forums, mailing lists, IRC, etc. all needed at least some people who could set up and manage the technology for them.Centralized services (Web 2.0) changed that. Now all of a sudden you didn&#39;t need to run your server --- you could just type some text and click some buttons to put up a blog on a shared service (myspace? blogger? wordpress.com?). You didn&#39;t need to run your own forum or mailing list or chat rooms, you could just put your community on an existing service that provided that (Google groups, FB/Whatsapp/&lt;insert your IM&gt; Chat). Need a forum? You have reddit. What is Twitter if not just a collection of mailing lists that you can openly subscribe to but not post on? Centralization allowed the vast majority of people to do what they wanted to do while &#34;outsourcing&#34; the technology part to somebody else, because most people don&#39;t care about the technology they care about their content.The problem with the modern decentralized web (3.0?) is that we haven&#39;t focused on solving the real problem --- making it easy to manipulate _content_. If anything, setting up a Web 3.0 presence is _harder_ than it was on a centralized service, and as long as it remains harder, the new &#34;old&#34; Internet will always be a niche."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I feel like I&#39;m encountering more and more sites and articles where I can&#39;t seem to find the date.It seems to me that its become standard practice on marketing type blogs for corporate websites to remove the date from their posts. I think its because (from personal experience) the company will go though a burst of &#34;blog productivity&#34; create a load of content but then not touch it for years, they don&#39;t want that content to look out of date or their website to look stagnant.Removing the date from their posts, or any other content, hides how old it is and therefore obscures how active they are at crating new content.Most companies try to use their blogs to attract new customers, a new customer may visit their website once or twice and will never see the blog again, it&#39;s not important that they do. They don&#39;t want it to look stale.As a counter example, an interesting thread from yesterday [0] was about how CloudFlare use their blog not as a marketing tool but for technical content and attracting employees. They very regulally use their blog, and so keep the date on it showing how fresh it is.0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30070422"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: On of the best friends of my oldest daughter moved to a new rented flat recently. When I saw the address for a playdate, I recognised it and said to my daughter &#34;I think you went to a birthday party at this address when you were 3-5 years old when another of your friends must have lived here&#34;. To corroborate this, I looked up the calendar on my phone, where I&#39;m pretty organised about putting dates and locations of events. However, at that point I discovered that Google Calendar only keeps 2 years of history!So modern technology is literally erasing our pasts. Not just calendar entries, but messaging systems (people used to keep handwritten letters for decades), and possibly even photos (if we&#39;re not careful about preserving them).Edit: See my clarification of the 2 years in comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30084620 below. I still think the point remains - we do not own or value our digital data in the same way as physical objects, and there is a much heightened risk of that data disappearing as a result, either by the owners of the platforms the data is stored on archiving the data or by us not valuing it enough to preserve exports and backups through long periods of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s search quality has taken a serious nosedive in the last couple of years - the last 6 months in particular.I think they implemented some new form of search term widening which is far too strong, so the results you want are often buried among pages and pages of results for the general category of things that you searched for rather than close matches for your keywords. Combined with the recency bias that other people have talked about and you end up with a lot less useful search for precise searching.This coincides with a large increase in the number of surveys that my partner has been getting through the Google Rewards program that ask whether or not a recently used search term gave relevant results. Obviously that&#39;s just anecdotal, but it does feel like there are substantial changes in the algorithm, and not necessarily for the better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Takeaway: to dramatically decrease the chance of Google rewriting your title, matching the H1 to the title tag seems to be an effective strategy.Of course it should be mentioned this wont last if it becomes popular. Historically every time an SEO trick gets popular, the rules are adjusted. Even having this article on the front page of HN might be enough to see Google react by rethinking how (or whether) tags in titles affect the title rewrites."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a different conclusion. The article mentions that the car would have cost her 3 months of income. That doesn&#39;t sound too much and is roughly about the same what people pay for cars today, maybe even more.The reason she thought about the car as a luxury and not a necessity is that then the society wasn&#39;t dependent on cars like we do today. They travelled less, worked closer to home, milkman brought milk to home and grocery shopping could be done closer to home as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting that he compares everything that is hard to compare but ignores one thing that would be very easy - rental pricing. You had to pay it then and you have to pay it now.&#34;four bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and a “nice outlook on green.” The rent was £90 for a year.&#34;According to one CPI calculator (https://www.in2013dollars.com) &#34;£90 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £4,951.54 today&#34; and &#34;£700 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;.Google search also reveals that average yearly wage in London in 1920 was £205 and average wage in London in 2021 was £53,700 so £700 income in 1919 was 3.5 times the average which in 2021 would be £187,950 (quite a bit more than &#34;equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;).A quick web search for 4 bedroom apartment (not sure about sitting rooms) in London shows that rent is between £2,000 and £8,000 per month - let&#39;s say £5,000 for a nice one like what Christie&#39;s sounds like which is £60,000 per year.
They paid £90/£700 = 13% of their (3.5 the average) annual income for rent and now the equivalent rent would be £60,000/£187,950 = 32% of the 3.5 the average annual income.Even just comparing the plain average income, person in 1919 could rent the same apartment and still have £205 - £90 = £115 to live on for the year (which seems possible considering maid lived on £36 per year but in 2021 the average income leaves you £53,700 - £60,000 = £6,300 short on the rent alone.So ignoring the tvs, computers, holidays, cars, healthcare and all the things that we cannot compare and comparing what we can, it is obvious that just to live in 2021 we need more money that what we are making and so it is easy to see how most people feel that the living standards have gone down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly enough, I&#39;m typing this in Singapore, where in 2022 it&#39;s quite common to have a &#34;maid&#34; (helper/domestic worker, in the current local lingo), but no car.Singapore imports domestic workers for poor neighbouring countries like the Philippines and Myanmar, which keeps wages very low, on the order of US$450/month, not too far off Christie&#39;s inflation-adjusted US$220/month.  Even the fully loaded cost with government levies, insurance, food &amp; board etc is on the order of $1000/month, considerably cheaper than most other childcare options, particularly if like most Singaporeans both parents work longer hours.By comparison, Singapore strictly limits the number of cars on the road, auctioning permits called &#34;Certificates of Entitlement&#34; to the highest bidder and imposing around 100% taxes on the cars themselves.  As a result, a plain vanilla Toyota Corolla costs US$120,000 all in.  What&#39;s more, half of that is the COE cost, which is valid for only 10 years, meaning the value of the car depreciates by around $10,000 every year.  Add in petrol, servicing, parking etc, and having a live-in helper to run errands and drop off kids etc starts to look quite affordable in comparison."</p>

The contract isn&#39;t a wholesale deal, meaning if your widget doesn&#39;t sell, it&#39;s sitting on your balance sheet, not on Amazon&#39;s balance sheet. It would be like if Costco instead of buying 1000 legos, just stocked legos in it&#39;s warehouse, then paid Lego company everytime a single unit sold. 
Then they figured out how to make their own legos through a different supplier, they fixed the original Lego price $5 more expensive then the store brand legos. Now Legos sell for $30 a box and Kirkland Legos sell for $25 a box, same exact product, just a few bucks cheaper. Oh and lego couldn&#39;t drop the price from 30 to 20 to compete....That&#39;s what Amazon has done. Price fixing and control of the competitors inventory. Damn bastards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case others were as confused as i was about this&#34;While they’re often confused, Sold by Amazon and Fulfilled by Amazon are two different things.    With SBA, Amazon prices your products and owns any transactions that take place. When an item sells, they pass the proceeds on to you for allowing them to sell your product.

    With FBA, you price your products and own the transactions. It is a service where Amazon handles the order fulfillment process for your products.&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the author of esbuild. I think this is a very smart, practical choice and is one of the approaches that has the best chance of succeeding (the other being a semi-automated porting tool instead of a purely manual port). I&#39;m very excited to see someone take this approach. This is how I would do it if I were to do it. Web developers around the world are hoping this works out :)The hard part about this project isn&#39;t doing the port but keeping up with the constant changes from the TypeScript team, especially if the TypeScript team isn&#39;t invested in helping you out. Staying as close as possible to the source language like this will be a big win there.One of the big benefits of a native language like Go aside from lack of a JIT is the ability to easily add shared-memory parallelism. I haven&#39;t studied the TypeScript compiler internals so I&#39;m not sure how easy it is to parallelize their type checker. However, I assume that it would be relatively straightforward to parallelize the parsing of JavaScript files, so I&#39;d hope for at least be a big speedup there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when people try to make a new Ruby implementation. They get the basics down and think &#34;this isn&#39;t so bad! I can do this!&#34;. Fast forward a few months and they&#39;re stuck on some nasty little edge case around eval and method_missing that they need to run Rails. Or some weird aspect of C extensions.TypeScript&#39;s compiler is an unholy, unsound mess, because JavaScript is an unholy, unsound mess. Sure the basics of type checking structs and variables is somewhat easy. But what about conditional types? What about weird generic constraints? What about indexing types? There&#39;s some really confusing stuff going on underneath the hood.It&#39;s also a mess that *does not have a spec*. Even if you somehow manage to  make a type checker that implements most of the features, there&#39;s no way to ensure it has 1 to 1 parity with TypeScript. Plus that parity can be broken at any point.The only way I could see this happening is if the author somehow convinced Anders Hejlsberg or a significant portion of the TypeScript team to work on this new implementation. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s gonna happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; tsc depends on shared mutability and has a cyclical mutable reference.
 Rust is designed to prevent this behavior.
Having two references to the same data (shared mutability)
 is undefined behavior in Rust.This problem has numerous solutions in Rust - (A)Rc, RefCell etc. I don&#39;t understand how this caused the author of the article to stop considering Rust."</p>

If you’re vaccinated, your chances of getting severely sick are extremely low. Even among people 65 and older, the combination of the vaccines’ effectiveness and the Omicron variant’s relative mildness means that Covid now appears to present less danger than a normal flu.&gt; For the unvaccinated, however, Covid is worse than any other common virus. It has killed more than 865,000 Americans, the vast majority unvaccinated. In the weeks before vaccines became widely available, Covid was the country’s No. 1 cause of death, above even cancer and heart disease.At this point if an adult in the US is unvaccinated it is (1) almost certainly by choice (there are some people who cannot get it for medical reasons but they make up only a very tiny fraction of the unvaccinated), and (2) it is very unlikely that any evidence or logical arguments will chance their minds.With COVID becoming endemic everyone is going to get antibodies, with the only choice being whether you get your first antibodies by vaccination or by getting COVID.The only question really then is how fast do we want the unvaccinated to do the getting antibodies by getting COVID thing. The faster they get it, the faster we can be as done with COVID as we are ever going to be.I&#39;d say the answer to that should be determined by the hospital capacity. If a region has sufficient hospital capacity that it would not be overwhelmed by the increase in COVID cases among the unvaccinated go ahead and lift most restrictions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The media&#39;s binary separation of populations into vax and unvax is a false dichotomy. More causal factors would be represented by:  1. Covid-recovered 
  2. Vaccinated
  3. Partly-vaccinated (&lt; 14 days after 2nd shot)
  4. Covid-naive + Unvaccinated

CDC reporting bundles #3 and #4.  UK reports all 4 categories separately.#1 was already a high percentage in 2021 and is now higher due to Omicron.Edit: CDC estimated pre-Omicron #1 as 146 million people (as of Oct 2021), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burd..."</p>
