								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://archive.is/egPlc“The research that we’ve seen is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a congressional hearing...“We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,” said one slide from 2019, summarizing research about teen girls who experience the issues.
“Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” said another slide. “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.”From what researchers said in a March 2020 slide presentation posted to Facebook’s internal message board."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it Facebook / Instagram&#39;s fault or us as a culture? As a culture we adore beauty, wealth, power...Facebook seems to be just a platform where our natural desires can have a play. Facebook hasn&#39;t created this impossible beauty ideal, it was created long long ago by Hollywood and the fashion industry. Facebook just makes it super easy for people to become obsessed with something by &#34;connecting&#34; with it. 
It used to be that 40 years ago you watched some supermodel in a commercial for 20 seconds and she was gone. The novelty with the internet is that now you can follow this supermodel and get dozens of alerts a week about her.
If it&#39;s not Facebook it&#39;s gonna be TikTok or something other platform."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So here&#39;s a potential business model for this: salvage rights.When ships sink, the owner generally still retains ownership of any property. Sometimes the location of the wreck is known. Sometimes it needs to be found. It can cost a lot of money to find a wreck and recover any property.So salvage rights are a principle of maritime law such that whoever does this is entitled to a reward commensurate with the value of the goods recovered (eg 10%).I imagine there are orbital slots that are essentially unusable because of space debris (eg Project West Ford [1]). If orbital slots are sufficiently scarce then these could have value. At some point it may become commercial to spend the effort cleaning up an orbit and making it available. Companies could then be compensated for the value they create this way.I do believe this will still require a dramatic decrease in launch costs, as in orders of magnitude more. But we&#39;ll see.My personal belief (and hope) is that the future of getting into orbit is orbital rings [2]. If so, that completely changes the game because cleaning up an orbit essentially becomes a problem of just holding up a giant &#34;paddle&#34; (for lack of a better word) that is fixed to a point on Earth (essentially) and just letting the debris hit it.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_West_Ford[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very skeptical of the technical challenges associated with this problem (business model and financing aside). The amount of delta-v required to perform maneuvers to repeatedly &#34;dock&#34; with different pieces of space junk, and then again to de-orbit is very high. You MIGHT be able to de-orbit on the order of magnitude of ~10 pieces of low-earth orbit debris per mission. Maybe. If you&#39;re really good. And low-earth orbit junk isn&#39;t the major issue since it will de-orbit naturally in a reasonable time-frame. Higher orbit junk is what really matters, and will require much more delta-v to reach, and then again to de-orbit after &#34;docking&#34;.Allow me to blindly speculate here: a space-junk company is going to take one of the two following paths:1) Perform low-earth orbit missions to de-orbit a few pieces here and then there, use the good PR to drive funding (let&#39;s just assume they can make the finances work via getting governments to pay for it or something). It will technically work, but it will only deorbit pieces that would naturally decay anyways at a meaninglessly low-volume. But the PR will be good and regulatory capture will ensure their investors get paid. The real problem will remain.2) Go after the really big pieces in higher orbits. These pieces tend to be well-tracked and aren&#39;t really a large problem, but all the same outcomes in option 1 will occur. Investors will get paid, and of course, the real problem won&#39;t be solved.Maybe I&#39;m being pessimistic, but I see space-junk removal companies largely relying on the general public&#39;s lack of knowledge on how orbits work to drive PR. Maybe Kerbal Space Program 2 will go viral enough to fix that problem? We can only hope"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Stripe cofounder.)Ugh, apologies. Something very clearly went wrong here and we’re already investigating.Zooming out, a few broader comments:* Unlike most services, Stripe can easily lose very large amounts of money on individual accounts, and thousands of people try to do so every day. We are de facto running a big bug bounty/incentive program for evading our fraudulent user detection systems.* Errors like these happen, which we hate, and we take every single false rejection that we discover seriously, knowing that there’s another founder at the other end of the line. We try to make it easy to get in touch with the humans at Stripe, me included, to maximize the number that we discover and the speed with which we get to remedy them.* When these mistaken rejections happen, it’s usually because the business (inadvertently) clusters strongly with behavior that fraudulent users tend to engage in. Seeking to cloak spending and using virtual cards to mask activity is a common fraudulent pattern. Of course, there are very legitimate reasons to want to do this too (as this case demonstrates).* We actually have an ongoing project to reduce the occurrence of these mistaken rejections by 90% by the end of this year. I think we’ll succeed at it. (They’re already down 50% since earlier this year.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Edwin from Stripe here. (OP, I&#39;ve just sent you an email and we can talk more over there—I&#39;m terribly sorry for the trouble.) I can&#39;t get into too many specifics about an individual business publicly, but unauthorized charges have high potential to be disputed in the near future—and while Stripe itself doesn&#39;t have a dispute threshold, the card networks require businesses to keep disputes low.Although that email in the post was admittedly a template, a human did review the transaction activity and actively sent the email. We&#39;re digging more into exactly what happened here to prevent the confusion from happening again. Over the past few weeks, we&#39;ve been overhauling how we work with businesses in situations like these and are rolling out some meaningful improvements soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through the same thing.
Some ML algorithm at Stripe randomly classified my business (bog standard WooCommerce/WordPress e-Commerce store selling a single product in low volumes) as a risk and I found that the process for escalating it was Kafkaesque and slow.Switched to Pin Payments[1] shortly after that experience and have never looked back.  Of course, we live in the 2021 century and algorithms will flag issues automatically (I ported my phone number and changed my bank account on the same day, which was fun!), but they&#39;ve always made sure to contact me and resolve the issue within minutes instead of cutting access.  The few times I&#39;ve contacted them, a competent person has both understood the issue and responded to it appropriately and promptly.[1]https://pinpayments.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m gutted on hearing this. I’ve been on one of my regular Norm YouTube binges, and was watching a ton of them just last night. His dedication to comedy was legendary, and his complexity was intriguing.Norm’s fake late gift to Conan for The Tonight Show, given after Conan was leaving, is a great example of his sort of expectation-bending humor.https://youtu.be/uarJj-K4XH4His appearances on The View are legendary examples of his ability to be uncontrolled and play the dumbest guy in the room at the same time while actually being the sharpest. His intentional subversion played off as uninformed is a seemingly one of a kind talent. There are videos of interviews where he describes some of the background to things he did on the show.https://youtu.be/a4ageUPHgnohttps://youtu.be/Z3PP_SWHUQQ“Not everything has a point” just gets me. It’s amazing how the hosts just want to jump from talking point to talking point and just refuse to let the guest actually talk, which Norm really plays off of.And lastly, the moth joke remains a shining example of his anti-jokes.https://youtu.be/jJN9mBRX3uoHis monologues at roasts, awards shows, and the correspondents dinner were examples of not being afraid of anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I literally gasped when I heard this. There is something uniquely sad when one&#39;s favorite comedian passes away.There were many things that made him special, but one thing stands out right now:I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a comedian pursue Truth so rigorously. So much of his comedy was him shining a light on a given topic and giving 100% unflinching attention toward it, even if everyone else wanted to ignore it or &#34;move on&#34;. This often made the &#34;joke&#34; the audience, in that we found ourselves laughing when we thought we shouldn&#39;t be. But why shouldn&#39;t we be laughing? Why shouldn&#39;t we be discussing this? Wait, why is this uncomfortable in the first place? Have I thought about this enough?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awhile ago I wrote a Python library called LiveStats[1] that computed any percentile for any amount of data using a fixed amount of memory per percentile. It uses an algorithm I found in an old paper[2] called P^2. It uses a polynomial  to find good approximations.The reason I made this was an old Amazon interview question. The question was basically, &#34;Find the median of a huge data set without sorting it,&#34; and the &#34;correct&#34; answer was to have a fixed size sorted buffer and randomly evict items from it and then use the median of the buffer. However, a candidate I was interviewing had a really brilliant insight: if we estimate the median and move it a small amount for each new data point, it would be pretty close. I ended up doing some research on this and found P^2, which is a more sophisticated version of that insight.[1]: https://github.com/cxxr/LiveStats[2]: https://www.cs.wustl.edu/~jain/papers/ftp/psqr.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way to think about why we tend to use averages instead of medians is that it is related to a really deep theorem in probability: The Central Limit Theorem.But I think we can twist our heads and see in a way that this is backwards. Mathematically, the mean is much easier to work with because it is linear and we can do algebra with it. That&#39;s how we got the Central Limit Theorem. Percentiles and the median, except for symmetric distributions, are not as easy to work with. They involve solving for the inverse of the cumulative function.But in many ways, the median and percentiles are a more relevant and intuitive number to think about. Especially in contexts where linearity is inappropriate!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some things, you can&#39;t even sensibly measure the mean. For example, if you&#39;re measuring the mean response time for a service, a single failure/timeout makes the mean response time infinite (because 100 years from now the response still hasn&#39;t been received).&#34;Why Averages Suck and Percentiles are Great&#34;:

Preset management is a nightmare, there are so many things that they could do to go forward, but the Sequencer market is stall and hasn&#39;t moved in years.Imagine if they applied something similar to a git versioning system to music projects.... I don&#39;t even know if the VST interface can be used or if it&#39;s licensed somehow from Steinberg.Also consider that there are no good audio drivers for Linux (like Asio for example) so you&#39;re almost forced to stay in windows or Mac...No plug-in or DAW has a CLI...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love to see the cultural differences between korea/japan and the West on the matter of artificial stuff. Whereas in the West people would try to hide fakeness as much as possible, people in the far East have a much more candid view of it.In the West we do understand and like artificiality, but we really want to contain it to the realm of fiction. When some artificiality spills out in the “real” world we raise red flags: “tssk, this temple is not authentic, it burned down 80 years ago and they rebuilt it from scratch”In the East, there is a deep philosophical difference that I would like to understand better - if anyone can point to any reference on that matter? It’s like people have understood that fiction and artificiality are part of our lives, cause people embellish things all the time, and we humans are happy when we believe in things. So instead of being suspicious, they let themselves invaded by artificiality, not unlike the way Western people create emotional connection with novel characters, but in real world situations.And I mean why not? In the West, we get cartoon character-based advertising, we get actor-based advertising. How is AI-based influencer (that doesn’t hide the fact that it’s artificial) is any different? If Tony the Kellogg’s tiger had an instagram account, we’d find it totally normal. Here is the same, except that we just jumped over the uncanny valley.There is a lot to talk about on the subject and doesn’t fit in a hn comment :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s a terrible policy prescription.  If natural immunity is acceptable, what proportion of the unvaccinated-uninfected population will just take the risk? Half?  More?Millions of people will just (continue to) take the risk, get sick, go to hospital, and die (in decreasing proportions), incurring substantial personal and social costs along the way.Accepting only vaccination as evidence of protection reduces the size of that risk-taking population, and the concomitant social costs.Should there be a third policy option - accepting test-verified infection and recovery as of _now_ as evidence of protection, but discounting future recoveries?  Based on the observational studies cited all over this thread , probably yes.  Seems like associated costs would be higher though, and the only benefit would be less gnashing of teeth here and elsewhere, so its understandable the CDC isn&#39;t rushing to implement it.Should those people just be allowed to assume the risk?  Not while the costs are predominantly social. Insurance (or tax-payers) pay the financial costs, healthcare workers bear the burden of treating a preventable illness, and we all assume the risk that healthcare resources will be stretched to the point of unavailability.  While risk-takers do pay into the same system, their premiums don&#39;t yet reflect the increased expected costs of their personal choice.  While ICUs often run close to or at capacity in one hospital, rarely do they run close at every hospital in a region, as is happening in the south and will happen elsewhere.  While it would be nice if there were more doctors, nurses and facilities able to treat patients, we&#39;re at war with the army we&#39;ve got."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The answer is pretty simple - the moment authorities start saying &#34;well, natural immunity is probably just as good as vaccination, we&#39;ll accept that as equal to vaccination for passport purposes&#34;, a huge segment of the population who&#39;s on the fence about getting the vaccine might just opt to wait until they&#39;re infected naturally, or, even worse, get infected purposefully (EG, chicken pox parties). Which leads to more deaths and outbreaks.In a perfect world, everyone would understand that getting the vaccine is the appropriate choice of action and we could accept natural immunity from people who were infected before vaccines were available - but unfortunately we&#39;re forced into playing these weird games where authorities have to try to incentivize people who aren&#39;t behaving rationally - which in turn leads to further distrust from people on the fence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s amazing how far Intel has fallen.The 10nm debacle exposed how far they&#39;ve fallen behind on fabs to the point that they&#39;re outsourcing to TSMC. Like, how humiliating must that be?Intel completely missed the mobile revolution. They had a stake in that race but sold it (ie XScale).Intel&#39;s product segmentation is bewildering. They&#39;ve also kept features &#34;enterprise&#34; only to prop up high server chip prices to the detriment to computing as a whole, most notably ECC support.And on the server front, which I&#39;m sure is what&#39;s keeping them in business now, they face an existential threat in the form of ARM.Intel had clearly shifted to a strategy of extracting as much money as possible from their captive market. I&#39;m not sure price cuts here are necessarily about AMD but more than their previously captive market now has more options in general.How the mighty have fallen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have been with Intel for almost two decades, I finally moved to AMD for the very first time recently and I&#39;m glad I did. Intel is being called &#34;Toothpaste Company&#34; for a reason. It has deliberately slowed down its innovation since gained performance advantage over AMD with CORE, for over a decade now. Between each iteration, there was not many changes but kept adding fancy instruction sets such as AVX512 useless to most if not all ordinary users. It&#39;s a shame that I bought it actually. But over time I gradually realized that the only occasions I used those fancy stuffs were benching marking new systems. So those fancy things mean nothing to me other than showing off to friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intel is NOT competing against AMD only. In the past couple of years, we’ve seen a number of big tech companies developing their own chips. Focusing on AMD would be quite myopic from a strategic pov. This market is only getting more competitive. Either you compete on performance or price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It makes me sad that FF browser share has continued to decline steadily.  The past couple years of releases have been some its the best in terms of my own UX, since perhaps the Phoenix era.It&#39;s pretty fast these days, the UI is good, has a lot of great extensions and privacy features.I use Brave at work to have a better chrome-based experience with gsuite.  It&#39;s also a fast, excellent browser with good privacy features, built-in ad/tracker blocking and for the time being seems to be user-not-revenue-first.But using a non-free browser feels like a trap to me.  Just as what happened with Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Netscape before, being the middle man between the user and the rest of the internet is just too tempting for any company not to try to leverage for their own advantage.FF hasn&#39;t been always perfect, but for 20 years now they have made a browser that didn&#39;t have a shady corporate agenda.  It feels like the writing is on the wall though.  Even people I know who care about FLOSS are using Chrome as their daily driver these days.Mozilla is great and I hope they continue to focus on building a best-in-class browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to mention (once again), that Firefox on Android is a huge leap in everyday browsing experience over Chrome - and you should try it if you haven&#39;t. Due to mainly one reason: ad blocker extensions; which aren&#39;t supported on Chrome.Since that&#39;s where most users are, I hope Mozilla will be able to communicate these advantages better. Chrome is arguably better on the desktop for most users, unless they&#39;re in the tiny subset of users who care about privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact alone that FF is the best-optimized browser for uBlock Origin makes it an easy choice for me.It&#39;s interesting to me that many of my favorite/most used web technologies in the past decade or so have come from individual, non-profit developers just trying to make something useful, free and flying in the face of a lot of legal and industry norms (e.g., gorhill, elbakyan). In my experience, these tend to work best on FF + VPN, or on Tor (built from FF)."</p>

It is very hard to publicly criticize some of the behavior of a group you are a member of without burning bridges or deeply harming relationships. At the same time, saying nothing publicly is read as tacit approval.I interpret the article as a giving Amazon credit for why people like Rust, and Steve&#39;s response as a public disagreement saying that such credit is unwarranted and gives Amazon more power than it should have over Rust&#39;s future direction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The facts are pretty thin here, but this seems to be the core tweet:
https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/1437441118745071617To summarize:* Amazon has too much administrative influence* Amazon has marginalized the core team* also un-stated dirty tricks by AmazonI think rust is great, and I love with the rust community has accomplished, and I wouldn&#39;t want to see Amazon break that. But from this thread I don&#39;t know enough to raise objections. It sounds like a Rust foundation governance issue, the sort of thing that comes up from time-to-time on most big successful projects.[edited to fix formatting]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there more context here that&#39;s missing from the tweet thread?&gt; And now they want to actually take Amazon&#39;s principles and claim that they&#39;re Rust&#39;s.These just... literally... aren&#39;t Amazon&#39;s principles. At all. &#34;The practice of coming up with pithy statements to guide decision-making&#34; is the Amazon part.&gt; they&#39;ve also taken steps to marginalize the core team. and some other dirty shit I won&#39;t say rn.This sounds like the real concern, and it sounds really concerning, and I hope people come out to speak publicly and candidly about it. But it doesn&#39;t seem sensible to pretend that the making a list of adjectives is itself malign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, never thought I’d see XCheck in a news article. I used to work at Facebook and spotted abuse of this system by bad actors and partly fixed it. It’s still not perfect but it’s better than it used to be.I think I might have agreed with the author of this article before working in Integrity for a few years. But with time I learned that any system that’s meant to work for millions of users will have some edge cases that need to be papered over. Especially when it’s not a system owned and operated by a handful of people. Here’s an example - as far as I know it’s not possible for Mark Zuckerberg to log in to Facebook on a new device. The system that prevents malicious log in attempts sees so many attempts on his account that it disallows any attempt now. There’s no plans to fix it for him specifically because it works reasonably well for hundreds of millions of other users whose accounts are safeguarded from being compromised. His inconvenience is an edge case.With XCheck specifically what would happen is that some team working closely on a specific problem in integrity might find a sub population of users being wrongly persecuted by systems built by other teams located in other time zones. They would use XCheck as a means to prevent these users from being penalised by the other systems. It worked reasonably well, but there’s always room for improvement.I can confirm some of what the article says though. The process for adding shields wasn’t policed internally very well in the past. Like I mentioned, this was being exploited by abusive accounts - if an account was able to verify its identity it would get a “Shielded-ID-Verified” tag applied to it. ID verification was considered to be a strong signal of authenticity. So teams that weren’t related to applying the tag would see the tag and assume the account was authentic. And as I investigated this more I realised no one really “owned” the tag or policed who could apply it and under what circumstances. I closed this particular loop hole.In later years the XCheck system started being actively maintained by a dedicated team that cared. They looked into problems like these and made it better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strong opsec that the supporting documents are actual photos of a computer screen from the visible moire (or somehow altered to look that way).After numerous leaks, Facebook&#39;s internal security team became very good at identifying leakers. The person responsible for this 2016 post was identified within hours and terminated the next day: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/blakemontgomery/mark-zu.... The leaker was easily identified by the names of friends liking the post (that and part of their name was visible).Facebook-issued laptops are filled with spyware, monitoring everything down to the system call level, and practically every access to internal systems is logged at a fine level. The only way to exfiltrate data with plausible deniability would be to photograph the screen with an individually owned device. The fact that you searched for the internal wiki page and viewed it are nothing, but that you shortly invoked the keyboard shortcut for a screen capture, then inserted a USB drive, and copied a file (&#34;Screen shot ____.png&#34; even!) to it (all logged) ... congratulations, you&#39;re caught."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new Windows 11 defaults manager is amazingly user hostile. [1] Microsoft decided it&#39;s a great idea to make non technical users manually adjust 15 different file and protocol associations in order to change the default browser.Microsoft&#39;s statement on this: we are implementing customer feedback to customize and control defaults at a more granular level, eliminating app categories and elevating all apps to the forefront of the defaults experience.More granular control is nice and all, but I don&#39;t buy for a second that it couldn&#39;t be behind some &#34;advanced&#34; button. I think the most probable explanation for removing the app categories is a calculated move to steer people towards Microsoft products which have access to backdoor internal functions to change all of these automatically.I do remember how bad things were back in Windows XP days when every random toolbar would change all the associations. I don&#39;t wish for that experience to come back for non technical users either. Microsoft could perhaps look into allowing digitally signed apps to change the associations automatically (a single summarizing OS confirmation prompt might be wise), and non-signed apps would have to instruct users to manually change things.--[1] https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-defau..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of dark design patterns around getting edge as the default browser is sickening.  Opera was flagged as PUA by many AVs for simply changing the default browser after asking users post-install if they wanted to use that browser as their default - just as edge does (and before Firefox copied that same mechanism here).  Now every post-windows update screen (which takes place before you even log in...) comes with a full-page nag screen asking you to &#34;Use Microsoft recommended browser settings&#34; [1]...  This is on the heels of a screen that says &#34;Let&#39;s make Windows even better - this shouldn&#39;t affect what you&#39;ve already set up&#34; [2].  Even more disappointing is not that they&#39;re doing this but that nobody is taking these platforms to court over it in a meaningful way.[1] https://www.windowslatest.com/2020/11/15/windows-10-is-now-n...[2] https://www.windowslatest.com/2020/06/07/windows-10-full-scr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I was reading this article I kept thinking to myself &#34;Microsoft is going to boot Firefox from Windows&#34; before realizing that MS doesn&#39;t have that sort of power (compared to say Apple).It&#39;s really interesting how MS will approach this. Unlike Apple, MS doesn&#39;t have direct control over which apps go on the operating system, they aren&#39;t even in a position like Google where their app store is the dominant platform for getting apps.This will be interesting, interesting to see how MS responds. Will they give in and let users easily set their default browser or will this turn into a cat and mouse game.Lastly I think what MS is doing with the default browser is foolish. Did they learn nothing from the antitrust cases of the 2000&#39;s"</p>

Also, since employees don&#39;t have equity (though I&#39;m assuming they&#39;ll get fat bonuses for this), it&#39;s bound to cause some level of strife in the company."</p>

You all deserve all the rewards, especially for bootstrapping.Hope everyone there made out like bandits, and may this give them the financial freedom to pursue new passions in their lives.For those curious about the founding story, How I Built This did a podcast with Ben Chestnut (released July 12, 2021): https://www.npr.org/2021/07/09/1014699766/mailchimp-ben-ches...Small tidbit: mailchimp was a major pivot into SaaS (before that was a phrase) from another already successful services business (building websites).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something to note about the 90s-era is that the &#34;death ball&#34; of cheap units was *aggressively* mitigated in almost all strategy games.* Civilization 1, 2, and 3 had &#34;stacks&#34;, but if you kill one unit in the stack, you kill ALL units in the stack. As such, &#34;death balls&#34; were incredibly fragile, one well placed attack kills the whole stack.* Command and Conquer has infantry, which get rolled over and instant-killed by tanks. The overall &#34;death ball&#34; of tanks can eventually reach endgame proportions of death, but the cheapest units are fully ineffective at death-balling.* Starcraft had a 12-unit selection cap. It required a lot of clicks (on purpose) to create a death ball, so only the highest levels of players (with high APM) could attack-move with a whole army effectively."</p>

They&#39;ve done a fabulous job at keeping the feeling of the original game while updating things like cross-platform support, screen resolution and network play and added build queues (and waypoints, I believe) that was present in later C&amp;C games. They&#39;ve also tweaked the game play, making thieves able to hijack vehicles and cloak (They are probably the most fun unit to micro around) and radar jammers able to deflect / confuse missiles, and added per-country special units like in RA2 (The French invisible phase transport is wild), and changed the tech tree so medium / heavy tanks require service depot.I remember in the original Red Alert, if you ordered an airplane to fly into the shroud, it&#39;d just disappear into the darkness, but in OpenRA you can actually use them for scouting (which totally makes sense). OpenRA also has fog-of-war which suddenly makes planes and helicopters key units for ground support.I don&#39;t like war. The arms trade should be abolished. We should help refugees get safe passage and eliminate borders rather than build walls or drop bombs on them. Anyone working with defense in any capacity, like militarizing borders with drones or whatever, should immediately quit or turn whistle blower. Still, I find this war game incredibly enjoyable. Applause to the hackers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This mentions something that has always irked me, YouTube trying to be informative about who the music is licensed by. For one, it&#39;s completely useless on classical piano music because the Content ID algo finds similarity in a dozen different recordings. But even when there is one canonical recording, such as Rick Astley&#39;s Never Gonna Give You Up, I&#39;m informed that the music is licensed by:(on behalf of Sony BMG Music UK); UMPI, Kobalt Music Publishing, LatinAutor, Warner Chappell, BMI - Broadcast Music Inc., UNIAO BRASILEIRA DE EDITORAS DE MUSICA - UBEM, LatinAutor - UMPG, SOLAR Music Rights Management, AMRA, UMPG Publishing, CMRRA, LatinAutorPerf, LatinAutor - Warner Chappell, and 15 Music Rights SocietiesWhat is happening here? Does YouTube have legal arrangements with all of these bodies to make sure they get their penny per kiloview?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Presumably this will encourage the creator of the 1914 work to create new works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Here’s what triggered this: The ceremony includes bits of a recording (of tenor John McCormack singing “Funiculi, Funicula”) made in the year 1914.
The Corporate Takedown&gt; YouTube’s takedown algorithm claims that the following corporations all own the copyright to that audio recording that was MADE IN THE YEAR 1914: “SME, INgrooves (on behalf of Emerald); Wise Music Group, BMG Rights Management (US), LLC, UMPG Publishing, PEDL, Kobalt Music Publishing, Warner Chappell, Sony ATV Publishing, and 1 Music Rights Societies”So what&#39;s going on here?  Did some record company reissue the song later on CD, so YouTube is treating it like it was released at a later date than it was?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain_in_the_United_St...:&gt; All works first published or released before January 1, 1926, have lost their copyright protection, effective January 1, 2021.Google probably should compile a list of public domain recordings to act as a blacklist for YouTube copyright claims.  Maybe that should even be legal a requirement for such automatic enforcement systems.  If they partner with some library or national archive, such a project could help with media preservation efforts."</p>

No one gave a crap about Taxi driver&#39;s work standards and they are/were treated worse than Uber drivers.This is all about the Taxi industry fighting back.75% of all ride share drivers would prefer to remain independent.In Chicago, I can make $42/hour driving Uber.

I suspect the statements only hold for the initial page load, that spinner and the slowly but surely updating fake counter holds visitors enthralled for the final outcome.Anyway, the path is clear: close that Starbucks tab after ~2 seconds of faked cookie setting time and get your caffeine kick elsewhere.[1,2,3] just search for it - most results are commercial entities trying to sell some &#34;marketing&#34; or &#34;website enhancement&#34; service which I do not feel like boosting by linking to them.

See Thomas Midgley Jr:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.This guy who invents awesome working chemicals that are tragically bad for people on a worldwide scale manages to exit life dues to his own inventions, unrelated to chemistry... Kind of Ironic! Thomas Midgley, Jr. (1889–1944) was an American engineer and chemist who contracted polio at age 51, leaving him severely disabled. He devised an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys to help others lift him from bed. He became accidentally entangled in the ropes and died of strangulation at the age of 55. However, he is better known for two of his other inventions: the tetraethyl lead (TEL) additive to gasoline, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a very distinct memory of disembarking from the Budapest to Belgrade night train to the smells of leaded fuel in Belgrade.Budapest was no standard of cleanliness at the time (late 90s), however Belgrade was truly still in its post-war phase and had all of the energy, anger and edge of a place that had been pretty beaten up.We were robbed, given a pistol in a nightclub (still have no idea what was going on there, I just remember being really surprised that pistols came in styrofoam and shrink-wrap packages when they are new... Being from Canada I had never even seen a pistol before), were surrounded by really beautiful people who we thought wanted something from us but who were only generous and kind, and .... the smell.The smell of that leaded fuel was everywhere. It smelled sweet and was so unique. It&#39;s what has stuck with me 20+ years later.One other side note from that trip. We were in the countryside (mean to be meeting a friend from home in his ancestral/family village but took the wrong bus) and someone in the village directed us in to a pub that was basically an old barn. Inside there were many middle eastern guys and a mix of Serbian and english speaking people. I was given a pin by one of the middle eastern guys after I threw an excellent game of darts on the dartboard next to him.Years later I had a job for a defense contractor and the subject of that trip and the pin came up. I showed him a picture of it and he recognized it instantly: al-Aqsa Martyrs&#39; Brigades. I looked it up and so it was.We were put up with a local elderly woman who served us some type of soup in the morning and then someone gave us a ride out of town to a bus stop that had service that day. We waited only an hour until the first car came along, reeking of leaded fuel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got a sneaking suspicion we ought to go through everything else Thomas MIdgley Jr. invented and ban it, just to be sure.  Leaded gas, CFCs, and the contraption he killed himself with is a worrying pattern.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PipeWire is how audio should be on Linux, and it&#39;s ready to use. No more complications between PulseAudio, ALSA, and JACK. PipeWire implements all 3 of these interfaces, which means you can use applications that depend on any or all of these interfaces simultaneously with no conflicts. Playing a video in Firefox and a track in a digital audio workstation at the same time works with no special configuration. PipeWire makes audio on Linux as easy as it is on other OSes.The Arch Wiki page describes some of the use cases for PipeWire: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the last ~12 years, I gave PulseAudio a try every time I upgraded the Fedora distro on my main computers. I almost never had the catastrophic bugs many people complained about. But pulseaudio has always taken 10-15% of one CPU when in use (be it on audio/video calls, or music/movie playback). This is across 3 different laptops and 2 desktops. It is not a huge deal, but it is a bit frustrating on laptops where battery life is precious. I understand that PulseAudio is very powerful, but it represented no practical gain for me personally, with my very simple use cases, so I simply disabled it.Weirdly, I found very few people complaining about PulseAudio&#39;s CPU usage. Maybe nobody cares about 10-15% of one core.However, I am happy to report that PipeWire seems to not have this problem at all. Since it became default on Fedora, it has barely shown on top&#39;s first page. Given that it is even more ambitious than PulseAudio in terms of latency, this is incredibly impressive!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wanted to try debian 11 last weekend. First time I installed it from debootstrap. I plugged in a 1TB SSD on an USB 2.0 to SATA case, formatted it, prepared the root filesystem with debootstrap, chrooted to it, installed a bunch of packages, setup locale and timezone, installed linux-image, grub and booted it. Worked flawlessly.Tried a &#34;ps|aux&#34; and discovered it is already running wayland and pipewire. Works so well it is boring. Nice!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good related reading: https://raphlinus.github.io/color/2021/01/18/oklab-critique...., with some analysis of various colour spaces of different types, focusing especially on their behaviour in gradients, to do with interpolation.My biggest complaint about perceptual colour spaces has been that they make working with colours near gamut boundaries really hard. For example, with #ff0 (yellow) in LCH, you can’t tweak any of the three parameters in either direction without going out of gamut (play with it at https://css.land/lch/ to get a vague idea of what I mean, though it doesn’t handle going out of gamut well). Yet such colours have plenty of practical value, and it’s a shame that many things eschew them because they’ve drunk too much perceptual uniformity kool-aid. Colour palettes often just don’t have any decent yellows at all. (To be sure, you do need to use such colours with care, but to remove them altogether is distressing.) For colour pickers especially, perceptual colour spaces have just been no good, because of their weird shapes and because you’re more likely to want to pick interesting colours nearer gamut bounds.So I’m really glad to see this, because it’s just what I’ve been grumbling about the absence of. Thank you Björn, I continue to enjoy your work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the real story is subjective, not quantitative. Color pickers:https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/OKHSL works a lot better than the alternatives. It&#39;s really nice!OKHSV doesn&#39;t seem as good, and neither do the other new ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personal complaint with color pickers is that they make it hard to find many normal environmental colors. Where is brown? I&#39;ve learned to find it around red, a little toward orange, and a dark saturation. It&#39;s not intuitive, and I don&#39;t feel like I just pick _some_ brown because I can&#39;t easily explore the space of browns through beige and tan. Flesh tones are similarly difficult.I&#39;m not sure what the solution is. A purely algorithmic color picker probably isn&#39;t the answer because it&#39;s not just our color perception that matters, but also the way colors are formed in our environment (which is what gives us so many browns)."</p>

There were meetings! Someone worked on that! People literally sat in a room and said effectively, “Hey Fatimeh, what is the status of the ‘make subreddits suck faster’ feature? Management is very interested in delivering that in Q3.” Right?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somehow this post takes the least interesting part of the source article[0] and draws false conclusions from it.&gt; In the simulation, the decision whether to rebroadcast is random, rather than being driven by “virality” or cognitive bias, so the simulation is an optimistic one.
&gt; It turns out that message propagation follows a power law: the probability of a meme being shared a given number of times is roughly proportional to an inverse power of that number.So they implement a textbook model and a textbook result comes out - surprise?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As soon as your news feed becomes too big for you to read all of it and then decide whether to repost anything, the quality of information you propagate is going to fall because of that filtering process.I avoid this by unfollowing people very frequently. I see one stupid candid or a pout or a food shot, I just unfollow that person.Same goes for SJW/White Supremacy types. Whether you are OP or a sharer, you get muted/unfollowed.This is how I use Quora. When I used Facebook five years ago, I used it this way.Twitter I use only for professional content. Very strictly. I also set the trending country to Namibia, so that I don&#39;t even know what they are talking about.I am less and less active on social media with the passing of days, but a good social media experience can be achieved by strictly filtering normies, politics, food porn, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a brief love affair with Elixir/OTP recently. The language ist beautiful, the platform very impressive. Genserver and the actor model are very powerful tools for concurrent systems and Phoenix is one of the best web frameworks I ever tried.BUT the tooling was a bit lacking (e.g JetBrains IDE, good debugging workflow), the library support was a bit spotty (e.g for Auth, everything high quality but often abandoned). Then if you use e.g GCP there is no real first class language support and if you deploy to Kubernetes then there is a lot of overlap with Beam/OTP for deployment management etc. this and I feel for most quick web development pure functional programming is too much mental overhead for me (maybe this comes down to practice). I feel way more productive with e.g Go or Node.I have mad respect for Jose Valim and the community for delivering such an exceptional project in a world saturated with languages and frameworks. But I fear its not for me. At least not yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very curious about the recent surge of Elixir / Erlang posts on HN, is there a reason for this?How is the the job market surrounding this as well for Elixir / Erlang devs?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great resource, thank you. I&#39;ve been slowly transitioning my programming time to Elixir/Phoenix the last couple years. Every couple weeks I dive in, but mostly going back to Rails. But recently with the `1.6.0-rc.0` release, this time it might stick. HEEx templates are fantastic, esbuild as the default is a really good choice, LiveView is getting some traction, and the packages seem to be picking up. Fantastic language &amp; framework in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “The biggest mistake was to miss Kubernetes. We were in that collective thought bubble where internally we thought Kubernetes was way too complicated and Swarm would be much more successful,” Jérôme Petazzoni, one of Docker’s first and longest serving employees, said. “It was our collective failure to not realize that.”They were not wrong on saying that Kubernetes was very complicated, at least in some sense. In the beginning no one wanted to use it because they could easily setup Docker Swarm with minimal effort. This argument still pops up frequently on HN when there&#39;s a new post about Kubernetes.I guess the problem was they didn&#39;t realize why Kubernetes needs to be that complicated. And if a system is complicated for good reasons, that&#39;s actually good business opportunity and tons of people and companies will be willing to make the effort to fill that gap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good read, and touches on a lot of the pain points from that era. As someone who was lurking on HN at the time during the containerization boom, I think that the key failing of dotCloud/Docker was not capitalising on Docker Swarm almost immediately. Docker Swarm was touted almost from the start but the repeated delays gave it a reputation of smoke and mirrors left people scrambling for solutions.I also clearly remember the multiple high profile spats that &#39;shykes had on HN which burned a lot of bridges. At the time he had a reputation for answering lots of questions on HN which helped a lot with community building. After those bridges were burned there was no one to speak for Docker as the developer mindsets shifted slowly towards Kubernetes. IIRC the Github PRs were also a source of contention as dotCloud corporatised.To be fair, Kubernetes was a real slog to understand at the start and had a lot of competition; it was definitely not the same level of simple, direct technical solution that Docker was.Interesting trip down memory lane and what a pivotal technology! Regardless of the rest Docker is a true cultural phenomenon and a testament to the insight of the creators working outside of the myopia of big tech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The truth is, Docker had the chance to work closely with the Kubernetes team at Google in 2014 and potentially own the entire container ecosystem in the process. “We could have had Kubernetes be a first-class Docker project under the Docker banner on GitHub. In hindsight that was a major blunder given Swarm was so late to market,” Stinemates said.&gt; Craig McLuckie, Kubernetes cofounder and now vice president at VMware, says he offered to donate Kubernetes to Docker, but the two sides couldn’t come to an agreement. “There was a mutual element of hubris there, from them that we didn’t understand developer experience, but the reciprocal feeling was these young upstarts really don’t understand distributed systems management,” he told InfoWorld.The article criticizes Docker Swarm as myopic, but IMO, there were only two possibilities for Docker to move forward; either they acquired Kubernetes, which was a possibility in this telling of events, or they won with their own Docker Swarm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was really when people started figuring out how bad fallout from thermonuclear bombs could be. General Fields described it most lucidly:&#34;If Bravo had been detonated in Washington, D.C., instead of Bikini, Fields illustrated with a diagram, that lifetime dose in the Washington-Baltimore area would have been 5,000 roentgens; in Philadelphia, more than 1,000 roentgens; in New York City, more than 500, or enough to result in death for half the population if fully exposed to all the radiation delivered. This diagram was classified secret and received very little distribution beyond the Commissioners.&#34; [1]Image reproduced here [2].Thermonuclear bombs are really terrifying. If one goes off and you&#39;re in the fallout zone do not go outside for at least 2 weeks. If you survive the initial blast you have about 10 minutes to get inside where you must stay. If you&#39;re still outside and it&#39;s &#39;snowing&#39; ash you&#39;re already dead. More tips and tricks in [3].Though these days, they say it&#39;s likely that a single individual or small group can have even worse impact from a basement bioterror lab.[1] Hewlett and Holl - Atoms for Peace and War around pg 181 (free pdf history book) https://www.energy.gov/management/downloads/hewlett-and-holl...[2] https://whatisnuclear.com/img/castle-bravo-if-on-dc.png[3] Nuclear War Survival Skills (free pdf book) https://www.oism.org/nwss/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"9/11 was my birthday, and I was just outside of NYC in school that day.I was in math class. The phone in the classroom rang and my teacher turned on the radio (1010 WINS) immediately. After hearing what had happened she broke down in tears because her husband worked in WTC. My parents worked in NYC (as did most of my classmates&#39; parents) and was very concerned.The school district evacuated the elementary schools to the gym at the middle school because our town had a major dam and there were concerns that could be attacked too, which would&#39;ve flooded the low-lying areas where the elementary schools are. Eventually, school was dismissed and I ended up at my neighbor&#39;s house. Her husband was a FDNY Captain.So many people I know died or were permanently harmed (physically or mentally) that day.While nearly every second of that day is permanently etched into my brain, there&#39;s one day that&#39;s even more vivid. My FDNY Captain neighbor took me to ground zero in early November 2001. I&#39;ll never, ever forget the smell of burning flesh and the hundreds of firefighters using rakes looking for human remains. He told me to never forget, and I never will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When reviewing 9/11 attacks (likely the biggest and most disastrous intelligence failure in U.S. history, give or take Pearl Harbor), it&#39;s worth remembering that it could have been much worse.  If the first plane had hit Indian Point nuclear reactor what, 30 miles from NYC and upwind?  It&#39;s likely a Chernobyl/Fukushima disaster would have resulted with an exclusion zone well into NYC.  That was reportedly part of the plan but as I recall they wanted a more media-friendly target.Additionally, the fact that members of the Saudi government aided and assisted the hijackers, and that they were tracked and monitored by both the FBI and the CIA, yet no action was taken to stop them, not even a simple warning to airlines to increase security after that Aug 6th Presidential Daily Briefing?  What a debacle.We should have left Iraq and Afghanistan alone and done the regime change op in Saudi Arabia, except that Wall Street likes its petrodollars so Washington props up the House of Saud and its theocratic dictatorship. And that&#39;s still going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was in the Navy and had been at my first command at a nuke base in the PNW. I walked to the galley for breakfast and they had some TVs you could watch while eating. I watched the second plane hit.
 I walked to work which was a telecommunications station. We processed messages for different regional commands and would call them directly whenever they had an emergency action message (EAM). I walked in to a completely chaotic watch floor. Every message was an EAM that day. Every phone was ringing or in use, every computer that could alarm was alarming, our dial up modems were constantly busy. All my coworkers were shouting and running here and there. I had never seen it like that and as a young Sailor it was very worrying. Everyone we called to inform them of their EAMs would ask if we knew what was going on or knew if someone was mobilizing but we were just as much in the dark as everyone else.I remember at one point our Leading Chief Petty Officer (LPCO) yelled for everyone to stop what they were doing and told us to call our parents and loved ones to let them know we were safe. That was the longest day I’d ever worked at that command and no one left that day, even those from the previous night shift. The fact that no one, even our CO, had any idea what was going on…that the military was in the dark, was such an unnerving feeling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I write on medium [1] and I don’t think switching to a stand alone website would be good for me at all.Medium has “publications” where my work gets sent out to hundreds of readers that are reading about a topic, not necessarily from me - I’m not notable at all in the field so I’d have a rather hard time getting people to subscribe to __me__.If I were to make my own website, I’d lose a ton of discoverability.Plus, the monetization on medium is fantastic. Nowhere else would I get that return per view - I’m currently averaging around 25k views a month with a $500 return.I do have my gripes with the platform, but in my case, Medium is the worst platform for writing besides all the rest.
 [1] https://anth-oleinik.medium.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two sides to this, though we often only hear one.For readers who aren&#39;t subscribed to Medium, it can be annoying. You go to read an article, and if that article is monetized, you see a banner to sign up. Plenty of people leave immediately.Now let me tell why, as a writer, I still use Medium and will continue for the time being.I only post 2-4 articles on there per month. But even then, I&#39;m seeing ~50K views per month and this month I&#39;m on track to earn $1000.To see those same results on my own blog, I would need to learn a lot about SEO, affiliate marketing, and have a large Twitter following to direct traffic to my blog. I would also need to maintain it myself.Sure, I might have a higher chance of going viral on HN, but how likely is that even anyway?As a full-time developer with a newborn who&#39;s just looking to earn some fun money, Medium is perfect. I write, submit to a publication, and they take care of the rest.People may say, &#34;I&#39;m not going to read your posts on Medium.&#34; My answer is: okay? Can&#39;t make everyone happy. But I&#39;m still getting 50K views from people who do want to read them, and I&#39;m okay with that.The other point to make is that Medium only pays for views/reads from other Medium members, so I don&#39;t necessarily care if I go viral on HN or not. If I really cared about going viral, I would just post my article to something like dev.to and then submit it to HN.If you&#39;re just looking to write and get views/go viral and don&#39;t care about money, then it might not make sense to post to Medium. But if you want to earn some money with relatively little effort, Medium is hard to beat.Edit: Here&#39;s proof of my claims for people questioning them (https://medium.com/@SunnyB/proof-of-medium-stats-700c2b0b638...). Note: it is a Medium link to an unlisted post. Didn&#39;t know where else to put it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every nights I read through the hackernews posts of the day which didn&#39;t reach the front page for my newsletter. Every time I click on a medium posts and that I click &#34;previous&#34; the page freeze during 1-2 seconds.Therefore I have a ban on Medium posts. When medium.com is in the URL it is automatically discarded, unfortunately they offer white label domain so I happen to click on some of those links.Also I didn&#39;t do stats about it, but if you want to blog about something and do it on Medium you have a much lower chance to be featured on HN (not talking about others forum ). Choose wisely. HN is not the center of the world but there are only a few places that can offer 50k visits"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The day this number reaches 100% will be on of those before/after moments. Considering the only problem with remaining 8 titles not running is DRM/anti-cheat, it is possible that we&#39;ll see this day arrive.I usually make fun of &#34;linux on the desktop&#34; prophets by saying &#34;Yes, 90% is great but problem is that everybody uses a different 90%&#34;. But 100% of the 50 most popular games is a different thing. It is a level of compatibility that you may not even achieve on windows depending on your hardware. Of course, performance and a few bugs will exist, but compatibility will be good enough for almost everybody.I wonder if this coupled with steam deck will finally make supporting linux sustainable. I mean, a point where supporting is so cheap and the number of users is big enough that it becomes profitable to do so. If that happens, most excuses to not support linux will finally vanish away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m very curious if we’ll start seeing a move off of windows for gaming rigs with this.  The 100 dollar premium for windows takes a big bite out of a 1000 dollar gaming rig."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few thoughts:1) Proton labels like platinum, means how much effort you need to put for the game to run on linux. It says nothing about how well it will run. So “work on Linux” means basically that it works on Linux. It says nothing about performance. For instance I had a game labeled platinum run without effort on Arch with 50fps with constant drops to 30 ~ 25fps whereas on windows it runs at a constant 60fps with rare drops to 55/50. (Yeah, I’ve tried all variations of proton, kernel, disabled composition etc)2) In my experience people that says that they see no difference in performance between linux and windows they usually have a powerful gpu, not a medium or low end one. So if you hear on the internet people claiming that the performance is about the same, it’s highly dependent on the game and/or your system specs."</p>

You can accidentally create this issue across lots of different AWS services if you don&#39;t verify you haven&#39;t created any loops between resources and don&#39;t configure scaling limitations where available. &#34;Infinite&#34; scaling is great until you do it when you didn&#39;t mean to.That being said, I think AWS (can&#39;t speak for other big providers) does offer a lot of value compared to bare-metal and self-hosting. Their paradigms for things like VPCs, load balancing, and permissions management are something you end up recreating in most every project anyways, so might as well railroad that configuration process. I&#39;ve experienced how painful companies that tried to run their own infrastructure made things like DB backups and upgrades that it would be hard to go back to a non-managed DB service like RDS for anything other than a personal project.After so many years using AWS at work, I&#39;d never consider anything besides Fargate or Lambda for compute solutions, except maybe Batch if you can&#39;t fit scheduled processes into Lambda&#39;s time/resource limitations. If you&#39;re just going to run VMs on EC2, you&#39;re better off with other providers that focus on simple VM hosting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS is complexity-as-a-service. This is why, as a one-man company, I went baremetal[1]. One flat price, screaming fast performance, and massive scalability if you get a beefy enough machine[2]. I don&#39;t have time to fiddle with k8s, try to figure out AWS billing/performance tradeoffs, or deal with untraceable performance issues due to noisy neighbours and VM overhead. My disaster recovery plan is a simple DB dump script to S3, and I know I can get another baremetal server up and running in less than 20 minutes.[1] with IBM Cloud 1 year free startup credits[2] Let&#39;s Encrypt and StackOverflow run their entire databases on a single beefy baremetal machine. https://letsencrypt.org/2021/01/21/next-gen-database-servers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Biggest mistake I’ve made:Shifting any non trivial infrastructure into AWS verbatim is always more expensive than running it yourself. You need to rearchitect it carefully around the PaaS services to make a cost saving or even break even.An extreme example of this is it cousin who works for a small dev company doing LOB stuff. They moved their SQL box into EC2 and it’s costing more to run that single RDS instance than their entire legacy infra cost was per year.I’d still rather use AWS though. The biggest gain is not technology but not having to argue with several vendor sales teams or file a PO and wait for finance to approve it. All I do is click a button and the thing’s there."</p>

French Rust is fully compatible with English-Rust, so you can mix both at your convenience.Interesting factoid: in France, most of the stop signs say &#34;stop&#34; due to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals linked below.In Québec, on the other hand, most of the stop signs say &#34;Arrêt&#34; due to nationalism reasons.

But.. when I learnt C programming, and in order to smooth transition from algo classes to practical programming, we were told to #include a header file that would more or less do what this does for rust. The header file would also enforce curly braces and parentheses when writing loops or condition statements, as far as I remember. Fact is: it actually helped. Problem: my first foray in the industry would involve C and guess what? They used english-C (sorry no better word for it) rather then french-C. I fought for a few weeks re-learning the language."</p>

If ever there was a Fraud Magnet, that&#39;s it.

Could it be that the legal and regulatory and insurance systems have made it a manageable problem? Someone steals your credit card, your losses are capped.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"People are worried about the wrong stuff. SolarWinds was bad but it was likely intel operation. They wanted access to networks for intelligence purposes. They jacked it so they could access assets behind corp firewalls. Spys will always try to spy.IMHO the Kaseya hack was far worse, maybe worse than WannaCry but with better outcomes. This was a criminal operation, provided by criminal software suppliers that really was only resolved when the keys were leaked on a forum.The rumor is that local intelligence forced the disclosure of the keys (eg: guns to heads), because this is pretty much the destroy the world scenario that is unstoppable.
It is easy easy for attackers to cause billions of dollars of damage in a day.Its not getting better. It can&#39;t. Our systems are designed for large scope of trust with massive surface areas. Security is a game where the defenders cannot mess up once. Its hopelessly asymmetric and can never be better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a semi-related anecdote about surprises from devices.I use a CPAP. After a year, I went back to the doctor for a followup, and was asked to bring the SD card so they could review the data it collects. The device records the times and duration of use, various settings, and some metrics on breathing (apnea events, etc). I knew it recorded this stuff on an SD card.I brought the card to the appointment, but the doctor said &#34;I don&#39;t need that, I have your data here.&#34; It turns out that the CPAP contains a cellular modem, and it phones home and reports in real-time. I had no idea this thing was recording any data at all. It wasn&#39;t verbally disclosed to me by either the doctor or the equipment technicians. I imagine there&#39;s something buried in the fine print of the (long lost) documentation, possibly even in the fine print of some form I signed, but I was caught off guard and none too pleased.I&#39;ve since done some research on this and discussed it with my new doctor when it came time to get a new CPAP. The doctor acted surprised by me having a problem with it. She immediately jumped to the defense of the manufacturer and insurance company, claiming that they &#34;needed&#34; that data. She said that if I disabled it, insurance would refuse coverage.This is insanely invasive, even with disclosure, and ought to be illegal without explicit, obvious verbal and written disclosure. The insurance defense is complete bullshit. For one, I paid cash for the CPAP because I had a high-deductible insurance plan and would have had to pay out-of-pocket anyway (and never claimed it even for the deductible offset).I realize a CPAP isn&#39;t a fridge, and there&#39;s at least a case to be made for insurance enforcing compliance (at least when insurance claims are involved). I don&#39;t agree with the undisclosed enforcement mechanism, nor do I agree that treatment should be contingent on monitoring (it is for some other treatments, but not for most; no one is monitoring diet, exercise, drug use, cigarette consumption, or other risky behaviors, and threatening to withhold treatment for non-compliance).Anyway, I&#39;ve ranted enough, but there&#39;s a serious problem with the normalization of surveillance technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It should also have an arm on the door to slap your hand when you open it for the 41st time in a day. I mean, that&#39;s insane, you deserve a slap.Btw, this reminds me a bit of my parent&#39;s Renault that would tell me every damn time I started it to follow traffic regulations. I wish I could slap that car and it would feel it.And then there&#39;s my father-in-law&#39;s Mazda, which has a GPS system that sometimes finds him 200 km off the mark, and it keeps talking nonsense. You can&#39;t silence it because the touch screen doesn&#39;t work while driving. Yeah you can guess how that makes one feel.. like slapping it.Oh boy, I also have an Amazfit smart watch, imagine mountainbiking at high speed, you quickly want to see how many KMs you still have to go. You look at the screen and it says: &#34;PAI 50 Good Job!&#34; (full screen!

I would break it open and remove the WiFi antenna if I had no choice of buying a non-connected one.I&#39;ve bought a robo vacuum cleaner recently. Luckily there still are 100% offline models available. Unluckily they all are overly stupid, can&#39;t have lidars and map your home (while I can see no reason why this has to require Internet access and can&#39;t be implemented an autonomous way)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Phony Diagnoses not just at nursing homes, also in mental facilities.  Was really surprised (better word-traumatized) that one flippant casual mention of not valuing my life in a private text message was enough to to get me detained by police in a facility for a night.  &#34;Doctor&#34; threatened me with drugging just because I refused to answer some of their questions and instead insisted on a lawyer.  Funny how  freedoms can be taken away so dubiously even when not charged of a crime nor arrested in a system that exists outside the criminal system.  I&#39;m surprised and not surprised similar behavior happens in nursing homes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t finished the article yet.  I got sidetracked by the claim that Haldol is &#34;a powerful sedative.&#34; I understand that journalists are neither doctors nor pharmacists, but if you&#39;re reporting on a story about medical ethics, maybe know a little bit about drugs, how they work, and what the words you&#39;re using mean in a medical context.Haldol is a typical antipsychotic.  If the patient has no symptoms that indicate its use, they should absolutely not be taking it.  There&#39;s a lot of side effects.  Some may even persist after the medication is discontinued.One of these side effects is that it can be sedating.  I&#39;ve been on the patient side of a misapplied antipsychotic myself.  They can make you very tired and cause you to feel &#34;drugged&#34;.  This is not the same as a drug being a &#34;powerful sedative&#34;.  Words mean things.  Words in a medical context have specific definitions and nuance.  If you&#39;re reporting on medical malpractice, it&#39;s important to get the vocabulary correct so that the way you word something represents the truth rather than a sensationalized version of it.I can definitely believe that these people were medicated in ways that were dangerous to their health for the convenience of the staff.  However, when you call Haldol a powerful sedative, I have to assume you&#39;re either trying to make the situation sound as horrible as possible or you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Antipsychotics have horrific side effects but are useful in institutional settings to make residents/patients/inmates easier to manage - psychiatry is the tool used to legitimize drugging people without need for their consent in such settings, for the benefit of others and the institution. It makes me despondent to read an article like this as I believe there are too many perverse incentives and cultural taboos for this situation to change in any meaningful way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Think Apple has already seen the writing on the wall - both S. Korea &amp; the US are now probably going to push back against the IAP restrictions, and they can / should do a couple of things, which might actually increase revenue.1. Cut down the IAP commission to 15% for everyone. 
2. Cut down the commission to 5% for those who pay for a Business Account, say at $5,000 a year.The thing is no customer wants to use any company&#39;s half-assed bug-riddled purchase or subscription system. Every iOS and macOS user will prefer to use the Apple system. All Apple has to do is to make the rates competitive enough, that after considering building their own purchases system, factoring in sales tax and VAT, most developers will happily just opt for Apple&#39;s system if the rates make sense. Many people are putting up with 30% already — bringing the rates down to something reasonable with an upgrade path to put them on par with payment processors like Stripe (with VAT and Billing and Radar) or Paddle will just increase revenues for them.The moment they drop rates and ease restrictions apps that are not being built because of these rules will get built, and these apps will gladly pay the market rate of 5% to 10% for a full service payments system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really happy to see this moving forward, but I loathe the potential future landscape. Every fortune 500 is going to immediately pivot to their own IAP options which will make my life harder compared to Apple Pay.I&#39;m hoping with this movement, tools like Stripe/Paddle will develop some better IAP flows to make it as easy as possible. Adding my card information to 50 different in-app wallets does not sound appealing to me, despite the win for consumers and developers.I guess what I&#39;m trying to say, is that it&#39;s unfortunate we have to make a tradeoff at all.Hopefully, this move will put downward pressure on Apple&#39;s payment infrastructure that incentivizes devs to keep using Apple payments because it&#39;s the same fee structure as whatever 3rd party they might move towards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been saying this for years now: this is why Apple should&#39;ve ushered in lower commissions on larger publishers themselves because otherwise a court, a regulatory authority or a legislature was ultimately going to do it for them.And you&#39;re almost always better off making that change yourself.Big publishers have their own payment processing pipelines. Apple&#39;s is just extra overhead. Smaller publishers still (IMHO) can see a lot of benefit from Apple&#39;s 30% cut. It&#39;s those large publishers who are most likely to challenge your rules in court or lobby against you.If the very largest publishers were paying 10% as a Preferred Partner instead of 30%, they would be a lot less willing to challenge the status quo when they might lose that privilege.We&#39;ve already have ridiculous workarounds for Apple&#39;s policies here like how you can bypass it to buy directly from Amazon through the app for physical goods. The carve out for digital goods is and was always a tortured post facto justification.Where once the 30% cut funded the App Store (when it was small). It&#39;s clearly transitioned to being a massive profit center and Apple executives couldn&#39;t see past the short term revenue to see the writing on the wall. Woops."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Windy is great. The map is appealing, but be sure to check out the forecast view for a particular location. Also make sure you try different locations. I&#39;m in the Salish Sea on Orcas Island in the San Juans and because we have a lot of topography here mixed with ocean, we have a lot of local effects, contour winds and so on and there are big differences between locations.Also note that Windy can get it wrong. I grew up in Cape Town and forecasting there is easy compared to here because it&#39;s the tip of Africa surrounded by Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Here it&#39;s very mixed with land, sea, big 11,000ft mountain ranges like the Olympics and so on and this region is hard to forecast. For where we are, the forecasts - and Windy&#39;s map specifically - is wrong fairly often.A trick that a lot of folks don&#39;t know about is using ATIS, AWOS or ASOS at a local airport or airfield. If you want to know what the weather is at a given location, find a nearby airport, get their ATIS (or AWOS or ASOS) phone number and you can call and get a real-time report that is extremely accurate. I do this for KORS, our local airfield all the time. You can get this data off Foreflight although I&#39;m sure there are plenty of free alternatives. Obviously it&#39;s current weather, not forecast, but it&#39;s often helpful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"over the past few years my use of weather apps + forecasting has really been improved by reading alongside them the local NWS office&#39;s &#34;area forecast discussion&#34;which is published multiple times a day by the station&#39;s meteorologists: https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/total_forecast/getprod.php?new&amp;wfo=...It&#39;s really great to be able to contextualize the state of a Windy map, for example especially in Seattle where the weather patterns are tightly influenced by the Olympic mountains and other local conditions which these global maps usually fail to capture or express well.Windy is impressive stuff but looking is half the battle with these maps, wind directions and &#34;that weather blob is orange right now&#34; only really go so far when your weather area&#39;s geography isn&#39;t simple; in fact, i think that the older static Weather Channel style maps which expressed the pressure gradients and fronts better and helped you build a model of what the weather is doing rather than which way the wind is blowing. (see https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/journeynorth.org/images/g... for an example)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personal Googler story: In Ads and in Search, at least as of 2010 or so, Google employed independent companies who hired &#34;raters&#34; to provide &#34;ground truth&#34; for the ML systems. For example, they would rate proposed ads for a given query, so that the ML system could learn from their &#34;truth&#34;. For Search, they&#39;d rate proposed search results for a given query. There was a whole pipeline to bring in the raters&#39; results and use them.Those &#34;raters&#34; were contractors to the independent companies, and had no Google privileges at all. They couldn&#39;t come to campus and eat at the cafes, for example. They had no direct contact with any Google employees. I helped a relative get hired as one of those. This was about 11 years ago.These outside companies had minimal oversight from Google, by design. My cousin joined the Search rater company and was given a test problem, which was timed and they had max times allowed. When she finished, they said &#34;sorry, you took too long, we&#39;re not paying you.&#34;I raised a stink and HR sent a representative to meet with the Search people. I sat in. The Search people were obnoxious little corporate toadies who claimed they couldn&#39;t interfere with any particular contractor&#39;s case, because of the legal separation requirements.I so enjoyed watching the HR rep calmly and politely tell them, &#34;That&#39;s great! Good job, you guys! But you know... when you hire someone and they don&#39;t do a good job, your remedy is to fire them. Not to refuse to pay.&#34;She got paid.I can&#39;t make any general statements about what happens to everyone, but in this particular case, I can&#39;t complain at all about HR&#39;s handling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Google executives have been aware since at least May 2019 that the company was failing to comply with local laws in the UK, Europe and Asia that mandate temporary workers be paid equal rates to full-time employees performing similar work, internal Google documents and emails reviewed by the Guardian show.&gt; But rather than immediately correct the errors, the company dragged its feet for more than two years, the documents show, citing concern about the increased cost to departments that rely heavily on temporary workers, potential exposure to legal claims, and fear of negative press attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My question is, if it&#39;s so advantageous to employ people via onsite staffing firms (basically half of FAANG&#39;s workforce is employed this way), why doesn&#39;t Google stop directly employing people altogether?Without fail, if it&#39;s a giant publicly-traded company, a huge percentage of the workforce will always be onsite vendors. It seems so bizarrely arbitrary where they decide to hire direct vs. contract.And I&#39;m not talking about janitors, I&#39;m talking highly paid software engineers, product managers, etc working on the same teams with Google employees.Based on the rates I&#39;ve seen, I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s cheaper than having direct employees. So I&#39;m guessing its more about making it easier to fire people, harder to get sued by them, and offloading the hassle of benefits onto a third party. It&#39;s clearly legal in the US, so why not take that strategy with all employees.Does anybody have insight as to when this trend started in corporate America and why it&#39;s only popular with big publicly traded companies?When a company goes public, do they suddenly get a mandate from the Board that they have to start mass-hiring people through Adecco?Based on stories of mailroom workers rising up to executive ranks in the past, this clearly wasn&#39;t true as recently as the 1970s."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder what Linux exclusive software they are hoping to support. Everything I use in my Ubuntu daily driver has a Windows build or corollary app. I get how ‘you never have to leave Windows’ is a nice thing for their business, but I don’t see this being a reason I would stop dual-booting. The only reason I run windows in the first place is for a few apps, mostly games. Otherwise I really enjoy the bloat-free, ad-free, telemetry-free, snappy, tractable, and undistracted experience that is Linux desktop computing.It would be nice if they did something actually useful, like add native ext4 support."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love WSL1. With WSL2 and the move to Hyper-V, I just decided to drop WSL and manage my own VM manually.I use the remote development tools on VSCode that power WSL to make everything feel like it&#39;s running on the host directly, just like WSL2.This way I don&#39;t have any confusion born from it pretending not to be a VM. No issues with network port mappings, dns stuff, who owns what binary and how does it execute? When is WSL2 running and when is it not? etc etcUltimately, I would rather run Linux on my desktop as a daily driver but the desktop experience is not quite there yet for me to live (at least) 8 hours a day in. Gnome 40 looks great though, can&#39;t wait too see what the future holds.My dream is running Linux as a daily driver where the UI is more polished than MacOS. Windows will run in a VM and will be used for API calls for playing games (I wonder if we will ever see some kind of GPU sharing for virtualisation)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a long time coming. There is an infamous MathOverflow thread about the proof (also linked in the article), with the following comment summarizing the state of affairs ~10 years ago:&gt; There is no other evidence. In fact there is absolutely no evidence what so ever. I have never met a mathematician who could convince me that he or she understood Freedman`s proof. I attempted to read that monstrosity of a paper a number of times by myself and quite a few times with a group of other mathematicians. We never were able to finish checking all of the details. Such seminars always ended before we could make it through even half of his paper. No other expositions on the subject seem to be any better. It is truely an odd state of affairs that after all of these years no one has managed to write a clear exposition of this so called proof, and that no one seems to question the claim that there ever was a proof. I remember thinking as a young mathematician either this &#34;proof&#34; is sheer nonsense or someone will eventually write out a clear and detailed explanation. As of April of 2011 I have understood that the so called proof is full of errors and they can not be fixed. I mentioned this to several mathematicians during the summer of 2011 and I believe these conversations are directly linked to the dialogue seen here on math overflow.Also on that thread, Brendan Guilfoyle raised the issue of writing a complete book-length treatment of the proof. I found the following response an interesting commentary on incentives in academia.&gt; Promotion committee: &#34;What have you done in the last 5 years?&#34;&gt; B.G.: &#34;I&#39;ve been writing a book about a paper published in 1982.&#34;&gt; Promotion committee: &#34;How is that groundbreaking overachieving hyped research?&#34;&gt; B.G.: &#34;It is not, but I am preserving the knowledge of the elders.&#34;&gt; Promotion committee: &#34;Who told you that was a good idea?&#34;&gt; B.G.: &#34;A guy on the internet, and 24 people liked his suggestion.&#34;&gt; Promotion committee: &#34;We will call you, don&#39;t call us. Good bye.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I understand this article, it’s about a 500-page book that is devoted to one proof of one theorem in topology. I find that amazing.And cheers to Quantum Magazine for regularly publishing popularizations of research mathematics. I know many, at times, take issue with their simplifications and framing, but they’re trying, where almost no one else with their reach covers these areas at all."</p>

Hundreds of research papers have been published on this topic.

When 802.11bf will be finalized and introduced as an IEEE standard in September 2024, Wi-Fi will cease to be a communication-only standard and will legitimately become a full-fledged sensing paradigm... tracking can be done surreptitiously because Wi-Fi signals can penetrate walls, don&#39;t require light, and don&#39;t offer any visible indicator of their presence.IEEE 802.11bf paper (March 2021): https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14918Theory: https://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/soda_paper.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this seems to be a neat thing, I am just wondering how common nowadays are door locks that actually have a hole through them? Where I come from, those locks could be seen in doors of old cabinets and other furniture. Or perhaps at the summer cottage, but even there, it is usually just an old shed or something; any doors that are supposed to keep anything valuable safe, have solid lock housing, i.e. no through keyholes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many comments here about MS and Oracle.  Mēh! I have an intellectual affinity for the suffering.  But it has been 20 years since I wrestled with the Beast from Seattle.Most of those twenty years were spent doing my own things in Linux, Perl, and R.  In glorious ivory tower isolation from the real world consequences of serving a master who&#39;s goal was to extract revenue...Here I am for the last year serving Apple (the Beast from Cupertino?).The problems are the same with documentation.  Yesterday I found an example in some Apple documentation.  It saved me half a day, and I almost dies from shock.  I have never before seen an actual example...Their main documentation is videos.  Fucking videos.  Videos of what looks like actors pretending to be developers, that go on for ages, have no transcripts....And then the tools:  At least the MS and Oracle tools work! (Do they?)  In Apple you cannot believe what the debugger tells you about the state of your programme with out double checking in at least two other ways, because their tool chain is very buggy, and they will not fix it.There is no money in fixing tools.  We developers pay them SFA money, brighter colours on the App store, deeper dark arts in getting you to fork over $XX for shiny apps that is where their development resources are going.SO...  They are all the same: APple, MS, Oracle, Google....  We developers are their bitches, we will crawl over broken glass to get things done, so there is no need to spend any resources on us....Come back RMS!! All is forgiven!!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to be the general rule of thumb that, when you want to  google for an oracle error message, then exclusion of both oracle documentation site, and developer forums is your first criteria on the search bar.  Same applies to Microsoft (large parts of MSDN), and now Amazon Web Services documentation (at least some parts of it).That&#39;s the reason StackOverflow works - it really solves programmer&#39;s problems, instead of the strange dialects of English and style that flourish on MS and Oracle and Java docs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked with databases for a while now and I&#39;ve never advocated for moving to Oracle (I have advocated for postgres though).  The long term organizational costs is a big factor - but an almost equally large factor is the fact that1. I have never actually used their dialect and have heard absolutely terrible things about it2. There is no non-enterprise DBMS available that uses something close to their dialect so I figure actually hiring Oracle DBAs would be a nightmare.These two factors combine to make me absolutely baffled at how completely Oracle has seemed to dominate every market but the private one (i.e. government, especially defense and educational).  Have I been missing something about ways to actually get real world experience with Oracle?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats, this is one of the best landing pages I&#39;ve seen this year. It looks really nice, and I love the idea of a headless ecommerce platform, especially one that comes with a nice backend GUI for managing inventory, etc.I took a quick look through the documentation as well, and was  pleasantly surprised by the maturity of the features that it has. This provides pretty much all of the basics I think one would need to manage a medium sized store. One area I do think could be improved perhaps is in the internationalization; it seems to me that every product has a single string to be the description, a single string to be the title, etc. with no easy way to localize the text across different regions.I also am curious about the pricing; the landing page mentions that you can get started for free, and &#34;start building for free&#34;, but is there some component that costs money down the road? I don&#39;t see any pricing page on the website so for now I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s 100% open source."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for building it as open source! Few q&#39;s:1. It doesn&#39;t seem to be multi-tenant (that is, hosting multiple shops/companies with one db). Are there plans to add multi-tenancy?2. What are the major differences vs  https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure ? (another nodejs solution, with included Admin panel and storefront)3. How do you plan to monetize?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks super nice!I&#39;ve been interested in the ecommerce + graphql space for a while, yours seems a really great project, will be following along and looking into migration paths!I love the stack choices as well, seems much more lightweight and approachable to me than other alternatives like saleor (which I don&#39;t really dig these days anymore) or vendure which is an excellent project too but with a stack I am no too familiar with (NestJS, Angular)... So kudos for making this open source!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The headline in a domestic newspaper reads &#34;There are some product placements that influencers do not need to label as ads&#34;https://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2021-09/bundesgerichtsh...:Dit&#39;s all about framing"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whether or not these influencers should have to label ads is one thing.But... I&#39;ll note how &#34;little guy&#34; regulation works relative to major players.You don&#39;t see court, legislature decisions, or such upending the business model of a FB, Google or whatnot. Every word will be negotiated, Google and/or FB will have control over implementation. Often, the regulation will be a net positive, given that it can slow small competitors down. The process will take years, the roll out will be gradual....&#34;Influencers&#34; or really anyone selling content via platforms can have rules slapped onto them by either the state or the platform without notice, lots of potential for revenue disruption... 
It&#39;s easy to belittle the little, and this article kind does it too: &#34;The court said one fitness influencer should have been clear she was advertising when she was paid to promote a brand of jam.&#34;Meanwhile.. FB, Adwords and such got decades of lead time. Extreme tolerance of various dubious practices as regulation designed to be business friendly at the cost of timeliness &amp; effectiveness was slowly formulated. No parliament demands Fast and Furious post little notices, nor have they over decades."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope they don’t get rid of the symbol entirely! It’s useful to know what resin a product is made of.Things like PLA (which is kinda sorta compostable) are not often recycled, but they can be. If you don’t know what resin the plastic is, then it’s even harder.Keep the resin symbol. Remove the arrows on it. We get better with recycling stuff over time, so eventually more resins could be recycled.But. Part of me wonders if it is actually BETTER to not recycle.Imagine if we made plastic by pulling CO2 from the atmosphere (which we do for PLA!). If the cost were the same and the processing energy the same, wouldn’t it be better for the climate to bury that plastic (sequestering the carbon) instead of recycling it? That is, after all, how we got fossil fuels and reduced the CO2 to preindustrial levels! Burying a bunch of waste carbon from dead algae or trees before fungi evolved that could efficiently break down lignin. Recycling that carbon would’ve meant higher CO2 levels today.And the waste in river thing is primarily about what happens to plastic BEFORE it ends up in a bin (trash OR recycling). Things like water satchets, which really are a compensation for having crap tap water."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would much rather incentivize non-plastic alternative packaging. Consumers should have better options for metal cans, glass bottles, etc for mainstream goods, as those materials are far more effective targets for recycling. But they&#39;re no where near competitive with plastic because the production cost doesn&#39;t account for the total lifecycle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a waste of time.Now we will spend a decade arguing which plastic is really recyclable, and if you can recycle it once is it enough, or should be 2 times? or does it degrade on its own? bio plastic (which turns out sometimes is worse than current common plastic) and etc.Coca Cola&#39;s &#39;Please Recycle&#39; on the caps makes me boil with rage, how about &#39;Please Don&#39;t Make it&#39;?There must be supply chain changes, probably 95% of my plastic is from the supermarket, it is increasingly more difficult to buy without plastic.This must be banned, it will take decades until the free market regulates itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is a tough feeling to see someone else&#39;s design for a library that would be literally perfect for my needs, but I&#39;m unable to use it because of the license, so I have to spend weeks implementing my own inferior version while carefully avoiding making the code too similar to what I happen to remember.I&#39;m past believing that I&#39;m smart enough to always be able to come up with/reimplement a competent enough solution for all my needs by myself every time. But copyright still has to be respected.When I&#39;m forced into that situation from licensing issues, it really makes me feel like my skillset primarily revolves around gluing together other people&#39;s well-designed code, and being left to my own devices exposes my weakness in implementing something from scratch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t blogged about this yet, but we saw a 1000x fold speed-up doing several things around symbolication. The more optimal approach we found was to use the gimli crate[1] directly &amp; carefully optimize it to read in the data structures for the executable(s) you are symbolicating upfront &amp; then issuing in-process queries. They also have a drop-in replacement of addr2line that outperforms it (both in symbolication speed &amp; memory usage).I am curious about how that compares with libbfd since that wasn&#39;t under consideration for us as it uses GPLv3.[1] https://github.com/gimli-rs/gimli[2] https://github.com/gimli-rs/addr2line"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Students at Portland State are not being taught to think. Rather, they are being trained to mimic the moral certainty of ideologues.They have been taught the magnitude of their outrage makes them righteous. And their outrage is never satiated. These people are toxic and sometimes evil. They&#39;ll eventually come for you too no matter how much you generally agree with them.Some of them are certainly sincere. But as Milton Friedman once said, &#34;sincerity is an overrated virtue&#34;. The damage they cause is the same irrespective of how sincere they might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think university departments that teach Philosophy, esp where edgy ideas are discussed should have some protection where the teacher is not harassed.Some of his experimental papers where he talks of &#34;dog rape&#34; were perhaps borne out of his outrage at his situation - I am not sure if they are wise decisions on his part - instead seen as extreme measures to prove a point.A liberal college by definition should allow diversity of opinion.  A literal interpretation of the word &#34;liberal college&#34; reflects the reality that many places are liberal bubbles of thought, where there won&#39;t be a safe space for researchers to pick apart and look closely at conservative views of a subject. It&#39;s the sad reality that the authorities are not remotely ready to be proven wrong - the anti-thesis of rational inquiry in an educational setting.Outrage Politics has pervaded everything.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting that &#34;broken access controls&#34; made it into the top spot. Not sure if this anecdotal but recently I&#39;ve seen many &#34;hacks&#34; of apps built with external BaaS &amp; auth providers that rely on some kind of token-based authentication, either via JWT or opaque tokens. What happens is that often the providers offer good support for role-based access control but developers just plain ignore it and e.g. include tokens with global read permissions into the app code, or do not properly restrict the permissions of individual tokens, making it possible to e.g. read the whole database with a normal user token. The researcher collective Zerforschung [1] e.g. has uncovered many such incidents. That might have to do with the fact that in my experience those BaaS frameworks and other low-code tools are mostly used by teams with a strong focus on product and UI/UX, which don&#39;t have deep security expertise or the right mindset. I think overall outsourcing of aspects like authentication can be beneficial, but only if teams adopt or retain a healthy security awareness as well.[1] https://twitter.com/zerforschung"</p>

XXE&#39;s aren&#39;t misconfiguration (in any sense that a myriad of other vulnerabilities aren&#39;t &#34;misconfigurations&#34; of libraries), and deserialization bugs aren&#39;t software update bugs (I don&#39;t even know what CI/CD is doing in that description).The OWASP Top 10 is rapidly losing coherence.It&#39;s important not to take it too seriously. For all the pantomime about survey data, there&#39;s not much real rigor to it. It&#39;s mostly a motivational document, and a sort of synecdoche for &#34;all of web app security&#34;.The best part of this is the end, where they say &#34;we have no data to support having SSRF on the list, but &#39;industry people&#39; tell us it&#39;s too important not to&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like with the flurry of support behind mRNA tech, right now is quite an exciting time to be in biotech. It&#39;s early days, but from what (little, admittedly) I&#39;ve read there seems to be a lot of promise behind it. If it lives up to even 10% of its theorised promise, we&#39;re potentially going to see a lot of amazing treatments in the coming couple of decades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a pretty exciting part of the mRNA field. There are some mutations that cause cancer (like G12D, G12V, G13D or G12C in KRAS) which allows you to make a single vaccine that can be used by anyone with those mutations. There is also a push to do personalized cancer vaccines where you sequence a single person&#39;s cancer and find the top 30 or so mutations in any gene that are different from their normal cells.The biggest issues IMHO with cancer vaccines in the past has been your bodies natural ability to prevent your immune system from attacking itself. With the discovery/invention of checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda, we may finally have a way to allow your immune system to attack yourself by co-administering Keytruda with the vaccine against your cancer cells [1].Another reason cancer vaccines may finally show promise is mRNA inherently has the ability to drive an immune response (see BNT162b2/Comirnaty) that elicits T-cell specific to the protein you&#39;re coding for. It is believed that cancer-epitope CD8 T-cells specifically are critical for anticancer vaccines, but even if you get good CD8 cells, the second it binds the cancer cell it gets shutdown by the checkpoint proteins on the surface of the cancer cell. If you add a CPI, boom, you don&#39;t prevent the CD8 from shutting down and you get cell killing![1] https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03948763"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the HN crowd, it may be especially interesting to note that this was pretty much a software discovery.The dataset here was DES, the Dark Energy Survey. It’s a big dataset that has been around for a few years, and probably thousands of astronomers have worked with it. But its just a huge amount of data, covering a lot of the sky.Bernardinelli’s software discovered a blip in that big pile of data. He crunched through the dataset and got a weird answer for the size of the solar system (basically - its a bit more complicated). Almost everyone, when they get something like that, tweaks the parameters of their analysis code: “I must have the threshold for object detection set too low.” The real discovery comes from trusting the software and pursuing the question.This is a lot like software developers and their persistence. When your production service has a mysterious error in the logs, do you shrug and say “well, probably some transient network bug, it won’t matter” or do you dig in to understand what’s going on? Both approaches are reasonable, and it takes a balance of pragmatism and curiosity to be effective.But anyway - there is an increasing demand for applying rigorous software engineering techniques to astronomical datasets. A problem that we are facing in astronomy software today is that the datasets have gotten way too large for astronomers to just pull up images in DS9 and eyeball stuff to make sure it’s right, so they need software that is much more trustworthy and bug-free than before.—-Edit to add: DES data is completely public access: https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/the-des-project/data-access..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is super cool. I studied comets for a while when I was in academia, and my favorite was one called Humason [0]. There are other great photos of it, some in google images, though the ones I had in the research lab in a a few books about comets were even more surprising. It had a very odd tail appearance because the comet tail is primarily created by an interaction with the solar wind / magnetic field, and at distances far from the Sun, that field is much weaker, so the tail becomes less straight, and this effect is even more pronounced when the comet is very large, as smaller comets just don&#39;t have an easy to detect visible tail from such great distances from Earth.Humason is less than half the size of this comet and is considered abnormally large.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Humason"</p>

If you&#39;re on an M1 you may run into https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10577 (which is WIP, and may have been resolved by https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/11451)."</p>

Virtual machine is still needed, so any performance issues are likely to persist (well, maybe Docker for Mac is a bit more buggy, but we can manually setup Docker instead of Podman in a similar way).Also, I think we are losing here access to the Docker socket on the host (inside the virtual machine it can be emulated using docker-podman)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels like the whole industry is now all going through the same motions…I tried podman; two hurdles I haven&#39;t figured out: 1/ sending the context is incredibly slow on podman, compared to Docker+Buildkit. It&#39;s definitely trying to send literally the entire context, like Docker without Buildkit does, but even more slowly… 2/ private registry auth. Haven&#39;t really tried too hard, but it&#39;s not just &#34;a drop in replacement&#34;; I think I need to somehow auth with podman specifically. (Part of this is our external registry is ACR, and we auth with `az`, but I think `az` is presuming Docker…)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plenty of skepticism in these comments. I&#39;ve been following CFS for a while and can present a point of view for why this time might be different.Fusion energy was actually making rapid progress in the latter half of the twentieth century, going from almost no power output in the fifties and sixties to a power output equal to 67% of input power with the JET reactor in 1997. By the eighties there was plenty of experimental evidence to describe the relationships between tokamak parameters and power output. Particularly that the gain is proportional to the radius to the power of 1.3 and the magnetic field cubed. The main caveat to this relationship was that we only had magnets that would go up to 5.5 Tesla, which implied we needed a tokamak radius of 6 meters or so in order to produce net energy.Well that 6 meter tokamak was designed in the eighties and is currently under construction. ITER, being so large, costs tens of billions of dollars and requires international collaboration; the size of the project has led to huge budget overruns and long delays. Recently however, there have been significant advances in high-temperature super conductors that can produce magnetic fields large enough that we (theoretically) only need a tokamak with a major radius of about 1.5 meters to produce net gain. This is where SPARC (the tokamak being built by the company in the article) comes in. The general idea is that since we have stronger magnets now, we can make a smaller, and therefore cheaper tokamak quickly.Small tokamaks do have downsides, namely that the heat flux through the walls of the device is so large that it will damage the tokamak. There have been breakthroughs with various divertor designs that can mitigate this, but to the best of my knowledge I&#39;m not sure that CFS has specified their divertor configuration.This was just a short summary of the presentation by Dennis Whyte given here [0]. I do not work in the fusion community.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exciting. Magnetic field strength is a key component for enabling magnetic confinement fusion. This is because energy gain and power density scales to the 3rd and 4th power with magnetic field strength but only ~linearly with reactor size. See following equations for more details: https://youtu.be/xJ2h3vbOag4?t=306So, why is this particular announcement exciting? There are 3 factors:1. This is a high temperature superconductor. I can&#39;t find any references, but as far as I remember the substrate they are using needs to be cooled to (WRONG, it was cooled to 20degK, see reply by MauranKilom) 60-70 degK to achieve super conductivity. Compare to magnets used in ITER which need to be cooled to 4degK. This is the difference between using relatively cheap liquid nitrogen vs liquid helium.2. Field strength of 20 Tesla is significantly higher than 13 Tesla used in ITER. Given that magnetic confinement fusion scales significantly better with field strength vs reactor size, this will enable much smaller reactor to be power  positive. See following links for more details on ITERs magnets: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2280763-worlds-most-pow... https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/27003. Finally, the magnet was assembled from 16 identical subassemblies, each of which used mass manufactured magnetic tape. This is significantly cheaper and more scalable than custom magnet design/manufacturing used by ITER.The kicker is how 3 of the factors above interact with the cost of the project. Stronger magnets allow smaller viable reactors. High temperature superconductors + smaller reactors allow for a much simpler and smaller cooling system. Smaller reactors + scalable magnet design further drives down the cost. Finally, cost of state of art mega projects scales somewhere between 3rd and 4th power with the size of the device. Combining all of the above factors, SPARC should be here significantly sooner than ITER and cost a tiny fraction (I would guesstimate that fraction to be between 1/100 and 1/10,000).edit: typos + looked at the cost of ITER and refined my cost fraction guesstimate + corrected some stuff based on the reply by MauranKilom."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These university press releases are always very positively framed. This one makes the new magnet seem incredibly promising and fusion seem like almost an inevitability now, but decades of failure have us conditioned for skepticism. What&#39;s the catch this time?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of my (now dead) open source Dropbox alternative Syncany [1] and all the different storage plugins I made for it [2]. Long story short, a storage plugin only had to implement the API methods upload, download, list and delete, so you could literally use anything as a storage backend (FTP, SFTP, S3, WebDAV, ..).I made a few fun plugins that would encode data (after deduping, compressing and encrypting them) into PNG or BMP and store them on Flickr (which gave you 1TB of free storage for images) or Picasa (now Google Photos). It was actually relatively efficient and not slower than the other methods, and it looked super cool to have albums full of what looked like images of static. It was a blatant violation of their ToC, so obviously not serious.The code is still online, it&#39;s from 2014/2015. The Flickr plugin with the PNG encoder is here [3], and I&#39;m not entirely sure if I ever published the Picasa one.[1] https://www.syncany.org/[2] https://github.com/syncany?q=plugin[3] https://github.com/syncany/syncany-plugin-flickr/tree/develo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once made a music player similar to this. It converted music files into image files, and saved them to Flickr. One trick that I employed was that the output image files were also visually recognizable, featuring album covers and lyrics.[1][2] The way I used to hide information was pretty barbaric, but it was still a fun experiment.[1] https://www.flickr.com/photos/barosl/albums/7215763383971356...[2] https://github.com/barosl/flickr-music-player"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has all its place on hacker news because it is a fun hack, but it&#39;s not at all practical. Not only it doesn&#39;t work in all browsers even fairly recent ones (service workers), but even when it works it necessitates javascript enabled, and imposes a non negligible additional load time. And more importantly, with the way it is recommended to use it using 404.html file as a &#34;catch all&#34;, it means all your pages are served as 404 errors, which can be a problem for a lot of things (starting with search engine indexing)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We should have some kind of dashboard tracking how many people die from terrorism, car crashes, heart disease, COVID, etc., and how much time and money we spend trying to prevent these deaths. We are just so terrible at evaluating risk, for some reason it is OK to waste everyone&#39;s time with over the top security to stop a tiny portion of terrorism deaths, while still being OK with high speed limits that kill thousands of people per year. Not that I&#39;m advocating for lower speed limits, just that there is a contradiction here.I bet that if instead of having people go through security at sporting events, you had them all do 20 push ups, you&#39;d save more people from dying of heart disease than would die of terrorism."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US is the only place I think I&#39;ve had to remove shoes for flight security in years. But in Europe taking off a belt is often required while in the US it is not. In Budapest they stopped having us remove laptops from bags a bit ago. My biggest challenge over the years was remembering what to do in each place as the security people at the airports had a tendency to get upset if you didn&#39;t do it their preferred way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way you know it is all security theater is TSA pre.  I haven&#39;t taken my shoes off, my laptop out, or gone through the hands-on-your-head scanner in years, because the TSA pre-check line doesn&#39;t require any of that.Because apparently verifying my ID before arrival at the airport makes me less of a threat.Or maybe it&#39;s the $80 they get every few years that makes me less of a threat..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After getting a (non-DIY because as much as I like hobby electronics I have a tendency to scope creep my little projects straight into incompletion) about a year ago, my main learnings have been:- Cooking is insanely bad for the air in your house, even with an outside-venting hood. Any sort of medium-high heat cooking will spike the PM2.5 to multiple times that of the haziest days here in NYC, and with the windows shut it will stay elevated for hours after.- The 20&#34; box fan + MERV furnace filter hack is super effective for cutting down on the PM. A few days this July the wildfire smoke from the west coast settled on NYC and we had 40-70 ug/m3 PM2.5 outside. The box fan filter took it down to around 5 in a matter of minutes. I didn&#39;t even bother taping the filter to the fan.- My A/C system&#39;s ability to precisely hold the temperature within fractions of a degree of the thermostat setting is impressive.- With two people working from home in an old, unventilated-but-kinda-drafty ~700 square foot apartment, the only thing that gets the CO2 levels into &#34;drowsy&#34; territory (my original point of curiosity when buying the sensor) is running the gas oven for a while."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did a similar thing -- set up AQ sensors in the house.I used the sps30 from sparkfun, CAD&#39;d up a panel mount, 3d printed it, built a wooden box for it + a pi, set up all the networking and hosting, and packaged my utils for debian.Anyway, the AQ is fine, HEPA filters work when in-line with the A/C, and there&#39;s nothing much to monitor even when AQ is mod/bad outside. Boring, but nice to know, and fun to learn all those new skills.Just don&#39;t burn incense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; the components for this project cost between $60-80Purple air sells a turn key indoor air quality device for $200, is very reliable, also comes in a (clear) 3d printed case, comes with power supply. Not as DIY as this guy&#39;s solution, but with limited time on my hands the $100 was worth the cost of admission. It also works with Purple Air&#39;s map which provides nationwide air quality, temp and humidity, etc which is really nice.It&#39;s worked flawlessly for me now for about five months. The light turns from green to yellow when I open the window in my south facing condo, but turns green again when I close the window and turn on the air filter. I was surprised at how bad the air quality gets when cooking food on the stove."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually initially wanted to be on Coinbase’s side here, but after a quick google of “Howey test” and reading even just the introduction on Wikipedia, I cannot imagine how they don’t see the SEC’s reasoning about Lend wrt Howey. If you want to argue that Howey does not apply or fight the decision/lawsuit, then fine. But feigning ignorance of something a (non-legal expert) programmer can connect the dots of instantly just makes me feel like they’re playing a PR game. Seeing as they are already offering APY on staked Ethereum, I don’t see “concern” reflected in their actions. Seems like they are trying to get out to the public before the SEC does to farm some good will."</p>

These two cases are from 1946 and 1990.Trying to make out like Howey is some obscure precedent from decades ago which the SEC is nitpicking over. The Howey test is the test applied to determine if something is an investment contract."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“We have no idea why the SEC intends to sue us! It is a complete mystery.”(Later in the post…)“All we’ve done is create a thing that people can trade which we are moving towards selling to investors against specific SEC advice to the contrary, but it is definitely not a security and as a result it is completely fine even though we have not complied with SEC regulations in any way with respect to it.”A mystery indeed…"</p>

They can ask, and it is problematic that they do since many of the people they stop won&#39;t realize that they can simply decline, but the police have basically no authority in the general case to require it.Without individualized suspicion, the police can barely even ask for ID. They&#39;ve lost cases over it. Even with suspicion, it&#39;s unlikely that they can forcefully demand social media information. (They can, with sufficient evidence, arrest you and conduct a search of your person to try to uncover it, but arrests are a big deal; they can&#39;t dragnet arrest.)With that in mind, I assume the productive article to write here is the one framed around informing people that they shouldn&#39;t cooperate with requests like these."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zig is a very interesting language. You are able to do thing that would require wizard level skills in C with simple plain language construct. Like serializing/deserializing an enum variants over the wire for example in the most efficient way (look at std.json.{parser, stringify} [0]).&gt; soon we’ll also have a package managerThis. If they succeed to do this (and I have my doubts) it will be a paradigm shift for low-level &#34;system&#34; programming.Let&#39;s hope this is not vaporware.Finally, it&#39;s relatively easy to contribute to Zig. Andrew Kelley is very opinionated on where the language should go with an emphasis on simplicity which sometimes can make things awkward but he is also persuasive and welcoming. I have been using Zig for a month and I am still positively surprised so he must be onto something.[0]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/json.zig#..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The build tooling of Zig is very impressive. I&#39;m a sponsor of the project not necessarily because of the language itself, but because it surely has the potential to make waves in some way or another (edit: though the language itself is also quite interesting).One thing I wish the blog post had brought up is testing! Zig has some great tooling around tests, and that is something sorely lacking in a lot of C projects. If nothing else, you can pretty easily use Zig to simply write some tests for a C project! Even that would be a big improvement to the ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Generally speaking, what killed C++/C for me is the absolute insanity that comes with it&#39;s build systems/third party dependency management.I feel like the notoriety that C++ gets for it&#39;s absurd complexity comes not from variadic template metaprogramming/rvalue references/unique_ptr or whatever, but the absolutely humongous effort needed to understand automake/CMake/autotools just to build other people&#39;s code (god forbid on a different platform than the original author)."</p>

Even having a lambda function run once every 5 minutes 24/7 would trigger ~15,000 invocations a month, which is in the realm of &#34;near Free&#34;.If there was some way to trigger the scale-down event from there, it would reduce the expensive part of this setup (Fargate) even further. Though, granted; given both containers are packed into the same Fargate VM, it would really only mean freeing up some additional resources for the Minecraft server.It looks like the watchdog is simply checking for connections on a port, which is probably too low-level to handle with lambda. But, an architecture like this could work in a ton of services, and if you had e.g. an ALB set up in front of the services, one could use the lambda to scan incoming request metrics and scale down on that."</p>

This only compares average time on app.• It could also be totally skewed, if let&#39;s say 100M people spend 2h/day on average on Youtube, and 1k (a tiny amount) spend 2.5h/day on average on Tiktok, that&#39;d be already good enough to say &#34;average time per user spent on the apps is higher for TikTok&#34;.I haven&#39;t read the report, but wanted to point out these two warnings.

I follow a handful of channels and even from them I lookat 20-40% of their videos.TikTok on the other hand I swore I&#39;d never use. Then came Covid19 and lockdowns. I reached the end of HN, Reddit and Youtube, so I installed it.The Algorthm is fucking amazing. Dunno how they do it, but 80-90% of stuff it shows me I end up watching (it is 10secs to 3 mins so the investment isn&#39;t that huge =) ).I&#39;ve ended up following, among others, an opthalmologist who does sketches about hospital stuff, to mechanics who show the most f&#39;d up cars they get to service, to farrier and sheep shearing videos to a guy who does comedy about weird animal facts.I&#39;d never actually go search anything like that on purpose, but I actually kinda found out I enjoy looking at. It&#39;s a good way to space out for 30 minutes and relax. Most TikTok videos get to the point before a stereotypical YouTuber has gone through their intro and sponsor segments :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a hit for US cultural dominance and influence.Americans and Brits, at least in average watch time, are now consuming media ultimately controlled by the Chinese government.And the previous election was influenced by a foreign government using American social media networks to influence, not to mention influencing the president-elect directly.Either America&#39;s own social networks are used against them or social networks controlled by other countries are gaining dominance.It seems nothing other than a decline in American influence in the world. And it comes from other countries outperforming the Americans.Whether America reacts to this or ignores it through the arrogance of the current greatest will define American power in the world for generations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Patent lawyer here.  There is a lot of dubious stuff already in this thread, so be careful with legal opinions from people on the internet.Some relevant claim language is below.  Of course a lot of this stuff has been known for a while, but you have to have everything together--or an evidenced argument that combining things in this way would have been obvious--before you can conclude anything about the validity of the patent.  And on unpatentable subject matter (i.e., being an abstract idea), there is a pretty good argument that this improves the functionality of the computer, not just uses a computer to do something known, which recent cases have started using as the de facto dividing line.1. A system comprising:
one or more computer processors;
one or more computer memories;
a set of instructions incorporated into the one or more computer memories, the set of instructions configuring the one or more computer processors to perform operations for automatically managing a set of memory chunks within the one or more computer memories at runtime for a computer application, the operations comprising:
receiving a set of entities from the computer application, each of the set of entities including a set of components, wherein each component of the set of components has one type of a set of types;
classifying the set of entities into a set of archetypes, each archetype representing a different count of the set of components or a different combination of types of the set of components relative to other archetypes of the set of archetypes;
based on a determination that one of the set of archetypes corresponds to a new archetype, building a new memory chunk, adding the new memory chunk to the set of memory chunks, and populating the new memory chunk, wherein the populating of the new memory chunk includes adding data from the set of components included in one or more entities of the set of entities that are classified under the new archetype, the adding of the data including contiguously adding the data to ends of a set of component data arrays included in the new memory chunk, each of the set of data arrays included in the new memory chunk corresponding to a respective component of the set of components included in the one or more entities that are classified under the new archetype."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Setting aside whether or not this patent is silly or abstract or obvious or anything else, I have one important question: what does Unity plan to do with this?Most big tech companies have a constant stream of patent applications, many of which are granted. But they rarely sue over 99% of them. Sure, Amazon had one-click for however many years and they cared about it. But the other tens of thousands of patents Amazon owns (a couple of which have my name on them as &#39;inventor&#39;) are never going to see a court room.Why do they patent everything? So that patent trolls can&#39;t patent it first and then sue them for patent violations. It&#39;s a defensive patent.Is ECS going to be Unity&#39;s &#34;This is ours, no one else can use it without paying us&#34; lawsuit-generating patent? I doubt it. They know they&#39;d lose in court eventually, and along the way the entire industry would stop doing business with them. It would be a complete lose-lose move.On the other hand, now that Unity owns this patent, no patent troll can go and patent ECS then start suing small-studio Unity customers, like parasites leaching off the success of Unity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, Unity&#39;s ECS development effort has gone radio-silent in the last few months.  Their latest versions of the Unity Editor (2021.1+) are no longer compatible with ECS, and Unity&#39;s forum reps have not responded to the many game devs left in limbo and begging for info or an update.Something with ECS development is clearly going haywire, and the silence from the Unity people is troubling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very nice!For reasoning about tree-based data such as HTML, I also highly recommend the declarative programming language Prolog. HTML documents map naturally to Prolog terms and can be readily reasoned about with built-in language mechanisms. For instance, here is the sample query from the htmlq README, fetching all elements with id get-help from https://www.rust-lang.org, using Scryer Prolog and its SGML and HTTP libraries in combination with the XPath-inspired query language from library(xpath):    ?- http_open(&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org&#34;, Stream, []),
       load_html(stream(Stream), DOM, []),
       xpath(DOM, //(*(@id=&#34;get-help&#34;)), E).

Yielding:       E = element(div,[class=&#34;flex flex-colum ...&#34;,id=&#34;get-help&#34;],[&#34;\n        &#34;,element(h4,[],[&#34;Get help!&#34;]),&#34;\n        &#34;,element(ul,[],[&#34;\n       ...&#34;,element(li,[],[element(a,[... = ...],[...])]),&#34;\n   ...&#34;,element(li,[],[...]),...|...]),&#34;\n        ...&#34;,element(div,[class=&#34;la ...&#34;],[&#34;\n   ...&#34;,element(label,[...],[...]),...|...]),&#34;\n    ...&#34;])
    ;  false.

The selector //(*(@id=&#34;get-help&#34;)) is used to obtain all HTML elements whose id attribute is get-help. On backtracking, all solutions are reported.The other example from the README, extracting all links from the page, can be obtained with Scryer Prolog like this:    ?- http_open(&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org&#34;, Stream, []),
       load_html(stream(Stream), DOM, []),
       xpath(DOM, //a(@href), Link),
       portray_clause(Link),
       false.

This query uses forced backtracking to write all links on standard output, yielding:    &#34;/&#34;.
    &#34;/tools/install&#34;.
    &#34;/learn&#34;.
    &#34;https://play.rust-lang.org/&#34;.
    &#34;/tools&#34;.
    &#34;/governance&#34;.
    &#34;/community&#34;.
    &#34;https://blog.rust-lang.org/&#34;.

Jq is closer to the awk where you can do just about everything with json. Cascadia, htmlq, and pup seem closer to grep for html. They can essentially only select data from a html source.[0] https://github.com/EricChiang/pup

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello, I’m Cameron and one of the two people working on the Bonsai web browser.We’re focused on making a web browser for programmers to improve their workflow. It helps you look up docs and search information. You can toggle it on with a hotkey and it can overlay on your IDE. Tabs are grouped by domain for easy organization. The history data structure is a tree which shows how pages are back-linked to each other and to spatial workspaces. Both open tabs and pages in your workspaces are just pointers to a node in your history tree!You can watch a 2 minute video walkthrough here https://www.loom.com/share/93c7c0012f514c37b58a42fa65badc88 or download it from our websiteHow did we end up here?Initially we wanted to make a citation manager because myself and a friend had an unconnected workflow moving research articles from Chrome -&gt; Zotero -&gt; Emacs org-mode. After talking to some other PhDs/postdocs the takeaway was that everyone has very different ways of doing research. This would mean that it would be impossible to make a citation manager that everyone would want to use.Later, a friend in industry mentioned that he had a hard time finding ‘cloud documents’ as part of his job. We then considered making a spotlight application to find and organize these documents. It turns out that this already been done and it seems that people actually just pull up their documents once at the beginning of the day anyway.We now think that the main problem is that web browsers are actually not currently suited for doing research. The current mixing of research type browsing with web-documents creates a mess and makes people think they want a ‘cloud file search’.What’s different?Instead of an add-on solution to Chrome which would create more noise, we are creating a fully functioning, organized way of managing information overload and keeping you on task as you go through your work day.What’s next?We are fixing up our Linux and Windows versions for public use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love it, this is the most innovative thing in the browser space for a long while. It&#39;s baffling to me how boring most &#39;new&#39; browsers are - most propositions are &#39;like X but with less friction on these 2 or 3 things&#39;.I hate that it&#39;s only for Mac so far, but glad to see others are on the way. I&#39;ve been thinking about picking up a cheap older mac for development work, though, and this is one more reason in favor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks really great, something I could use and would pay for when polished but there&#39;s definitely a few issues for me at the moment:* Why go fullscreen and modal? I want to drag in links from docs, email, other browsers, have it side by side while reading PDFs etc. etc. this stops me from doing any of that* Please let me change the shortcut! I already have Option-Space bound.* Let me put the browser window anywhere I want when it&#39;s in the single page non-fullscreen mode, don&#39;t levitate it to where you think I want it* Unless I&#39;m missing something the process of opening a page then adding it to a workspace seems to be three clicks - open page, hit + (plus) button, select workspace, select workspace/inbox - need to make this one click, maybe just show the inboxes? This also seems clunky, I&#39;d much rather browse, drag that page to the workspace/inbox, continue browsing and adding further pages, then arrange all the pages in the workspace after i&#39;ve added all the links. Seems a faster workflow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Be careful when companies market themselves as Swiss or that due to them being located in Switzerland means there is some extra layer of security or privacy.Sure, it&#39;s a more stable country than many other countries in the world, but not much different from most EU countries for example. And privacy wise there is no difference.Be also aware of the fact that many companies market themselves as Swiss, but all it means is they have a head office in Switzerland due to tax reasons. In one example, it&#39;s a cloud storage company, they say on their marketing page and their about page that they are based in Switzerland and under Swiss law, but if you look at the legal pages the company you sign up with are actually based in Bulgaria. Their servers are based in Texas, USA and Luxemburg, Europe and their development team in Bulgaria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ProtonMail guys always said that unless they were 20 miles  from the littoral, in the sea side, they had to abide by national laws. So it was bound to happen.What makes me sad is how flimsy their entire premise (not necessarily &#34;promise&#34;) turned out to be: all it took was some minor rascal in France to hug the wrong tree (so to speak), and ProtonMail is in the open saying they can&#39;t even protect the IP address of their customers. From there, all it takes is for somebody to change a law in Switzerland and end-to-end encryption of the messages themselves will only be &#34;by default.&#34;I think there is a market for datacenters in open seas."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The expectation that Proton would be able to disobey the legal requests of their local authorities with impunity is unrealistic. Protonmail makes certain claims about privacy, particularly about encryption. They don&#39;t make any claims that they have the intention, or ability for that matter, to defy local authorities at their peril. Like Grugq said in one of his presentations (paraphrased): &#34;Don&#39;t expect your VPN company to do your jail time for you&#34;. I&#39;m neither for nor against Protonmail. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve been dishonest. I think people have an unrealistic expectation of the service they offer. They offer additional privacy, not legal indemnity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run an Alexa top-2000 website.  (Mangadex is presently at about 6000.)  I spend less than $250 a month.I have loads and loads of thoughts about what they could be doing differently to reduce their costs but I&#39;ll just say that the number one thing Mangadex could be doing right now from a cursory glance is to reduce the number of requests.  A fresh load of the home page generates over 100 requests.  (Mostly images, then javascript fragments.)  Mangadex apparently gets over 100 million requests per day.  My site - despite ostensibly having more traffic - gets fewer than half that many in a month.  (And yes, it&#39;s image-heavy.)A couple easy wins would be to reduce the number of images loaded on the front page.  (Does the &#34;Seasonal&#34; slider really need 30 images, or would 5 and a link to the &#34;seasonal&#34; page be enough?  Same thing with &#34;Recently Added&#34; and the numbers of images on pages in general.)  The biggest win would probably be reducing the number of javascript requests.  Somehow people seem to think there&#39;s some merit to loading javascript which subsequently loads additional javascript.  This adds a tremendous amount of latency to your page load and generates needless network traffic.  Each request has a tremendous amount of overhead - particularly for dynamically-generated javascript.  It&#39;s much better to load all of the javascript you need in a single request or a small handful of requests.  Unfortunately, this is probably a huge lift for a site already designed in this way, but the improved loading time would be a big UX win.Anyway - best of luck to MangaDex!  They&#39;ve clearly put a lot of thought into this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done things at scale (5-10K req/s) on a budget ($1000 USD) and I&#39;ve done things at much smaller scales that required a much larger budget._How_ you hit scale on a budget is one part of the equation. The other part is: what you&#39;re doing.Off the top of my head, the &#34;how&#34; will often involve the following (just to list a few):1 - Baremetal2 - Cache3 - Denormalize4 - Append-only5 - Shard6 - Performance focused clients/api7 - Async / background everythingThese strategies work _really_ well for catalog-type systems: amazon.com, wiki, shopify, spotify, stackoverflow. The list is virtually endless.But it doesn&#39;t take much more complexity for it to become more difficult/expensive.Twitter&#39;s a good example. Forget twitter-scale, just imagine you&#39;ve outgrown what 1 single DB server can do, how do you scale? You can&#39;t shard on the `author_id` because the hot path isn&#39;t &#34;get all my tweets&#34;, the hot path is &#34;get all the tweets of the people I follow&#34;. If you shard on `author_id`, you now need to visit N shards. To optimize the hot path, you need to duplicate tweets into each &#34;recipient&#34; shard so that you can do: &#34;select tweet from tweets where recipient_id = $1 order by created desc limit 50&#34;. But this duplication is never going to be cheap (to compute or store).(At twitter&#39;s scale, even though it&#39;s a simple graph, you have the case of people with millions of followers which probably need special handling. I assume this involves a server-side merge of &#34;tweets from normal people&#34; &amp; RAM[&#34;tweets from the popular people&#34;].)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many manga fans have a love/hate relationship with mangadex. On one hand, it&#39;s provided hosting for countless hours of entertainment over the years. Their &#34;v3&#34; version of the site was basically perfect from a usability point of view, to the point that the entire community chose to unite itself under its flag.On the other hand, directly because of the above, their hasty self-inflicted take down earlier this year nearly killed the entire hobby. Many series essentially stopped updating for the ~5 months the site was down, and many more are likely never coming back again.The decision to suddenly take the site down for a full site rewrite feels completely inexplicable from the outside. (A writeup the above or the previous one[1], both of which read like they were written by a Google Product Manager, especially don&#39;t help as they conspicuously avoid any comment to the one question on everyone&#39;s mind: &#34;leaving aside the supposed security issues with the backend, why on earth also rewrite and redesign the entire front end from scratch at the same time?&#34;)[1] https://mangadex.dev/why-rebuild/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I launched my former bitcoin casino in 2011 (it&#39;s gone, but it was a casino where all games, even roulette tables were multiplayer, on a platform built from scratch starting in &#39;08), I handled all web requests through a server in Costa Rica that cost about $6/mo. Where I had a shell corporation for $250/year. Once the front end -- the bullet containing the entire casino code, about 250kb -- loaded, from Costa Rica, and once a user logged in, they were socketed to a server that handled the gaming action in the Isle of Man. Graphics and sounds were still sent from the Costa Rica server. I didn&#39;t have a gaming license in the IoM, though - that was around $400k to acquire legally. So I found a former IoM MP who was a lawyer, who wrote a letter to the IoM gov&#39;t stating that we didn&#39;t perform random calculations on their server, thus weren&#39;t a gambling site under IoM law. Technically that meant that no dice roll or card shuffle leading to a gambling win or loss took place on that server. So the IoM server handled the socketed user interactions, chat, hand rotation and tournament stuff. Also the bitcoin daemon and deposits/withdrawals. But to avoid casino licensing, I then  set up a VPS in Switzerland that did only one thing: Return random numbers or shuffled decks of cards, with its own RNG. It was a quick backend cUrl call that would return a fresh deck or a dice roll, for any given random interaction on the casino servers. The IoM server would call the Swiss server every time a hand was dealt or a wheel was spun; the user was still looking at a site served from a cheap web host in Costa Rica. And thus... yeah, I guess I handled millions of requests a day over a $6 webserver, if you want to count it that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People tend to severely underestimate how fast modern machines are and overestimate how much you need to spend on hardware.Back in my last startup, I was doing a crypto market intelligence website that subscribed to full trade &amp; order book feeds from the top 10 exchanges.  It handled about 3K incoming messages/second (~260M per day), including all of the message parsing, order book update, processing, streaming to websocket connections on any connected client, and archival to PostGres for historical processing.  Total hardware required was 1 m4.large + 1 r5.large AWS instances, for a bit under $200/month, and the boxes would regularly run at about 50% CPU."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s the point of this post? OP is serving a file at 50req/sec. There is not even mention of a dB query. How is that able to relate to any kind of normal app?I guess that the post was written as an answer to the mangadex post [1]. Mangadex was handling 3k req/sec involving dB queries. It was not just a cached Html page.50req/sec for a Html file is super low which shows that a $4 month server cant do much actually. So yes this is enough for a blog, but a lot of websites are not blogs[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28440742"</p>

Bonus if you opt to answer the door naked and claim you were busy showering/having sex/aligning your chakras/whatever.Any bureaucracy will naturally follow the path of least resistance.  It is your job to make it more painful for them to pursue their goals than it is to leave you alone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These &#34;data disruption warrants&#34; are the most interesting to me:&gt; Data disruption means adding, copying, deleting or altering data held in a computer. This can only be done in order to frustrate the commission of offences or determine relevance of data. To assist disruption, a warrant can also authorise other facilitative activities, such as entering specified premises, using electronic equipment to obtain access to data, removing a computer from premises, copying data that has been obtained, and intercepting if necessary to carry out the things authorised in the warrant. A data disruption warrant also allows the officer to take actions to conceal the access and the activities, allowing the warrant to be conducted covertly.&gt; Data disruption warrants can be used to affect data offshore with the consent of an appropriate consenting foreign official (if the location of data is known or can be reasonably determined). They can also be issued internally in an emergency situation, and subsequently authorised by a Judge or AAT member. They can also permit the officer to seek assistance from a person with knowledge of a computer or a computer system to help in carrying out the warrant.- https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/natio...So they can get a warrant to come into your house while you&#39;re not home and put a keylogger in your keyboard USB cable, or put a bug on the UART of your router, etc. Or just hacking your cheap Netgear router with one of the hundreds of vulnerabilities that exist.Scary shit. Sounds like they&#39;re pretty drunk with power. Does Australia really have a capable offensive security group like the NSA to pull these sorts of things off, though?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve spent a bit of time in Australia. When I compared the caliber of people who worked in tech and venture to those in mining and law enforcement, it was night and day. There’s a TON of smart people at companies like Woodside, and lots of smart people at the Australian Federal Police (to the extent where the US and other countries rely on them for help in tricky technical situations). The tech and VC crowd seemed to get off on the size of a funding round, or how tight they were with the founders of Atlassian, or if they knew some guy from America with a “successful exit,” or other complete nonsense.With a dynamic like that, the law enforcement people are always going to point to the tech and venture people and say to politicians, “are you going to take orders from these clowns, or are you going to listen to us?” And now that you’ve got the climate activists antagonizing the mining companies, who are responsible for a very significant percentage of the economy, you’ve got two extremely savvy and powerful groups working together.If Australian tech people want their government to take them seriously, they’re going to have to act in a manner that is as professional as those at the AFP, and they’re going to have to hit people with an economic hammer that can match the force of mining. Yes, it’s not fair that things are this difficult, but that’s life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of the 2019 Canadian federal election. There was a new party in that election led by a man named Maxime Bernier called the People&#39;s Party. They&#39;re a far-right populist party and generally awful. Bernier himself was running in Beauce, Quebec, which he had represented through the Conservative party since 2006 before he had created the People&#39;s Party.But then the Rhinoceros Party, a satirical political party, announced a new candidate for Beauce named... Maxime Bernier. When asked about the confusion, the Rhinoceros Party&#39;s Maxime Bernier said, &#34;If you&#39;re not sure, then vote for both!&#34;.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/maxime-bernier-rhino...The Conservative candidate won with 22817 votes, the People&#39;s Party candidate came second with 16772, and the Rhinoceros Party candidate came last with 1072 votes and another 1147 were rejected. This left the People&#39;s Party with no seats in parliament."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is driven by narratives—A narrative that college isn’t worth it anymore. A narrative that (white) men are uniformly privileged and life is just easy for them. And a narrative that those men aren’t wanted by society any more.I’m not convinced that all those men need to go to college, but they clearly need something. They need to feel like they’re part of society. Nothing good can come of an entire generation that feels lost, without purpose, and unwanted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Young men get little help, in part, because schools are focused on encouraging historically underrepresented students. Jerlando Jackson, department chair, Education Leadership and Policy Analysis, at the University of Wisconsin’s School of Education, said few campuses have been willing to spend limited funds on male underachievement that would also benefit white men, risking criticism for assisting those who have historically held the biggest educational advantages.”So this is a direct result of the move away from color blind policies, to race based policies.&gt; Keith E. Smith, a mental-health counselor and men’s outreach coordinator at the University of Vermont, said that when he started working at the school in 2006 he found that men were much more likely to face consequences for the trouble they caused under the influence of drugs and alcohol.This is exactly what black students report as racism in school.Seems like evidence that race based policies are just racist.&gt; In 2008, Mr. Smith proposed a men’s center to help male students succeed. The proposal drew criticism from women who asked, “Why would you give more resources to the most privileged group on campus,” he said.
Funding wasn’t appropriated, he said, and the center was never built.Obviously white men are not in fact privileged on university campuses.“Female students in the U.S. benefit from a support system established decades ago, spanning a period when women struggled to gain a foothold on college campuses. There are more than 500 women’s centers at schools nationwide. Most centers host clubs and organizations that work to help female students succeed.”Men are failing because it is the policy not to support them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like this, but I think a reasonable alternative would be that for smart phones older than a certain age the manufacturer publish enough information for the creation of free drivers and software and unlocks for installing that software. One thing that makes me really sad is that I would probably be perfectly fine still using iPhone 5 era hardware if I had a free OS I could put on there with ongoing support. That&#39;s entirely reasonable in the desktop/laptop space so it strikes me as kinda sad that it seems non-existent in phones, when it&#39;s all just computers anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be very nice if this happened.In my view, one other feasible good step would be to require companies to publish the source code of their phones, ie provide the option for people to download, compile and install the full sw stack.

At the very least it would make it easier to support devices than it currently is in third party ROMs"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The good thing about the fact that Atlassian offers both on-prem and cloud versions of their offerings is, everyone is now aware of the awful engineering practices that underpin their products. We have to assume that there are problems of a similar nature in their cloud service, which is way more of a problem considering the number of orgs that depend on the JIRA SaaS offering.Maybe the founders could have used some of that time spent planning a tunnel between their side-by-side $100M houses, or engaged in Twitter rants, to actually bother delivering value to customers. It’s only a matter of time before this product suite is disrupted, and it might represent one of the most obvious low-hanging opportunities in our entire industry.I still remember being in line at a WWDC a few years back, overhearing someone ask a developer, “where do you work?” When the developer responded with “HipChat,” the other person immediately chuckled and said, “oh — Atlassian... I’m sorry” — and then everyone around them also started laughing. It’s amazing that this company continues to fall up, and that the founders have taken on roles as the ruling digital gurus of Australia (shows you why it’s so easy for the government to run circles around the local tech industry and pass whatever laws they want)."</p>

One thing I couldn’t quickly surmise: it looks like your services are centralized and neither servers/spaces (whatever terminology you’re using for logical groupings of communities) nor DMs have support for encryption. Do you have plans to support this? I don’t mean to ask this as a FUD spreader, I just am curious how you differentiate from Discord aside from being open source, and similarly, how you intend to ensure your offering stays open source in perpetuity?"</p>

Other things I&#39;ve wanted:- Instagram with an ML layer that auto-rejects pics with faces or text. Landscapes, vistas, animals, architecture etc all would be welcome.- high latency Twitter, where no post is viewable until at least 2 weeks after it&#39;s published. Bickering threads become impractical. People learn to post stuff that will be worth caring about later.- Clearly just for entertainment and not information Facebook alternative, in which GPT bots produce a significant fraction of posts, impersonating users and making stuff up. Everyone quickly learns you can&#39;t trust it, but it can still be cute/fun/humorous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, podman-apple-silicon developer here! I want to share some FAQs about this project. :)Q: Does this run amd64 docker images or aarch64 docker images?A: aarch64 images currently, but I&#39;m going to patch podman to make it possible to run both amd64 image and aarch64 image. All I have to do for this is to make QEMU call and Linux image configurable, so it won&#39;t be very hard. However, if you are running amd64 images, you will have to bear the performance overhead due to CPU emulation.Q: Is this toy or are you actually going to maintain this?A: I&#39;m DevOps engineer and I made podman-apple-silicon to actually use this in my day job.Q: Are you going to merge this to the upstream?A: I&#39;ll keep trying, but it won&#39;t be easy unless QEMU merges Alex Graf&#39;s Hypervisor.framework patch.I may forgot to check HackerNews, so please feel free to ask me anything about podman-apple-silicon at https://twitter.com/simnalamburt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangentially, I wonder if Moby underestimated the amount of human hours that were instantly allocated to alternatives as soon as they announced Docker Desktop was going paid. (I don&#39;t know if this project is a consequence of that announcement or not.)Hopefully Podman will be able to capitalize on this event and get the polish needed for widespread use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the real nice thing here is having a formula for QEMU with the ARM patch applied: https://github.com/simnalamburt/qemu/tree/hvfWith this I believe you could also used [nerd](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) instead of podman but I haven&#39;t tested it yet.Edit: It works. Had a bit of trouble since I wanted to uninstall the &#34;real&#34; QEMU first, but `lima` still depended on it, and then installing the patched QEMU needed to update the version of `lima` I had installed, which then tried to reinstall QEMU, which failed because of some symlinks which were now owned by the patched QEMU..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand the points about having to comply with laws. But what is is unjustifiable is my view is that their marketing does not match the reality. They probably did some A/B testing and saw that keeping vague promises about not tracking users increases conversion rate. You, as an HN reader, being in the top 0.1% of the population in terms of tech-savviness, may be able to read through the nonsense and understand how little it means when they say &#34;by default, we do not keep any IP logs&#34;. But the other 99.9% of the population won&#39;t understand it, and that&#39;s why their marketing strategy works: they are selling a level of privacy that does not exist to customers who do not know better without technically lying.Their threat model and all threat scenarios should be front and centre on their front page and sign up page. That is if they care about user privacy not just the bottom line. They have a choice between better-informed customers or more money, and so far, they have chosen the latter.What this and the new Apple debacle have proven to me is that privacy is not a product that can be purchased. If you want real privacy, you have spend a lot of time learning how to preserve your privacy. No matter what Apple and ProtonMail and similar companies tell you, you cannot buy privacy off-the-shelf."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They claim to have exceptionally good Tor support, when in reality people have (rightly) been screaming at them for years now to fix their permabroken Tor signup flow.1. It&#39;s impossible to create a paid account with cryptocurrency: You can only use it to pay for an existing account2. It&#39;s impossible to anonymously create any account over Tor: You have to at least pass SMS / secondary email verification, and it better not be an easy to get address (&#34;Email verification temporarily disabled for this email domain&#34; etc.)Lots of marketing and boxticking (.onion: check), but it looks curiously hostile to anonymity if you actually try to use it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"According to MSN [1], the DEA decided last week to give him his money back.They kept the money for 200 days, in violation of the Federal statute requiring the DEA to file a case within 90 days. It&#39;s unclear what, if any, repercussions there will be for the DEA for violating the law. Astoundingly, the Nevada Highway Patrol did not violate the law. That only means, of course, it&#39;s a terrible law and needs to be eliminated. Hopefully there will be some consequences for police that abuse this bad law, but that will have to come from local voters.Note that $87k in 100&#39;s is a stack about 4&#34; thick. It sickens me to hear people blaming the victim for the non-crime of holding his own cash, with bank receipts, and for the non-crime of simply telling the officer the truth and being totally cooperative. The lesson here is clear: do not cooperate with the police. They are not your friend, they are not trustworthy, and they will hurt you, badly, and suffer no consequences.1 - https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/marine-veteran-suing-nh..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Veteran never learned: Don&#39;t talk to the cops. &#34;Am I being detained? Am I free to go?&#34; Is all he needs to say.&#34;So when the officer asked him about carrying cash, Stephen said “yes.” When the officer asked to search his car, he said “yes.” And when the officer asked about the source of the cash, Stephen showed him over two years’ worth of bank receipts. Stephen did everything he was told, and answered every question he was asked.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve supported IJ for years and watched them fight these civil forfeiture cases onesey-twosey, but I really don&#39;t understand why they haven&#39;t gotten to SCOTUS and why something so blatantly against the constitution is allowed to stand (among many things, I know, but...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GoodReads is all but dead for many. A few months ago, they deprecated their API keys (without notice).I started building a GoodReads-equivalent but realized that many people care more about learning from multiple media formats (blogs, videos, research  papers, interactive explorables, podcasts, courses etc) rather than simply reading books. Because there are too many projects attempting to build a new GoodReads, I ended up building something more oriented for multimedia learners.It’s up and running, open-source, built with Ruby on Rails and supports protocols like ActivityPub, RSS etc. There is a companion browser extension, integration with Slack groups, Twitter and more, and a WIP mobile app. Like GoodReads, you can build your learning lists and embed them on your sites.It participates in fediverse so your reviews can be broadcasted to your followers on Mastodon, PeerTube etc but full federation is not yet there because it has an underlying knowledge graph that will need to be synchronised across instances.I think many HN users may be interested in checking it out:https://learnawesome.org/https://github.com/learn-awesome/learn"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What exactly is wrong with Goodreads? I keep hearing a lot of hate about it, but the reasons seem never expanded on.I use Goodreads to maintain a public bookshelf of books I have read or want to read. It&#39;s also nice that I can check what my friends are reading. Occasionally it&#39;s nice to read other people&#39;s views on a book. I typically tend not to agree, but it&#39;s nice that these exist.That&#39;s it. Isn&#39;t that what Goodreads is about? Seems like a nice website and perfectly suited for what it does. Am I missing something?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very excited to see a decentralized alternative to Amazon-owned Goodreads &amp; LibraryThing, the latter which I recently learned is 40%-owned by Amazon through a subsidiary AbeBooks.I&#39;m not too familiar with the fediverse model. I noticed that registration is closed on the primary instance bookwyrm.social.[1] Is the ideal use case of bookwyrm for each user to host their own instance? Like this one: https://book.dansmonorage.blue/As a user, I wouldn&#39;t want to sign up on someone&#39;s hobbyist bookwyrm instance only for them to shut it down later and lose all my data.1. https://docs.joinbookwyrm.com/instances.html"</p>

Sci-hub and libgen are like an entirely different internet, one allowing you to dive as deep as you wish into any technical subject. There’s really no comparison I have found anywhere for the depth of material available. People always point to Wikipedia, but all of that is surface level. If you to build something, research something, or just really delve into it, there’s no substitute for having access to all of the latest textbooks, manuals, and papers. I’ve never found any source paid or otherwise that comes even close."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Torrent seeding effort: https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/nc27fv/rescue_...All papers on sci-hub are available as torrents from library genesis. The full collection contains 85 million articles (before this announcement), and is about 80TB. If anything ever happens to sci-hub or library genesis, there&#39;s enough people out there with backups that a replacement can be set up fairly quickly, albeit without the proxy functionality to obtain new papers.However, the more the merrier, so if you&#39;ve got some spare hardware and bandwidth to share, I&#39;d encourage you to contribute to the seeding effort if you&#39;re able. At current market prices of ~$30/TB, it costs ~$2400 to have a copy of the full collection sitting on your desk."</p>

Here we are in 2021, we now have Alexandra&#39;s library, which rivals the first in size and scope, and there are at least as many forces trying to burn it. But fortunately this one is digital and you too can have a copy in your hallway closet for the price of some harddrives and bandwidth.Go make a backup, if you can afford it, and let&#39;s make sure that this one sticks around."</p>

Maybe in 2018 it was good enough. But in 2021 it&#39;s not. Come on, Protonmail, you&#39;re supposed to be leading the way  -- don&#39;t make me figure it out myself.Replace immediately with &#34;By default we don&#39;t log IP, but may be required to by local law enforcement. We recommend everyone connect through Protonmail through Tor. This month, 60% of our users connected through Tor&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m aware that this is a very silly sounding question, but I’m very confused about what’s going on here.If the subject of this investigation had been using ProtonVPN to connect to ProtonMail, would this have (in a marginal way) protected their anonymity? If ProtonMail can be compelled to begin logging, surely the same must be said of ProtonVPN right?It’s interesting how many “privacy focused” companies tout being based in Switzerland as some big badge of honor, which a layman consumer such as myself is supposed to be really impressed by due to the overall reputation of “Swiss privacy laws.”In practice, I’ve never been to Switzerland. I don’t know any person that has had any legal issues there, let alone someone that’s litigated a digital privacy case there. I do not speak German or French, and don’t know where to start when it comes to looking up specific cases or court proceedings, so I’d be extremely slow on the uptake of the actual ins and outs of how the Swiss privacy model works from a practical standpoint.The “based in Switzerland” thing strikes me as a bit of a black box bit of marketing speak. How much time, energy and money did ProtonMail expend fighting this surreptitious logging mandate? Does “Swiss privacy” actualy mean anything if ProtonMail is happy to hand over your IP address when spooked?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I have a ProtonMail account that I pay for.I have seen a ton of disturbing pieces about ProtonMail. Every time I&#39;ve looked into them, they seem to be maliciously motivated and usually not true, or otherwise twisting of the truth. This has been a confusing thing for me because why is there a small subset of people so vehemently against them?In this case, I&#39;m not surprised. They say quite clearly they can be compelled to collect IP addresses - including in the linked tweet. This seems like a pretty clear cut case of them being compelled to provide an IP address. What the authorities can&#39;t do, is read that person&#39;s email. And that&#39;s what I and others pay for.I&#39;m not sure what there is to be upset about here? Other than perhaps France prosecuting this individual to begin with? If we had faith that ProtonMail wouldn&#39;t hand over anything to the government, why would anyone even care about having encrypted emails?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amen to this. Two case studies from the UK I&#39;ve been thinking about recently:1) Visiting London and spending time in South Kensington - walking back to hotel at night, only about 30% of houses had any lights on. Suggestion is the others are effectively uninhabited, and a search on RightMove shows properties sell for £20-£30m for a 4/5 bed. This isn&#39;t normal Londoners, it&#39;s outside investment.2) Cornwall, where I live - an insane house price rise over lockdown as city dwellers aim for the beautiful bits of the country. Literally no way now you could afford your first home round here on minimum wage, and some towns have a high (&gt;50) % holiday or second homes.It&#39;s an untenable situation. I think my generation (I&#39;m nearly 50) are probably the last to be able to afford their own home on anything other than a massive wage.Round here in Cornwall the jobs are things like surf instructor, supermarket worker, barperson, etc. That&#39;s not gonna stretch to the local house prices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is desperately needed. And not just in the major cities; this is happening in every Dutch town. Amsterdam may have prices beyond absurd, but the whole nation is burdened by this problem.In the street I live in the capital of the northern province of Fryslân (Frisia) most homes are owned by their inhabitants, but in the past few years we&#39;ve seen several houses being bought by small-time investors (who already own their own home of course, are financially well on their way, and are looking for ways to save their saving from low interest rates and inflation), who charge renters four times what my fellow homeowners and I pay for mortgage.You never get to know the renters, because they are really only here for as long as nothing better comes along (like buying a house or social housing), and who can blame them?Meanwhile maintenance of these houses is minimal, because the market won&#39;t really reward proper upkeep at this point; they can always sell the house for an insane price tomorrow.It&#39;s really upsetting to see my younger colleagues stuck renting a flat, while I own my house having even paid of the vast majority of the mortgage simply because I had the luck of buying it in 2013 (a major dip in the market where paying less than the listed price was common).For the good of society we need to put a stop to this type of speculation on the housing market."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Members of a hacking group linked to the Chinese government called APT 5 hijacked the NSA algorithmJust wanted to acknowledge how brilliant that is. They could have made any other code change, but it was genius using NSA&#39;s own backdoor.NSA advocated for that backdoor to be included in the standards. The US government then would be embarrassed and would want to cover up any issues related to it, including the fact that it was taken over by someone else!Gotta wonder what that Monday morning meeting was like at the NSA when they realized what had happened."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A finer point often missed on HN is how different publishing is across fields. In physics i have always been able post preprints to the web/arXiv and leave them up indefinitely. Their scientific content is identical to the journal formatted version and they show up in search often before the paid version. This is true even for the historically worst offenders (i.e. Elsevier)Last I heard the situation in chemistry was still completely different. The ACS is also known for bullying cash strapped college libraries into exorbitant and unnecessary journal subscriptions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, everyone uses scihub (and author websites, etc) from time to time.A related question is &#34;who pays the per-paper fee&#34;.  Well, not me, and none of my colleagues.  However, I&#39;ve learned that the fees do get paid, but not by individuals. Rather, it&#39;s libraries that are paying, to fulfil interlibrary loan requests for papers in journals with high subscription costs and low readerships.  If the number of requests times the price per request is lower than the yearly subscription cost, this can be the only way to stay within budget.Where I work, research grants let me cover journal &#34;page charges&#34;, but they do not let me subscribe to journals, nor contribute to the library budget.  This has always struck me as crazy, for the yearly cost of many journals is under the cost of publishing a single paper.  Heck, we have researchers publishing in the journal of whatever, paying several tens of thousands of dollars per year ... and our library cannot afford to subscribe, so we can see our work.Yes, you read that right: in many cases, authors have to pay to publish, and then pay again to read.Some progress is being made, though. Many granting agencies now encourage researchers to publish in open-access mode. That would seem great, except that they did not increase grants to compensate for the extra cost.  Money spent on those fees is money that cannot go to support graduate students.As others have noted (here, and in dozens or hundreds of similar discussion threads), things are different from field to field.  I work in a field where it&#39;s just as important to read old papers as new ones. That means that the solution of authors posting to their websites is not always viable.  Probably a third of the papers I read (in support of teaching) are from people who died long before the web got started."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why would anyone not do this? Do people enjoy enriching copyright monopolists by paying hundreds of dollars for 24h access to one paper that may or may not have dubious methodology? That&#39;s fucking stupid and these paid journals can&#39;t go bankrupt soon enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the article: &#34;Suzuki says that although he used computer software for the design, the simulation of its motion was entirely in his head only, and that seeing it take shape was a major motivation.&#34;&#34;Then I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind.
...
My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get an idea I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no difference whatever, the results are the same. In this way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything. &#34; - From Nikola Tesla&#39;s Autobiography &#34;My Inventions&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is something similar (&#34;useless&#34; complex machine made from wood) that somebody made to create music:&#34;Wintergatan - Marble Machine (music instrument using 2000 marbles)&#34;https://youtu.be/IvUU8joBb1QThe video shows the details pretty well too, and the piece being played is of quite good quality. One can see that the machine can just play a pre-configured song, but the operator can add and/or change a lot while running it to create variations of that pre-configured song. The machine is programmable, so that song could be changed."</p>

The clock reportedly kept near perfect time for decades.https://youtu.be/hbQF-kt4B5M"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always amazed by how so much Minecraft innovation is driven entirely by hobbyists. For years Minecraft was unplayable on many machines without the Optifine plugin. Even with a huge corporation behind it, Microsoft didn&#39;t build the capacity for large-scale servers, and the very large paid servers seem to use region based sharding with portals. This project is truly exciting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of weeks ago I made https://playmcnow.com with the opposite idea - have many super lightweight servers for small groups of players. Instead of saying to friends “register to digital ocean, pay $5 and get a Minecraft box”, I can host thousands of worlds for them.I made a custom minecraft proxy (similar to bungeecord but A LOT less resource intensive) that starts the real server when someone attempts to connect to it.200 lines of go for the proxy and about as much for the http front end in django :)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Their content quality is worse than ours. They seem focused on home video/community space while we want to be more like iTunes/TV&#34;16 years later, home video is still the core value of YouTube, yet they are still trying to push overproduced shows and TV while mistreating original creators.It&#39;s literally killing the golden goose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, if unsurprising, to see that a large factor in the interest in YouTube was based purely on location, as well as knowledge of the people working there, their backgrounds, and who specifically they were funded by.Where you are and who you know often outweighs having the best product, features, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So basically the only reason they were considering YouTube was to either deny it to their competition, or force their competition to pay more for it.It sounds like they expected it to die on a backroom shelf somewhere if they made the purchase. This seems anti-competitive behavior even during what might otherwise be viewed as their &#34;don&#39;t be evil&#34; phase. They didn&#39;t see it as valuable for their own needs, they just didn&#39;t want it to grow into competition itself or via another competitor and so considered buying it to let it die."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty amazing when you think about it. When I was a child, 200 years seemed like an eternity (I was born near the US bicentennial, and the founding of the US was like ancient history to me). Now, nearing 50, 200 years ago is just about 4 of my lifespans. In just 4 of my lifespans (and I don&#39;t even feel that old), we went from rudimentary electric motors to all the amazing technology we have at our fingertips today. Truly astounding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, sort of. Faraday invented the first thing that would sort of rotate given electrical power. It took another 33 years before someone built something that had useful torque at the output shaft. Along the way, coils and commutators had to be developed. It also took a while to realize that generators and motors are basically the same.Rotating electrical machinery was considered a solved problem and kind of boring until about 20 years ago. Then people started using semiconductor switches to drive electric motors. Classic theory assumed you were driving motors with a sine wave. Motor controllers tried to make motors happy by providing a sine wave, or something close to one. Gradually it was realized that motors could be purpose designed for chopped waveforms. This broke all that beautiful closed-form math and charts on polar graph paper that goes back to Tesla. You have to simulate to design a modern electric car motor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At heart, Faraday was an experimentalistThis is often repeated, but I think it&#39;s a misleading label. Faraday doesn&#39;t get nearly enough credit for his theoretical prowess -- probably because he didn&#39;t develop his theories mathematically. But I would say his mental model of nature was far more accurate than most of his peers, mathematical or not, and that understanding is what guided him to groundbreaking discovery after groundbreaking discovery. He developed his experiments to confirm his own theoretical predictions, often predictions that no theoretical physicsts were making at the time; for example, the Faraday effect (that magnetism can rotate the polarization of light in a material), Faraday&#39;s law (the electromagnetic one), and Faraday&#39;s law (the chemical one)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 10 years ago my wife and I got two recues. A female greyhound and a male lurcher (who basically looked like a greyhound). My wife used to try to get our dogs to howl, because she thought it was funny. It turned into something they would do on command. Anyway, about 8 years ago my wife discovered the song &#34;Werewolves of London&#34; by Warren Zevon. At the appropriate parts of the song, she would command our dogs to &#34;sing&#34;, and they&#39;d both howl. Yes, hilarious. Anyway, about 7 years ago the greyhound got osteosarcoma, a painful bone cancer, and we had to put her to sleep. The lurcher was extremely lonely, so we rescued another greyhound. My wife didn&#39;t put the Werewolves song on again, because it made her feel sad. Fast forward about a year, and we&#39;re both in the house doing whatever, and I put on a playlist, not realising the song was in it. As soon as the first bar of the song played, the lurcher jumped up onto the armchair at our front window, frantically looking into the park out front, howled, and ran around the house &#34;searching&#34;, presumably for Pasha. Tears, obviously. But also the realisation that a dog can recognise a song, years after last hearing it, in a sea of thousands of other songs. And within the first few seconds of it playing. Honestly, I was astonished."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many pet owners have seen this behaviour, and what I find note worthy too is that that trauma can be easily detected when the animal doesn&#39;t react according to intention.Anecdotically, I adopted a mistreated dog this year. He&#39;s a really good boy, and shows the exact same behaviour the paper states regarding accidental interactions in general. But if you are for example brooming and slightly touch him, he immediately hides and may even piss himself. It seems to me that he was beaten up with some kind of stick when he was just a puppy. Poor boy :("</p>
