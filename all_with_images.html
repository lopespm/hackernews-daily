								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata (only because I don&#39;t have access to the data anymore). Customer satisfaction is so much higher when they get a one click unsubscribe. In fact, when the friction is so low, the customer is likely to start the subscription back.I say this as someone who worked in customer service automation. The worst customer satisfaction score with lowest rate of re-subscription is from companies that make it hell to unsubscribe.I&#39;ve seen customers send messages like &#34;Cancel and refund immediately!&#34; Since our response was ai driven, we cancel and refund no questions asked in less then a minute (we do fraud check in the background). Many times you get a response back from the customer apologizing for their tone and praising the product. Some of them restart the subscription a cycle or two later.When you make it hard to cancel, you lose customers on the long term. Make it easy, in fact make it friendly. Unless you are selling a shady product, there is no reason to believe customers won&#39;t come back.Edit: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; including an option that’s “at least as easy” as the one to subscribeWeirdly enough this sounds like a loophole.I can already see some companies trying to bullshit their way through an investigation: &#34;Oh sure, we don&#39;t provide online cancellation, because our way to cancel is even easier than online:&#34; *presents a way to cancel that is in practice more difficult than online*.I think either mandating that cancelling must be possible using the same workflow as subscription or more clearly defining what &#34;easy&#34; means would be important."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"California SB-313 (https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtm...) was passed in 2018 and has this requirement:&#34;... a consumer who accepts an automatic renewal or continuous service offer online shall be allowed to terminate the automatic renewal or continuous service exclusively online, which may include a termination email formatted and provided by the business that a consumer can send to the business without additional information.&#34;But I have one recent anecdote that suggests this language is not specific enough to lead to a very good outcome.I had a SiriusXM subscription for my car, and paid $52.21 for the past 12 months of service. And they wanted to renew me for something in the ballpark of $20/month ($240/year). I absolutely hate that business practice and having to go talk to them to negotiate a better rate, otherwise they auto-renew you for a much worse rate than you were already on.So I went to cancel. There is no click to cancel option. You have to call or do online chat. I think the online chat is how they can say they follow California law.It still took me about 30+ minutes to actually cancel the service, because the person responding to the chat has to run through a script to try to retain you. First they want to know if you are enjoying the service. Then they want to know what stations you like. Then it&#39;s &#34;I&#39;ll switch you to this new plan that&#39;s only $12/month, can I go ahead and do that?&#34;All the while I&#39;m telling them that the reason I&#39;m cancelling is that they tried to auto-renew me to a much higher rate, and now they are making it super hard to cancel, which makes me want to cancel more.So I had to go round and round insisting I wanted to cancel. Never did they offer me anything close to the previous rate I was paying. Though I see now that if I re-enabled my subscription I&#39;d get close to that rate again for 6 months. But for a service that I only use when I don&#39;t have good cell phone coverage, and the annual time waste they put me through to avoid over paying... It&#39;s not worth it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based on all the dumbfounded and cynical replies, I don&#39;t think people understand why this is happening.Anybody saying this is a response to recent anti-trust headlines doesn&#39;t understand how a company the size of Apple works. When an announcement like this is made, it means this program has been in the works for YEARS.My guess, this is all part of Apple&#39;s slow shift towards a recurring revenue services model, and a better integration of customer &amp; business incentives.It used to be, the worst thing that could happen to Apple was the customer stops upgrading their phone.But now, when the revenue growth is coming from services instead of hardware, it doesn&#39;t pay to piss off customers by making them buy a new phone a year early because the battery died.The worst thing that can happen now under this new business model is the customer leaves the ecosystem or buys less services because they aren&#39;t happy with the hardware.Hence why you&#39;re seeing Apple do things they never would have before. Capitulating on the MacBook Pro and rolling back on the Touch Bar, opening up to more repairability, etc. etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for the tangent, but I&#39;m sad to see even Apple is now pumping out terrible Alegria corporate art.In 10 years people are going to look back on all this terrible art and wonder what the hell every tech company was thinking.There&#39;s even a subreddit dedicated to hating the Alegria trend: https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckalegriaart/top/?t=all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What?!I was completely blindsided by this. I do regular laptop and smartphone repairs for friends and family and getting original parts often is difficult or even impossible. There are many scammers around that will sell &#34;original OEM&#34; i.e. cheap knock-off trash.Ebay is OK-ish for second hand parts but sometimes you are just out of luck.I&#39;m pretty excited about this, to say the least."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recent major threads on this:Microsoft to Block Windows 11 Browser Workarounds - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29201027 - Nov 2021 (105 comments)You can no longer bypass  microsoft-edge:// links using apps like EdgeDeflector - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29191244 - Nov 2021 (171 comments)This is a lot more obvious once we change the URL from the submitted one (https://www.howtogeek.com/768727/microsoft-calls-firefoxs-br...) to the article it&#39;s copying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is this even worth it to MS?Do they really expect people who go through the effort of installing a third party browser and setting it as default to switch back to Edge because of the grand experience they had with it when Windows opened some help article in it?How much money do they make of the 0.000001% of users who do the above?How much money do they lose because of the reputation damage and increased regulator attention because of it?I cannot think of any scenario where, money wise, this is a net positive for MS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft’s reasoning is that features like search is an end to end experience. That’s odd to me — it just opens a web page. Is there anything special about it being in Edge that we don’t notice?I mean, obviously it’s BS, but are there PMs who actually think it’s better for the user to override the default browser for things like this? A side note: one frustrating aspect of this problem is that my browser extensions are never installed in Edge. So things like password autofill in a lot of the MS auth flows (which appear to be web-based, as far as I can tell) just don’t work"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My daughter has this as an school assignment, with some implication that it is some sort of a contest, and we managed to grow quite a few of similar quality to the seed crystals on the site in 4 days, which was the original (poorly thought IMO) deadline. 
The trouble is that no one else was able or cared to do it so fast, so the deadline has been slipping for a couple weeks now, with our best crystals going to school and back a few times, getting scratches and broken bits instead of nicely growing undisturbed. 
A bit discouraging. I&#39;m now remembering how frustrating was for me to take school related things too seriously and discover you cared more than your teachers when I was her age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an organic chemist, growing crystals was of paramount importance for certain structure determinations using X-ray crystallography (to answer &#34;did I really prepare what I think I prepared?&#34;)With sensitive compounds, sometimes you can&#39;t just let things evaporate. Also as the article states, weather conditions might mess you up.
IMO the coolest trick we had to solve this was osmosis of an anti-solvent into a saturated solution.A small sealed container with a saturated solution of your compound/salt is punctured, and put in a bigger sealed container containing a worse but miscible solvent for the compound under study. Slow diffusion into the inner container causes very reproducible crystal growth, as long as you can control the temperature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is worth reading purely for the writing alone. Scott Alexander is a treasure:&gt; As best I can tell, this is some kind of Egyptian trial. It might or might not be an RCT; it says stuff like “Patients were self-allocated to the treatment groups; the first 3 days of the week for the intervention arm while the other 3 days for symptomatic treatment”. Were they self-allocated in the sense that they got to choose? Doesn’t that mean it’s not random? Aren’t there seven days in a week? These are among the many questions that Elalfy et al do not answer for us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While reading this piece I got a little depressed that most journalism is just such utter trash compared to it. I&#39;ve read so many articles on ivermectin and none of them gave me even ten percent of the clarity that this article gave me. Can you imagine if writing and journalism of this calibre was commonplace among practising &#34;journalists&#34;? And look at how this piece compares to the CDC&#39;s and WHO&#39;s science communication. It&#39;s a shame that clear thinking and communication is so scarce."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real story (in my opinion) behind Ivermectin are the studies not being conducted. Here you have a ton of studies claiming to have found benefit with a worldwide, massively available drug that has practically zero risks for most people (and it&#39;s an extremely well understood drug) and we don&#39;t have first world countries conducting RCTs to understand it better.So you have to ask yourself - when do we get high quality RCTs, who funds them and why? This to me is a clear cut indicator that we have very maligned incentives for health science. How can we be this far into a global pandemic, with all of this funding and not have multiple high quality RCTs on this drug? It&#39;s sad to say the least. Even if Ivermectin ends up being fairly weak or completely ineffective - surely there&#39;s something to learn here..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of an amazing implosion all at once on Twitter. The OBS Project accused Streamlabs of this after another streaming company, Lightstream, noted that Streamlabs had copy-and-pasted a marketing page from their product to use for Streamlabs&#39; product, down to word-for-word copies of the &#34;user&#34; recommendations.https://twitter.com/Lightstream/status/1460709404609757185And, also in that thread, El Gato -- makers of the hardware Stream Deck -- chimed in with a wry &#34;know that feel,&#34; showing that &#34;Streamlabs Stream Deck&#34; was, let&#39;s say, strongly reminiscent of their product.https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1460722403261046789"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know, I&#39;ll admit that this is ignorance on my end, but I honestly thought that Streamlabs was the owner of OBS, in that OBS was just an internal project that they open sourced.Clearly I&#39;m wrong but I doubt I&#39;m the only person who thought that.  Seems like they&#39;re being douchebags if they&#39;re just taking the offensive and filing predatory trademarks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this is true, the detail that sticks out to me is that before the legal filings StreamLabs thought to reach out about using the name. If StreamLabs thought the names were similar enough that they reached out about using the name, that proves that even from their own former perspective, they&#39;re using a mark that was already recognized in the industry and similar enough to their own mark - surely consumers could have the same perspective (many in the comments here were already confused). They also can&#39;t claim ignorance. Why should they expect trademark law to now protect the name for them?The same thing apparently happened with Meta: http://meta.company/."</p>

  ffmpeg -i &#39;frames/%6d.png&#39; -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 15 crf15.webm

To my eye, crf15 is very very good quality, but I included lossless encoding so there can be no quibble about quality differences :)And yes I know Safari can&#39;t do VP9 but there&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t also encode a HEVC and AV1 version and list multiple &lt;source&gt; elements and let the browser decide which format it prefersedit to the edit: It seems that smoothly scrubbing through a &lt;video&gt; element is more tricky than I originally knew.  Still, a lot of mileage could be gained by encoding the individual frames as AVIF or WebP and using them in supported browsers"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At my last job, I found our code review process was terribly slow and set about analyzing it and coming up with solutions.  I found a lot of developers were blocked on reviews.  They either task switched (expensive) or babysat their review (expensive).  Even though we were using Phab, few did stacked commits because of how unfamiliar the tools were which made them feel brittle.Improving the stacked workflow is one part of the equation but I&#39;d recommend being careful of letting that mask other problemsI identified a series of busy-waits including:- Post, wait, CI failure, fix, post- Post: wait for reviewer, ping reviewer, wait, find feedback was posted, fix, postSome of the root causes included:- Developers weren&#39;t being pinged when the ball was in their court (as author or reviewer)- Well, some notifications happened, but review groups were so noisy no one looked- The shared responsibility of review groups is everyone assumed someone else would look.- The tools we were using made it hard to identify active conversationsMy ideal solution:- Auto-assign reviewers from a review group, allowing shared responsibility of the code base while keeping individual accountability of reviews- Review tools that ping the person the review is blocked on when they are ready to act- Review tools that give a reminder after a set period of time- Azure DevOps&#39; tracking of conversation state with filtering (and toggling between original code and the &#34;fixed&#34; version)- Auto-merge-on-green-checks (including reviewer sign off)With this, responses are timely without people polling the service, letting machines micro-manage the process rather than humans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This idea isn&#39;t new, and if you&#39;ve worked at a company like Facebook, Google, Uber, Dropbox, or Lyft (among others), you&#39;ve either had first-class support for stacked changes built into your code review platform (i.e. Phabricator at Facebook...Phabricator got a lot of stuff about code review right (I may be biased from working at FAANG). I&#39;m happy to see someone trying to improve the code review situation on GitHub. When I did use GitHub at the startups I worked at, we were never fully satisfied with the code review experience.I hope they surface &#34;Phabricator versions&#34; as first-class objects. I never liked it how GitHub just clobbers the history left behind from force-pushes from to branch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actual observed problem in the article is that the team&#39;s SDLC pipeline can&#39;t handle the current flow it&#39;s being subjected to. Work is getting &#34;blocked&#34; in code review.Devising a coping mechanism for developers so that they can increase the inbound flow to an already overloaded system is not actually a solution.The real solution to this rather common problem is to introduce a culture where &#34;done&#34; means &#34;shipped&#34; and not &#34;I created a bunch of PRs for my team mates to read and while they all do that Im gonna create some more&#34; and to use tech where you can to increase the flow the SDLC pipeline can handle.This involves things like moving as much &#34;code review&#34; into the compiler/linter as you can, do a little more design/consensus building upfront, streamline all acceptance testing and deployment steps to their bare essentials etc...https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back, not too long ago, I started working on a new contract assignment at a medium size aerospace manufacturer.I show up and check in with IT department. The system administrator shows me to my desk, and hands me a post it note with my password.  Well pass phrase is more like it.  It was something like “sliding down the tall building”.I was quite impressed that they encouraged the use of long pass phrases instead of short cryptic passwords that are hard to remember (think “correct horse battery staple”).  This place really is serious about security, I thought.I thanked the system admin and causally said “I’ll be sure to change this to an equally secure pass phrase”.“Oh no,” he said, “we don’t allow people to change their passwords here. You see, we need to be able to log into anyone’s computer if they go on vacation or are out of the office, so we keep an Excel worksheet with everyone’s username and password. So please don’t change your password.”He turns and walks away, and I just sit there stunned, wondering if this was some kind of practical joke.Sadly he was completely serious.  I kept the password they gave me for the 3 months I was there, as I was asked to do, knowing that at any time someone could log in as me and do something illegal or unethical. It really did give me a bit of anxiety."</p>

I really didn&#39;t expect it to resonate with so many and I am so happy (and slightly terrified) that it did.

As a developer, it&#39;s easy to spend all your time on your pet project and think it&#39;s free and there&#39;s no harm. I fall for that all the time. But it&#39;s never free and yes, there is actual harm. Think of all the other projects you never launched. All the moments with loved ones you never had.Using creativity instead of all your time is just like using an elegant algorithm* instead of brute-forcing it.Notes:* I am a (primarily) front-end developer, don&#39;t know a single algorithm** Thanks @jeremylevy for sharing my story here, I would never dare to"</p>

How did he get restaurants to sign on and trust him enough to prepare food for 1 month without payout? Assuming &#34;based on existing relationships&#34; I have to wonder his former employer didn&#39;t care about taking his rolodex and directly poaching customers? What about couriers? How did they handle &#34;no couriers available&#34; or a spike in demand? If someone places a delivery order and it turns out there&#39;s no one to deliver it in the next hour, that&#39;s a problem. What about disputes, refunds, missing items, &#34;this isn&#39;t what I ordered&#34; etc.? The all-cash nature of the business makes clear this was not a US based business where that would likely have been a non-starter.Very cool story but it&#39;s hard for me to really understand it without knowing how the business actually worked and made money. I assume it was a very different market from USA and so economics are very different (cheaper labor, less regulation etc.). Would love to know the name of the business to see the outcome."</p>

I feel like the core of the article can be summarized into this:Air transport is still more expensive than shipping. But the magnitude is less than it used to be. This is because shipping is seeing bottlenecks and surcharges to handle the bottlenecks. Therefore it makes the more expensive air transport ok to use especially with time sensitive holiday purchases coming up.If that sounds right, almost all that comes from the last few sentences in the article."</p>

How this makes any sense in terms of efficiency is totally beyond me.As a side note, I&#39;m mildly paranoid about new Apple devices spending a week held up in Chinese customs.

I implemented it in react hooks which wasn’t natively built into react so I used preact which had the newest feature set. If anything did hackerrank use my work to seed their tests? I see that as the likelihood. Also it could be because I used the text copy from the contracting job that asked me to create a leaderboard in the readme. In truth it could be either but this has become yet another pitch fork into a very difficult time where I have no job or money to do anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hackerrank also records videos and takes random screenshots of you when you are taking a tests.Unfortunately recruiters don’t inform about this in advance so that one could know about the privacy policy. When you are taking the test you’ve to give those permissions.I think those images can be seen by literally anyone at recruiting company (and then I guess at Hackerrank as well).edit: Context https://www.hackerrank.com/products/free-trial-search"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Goals masquerading as strategy is an incredibly common problem. Good Strategy Bad Strategy is my favorite treatment of the problem. Unfortunately a lot of executives don’t like to be told they are suppose to take responsibility for strategy. Here is an article length version from the author: https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-cor..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my issues with OKRs is the oft-repeated line that the goals should be so audacious that you should only expect to achieve about 70% of them.If you&#39;re following this advice, you are either purposefully choosing goals that you do not know how to achieve, which is a problem, or purposefully choosing goals whose achievement relies on way too many externalities over which you have little control, which is a problem.I&#39;m not saying external factors shouldn&#39;t be considered, or that we should only set goals that are within comfortable reach.Rather, I&#39;m saying the uncertainty should be accounted for differently. It should be baked into our goals, not treated as if it only matters at the OKR level.Imagine if you were to plan a sprint, and your story points did not factor in uncertainty at all. Then, you committed to a sprint size that also did not take into account uncertainty. But your stakeholders agreed that a 30% sprint failure rate was acceptable.Now imagine baking in uncertainty into your estimates and then committing to a sprint size you can realistically hit. Add stretch goals if you want. Doesn&#39;t that seem more sensible?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think of Steven Covey&#39;s &#34;Begin with the End in Mind&#34;.There really are some metrics that are strategic.  But when your manager is asked to have 20 OKRs just because your manager has to have 20 OKRs and then you get asked to have 20 OKRs that is a distraction.(In terms of strategy there might be one thing or three things you REALLY need to do.)At one place I worked I was expected to create OKRs for my own personal and professional development and I felt offended by it because it was out of phase with my own needs.Today I do a lot for personal and professional development and it is highly strategic,  it&#39;s motivated by being better at what I do for work but also about getting the social opportunities I want and where I think technology is going over the next ten years.Because it is strategic I am continuously finding that a project I started a year ago has given me exactly the resource I need right now for a situation I had no idea I&#39;d be in.Like hell I need to fill out a form in some artificial format for my boss about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NVIDIA, Intel and AMD sit on the ISO C++ and ISO Fortran standard committees. They voted GPU support into the C++ 2017 and Fortran 2018 ISO standards. While NVIDIA implemented this YEARS ago, almost 5 years after these ISO standards were voted in, Intel and AMD have not even announced a plan for implementing GPU support for ISO standard languages on their GPUs.Instead, Intel and AMD strategy is pushing applications to &#34;rewrite CUDA with HIP/OneAPI&#34;, which are not real standards and are no more portable than CUDA. The people claiming that they are &#34;open&#34;, probably also think that OpenACC is an open standard, even though it mostly only runs on NVIDIA GPUs.If you care about portable GPU code, unfortunately, NVIDIA is the only vendor that actually delivers.You can take your standard conforming C++ code _today_, not a single line of CUDA, OpenMP, OpenACC, etc. and the nvidia compiler compiles it and runs it on GPUs and multi-core CPUs. You can also take your normal Python NumPy code and run it on NVIDIA GPUs &#34;as is&#34; without changes.It doesn&#39;t get any more portable than that.I don&#39;t understand how there are so many people in these threads that apparently care about portability happy about AMD and Intel rewriting open source applications in their proprietary vendor-specific technologies, instead of angry about them pushing their proprietary technologies, instead of implementing GPU support for ISO standard languages, just like NVIDIA does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s good that AMD is providing support for some of their customers since OpenCL is being removed in 3.0. I hope that this is just the start of far greater investment into their software ecosystem. It was understandable that AMD invested less in drivers and support software when they were almost bankrupt but that excuse is drying up. There are rumors that future AMD GPU architectures will be quite good and it would be a shame for that advantage to be wasted by a lack of software support."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glad to hear it. We&#39;re going on 10 years since Blender notionally got OpenCL support, I bought an AMD GPU on that basis, found out that the &#34;OpenCL support&#34; was so thoroughly dismal that it was slower than my CPU, sold my AMD card, ate the ebay fees, bought an NVidia card, ate the green tax, and got on with my work.I had to repeat that lesson a few years later with deep learning code before it stuck.Hopefully this time is different. I&#39;m cautiously optimistic... but I&#39;ll let someone else be the guinea pig."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK, for starters, ECC has to become standard.Then the rate of ECC errors has to be monitored. If something is trying a rowhammer attack, it&#39;s going to cause unwanted bit flips which the ECC will correct. Normally, the ECC error rate is very low. Under attack, it should go up. So an attack should be noticeable.  You might get some false alarms, but that just means it&#39;s time to replace memory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article:
&gt; We demonstrate that it is possible to trigger Rowhammer bit flips on all DRAM devices today despite deployed mitigations on commodity off-the-shelf systems with little effort.The fact that user space code can cause bit flips in your RAM is a hardware bug. I&#39;d love to see this code in memory testers like memtest86 so I could send the RAM back if it ever caught a problem like this.I guess it shows just how close to the edge of not working our modern computing environment is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eventually, it will be obvious that running shared workloads on a single piece of physical hardware has fundamentally unremediatable security implications. This slow recognition is deeply perpendicular with how the current landscape of x86 chips are both manufactured and priced, as well as how cloud providers have structured billions of dollars in DC investment; in other words, they&#39;ll down-play it. This will be a massive opportunity for ARM &amp; SoC manufacturers in the coming years, as its far better positioned to offer, for example, a single rack appliance with 64 individual 2-core mini-computers at a price-point competitive with a 128 core x86 rack, as one computer.Computing moves in cycles:- 2000s: gigahertz race on each core- 2010s: increase core counts, multicore everything- 2020s: back to core-efficiency and increasing per-core performance. M1 is already leading this charge, but is obviously a mismatch for a DC environment.AMD and Intel need to adjust, or face extinction. Its not just about pushing ultra-high per-core performance (they&#39;re both good at this); its about pushing for more efficiency, so per-blade density in a DC can be pushed higher in the face of more, smaller individual computers. If they don&#39;t evolve, AWS will for them [1].[1] https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think at this point we can just expect this stuff.The ridiculousness of it, though.  The rekieta law stream (which is fantastic, btw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7YXd2M5E-8) has anywhere from 4-12 active lawyers giving commentary and context to everything that is happening.This is exactly the type of thing we dreamed about when we were first creating the internet.However: often times these smaller independent journalists and commenters go against the reality that media companies want you to believe you live in.  Thus: they get censored.  Rekieta lost almost 40,000 people who were getting live commentary from a diverse (idealogically) set of lawyers, and now must to places where these companies can assert more narrative control.It&#39;s sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It doesn&#39;t fit the narrative that they and the entire mainstream media are so desperate to perpetuate.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I live in Christchurch, NZ, and so I see a variety of long distance travellers in the swamplands and estuaries, including bar-tailed godwits at the end of Southshore spit https://newsline.ccc.govt.nz/news/story/draft-godwits-arriva...A huge amount of housing and infrastructure here wouldn’t be allowed now, because when it was built it would have disrupted rare birds (or perhaps that is why the birds are now rare).It does make one feel more aware of how the world is connected when you realise that migratory birds need to survive stopovers in other countries like China.The birds also need to survive in New Zealand, where just a few signs and some social convention prevents dogs from attacking nesting sites (edit: or people disturbing them), and it would be hard to lock down the area since many people would strongly assert their rights to go there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"According to Wikipedia a godwit weighs ~0.5kg and it flew 7000 miles. If my calculations are right we are looking at 1.5kwh of energy and 0.2 wh per mile?Even if we assume that the bird is almost all fat and fat can store ~3500kcal per pound, the maximum stored energy is 4kwh. That gives us 0.8wh per mile. So we can safely say that the bird spent [1.5-4kwh] to do this trip.Teslas that are very efficient are in the order of 200 wh per mile.What the heck we have a lot of work to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I immediately smelled bullshit in the headline because surely they don&#39;t mean non-stop in the literal sense. An animal has to eat! But no, I was wrong, these birds fly 8+ days in a row without sleep or food (or a complete mental breakdown, presumably). Though I do find it odd the article doesn&#39;t discuss the food and sleep issue more."</p>

A network tool I&#39;ve always wanted is one that automates the investigation you have to do manually if you are experienceing &#34;internet issues&#34;. I mean, the check list is quite straightforward but still a pretty manual process, stuff like:
- Do I have the expected IP?
- Is there large packet loss or latency issues hinting at connectivity issues?
- Can I ping the local gateway?
- Can I ping to outside network?
- Is my nearest DNS responding?
- Is another, remote DNS responding?

It was 2x my current salary and it was too hard to turn it down when the money was right there in front of me.I had sincere moral issues with the company but I convinced myself their worst days were likely behind them, that they were committed to doing the work to to fix their reputation. The last 2 years have only gotten worse and it’s very clear the leadership has no interest in making meaningful changes to address social harm caused by the platform. I legit don’t like telling people what I do for a living when I meet someone new at a bar for fear they ask where I work.Couple this with a culture that has masterminded a set of carrots and sticks that gets people to push themselves very hard all of the time, I’m completely burnt out. My GF pretty much told me she can’t handle living with someone so stressed out all the time.I don’t have another job lined up but I’m not too worried. I’m excited for a reset. I’m taking through the end of the year to cool off and prep for interviews. I think it’s imperative at my next job that I at least somewhat believe in the product. I’ve learned that money isn’t enough to keep me going in the face of giving 0 fucks about the company mission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have much data points to share. But I&#39;ve been seeing responses to people working FB have been horrible since for a while now.It has been a common trend that when someone I know posts a job position in FB, nobody replies to it. At least not publicly (publicly means replying to tweet, replying to slack message in a well knit/known group of people). Even if they are replying personally and privately, that in itself shows a problem.When I see someone working in FB, I can&#39;t deny that I am judging them. At this point, there is no reason to give a benefit of the doubt to how bad FB is to people, democracy and humanity in general. Sure, you can argue with technical meritocracy of some tech they produce. But how long can you sell yourself that excuse really when on the other side, adverse effects are mounting up?As nerdy and smart as tech workers are, we are still in need of validation from others right? There definitely should be some effect on people being perceived as a bad person for working for a bad company even if it is paying a ton. FAANG engineers should be more than equipped to look elsewhere because of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this article focused primarily on things being left unmaintained, etc. there is also a huge problem with things being touched for no reason and making them worse.When handed what must be a mountain of bugs and unfinished items, why the hell did they prioritize things like breaking notifications and Safari tabs, for instance?  They’re in a position where engineering resources desperately need to be closing gaps, not creating huge new ones.There seems to be a prioritization problem at the very least.  Which I get, on some level who wants to work on the broken things?  But if they threw some money at this they could fix it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an anecdotal example that may be relevant, I wanted to upgrade to Monterey and my Mac Mini said there wasn&#39;t enough room.Hooked up a Western Digital external drive that I had used on previous Macs and launched Time Machine. And that&#39;s when it started. Time Machine presented what seemed like a stack of Finder windows in the middle, a timeline with hash marks on the right-side and the only button highlighted was the &#34;Cancel&#34;.No menu, no other actionable buttons, no right-click menu. Nothing. So after hitting various key combos and mouse buttons, I decided that my 30+ minutes trying to use Apple&#39;s built-in backup software to backup a few folders was better spent finding 3rd party software.And that was another user experience fail in my opinion for Apple and any &#34;total quality&#34; experience.And that&#39;s not even talking about Safari or XCode or Pages or Numbers or iBooks not syncing and so many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yesterday I prepared a few years old Windows laptop for my daughter to use in school.It took me a few hours just to install updates, remove bloatware (my oh my, the amount is staggering!) and fix privacy settings. And this was for Windows 10 which I hear is a mild version of a mess that Windows 11 is.I was instantly reminded why I appreciate Apple software more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Who is going to do it?&#34; is always my first question whenever I am asked to estimate a piece of work. PMs/EMs are usually taken aback by the response, as if we are all supposed to pretend that all dev &#34;resources&#34; are equal. Yet reality doesn&#39;t fit into neat planning spreadsheets or burndown graphs, so often gets ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a security engineer but have been a business leader from time to time.  Business leaders often need to plan around dates- eg ”should we spend $50k announcing at conference Y in month Z, or should we wait until month A?”  “Our competition just launched; will we be able to launch this quarter (the board wants to know, and we have to report material financial impact items quarterly or face SEC fines)?”Every team I have ever worked with hates planning; every team hates their methodology and thinks it’s stupid and inaccurate and why are those pinhead business people insisting on a date; it’ll be done when it’s done.One of the primary jobs of managers at all levels is to plan and then execute in accordance with the plan.  Some managers are good at it, many aren’t- the world is populated with people nearer the center than the ends of the bell curve.So show me a methodology that mere mortals can implement successfully.  If all you can do is complain and point out unicorn 500x engineers (yeah try hiring for that characteristic, good luck), then I don’t want to hear it.  But if you have a practical idea on how to “solve” planning, then you have my full attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cathartic to read, but I also despair at getting the people who need to hear it to take it seriously.&gt; But many people want the world to be simpleThis is the source of so much insanity in the world, not just with regard to allocating labor. Details matter, but people who plan &#34;timelines&#34; desperately don&#39;t want to hear it. They can go through whole careers without being forced out of the cozy illusion that the world is simple. It&#39;s hard to get a man to believe something when his salary depends on it not being true, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the movie The War Lover, Steve McQueen (well, the actual pilot) pilots a B17 bomber &#34;cutting the grass&#34;, i.e. flying low with the gear up. The stunt was to be done with models because it was too dangerous.My dad was in the AF at the time, and was assigned to the movie as a consultant on AF trivia. He convinced them that the stunt could be done safely, and explained how to do it.And so it was done. My dad got in trouble, because if the B17 had crashed doing the stunt, the AF would have looked bad. But it didn&#39;t crash, and the stunt was a big deal to the movie crowds, so he was forgiven.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGGynxYbA48It&#39;s still freakin&#39; impressive today.His other contribution to the movie was the mission briefing wall maps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most fascinating non-CGI effect from Terminator 2 is a cut scene which can be seen in the director&#39;s cut, where they use Linda Hamilton twin sister in a surprising way: to fake a &#34;mirror&#34; scene where Sarah is operating on the Terminator&#39;s head.They are in front of a mirror. They wanted to actually use Arnie in the reflection to show his face; they wanted a dummy for the head closest to the camera, to show the surgery inside the head. So they used a window in the wall instead of a mirror! Linda Hamilton and her twin sister are mimicking each other&#39;s movements to make it seem it&#39;s a mirror image.(The other use of Linda&#39;s twin sister, the scene where the T-1000 fakes being Sarah, is better known)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As more data comes out about Google, Apple, Amazon, one simple underlying thing becomes clear: a single company cannot be trusted to operate a marketplace while also being a participant.Apple&#39;s App Store insider knowledge lets them discover popular apps, then boot them off the platform when they decide to compete. Amazon sees what products are successful and profitable, then makes knock-offs which they promote over the originals. And now, reading into this, Google is manipulating their ad markets using inside knowledge.It&#39;s all very profitable.If we cannot trust large companies to not abuse this kind of power, then they should be prevented by law from playing both sides. This may result in the breakup of some very large companies, akin to the 1934 Air Mail Act that broke up Boeing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The lawsuit also highlights Google&#39;s use of a secret program dubbed &#34;Project Bernanke&#34; in 2013 that used bidding data to give its own ad-buying an advantage. For example, in a 2015 iteration of the program, Google allegedly dropped the second-highest bids from publishers&#39; auctions, accumulated money into a pool and then spent that money to inflate only the bids belonging advertisers who used the company&#39;s Google Ads. They otherwise would have likely lost the auctions, the states alleged.Can someone rephrase this and possibly explain like I&#39;m five?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read this and couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that it&#39;s a fantasy tale because it mentions the mystical Unity support engineer who actually fixes bugs - the one I haven&#39;t been able to get a hold on for the past 5 years, despite having critical bugs escalated by support... But then I noticed this is from 2016, so before they started kicking out experienced people to polish their profit margin for the IPO.Still an amazing debugging story, though :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When another thread pushes a socket to be processed by the socket polling thread, the socket polling thread calls select() on that function. Since select() is a blocking call, when another socket is pushed to the socket polling thread queue it has to somehow interrupt select() so the new socket gets processed ASAP. How does one interrupt select() function? Apparently, we used QueueUserAPC() to execute asynchronous procedure while select() was blocked… and threw an exception out of it!Not taking anything away from the great debugging, but that is just incredibly bad design and reeks of bugs from a mile away. System calls block for a reason. If you can&#39;t handle the blocking, how about a non-blocking architecture? But in this case, the engineer thought &#34;hey, I don&#39;t want to block on my precious main thread, so let&#39;s just give this blocking thing to another thread, that&#39;ll surely solve it!&#34;. Except it doesn&#39;t when you use that same thread as a worker to execute all other thread&#39;s blocking crap ... but then write the queue push() function to be blocking as well!Keep it simple folks. Bad design always breeds more bad design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: &#34;Surprisingly, setting up kernel debugging is extremely easy on Windows.&#34;Microsoft (at least used to) take developers very seriously. The OS actually plays along when you&#39;re trying to debug things, and Windows error reporting actually sends you data that you can work with.Say what you want about their business practices, but I&#39;d deal with Microsoft&#39;s developer support over Apple&#39;s anytime.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had my Vizio TV (P55-F1, 2019 model; a mid range model) for about 2.5 years now. Image/sound quality is great. But the annoyances and overall mediocrity of the OS and its updates [0] made me just disconnect the TV from the internet and fully switch over to using an Apple TV for all consumption rather than using the native Vizio OS.[0]: The OS is terrible and the remote randomly stops working sometimes. Sometimes the TV would take tens of seconds to turn on, but then other times it was near instant.Every single update since I&#39;ve gotten the TV seems to make the TV even slower/more laggy. There was even an update about two years back where the Youtube app&#39;s volume was inexplicably an order of magnitude lower than every other input&#39;s volume (e.g. a volume of 100/100 on the Youtube app ended up being equivalent to a volume of 10/100 for all other apps/inputs). It took Vizio 1-3 months to fix it.Unblockable ads on the home screen and genuinely multi-hundred millisecond response times on the app launcher infuriated me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is likely incorrect.The $57.3 million is for the &#34;Platform+&#34; division. It includes profit from homescreen ads, selling of buttons on remotes, and cuts of streaming revenue. It&#39;s likely that only a small fraction of the division&#39;s $83 million in revenue comes from tracking and then selling viewing habits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On a similar theme, I remember reading a story about a server that would crash mysteriously every couple of weeks. They eventually worked out that this happened whenever there was a new moon or a full moon, and the resulting high tide caused a battleship moored in a nearby harbour to rise just high enough that its powerful radar would interfere with the server."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;When did this start?  A
few days ago, you said, but did anything change in your systems at that time?&#34;&gt; &#34;Well, the consultant came in and patched our server and rebooted it.&gt; Having established that--unbelievably--the problem as reported was true,
and repeatableAs far as problems go, this is an easy one to solve. Accurate description of the problem. Accurate reporting of what changed. Problem is consistently repeatable.Compared to a problem that doesn’t reliably reproduce and for which the person reporting it claims nothing changed, this one is child’s play.But it’s still amusing to read every time.I had something similar occur in the early 2000s on a patch release of Solaris 2.6 (I think) where the sleep call was broken and would always return almost instantly. This caused all sorts of weird behaviors on the running system.I also recall the first time I ran into an issue with MTU on a dedicated frame relay link we had to admin our web farm in the late nineties. One day a developer reported they could login to our bastion but when they ran “ls -l” in a big enough directory their ssh connection would hang. It turned out the connection would hang whenever a packet was generated near the MTU and we eventually tracked it down to an issue with the frame relay connection. We played with MTUs until we found out what worked. It then took a while to convince our provider what was going on but they eventually replaced a line card on the far end of the connection which allowed us to re-raise the MTU to 1500.Another fun problem I had was an email to SMS gateway I wrote for myself that worked by posting to a Verizon web form. I developed it on a Mac (probably 2002 or so) where it worked fine but when I deployed it to my Linux box on my same home network, the script couldn’t connect to Verizon’s site. It turned out the Linux box was a setting a flag on the TCP connection (ECN I think) that was tripping up Verizon’s web firewall. The work-around was disabling ECN on the Linux box."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have big love for PE. I&#39;ve learnt so much in the process of trying to solve some of these problems. In particular, number theory and data structures are two fields that I have come to love almost entirely because of this website. I did a random selection of the first 200 problems on my own about a decade ago but ran out of steam as the problems got harder.Recently, however, I introduced it at work as a way of encouraging the team I manage to work collaboratively. We have a fortnightly catch up where we talk through solutions, pick new problems (we have a script that randomly picks an easy, medium and hard problem, which has become an exciting ritual), and then we have an initial discussion about each of the new problems.It&#39;s a good way to foster group work. It&#39;s also a great way to introduce people to using version control and pull-requests in a non-scary way!"</p>

Is this something I should focus on as someone learning to code, or the other coding puzzle sites with &#34;linked list&#34; type of challenges are just as good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; When people buy access to a service via a subscription in an iOS app, they are essentially Apple’s customers. For privacy reasons Apple does not provide much information about them to the apps or businesses that run the apps. That means it’s hard to do customer service, address issues, or solve any problems.&gt; “The user experience is much worse,” a marketing executive from one company told me. “When you buy with the developer, they have a relationship with you ... when you buy from Apple: sorry, you’re Apple’s customer, not ours, and if you have a problem with a subscription … we can’t really help them.”Now interview a real user of subscriptions instead of a brand marketing executive and ask them if the user experience is worse.PS. Even when not confronted with such a piece, remember that Forbes is no longer the business journalism folks may have grown up with.  For the past decade, it’s a blogging platform for independent contributors:&gt; Each contributor flies solo with his own blog. He is responsible for conceiving and creating the content, ensuring its accuracy and building an engaged, loyal readership.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lovely corporate ethics. I posted this in our company slack room as an example of how not to act for bizdevGoogle benefits too much from this sort of arrangement to have any incentive to stop it, even though these are unauthorized advertisements that are specifically against Google&#39;s AdWords TOS (side note, I wonder if there is a legal avenue to follow when a vendor doesn&#39;t follow their own TOS? An interesting thought...).This is also a recurring issue with all of Google&#39;s advertising revenue -- malicious behavior such as fraudulent clicks, unauthorized ads, etc., are a decent portion of the revenue stream, and Google is financially incentivized to keep these sorts of abuse going until the ruse is up and the accuracy of their system is called into question publicly in a way that scares away advertisers, but with NDAs and corporate secrecy, it is far too easy to keep things unbalanced, and keep abuse like this in the dark.Business models like this demonstrate just how dire the need for regulation is in some areas of the tech world, particularly among FANG."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That Apple would do this is interesting, but more interesting to me is Google&#39;s position, and obligation, here. There was a throw-away line in the article about Google &#34;not doing anything about it&#34;. What could or should Google do about it? Has Google mediated between competitive ad-buyers in the past? I am not sympathetic to goog in general but it seems like that line puts them in a no-win situation: either they err for not doing anything, or they err for doing something (but not the right thing). Indeed, in this case it would seem the corrective action would better come from Apple than from Google. (Also note this whole play feels like Apple trying to get creative with ways to productively bleed off ridiculously huge capital reserves in a low risk way. It would be ironic for Apple if this blows up into a big thing, but somehow I really doubt it will. )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The beginning of this article is a fairy tale that ignores what used to be one of the biggest drivers of revenue for banks: overdraft fees. Maybe the HN crowd has never been in a situation where they were auto-billed into a negative balance, which then caused an overdraft fee that then further drove their balance into negative territory, but this was a weekly/monthly fiasco for millions of Americans.I was once in a meeting with one of the senior executives at JPMorgan, where the guy smugly told me he felt they were “doing a service for the community” by charging people overdraft fees. After leaving the meeting, my very senior colleague said, “I had to hold myself back from throwing that guy out of his window.”These sorts of articles — half PR, half history lesson — tend to leave out these sorts of politically inconvenient but important bits of history. It’s so much work to unpack the bias..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Typically, the apps offer their users a choice: payouts at the speed of banking, for free, or payouts at the speed of the Internet, for a small convenience fee. Cash App charges 1.5% with a minimum of a quarter.This is just another way the financial system (including fintech startups) preys on the poor. If you are well off, you wouldn&#39;t want to pay any convenience fee for the privilege of receiving money from a business a few days earlier. In fact, you can think of it as interest: from first principles if someone delays a payment to you, theoretically they should pay more because of interest; now if you opt for waiting 3 days and saving the 1.5% convenience fee, you would effectively earn an interest of 1/(1-0.015)-1 = 1.5% in 3 days. That&#39;s not even an annualized figure. If annualized it would be 1.5%/3*365=122% implied annual interest rate. No one in their right mind who does not have cash flow issues would opt for receiving debit card payments with such a fee.&gt; Many report that it transforms the nature of their interaction with the underlying application; delivery driving for casual drivers becomes something that you can burst up to fill an immediate cash need or mentally allocate against a particular desired expenditure (e.g. “Drive for 3 hours to afford a night out starting immediately after you log off.”)If your cash flow is not an issue and have credit, this is how you would handle it: let&#39;s drive for 3 hours, receive the full payment amount in a few days instead of immediately, and put all the charges from the night out on a credit card, whose bill will become due in a month or two, with no interest. But the poor doesn&#39;t have a bank account or a credit card, so they suffer. They pay more in fees. That&#39;s the injustice of the system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Here&#39;s why I like SSH signatures:&gt;* It&#39;s not PGP.The most important reason people use the OpenPGP message format is because it is a well accepted standard. Sure the cryptography is not new and fun but it is secure. If you sign something with OpenPGP then you can be sure that those signatures are verifiable on any platform by anyone. The OpenPGP standard has provisions to ensure that the signatures are from a particular entity. This proposal suggests that Github could be treated as a trusted third party. If that is the case then you don&#39;t need signatures at all.Obligatory &#34;The PGP Problem&#34; rebuttal:* https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan:tpp"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; GitHub acts as a trusted third party here, and you have to trust them not to lie about people&#39;s public keys, so it may not be appropriate for all use cases. But relying on a trusted third party with a professional security team like GitHub seems like a way better default than PGP&#39;s Web of Trust, which was nigh impossible to use.Hopefully that&#39;s a false dichotomy and the entire Free Software community doesn&#39;t end up reliant on Microsoft to host all our keys for us.  The article goes on to mention key transparency, though, which does seem like the right solution.I note that rekor (the transparency log implementation used by sigstore) already supports signing with SSH keys[0], so this TechRepublic article about it[1] from March (which lists only &#34;GPG, x509 and Minisign&#34;) is already out of date.[0] https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/blob/main/types.md#ssh[1] https://www.techrepublic.com/article/a-new-linux-foundation-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding PGP&#39;s &#39;Web of Trust&#39;, I thought the purpose of this was to validate the link between the key and the owner of that key.  This is not what you get from retrieving a public key from github... that only gives you the link between that key and a github account.  But what does that give you?From what I understand, it gives you nothing for anything that is signed and that does not have a direct link to a github account.  Obviously, if someone releases software on that github account and I find a signed release of that software, I can validate that it really was signed by the official source of that software on github. For anything that does not have that direct link, it really does not give you anything.I&#39;ve never used PGP, but I thought the web of trust was used to validate metadata on the key and that this can be used to validate that a key really belongs to the person that you think it belongs to.  I saw it more like how you have SSL certificates with different degrees of validation and where you must deliver more proof of your identity if you want to receive a certification with a higher degree of validation.I&#39;m all for using SSH keys for signing, but I still would like to have something like PGP&#39;s web of trust for those keys."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  We have been made aware of &#34;scary&#34; emails sent in the last few hours that purport to come from the FBI/DHS. While the emails are indeed being sent from infrastructure that is owned by the FBI/DHS (the LEEP portal), our research shows that these emails *are* fake.

https://twitter.com/spamhaus/status/1459450061696417792"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The email domain where the messages originate is from some sort of federated identity management system that was created in 2010 (here is a proposal deck [0] with technical details). Found this program simply by searching Google for the sending domain.Based on the guide for using this system [1] (see step 15) looks like this specific email address is the one that sends automated confirmation emails upon registration. Perhaps someone was able to inject a message instead of the regular canned text through some sort of reflection attack? This explains why replies to the message result in a canned response. The system also now appears to be temporarily down. So it’s getting some sort of attention (internally taken down (most likely) or maybe denial of service from the abuse).The Reddit thread suggests the recipients’ emails are likely ARIN IP range contacts. Those are very available from tools like this [2] so nothing interesting with that, but the real question is WHY someone would do this at all? This was clearly given some thought (on who to send this to who would actually take the time to verify the headers) but given the sloppiness of everything else, is this just a script kiddie flex? Whoever it is pissed off the FBI and gained absolutely nothing.[0] https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/docu...[1] https://www.justice.gov/tribal/page/file/1260671/download[2] http://itools.com/tool/arin-whois-domain-search"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of people commenting that the text of the email seems amateurish. Perhaps it’s exactly as it should be, but you don’t understand its purpose. Maybe they wanted this to be discussed on netsec forums everywhere, so that Google searches for “Vinny Troia” always lead back to discussion about this email, framing him as a cyber criminal and outranking legitimate posts about or by him - an online identity assassination. They needed the email to set off some alarm bells so that it would pique enough interest to be widely discussed. They appear to have widely targeted the email addresses of system admins. I’m fairly certain this was their intention.Also, does it strike anyone else as odd that the account that posted this to HN was created hours ago, for the sole purpose of starting this thread?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Portuguese here)
Portuguese Parliament and Government publish law every day and afterhours[1], as a citizen I have to keep up with this. MPs believe they are doing a great job by producing more Law, instead of checking if what is in place is accountable. A common behaviour is when a &#34;crime&#34; case is well covered by the media, the first thing is said &#34;we need to change the Law&#34;, trying to dodge blame.I have been working remote for 17 years, and the teams I worked in, work asynchronously. It is fine to text, slack, discord and email after hours, people don&#39;t expect to get answers immediately, they will reply according to their schedule or contract.One case is that employers have to compensate employees for electricity and utilities for working remote, in my case that is a cost of €10.58, I save much more for not commuting, financially and psychologically.[1] https://dre.pt/dre/home"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we open up a broader discussion about Portugal&#39;s culture of work? On one hand this sends a message that Portugal cares about work/life balance for everyday citizens. On the other my general impression of Portugal&#39;s economy is that it&#39;s one of the weaker members of the EU. High debt, not a huge driver of innovation, wealth, etc. These are all just loosely held beliefs kicking around in my head. I&#39;m not attached to any of them or sure that they are even accurate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I DM my staff on slack “after hours” [1] all the time, and set the expectation that they should respond when appropriate at their discretion. That could (and often does) mean the next business day or even later. Or it could mean ASAP; they’re adults, and have the judgement to make the correct call.[1] Obviously, this policy is not targeted at staff in different time zones, which makes their remedy meaningless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading this really drove home to me just how amusing some of the twists and turns of music tech development are. In contemporary modular synth formats, you now have modules that use similar FM tone chips, but are controlled by potentiometers and analog control voltage inputs (for instance, https://busycircuits.com/alm011/). I could see how someone could conclude that this destroys the reproducibility advantages of digital FM synthesis, while preserving the cheesiness of FM sounds. From another perspective, you can freely explore the enormous landscape of sound produced by FM synthesis, without diving into the deep end of DX7 programming. Instead of generating sysex dumps on the fly to dynamically change the sounds produced by the synth, you just feed whatever control voltage you can come up with into the inputs of a module and bask in the insanity that comes out (for instance—https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-YEbg040ww definitely not everyone’s cup of tea).Edit: but if you want to explore the landscape of FM tones generated by these chips without spending all of your money on a modular setup, generating sysex messages will of course take you where you want to go: https://fo.am/activities/midimutant/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is maybe a little outside the scope of your article, but I&#39;ve read about the DX7&#39;s log2 based sine wavetables in the past, and it makes sense from a math standpoint (log2(x) + log2(y) = log2(x*y)). However, I find it confusing when I go to try to replicate it. My understanding is that these are NOT floating point numbers. In which case the output would be in the 8bit range of (0-257) or -127 to +127 if we&#39;re using signed values.So assuming I want to represent a signal value of 127 (i.e. sin(t) = 127) using base 2 logs, I punch this into my calculator and i get log2(127) = 6.9886.
But that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to be stored in the signal LUT since it&#39;s a floating point number.I think I&#39;m probably missing something obvious, but any clarification would be amazing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I agree with the author in principle, I think there is an implicit criteria they ignore, which is the intuitive correctness from the perspective of the user.Imagine a user chooses &#34;Sort by rating&#34;, and they subsequently observe an item with an average 4.5 ranking above a score of 5.0 because it has a higher Wilson score. Some portion of users will think &#34;Ah, yes, this makes sense because the 4.5 rating is based on many more reviews, therefore its Wilson score is higher.&#34; and the vast, vast majority of users will think &#34;What the heck? This site is rigging the system! How come this one is ranked higher than that one?&#34; and erode confidence in the rankings.In fact, these kinds of black-box rankings* frequently land sites like Yelp into trouble, because it is natural to assume that the company has a finger on the scale so to speak when it is in their financial interests to do so. In particular, entries with a higher Wilson score are likely to be more expensive because their ostensibly-superior quality commands (or depends upon) their higher cost, exacerbating this effect due to perceived-higher margins.So the next logical step is to present the Wilson score directly, but this merely shifts the confusion elsewhere -- the user may find an item they&#39;re interested in buying, find it has one 5-star review, and yet its Wilson score is &lt;&lt; 5, producing at least the same perception and possibly a worse one.Instead, providing the statistically-sound score but de-emphasizing or hiding it, such as by making it accessible in the DOM but not visible, allows for the creation of alternative sorting mechanisms via e.g. browser extensions for the statistically-minded, without sacrificing the intuition of the top-line score.* I assume that most companies would choose not to explain the statistical foundations of their ranking algorithm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article inspired me so much that I based my shitty undergrad senior thesis on it. My idea was to predict the trend of the ratings by using I think a trailing weighted average, weighted to the most recent window. It managed to generate more &#34;predictive&#34; ratings of the following 6 months based on the Amazon dataset I used, but I doubt it would have held up to much scrutiny. I learned a ton though!Edit: Link to paper, which looks like it actually attempts to use a linear prediction algorithm. https://github.com/rkuykendall/rkuykendall.com/blob/e65147f6..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using this at work for the last year or so to great success.For example, we have an internal phishing simulation/assessment program, and want to track metrics like improvement and general uncertainty. Since implementing this about a year ago, we&#39;ve been able to make great improvements such as:* for a given person, identify the wilson lower bound that they would not get phished if they were targeted* for the employee population as a whole, determine the 95% uncertainty on whether a sample employee would get phished if targetedIt lets us make much more intelligent inferences about things, much more accurate risk assessments, and also lets us improve the program pretty significantly (e.g. your probability of being targeted being weighted by a combination of your wilson lower bound and your wilson uncertainty).There are SO MANY opportunities to improve things by using this method. Obviously it isn&#39;t applicable everywhere, but I&#39;d suggest you look at any metrics you have that use an average and just take a moment to ask yourself if a Wilson bound would be more appropriate, or might enable you to make marked improvements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience with learning math is that the first months are all about backtracking. You have to fill all your holes.It&#39;s basically one big graph of concepts.The tricky part is, most beginners simply don&#39;t know how to navigate that graph.They see complex numbers with their exponentials and cos/sin forms and shut down.They can learn all these concepts no problem, but finding what they need to learn defeats them."</p>

&gt; given of  the  theory and its applications, there­
&gt; by  complicating  an  understanding  of things  that  
&gt; were  intuitively  clear.hear hear!This problem is like most of the Wikipedia pages that I come across on &#39;complex&#39; topics of not just maths but anything remotely intersting technically.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that if you’re building a framework with the intent of using Linux avoid the “vpro” variant of the Intel wireless adapter:https://community.frame.work/t/using-the-ax210-with-linux-on...Last I checked with every recommended config tweak you still lose ~3% battery per hour of suspend, which really adds up and is extremely annoying.We’ve been asking framework to include a notice referencing this issue when configuring but as of the last time I checked they haven’t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://frame.work/blog/linux-on-the-framework-laptop :“ There has been immense interest in this configuration, with it outselling pre-configured systems with Windows 10 by a wide margin.”There is a market. And it is currently under-served."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m typing this on my Framework now and I have to say it really is a special device. The prevailing culture of treating technology as disposable is something I personally don&#39;t vibe with - I always keep all of my tech and have collected machines over the years that most people would probably consider obsolete and uninteresting (there&#39;s an Amiga 1000 and iMac G3 currently in my field of view). Having a fully open machine that I can customize, upgrade and repair for the foreseeable future is just so cool and makes me feel like this is my personal computer in the truest sense of the word!A few takeaways from using it for around a month now:1. This is the most &#34;premium&#34; feeling non-Apple laptop I&#39;ve ever owned. Most of the laptops I&#39;ve ever daily driven are Macs or Thinkpads so take that for what it&#39;s worth, but I think most people will be happy with the fit and finish of this device.2. The swappable port system is actually a lot more useful than I expected. I initially thought it would be something I set up once and didn&#39;t bother with again for a while but there are a lot of random moments where it comes in handy. I&#39;m kind of a messy, hyper person that periodically reorganizes my desk and I like to move between different workspaces when I need a different setting to feel creative. Being able to move my HDMI or USB-C ports around for better cable management is so nice and yeah I could use an external hub but I&#39;ve always found those to be annoying on-the-go and just &#34;feels bad man&#34;. Also I don&#39;t use Micro SD cards as much as other people but there are times when I do and being able to swap that in is really kewl.3. Linux support is amazing but there are still a few hiccups. I use Arch Linux and everything works perfectly except for one minor inconvenience with Bluetooth: on a soft restart, the Bluetooth is disabled and I have to do a hard restart to restore it (can be mitigated by a kernel downgrade and should be fixed in a future update). It&#39;s not a deal breaker for me as I usually just close my laptop and put it to sleep, but just know that it&#39;s like running Linux on most other computers - you&#39;re going to have a much better time if you&#39;re fluent in tinkering and configuring your OS.4. The 3:2 display is awesome for programming and content creation, and I don&#39;t know why more devices don&#39;t adopt it. My only criticism is that it&#39;s not a touch screen but with how modular this laptop is it&#39;s only a matter of time before that becomes an option."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome project Jacques! I saw a comment of yours on an article a day or two ago and was hoping to see this pop up soon.I&#39;ve found the most difficult thing about riding an e-bike is the other motorists have no idea how to react to you. You&#39;re not really a regular bicycle anymore due to your speed, but you&#39;re also not a motorcycle that deserves its own lane. I have at least one car turn in front of me almost every trip out just because they&#39;re misjudging my speed. I get honked and yelled at when on the road because folks get frustrated when I&#39;m using the left-hand side of the right-turn lane as a bike path.Sidewalks/bike paths tend to be a lot less safe in residential areas as well, since cars coming out of their driveways really don&#39;t expect an e-bike to come rolling through. I&#39;ve learned to dramatically reduce speed in areas like this.Aside from those things, I love it! I ride the e-bike whenever I&#39;m going somewhere in range (I live in Florida so things tend to be spread out) and the weather permits. My bike gets about 80km which is more than enough for anyplace I want to go on a bicycle anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What bugs me is so much of our (Australia&#39;s) government&#39;s policies over time have increasingly deferred to some ISO standard or another. These days most agencies / departments are stipulating some form of ISO27k compliance from vendors, a standard that can only be purchased from ISO.Given we pay our taxes to the government, and I would have thought defining policy standards was one of the services we pay tax to have (what better thing for governments to do than what they&#39;re naturally geared towards - bureaucracy?), at the very least they would be able to directly and in detail outline the standards they expect and not simply handball the entire definition and auditing off to an international organisation and myriad consultancies with the stroke of a single bullet point requirement in the RFx.The quagmire of ISO consultancies are often charging exorbitant rates to deliver essentially a set of Excel templates, when the hard work of adopting a standard really is all in-house and any company with a copy of the standards and the templates can pretty much get it all done internally then get certified.And ultimately when it comes down to it, the standard doesn&#39;t really do much to improve quality outcomes, especially for an organisation that doesn&#39;t give a fig. A well intentioned company that&#39;s on the ball will already be following best practices, a shady company that plays cowboy will do the bare minimum to get the badge.Anyway, just an axe I tend to grind. Standards definitely are needed and have their place but holy hell is it a mess ATM. There needs to be an independent open source standards body, ISO is a farce IMHO - the standards as they are written are actually decent but their business model and hands-off approach to auditing and verifying standard adherence is a big issue across multiple sectors I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did recently discover that the Estonian standards agency makes ISO standards available, not for free, but significantly more cheaply than other sources I found when trying to locate standards (although I didn&#39;t end up using it so don&#39;t know any more than is on the public Web site): https://www.evs.ee/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"100% agree!I am very angry that standards that were paid for by taxpayers around the world were then given by governments to the ISO who then charge for very minimal work done afterwards.For example, BS3939 was created by the UK Government for electronic symbols and as far as I know, has not been updated since 1991 when an ISO document took it over. Why would they, therefore, be charging $250+ per copy for it?I think there should be a phrase like &#34;immoral bureaucracy&#34; which pertains to the extraordinary amount of money a quango burns through compared to what they actually produce. Since most ISO docs are produced by experts and not by the ISO themselves and since many of these do not change frequently, the cost is immoral imho."</p>

I&#39;m also really confused as to why sed is suddenly &#34;s&#34; in one of the examples. This just isn&#39;t a very good reference, and I&#39;m not sure if the author thinks about how &#34;c&#34; works, but it really needs a \ afterwards, no matter what the one specific version of sed you are using might allow :/. As someone who loves sed so much he nigh unto regrets how much he uses it: &#34;beware&#34;.FWIW, I&#39;d argue that the path to true sed mastery eventually goes through the hold space, which isn&#39;t mentioned here.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice descriptions, but some of them need changes to match the command. For example:    sed &#39;1~2p&#39; file.txt #needs -n option

    s &#39;1,$ s/foo/bar/&#39; file.txt #s --&gt; sed and 1,$ --&gt; 5,$

Many commands using `-r` do not need the option for the command used (for ex: `sed -r &#39;/start/q&#39;`). Also, using `-E` is preferred instead of `-r` since some of the other implementations support this option but not `-r`.---I wrote a book on GNU sed with plenty of examples and exercises: https://github.com/learnbyexample/learn_gnused It is free to read online and there&#39;s a detailed chapter for learning BRE/ERE regex flavor as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am so happy to see the quick progress of Linux on the ARM-Macs. In the 80ies and 90ies, there were several competing processor architectures on the market, but for the last 20 years for PCs it was x86 only. With the Apple Silicon, there is now a real contender, actually surpassing the current x86 offerings in many aspects. And that is, why competition between architectures is so important. And of course just interesting from a software development perspective.With Linux becoming a viable option on those machines, they become interesting for a far wider audience than just the MacOS users. Thanks to the great work by Alyssa, GPU acceleration should be close too.Then lets see when Linus gets himself a Mac, he already indicated that he would be interested to do so as long as he doesn&#39;t have to port Linux himself."</p>

Just another big company with data gathering ambitions.
After Catalina MacOs is a total joke.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve tried to incorporate some of the ideas of the &#34;second brain&#34; and it didn&#39;t really give me that much. My lessons:1. It&#39;s always super helpful to write things down. Taking notes from what I read/learn is a great way to verify that I understand it. It sharpens my thinking.2. However, maintaining the &#34;second brain&#34; is a lot work. It&#39;s not only about &#34;linking&#34; together notes. You also need to maintain some consistency between them. I ended up spending a lot of time thinking about the structure instead of actually thinking about the content.3. Most of my notes/thoughts fall into two categories: (1) Either they are critical for something I&#39;m actively working on or (2) it&#39;s just loose concepts that I&#39;m toying with. For (1) I immediately end up playing with it in code — which is far more concrete and tangible than notes. And for (2) it was rarely important to retain the knowledge accurately many weeks/months later.What I&#39;ve ended up with is taking a lot of notes, but I hardly focus on organizing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use textfiles...Some are lists, like todo.txtSome are individual topics, brainstorms, etc.For organizing them, I put hashtags like #food inside.Even thousands upon thousands of textfiles (which I&#39;m nowhere near) grep quickly, archive and backup quickly, and transfer to other systems quickly, without lock-in or putting my eggs into someone else&#39;s basket.I can even build my own UI on top of it... First, index them into a SQLite, then generate some HTML from it, and have a form which puts another textfile back into the directory. Best of all: the UI never changes without my consent.After getting burned repeatedly by third-party systems with stupid UI changes, data migrations, just plain shutting down, leaking my data, your version is out of date, and your OS is not compatible with our new version, and your device is not compatible with the new OS version, etc., there&#39;s no way I&#39;m using a third-party system for this ever again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently read &#34;Getting Things Done&#34;[0] and began incorporating what I learned into my simple second brain. And the results are kind of ridiculously good for me.I built my whole system on a Google Sheet, but I&#39;m experimenting with building myself an App instead- something I would never have been able to accomplish or even been willing to start if I didn&#39;t have this second brain helping me.The lessons I&#39;ve learned from this:1. Being pro-active on things instead of reactive makes everything easier. Each action takes less work because there&#39;s no worry or guilt associated with it. Just a small amount of planning to make myself pro-active is a worthy investment.2. Putting things I need to remember into a system and then forgetting about them, trusting that my system has it under control, removes a huge cognitive load from me. I have more energy to use elsewhere.3. Building a system that evolves to fit my needs, being flexible with myself, rather than trying to jam myself into someone else&#39;s system has made it work at all. That&#39;s why Google Sheets is awesome as a prototype tool for this.[0]https://gettingthingsdone.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was definitely written by a pythonist!  If I tried to write it, as a rubyist, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get some things about python wrong.  (I find it notable how few people there are that are actually familiar with both).The standard alternative to `for` in ruby does involve `each` and blocks... but definitely doesn&#39;t involve defining a custom `each` method on your class... That is a specialty thing that most developers have probably done rarely.  Let alone defining it in terms of `for`, which is just weird!But the basic principle stated &#34;Instead of passing data back to the for loop (Python) you pass the code to the data (Ruby)&#34; -- is more or less accurate.blocks -- syntactic support in the language for cleanly passing a single in-line defined lambda/closure object as an argument -- are possibly the thing that are most special to ruby.&gt; Python builds on for-like constructs for all kinds of processing; Ruby pushes other kinds of data processing work to methods.OK, maybe, although not totally sure what you mean.&gt; Ruby keeps going with its methods-first approach, except instead of each we have a new set of methods commonly implemented on collections, as below:Um. I&#39;m not sure where the author is getting this. It is certainly possible, as shown, but definitely not common to implement `select` or `map` or other methods provided by Enumerable directly on your custom class. It is a bit more common to implement `each` alone and let the `Enumerable` mixin provide the rest.  But even that I&#39;m not sure how &#34;common&#34; I&#39;d call it.&gt; Ruby, however, inverts this. Ruby puts object-orientation as the foundation of the pyramid. Ruby contains the messy procedural world in blocks, letting objects work with those procedural blocks.OK, true. The author is getting the details wrong, but I guess their overall picture is still right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While people have pointed out that this is not idiomatic:  class Stuff
    def initialize
      @a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    end

    def each
      for item in @a_list
        yield item
      end
    end
  end

I haven&#39;t seen anyone point out the deepest reason why: unlike in many languages, “for” is not a basic, low-level construct in Ruby, it is  syntax sugar. That is:  for x in y
    x.stuff
    more_stuff
  end

is sugar for:  y.each do |x|
    x.stuff
    more_stuff
  end

(Also, for quite a long time, for...in also had runtime overhead , so it was slower syntactic sugar.)for...in is rarely used (it is syntactic sugar that is neither more concise bor more specific in intent, but more familiar to people with experience in non-Ruby languages), and mostly on scripts that consume but don’t implement collections. If you are getting deep enough to be implementing an #each method for a custom collection, that&#39;s an odd place to use for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, its the explicitness in Python that is killer.  I can see a name and match that to an import and match that to a package.  Grabbing a function pointer works exactly as I would expect.Stealing from Krister Stendahl&#39;s laws for religious discourse, Ruby&#39;s composable iteration is one area I have holy envy, particularly after I got used to it in Rust.  I&#39;ve used Python&#39;s generators many times just to have to switch to an explicit for loop.  Things are generally better with a composable iteration model but occasionally I find myself switching to explicit loops in Rust.Unlike Ruby, Rust does pull-iteration like Python, though there are experiments with Ruby-style push-iteration [0] [1].[0] https://github.com/AndWass/pushgen[1] https://epage.github.io/blog/2021/07/pushgen-experiment/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting, but always calibrate their claims against the fact this is about the tenth time this movement has come around. This movement literally goes back to COBOL. That is not a typo. It&#39;s not only likely older than you are, but probably much older than you are.I recognize COBOL may not seem like &#34;no-code&#34;, but that&#39;s just because &#34;no-code&#34; is a stupid label. &#34;No-code&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;no code&#34; just like &#34;serverless&#34; still runs on a server.I would say the main problem with the no-code hype is the idea that it is a leader. It is not. It is a follower. &#34;Normal&#34; code goes out, hammers things out over the course of literally decades, and then, when it has finally settled what the best couple of ways to do something is, it&#39;s finally time for the &#34;no code&#34; solutions to come in and systematize that for a larger audience. Nothing wrong with that. Power to the people and all that.It just goes wrong when no-code advocates put the cart in front of the horse and make grandiose claims about replacing all developers or something. That&#39;s not the direction the stream flows in. No-code can&#39;t operate without the &#34;normal&#34; developers doing immense amounts of work charting the territory and building the infrastructure to get there. There is no chance of them displacing &#34;normal&#34; software developers; they are structurally incapable of it. Woe unto the no-code startup that doesn&#39;t understanding this dynamic, and foolishly tries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an imperfect analogy, but consider for a moment the role Microsoft Excel plays.Excel allows non-coders to do many useful things, and provides a relatively gentle on-ramp to actual code via formulas. If you take that on-ramp and keep going, towards VBA and add-ins and other pieces of Microsoft technology, you might wind up becoming a full-time software developer, leaving Excel behind and using “real” tools.Now, there’s a happy path and an unhappy path here.The happy path is that you use Excel for what it’s good at, but recognize when you are operating at its limits, and at that point pivot into “real” software engineering tools.The unhappy path is that you stick with Excel too long and become mired in the world of VBA and advanced formulas and attempts at shared workbooks, and build pseudo-database application-contraptions.No-code can be like that early Excel usage: it can grant some limited but useful powers to non-developers. But no-code can also evolve to become like those contorted, unmaintainable spreadsheet monstrosities that stretch the technology far beyond the point where some “real” software engineering would have been the right answer.Short version: use the right tool for the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an engineer with 20+ years of hands on keyboard, I&#39;ve got projects that are now part of Apache, 1000&#39;s of stars on github. I&#39;ve been CTO at a number of startups that have got significant funding. My point is to establish some credibility. I probably still suck.Having said that, I have been working with Microsoft PowerAutomate for the past 1.5 years and while it has saved a lot of time and been overall a good experience, there are times when the no code/low code gets in the way and I wish I could just &#34;drop into code&#34; to get something done. Examples are things like data validation. 
This technology is not going to replace coding, the paradigm shift is really happening for people in the marketing and sales operations parts of the business. For these folks, this tech is life changing.
In a lot of ways, this tech felt like when you try a new framework in your language of choice; at first it&#39;s super easy and you get hyped, and then you hit a requirement where the nocode/lowcode environment really gets in the way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t a joke; I had actually scheduled a lunch with Lowtax for this Saturday.  Despite a (let&#39;s call it) checkered past, I was extremely excited to meet him, since he&#39;s been a huge influence to my sense of humor and Something Awful was really important to me as a teenager.-------I had found him on LinkedIn a few weeks ago, and simply sent a message explaining that I&#39;m a fan, would love a chance to buy him lunch and chat about Something Awful and Gaming Garbage.  To my surprise, he responded back with &#34;sure, I&#39;d be up for it&#34;.I responded back with &#34;How does early December sound to you? something on the order of December 11?&#34;His response was &#34;shit I dont even know if I&#39;ll still be alive then&#34;.  This response was a little weird, but this isn&#39;t exactly &#34;off brand&#34; humor for Lowtax, so I ignored it.I then say something to the effect of &#34;how about something along the lines of November 13?&#34;, which he said was better. He then said &#34;and you have my permission to stab me&#34;.  Again, not off brand for Lowtax.I bought a plane ticket to Kansas City, was ready to fly out this friday.  But I had this deep feeling in my stomach that what he was saying wasn&#39;t just a joke.  It&#39;s pretty well documented that he&#39;s been depressed, and I dunno, upon re-reading his messages a hundred times I got a dark feeling that these might be kind of bad omens. What exactly do I do with this?  I discussed it with my wife and a friend, who weren&#39;t sure what the best solution was, and I ultimately decided not to say anything.  I figured I&#39;m just some dork who stalked him on LinkedIn, and I was afraid that if I said anything he would think I&#39;m weird and cancel our lunch date.And now this shit happened. He finally did it, and now the thought keeps playing in my brain of &#34;what if I had said something a few weeks ago?&#34; I know I don&#39;t owe him anything, but I can&#39;t help but have this repeated feeling of &#34;I valued an opportunity to meet my man-crush more than I valued someone showing suicidal tendencies,&#34; and it makes me feel downright rotten. That&#39;s not the kind of person I want to be, and it makes me feel legitimately sick that that&#39;s how my brain decided to work.At some logical level I know none of this is my fault really; realistically even if I had said something, I doubt much would have changed, and I doubt I had enough there to get him committed or anything, but there&#39;s a difference between logically knowing something and feeling something.As it stands, I think there&#39;s a reasonably good chance that I will feel partly responsible for this for the rest of my life.  This sucks.--------RIP Rich.  I know you had a rough last couple years, you were the definition of a &#34;complicated person&#34;, and despite everything you will be missed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He leaves behind a complicated legacy. It&#39;s important to note that credible allegations of domestic abuse lead him to sell SA in the past year, and this can&#39;t be set aside.At the same time, SA&#39;s influence on the modern internet can&#39;t be understated. The &#39;image macro&#39; of early SA (maybe created by Lowtax himself, from what Fragmaster says in his video in the link) is the direct ancestor of today&#39;s common meme image--impact font text over a silly image, easily accessible to anyone who wants to post it.Many of today&#39;s well-known internet comedians and writers grew up with the site. And it&#39;s hard to estimate how big the impact (positive or negative) of things like ADTRW leading to 4chan have been, not to mention things like the rise of Let&#39;s Play videos, or the creation and eventual shutdown of BitTorrent Barnyard (and its ensuing spinoffs).The site itself still remains one of the last vestiges of the old internet--one of the few sites that both survived and managed not sell out and go headlong into monetization--and as a result, is one of the last sites on the modern internet that (maybe ironically) is not entirely awful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to visit SA regularly. A lot of the humor was tasteless, but nowhere near the level of the chans. I avoided the forums, and only read the front page stuff.What kept me coming, was that they were amazing writers (it wasn’t just him -or he wrote under several nom de plumes).His essays, done in the style of famous writers, and deadpan humor, where a story seemed serious, up until the point that you suddenly realize you’re being punked, were masterful.But it sounds like his personal life was a disaster. I have known a number of folks like that. In most cases, I always hoped that, one day, they would “come out of the cesspool,” and start to realize their potential (I have also known a number of folks that did that, too). In my experience, these people were absolutely miserable, and difficult to be around. I only ever saw his creative output, so had no other stake in his personal life.I wish his exes and children the best. It sounds like they may need it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems to be kind of a complex topic, with a number of variables.
Here is a study:How physical text layout affects reading from screen
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220208446_How_physi...A quote from the Discussion section:
&#34;Most of the studies on line length report faster
reading with longer lines, and point to the number of
characters as the variable responsible for the differences, rather than physical line length (visual angle).&#34;The OP thinks that humans read thinner columns faster. Generally, this seems not to be the case, so maybe we should treat his main conclusion with some skepticism. In any case, it&#39;s probably best to refer to the scientific literature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thinner columns allow for more of a &#34;Z&#34; pattern of reading, where you can kind of scan-read backwards when your eye scans back to the left, as opposed to the standard &#34;E&#34; style of reading of reading an entire line, returning to the left, then moving to the next and repeating.Writing in thin columns allows you to keep an eye on what you just wrote more easily as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A vast majority on book typography agrees on 66 characters per line in one-column layouts and 45 characters per line in multi-column layouts as being the optimal numbers for reading. The text-block should also be placed assymetrically on the page, with the margins in size order being inner&lt;top&lt;outer&lt;bottom. The line height should be set at 120% of the highest character hight for normal book typefaces, but should be increased for typewriter typefaces and can be decreased slightly with shorter lines. A small set of typefaces are economic without losing readability, and if you use them you can increase these numbers slightly. But any more than 80 characters and anything less than 40 characters is suboptimal for texts that are longer than a paragraph or so.If you adhere to these very simple principles, you will have avoided like 95% of the typographic choices that can make texts hard or slow to read."</p>

If they ALWAYS won the addiction also wouldn&#39;t form.The old thing was email that people were addicted to checking because you MIGHT get an interesting email. It&#39;s the same way with training a dog. You don&#39;t always give them a treat for behavior. If you only randomly give them a treat they are more likely to perform the behavior because they don&#39;t want to miss the reward. If they know they will get the reward then they know the exact opportunity cost and can weigh that against performing the behavior.That&#39;s how social media and more specifically sites like reddit and HN are addictive.I think we all feel that we occasionally get some beneficial information from them. I know I do, and even this very post I feel has some benefit. But we also see it as time wasting because the majority of the time, that&#39;s what it is.But we are compelled to continually check because of the fear of missing out on some piece of beneficial information. If we were always presented with good information then we could more easily delay checking the sites."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you have such a hard time not reading reddit or hackernews maybe the correct conclusion is not that you&#39;re &#39;wasting&#39; time but that there&#39;s something enjoyable about so called low quality or idle activities and that they&#39;re normal part of a healthy life.I think it&#39;s deeply ironic that people will judge videogames on that basis but then to proceed to gamify and min-max their entire life because of this rat race mentality. If you think that kind of stuff is meaningless when it turns up as a hobby the correct conclusion is probably to not structure your entire personality that way.Just be less judgmental with yourself. things don&#39;t need to be highbrow or particularly meaningful to be a good use of time. It&#39;s mostly just a cultural artifact of our time that puts ripped busybodies and entrepreneurs, and celebs and intellectuals on pedestals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facing a very similar issue and trying similar things unsuccessfully, I&#39;ve found out lately with my coach that a more promising way to break out of the cycle of &#34;wasting time&#34; and beating myself up over it might be very counter-intuitive: Self-acceptance.I&#39;ve found that acknowledging my need for relaxation and satisfying my curiosity was a solid first step in helping cure my addiction on a more fundamental level.Changing my own internal reaction to realizing I spent the last 30 minutes on Reddit from self-punishment to &#34;Oh, interesting. Looks like I needed a bit of a pressure vent from the complex work I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m worth that. Is there anything even better I could do to myself so I can relax more effectively with quality time off?&#34; at least to me was a way better way to deal with it.I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m &#34;cured&#34;, but I spend way less time with these things, more time I would define qualitatively highly (like playing some piano, walking or just dozing a few minutes).Stopping the internal conflict from the other end might be worth a try for you too, even if it sounds weird."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work on a complex desktop application, and it&#39;s been astounding the number of bugs that have appeared over the years triggered by spaces and other unusual characters in file names. If you do anything with subprocesses or path processing, it&#39;s absurdly easy to hit in a thousand different ways, over and over again.Pro tip: rename your development directory (or even better: the workspace path in CI) to put a space and/or special characters in it.Forces you to deal with this properly, and immediately ensures that every automated test checks this case without you having to remember every time. Hasn&#39;t been particularly inconvenient, since I&#39;m autocompleting it 99% of the time anyway, and I haven&#39;t shipped a single path parsing bug since."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have recently joined a team that had invested in Svelte. I had previous experience in Angular and React. I was happy with React, but I decided to drink the koolaid and go all-in and do my best with Svelte.6 months later, we&#39;re moving to React. It is partly because our Svelte code was messy enough to warrant a rewrite, and partly because we wanted to leverage the React ecosystem in that rewrite. It was also partly because I just don&#39;t like Svelte very much.I think Svelte is clever, and interesting, and I&#39;m glad it exists. But I found a few points insurmountable:- Too much magic. The abstraction leaks and when it does, it requires a good mental model of Svelte&#39;s magic. I noticed this threw our juniors off.- Special syntax for reactivity is not javascript- I find the javascript-native flexibility of JSX far more expressive than any custom templating- There are major tradeoffs made by doing things at compile time. Things that are easy in React at runtime turn out to be surprisingly difficult in Svelte- Two-way data binding is a constant source of bugs- Svelte practically requires let-style variable rebinding, often at a file wide scope, which again caused our juniors in particular to write bad code- The style system is too opinionated for me. I also find it necessary to break into the global scope for any minor restyling of a subcomponent (or worse, pass in the style as a prop)- Built in reactive store is cool, but our developers all ended up using it for tight coupling and global variables- The strict one component per file approach can be cumbersome. It&#39;s not possible to write a one-line function component or similar- Much smaller ecosystem than React, requiring much more to be done in house (exacerbated by all of the above).- The faster runtime speed in no way made up for any of the above. Bad Svelte code is still slow compared to good React code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this should be great news for Svelte and SvelteKit! Hopefully with Vercel&#39;s backing these projects will fly off.Having worked with React for about 5 years (with a project in Vue in-between) and now having dabbled with Svelte, there is just something more appealing working with less higher-level abstractions. Sure with large apps React does have its benefits and its ecosystem is larger by a good amount.But there is just something about being less annoying that to me is perhaps one of the most important things with any tool. If I enjoy using it, I don&#39;t mind that it may not be the &#34;current best choice&#34; of the moment. People who enjoy MobX especially I think ought to find Svelte quite nice.Sure though would wish SvelteKit was at the same level with Next.js. Fixing dev server errors is a little distracting at times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like a huge positive step forward for Svelte and the community. Big congrats to Rich!I&#39;ve been excited about Svelte for a while and recently chose to use it as the UI for a cross-platform video editing app (https://getrecut.com), with the back end in Rust. I&#39;ve found it a pleasure to work with -- Svelte Stores and the Context system are especially great for sharing state, and the app feels snappy. Last few weeks most of the focus has been on the Rust backend but I&#39;m really looking forward to building out more of the UI soon.I&#39;ve also been happy to find that its generated code is pretty readable. On one little performance-tuning side quest, I was profiling to figure out why the app was performing a Layout on every video frame, and I was able to step through the compiled Svelte component code and narrow it down to one of my own functions. I also briefly went down a path of trying to manually set the text content on an element, to see if it&#39;d be faster than letting Svelte do it. Turned out the answer was no, but it was nice to know that level of control is available if I need it some day.Excited to see where the Svelte community goes from here!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is something very fulfilling (at least to me) about working this way. Not solving the problem in the best way, but solving it in the way you can _right now_. When I was younger this was how I solved most problems, but in my professional life I can&#39;t really do that (and for mostly good reasons).I follow someone on YouTube who moved to a small island in Panama, built his house, many boats, and lots of other items by hand using what he has. He is definitely crazy but he personifies this get it done attitude. A few years ago I travelled to Africa to volunteer at a hospital and was tasked with fixing an oxygen machine. I had to channel this YouTuber because there definitely was not the right tools and I definitely needed to get it done. I honestly surprised myself in how I was able to fix it and it was quite fulfilling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an 80s tv show called MacGyver which impressed on me as a kid that you can use what you got to get out of tricky situations.  I&#39;ve done loads of different things as a result of this attitude.  The only time I stopped to think about the show&#39;s wider influence was when I was at University (some time ago) in the Engineering building with my best friend (an Engineering student) and a phone went off with the MacGyver theme.  When I told my friend I thought that was cool (these were the days when you had to pay for novelty ringtones) he casually remarked that a lot of the Engineering student body had the MacGyver ringtone and MacGyver had a huge influence on students enrolling for Engineering.After reading this article I wonder if there are MacGyver-esque influences on younger generations?  I haven&#39;t come across any YouTube channels or shows on Netflix, Prime or Disney Plus that would interest my 7 year old son and capture his imagination like MacGyver did for me as a kid.Having said that, in true MacGyver fashion I started teaching my son Chemistry last weekend using a whiteboard, YouTube and some Minecraft analogies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"s/genius/resourceful and creative/gThat&#39;s not a slight. But being resourceful (and creative, of course) is what was displayed. There was no evidence of genius. Being resourceful and creative means using what you have on hand to achieve a goal.For example, I wanted to make a gift for a friend who loves dinosaurs. I used old bicycle parts and various bits of metal I had left over from other projects and made her a 3 foot tall T-Rex. She loved it! Money spent = $0. Am I a genius? Probably not. Was I resourceful and creative? Definitely.Perhaps for people who don&#39;t have a &#34;hack the world!&#34; mindset, it does appear as genius I suppose."</p>

Today saw a sharp selloff on the 10-year maturity, a favorite &#34;asset&#34; of foreign governments and companies. When those organizations get into trouble, they sell treasuries to raise cash. &#34;Trouble&#34; often comes in the form of dollar-denominated debt which must be serviced in dollars.As the dollar rises, borrowers of dollar-denominated debt must raise more local currency to buy the dollars to service their loans. That puts further upward pressure on the dollar, distressing foreign usd-debtholders even more. It&#39;s called a &#34;short squeeze&#34;:https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/The entire world (including the US federal government) has taken a short position on the US dollar by assuming obligations requiring them to pay later in dollars.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to know more about the &#34;built for devs&#34; concept you are presenting to us. What does that mean to you?For me personally, I rarely perform site:github.com or site:stackoverflow.com searches in my browser&#39;s default search engine. I typically just enter a few keywords and try to make sense of what I find.When I personally think of a search engine built for devs, I think of one that parses queries differently from the natural language processing that seems to be all the rage these days. For instance, when I search &#34;?. C#&#34; I want to know what this operator actually is. Instead,  the algorithm omits the ?. and just returns the most generic results relating to C#. https://you.com/search?q=%3F.%20C%23&amp;fromSearchBar=true This is true even when I put the &#34;?.&#34; in quotes. One of the results is titled &#34;Null coalescing operator&#34; from Wikipedia, but this is actually misleading since ?. is actually the null-conditional operator. The information is there but it is not easy to find.The other item on my wishlist for a dev-centric search engine is to be able to persist the main language(s) I am trying to search about. Its mildly tedious to type C3 and then my keywords (..... dammit, C#, this happens ALL the time), in each query to narrow things down and not get javascript results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google Maps may silently be Alphabet&#39;s most powerful property. As someone who has spent the last 8 months religiously degoogling my life, I&#39;ve found that Google Maps features are incredibly hard to replace, while at the same time, giving Google direct abilities to influence behavior in the physical world. People see it as &#34;just a map&#34;, but it&#39;s so much more. OSM-based map tools are pretty good as maps, but they utterly fail at being real-world information directories and functional tools for coordinating physical activities.I do have hope. It seems that there has been a lot of new enthusiasm for these tools lately, and some of them have key features in development.Two low hanging fruits: 1) location bookmarking features that can be synced between mobile/desktop with third party sync tools. 2) Link conversion features that can take Google Maps (or other map links) as input and open the location in OSM tools, and vice-versa.The real-world information directory is a much bigger challenge, but if the low hanging fruit features are developed enough that the average person could easily use open source / OSM tools for everything except a modern phone book, while still coordinating with peers who use Google Maps, then we&#39;d have a much better foundation for tackling the issue."</p>

Why can&#39;t they campaign for or against stuff, enlist their customers, and such. OTOH... Google are the gate to online information. Google &#34;lobbying&#34; is not like a normal company lobbying the public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; People will tell me to click that “unsubscribe” button. I will and swear I have before.Regarding this point, I&#39;ve had this suspicion of so many subscriptions – to the point where I was questioning my own memory/sanity on the regular. I finally set up a label in my Gmail inbox called &#34;Already Unsubscribed!&#34;. Every time I unsubscribe to a newsletter, I add a Gmail filter that marks anything from that sender with the &#34;Already Unsubscribed&#34; label. This way I know if I&#39;m just misremembering unsubscribing, or if I&#39;m actually being spammed.Incidentally, I just checked that label after about a year of doing this. As it turns out, there&#39;s only one company that&#39;s ever continued to email me after my unsubscribe request. So I guess my memory (or sanity) has been failing me all this time.(And no, the company is not Wikimedia) :P"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But open the email and you don’t see that text anywhere!In the email industry, we call this a &#34;pre-header&#34;. The bit about &#34;multi-part email&#34; is pure nonsense. If you put any text above the body, it won&#39;t render in the email but will still be parsed by the inbox preview function (since it ignores any html it sees). This was mostly an exploit back in the day, but clearly email clients love it because they doubled down on supporting it.Having a different from and reply-to is also built into the way email was designed. Both of these features are built into every email client and service.I thought this was going to be a complaint about their clearly hyperbolic messaging, but OP is really frustrated about some of the most basic features of email. I wonder if he has yet learned that the letters he gets from the White House are not actually sent from the White House."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bummer. I often use like vs dislike ratios as a gauge on whether a video is worth watching. If I see a 3,000 up / 48 down video on a topic I&#39;m interested in there&#39;s a really good chance the video is great.I&#39;m a small time creator (~13.5k subs) and don&#39;t care at all about upvotes or downvotes being public. There&#39;s only been a handful of videos out of hundreds that received more downvotes than expected because the video was posted on a place out of my control and folks didn&#39;t like that. Almost always if a video naturally gets downvoted it&#39;s because you either released something bad or unrelated to what your channel normally expects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a damned shame. I use dislikes to gauge if a video is relevant to the topic at hand.For example, I like fixing stuff and use Youtube for unfamiliar items. Often videos with a high number of dislikes are Spam (usually a bot reading text from some website), Videos where the person handwaves through the steps, videos where the fix is improper, or videos where the creator spends more time monetizing than working through the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So just to make sure I&#39;m reading this correctly (this is not my area of speciality so bear with me):This is Apple-hosted MDM, yes?I took a brief spin through this world on a consulting project a few years ago and I found it SUPER weird that Apple didn&#39;t do this already.  You had to do this weird dance between Apple Business Manager and the MDM solution (we ended up with SimpleMDM but looked at a bunch).  I kept saying &#34;Am I missing something?  Why doesn&#39;t this service come directly from Apple?&#34; and everyone was as puzzled about this as I was.  So I guess they&#39;re finally closing the loop here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart play to focus on businesses with fewer than 500 employees, as those are the most likely to grow in the next 3-7 years into larger accounts, and they don&#39;t have the 12-18mo sales cycle and shennanigans of an enterprise.It&#39;s a strategic departure from being a consumer luxury product company, and the shift to enterprise suggests they&#39;re out of ideas, but at the rate they&#39;re losing consumer growth I&#39;d say they&#39;ve still got another 150 years.
Leveraging the apple store as a service point is a huge deal, as it may compensate for the additional hardware premium their products cost.I&#39;ve worked in a large number of organizations as a consultant and the microsoft ecosystem is basically unusuable to me now. Between performance issues and thoughtless design, I switch back to my apple devices to do simple things and get real feedback from actions while I&#39;m waiting for the microsoft platform to respond. As a result, I manage client work on MSFT, and do real work on my mac. With Apple getting into this space, I can&#39;t see buying another microsoft product unless I actually hated the people I was hiring to use it.The essence of the apple experience is that by their products being designed to be responsive no matter what, you are always engaged and working on them for the feedback, whereas some MSFT error message means I&#39;m going to go do something else for 15-20m while I get past the gumption trap. Current one is having to reboot the machine to reset a VPN driver just to check client site email. MSFTs problem  isn&#39;t from lack of a solution, it&#39;s that the problem exists at all and as a user I am even aware of it.I have lots of issues with Apple&#39;s social decisions, and am switching out of their ecosystem because of it so I&#39;m not an uncritical fan, however, this announcement means they aren&#39;t just getting into enterprise, they&#39;re getting upstream of it and in 10-20 years they will have replaced a lot of it. They&#39;re dropping in on a macro trend wave that is how work itself is going to be different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish they had a better MDM for kids... All I want to do is ensure that NextDNS is installed/forced and that they can&#39;t remove it.  Somehow, if you block store, block adding apps and block removing apps and hide the icons, kids still figure out how to remove the damn thing and the only thing you can do to block it is set a 1 minute time limit (why can&#39;t you set 0 minutes? wtf apple?) and hope they don&#39;t stay up until midnight to click through in 1 minute and slide the slider to off (or figure out how to get into settings/network/dns and disable - which why can&#39;t the limits limit that??)"</p>

As someone with Ø in my name, and both Å and Ø in my address, don&#39;t get me started on poorly written systems which cannot handle unicode properly. I&#39;ve seen my name and address mangled in shipping forms, in airline tickets (every time) and even in my marriage-papers since I married abroad.I literally have personal reasons for getting everyone, and I mean everyone, on the unicode bandwagon.That said... Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a child of the late 70s and early 80s and learned to program on computers which simply didn&#39;t have non-ASCII characters at all...But can&#39;t we all just sit down and admit that allowing non-ASCII characters in programming-language identifiers was a bad idea? Can&#39;t we in the next revision of EcmaScript (or Rust, or whatever) mandate ASCII-only identifiers when in strict mode or using modules or whatever? Having invisible characters represent executable code is not just a dumb a idea, it&#39;s so hazardous that you might call it borderline malicious.There has to be some way to undo this damage, without breaking compatibility with the code which is already out there, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few things people seem to be missing in this thread:- This ruling doesn&#39;t allow for supplanting IAPs, as the it only prevents Apple from prohibiting external links to alternatives. So apps still aren&#39;t allowed to have in-app payment alternatives, they can have a link to something else, and AFAICT they can still mandate an IAP option should be present if the app has such a link, like they do with &#34;Sign in with Apple&#34;.- If that sounds familiar, that&#39;s because it is: this isn&#39;t too far off from the agreement Apple reached with the JFTC that allowed &#34;reader apps&#34; (think Netflix, Kindle, Spotify) to have a link to an external website to set up user accounts: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-comm...- This is extremely unlikely to hurt Apple&#39;s profit margins all that much, because the judge also rules that Apple was entitled to a licensing fee, which it could still claim for payments made outside Apple&#39;s IAP system. This point is probably why Apple is fighting the ruling, because with external links they might have to put a lot of effort into getting their cut, as opposed to what Google did with their payment alternatives - i.e. adding a &#34;service fee&#34; to in app transactions but allowing alternative payment services. (This might not apply to the exception carved out for &#34;reader apps&#34;)Essentially, nobody wins. Even in the best case scenario, Apple will probably keep a significant portion (but not all) of its cut, developers still have to pay through the nose and users will probably stick with Apple&#39;s IAP if the provider can&#39;t make a significant difference, and can&#39;t sideload apps that the App Store won&#39;t allow. Yay!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple and Google transformed mobile into a poisonous experience. Apart from being constantly spied, you don&#39;t get to decide what you can do with your own device. You can&#39;t install software unless is approved by them and if it is, you have to also pay them.As a developer, if you target iOS and Android your app should not compete with their apps, you have to get it approved and you have to get them a 30% cut for nothing.Why can&#39;t installing software on mobiles work exactly like on desktop?"</p>

Stripe was easy and I could rapidly test almost every scenario (cancellations, deferments, non payment,el etc).  Apple and Google?  Good luck, you basically have to test in production to figure out all the corner cases for your users.As a solo dev, being able to choose my payment processor would let me focus on delivering real features and value instead of app store toil."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The current state of the Windows Store is a holdover from the early 2010&#39;s where &#34;number of apps in our app store&#34; became a huge KPI and something for the CEO to tout to the board of directors. Apple and Google kept bragging about these numbers at their respective developer conferences/yearly refresh unveilings and therefore Microsoft was all too happy to accept any and all apps into the Windows Store at the time in an attempt to appear relevant.Times have changed, though, and you could argue that now many people would like less app clutter and easier discoverability of the apps they actually want. What end user is benefitting from all these carpetbagger apps squatting on Firefox&#39;s brand? I don&#39;t know what the policy or action looks like to clean this up without instituting heavy hand moderation of the Windows Store but I feel like something has to be done. The way it is now is unsustainable if you want the store to have any value at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve gone down this rabbitole before, and yes, there are things that take two hours, and there are things that take a lot more. The problem is the scope - ie. are you trying to do what you said you&#39;ll do (miniature software to log urls), or are you adding 100s of requirements to the scope (gui, filters, privacy,...).We had a bunch of .xml files containing some data, and someone wanted a .csv file... sure, an hour max, and it&#39;s done. Fire up some perl, loop, xml-&gt;hash, take the data needed, print line by line, done... less than an hour.&#34;Hey, can you add just this and that, and separate folders for this and a total and rolling sum?&#34;...yeah sure... hour or two.&#34;and this and that?&#34;...sure, another hour...&#34;Can this be made for that department to use.. just add a simple gui&#34;...and we&#39;ve gone from an hour or two, to weeks or months of work.  Nobody wanted a gui application made for &#34;normal users&#34;, with all the checks and verifications and documentation and everything when you made a request... the scope was a simple one-off script, and that actually took an hour or two.  This is like requesting a bicycle, than wanting to add a hitch for a boat trailer and making it higway-legal. And the added problem is, that your script never intended to do &#34;all of this&#34;, and you either have to rewrite it from scratch, or you software looks like &#34;the Burrow&#34; (from harry potter)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A few students came to me asking if I had any ideas for a software project that they could work on outside of class.&gt; I explained an idea for a utility that I had been wanting: A desktop program that monitors my clipboard for URLs and logs them automatically.I think this person misunderstood the students, the student wanted a project to practice programming, not a project to practice project management. The programming parts of this would take 2-4 hours, it isn&#39;t a terribly hard thing to code. All the project management parts would take days or weeks or even months or years depending on how polished you want it to be.Giving them a project management project because in your mind project management is more important just to prove a point doesn&#39;t help them at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The whole notion of online proctoring seems pretty whack to me also: what world are we training and testing people to live in?  The real world has internet, you can search for stuff, you can work from home and take a break.I&#39;m not good at things because I&#39;m always able to magically materialize the right answer out of my mind inside an anechoic faraday chamber, I&#39;m good because I get the right answer in a reasonable amount of time using all the tools available to me (the internet, my brain, books, whatever).I get that there are a few professions where you&#39;re really going to need to know the right answer quickly without looking it up under high-pressure situations, and it seems like testing and certifying doctors and lawyers is important enough to society that we can arrange to proctor those tests in person (and still maintain covid safety, disability/poverty access, etc).  That level of extreme proctoring security seems pretty dumb for random exams WHERE school &lt;= undergrad.If you elaborately cheat your way through all online classes all the way through undergrad, that seems mostly bad for you"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proctor-spyware is also famously biased:
https://library.auraria.edu/news/2021/why-online-test-procto...I opted out of using spyware in the university physics courses I taught last year, and caught my cheating students the old fashioned way. Proctor-spyware, like airport security, is more about theater than effectiveness. You aren&#39;t giving the USMLE or a Bar Exam, so you can take the time to write a good exam and evaluate it correctly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They also are terrible at how they treat your local machine. I had to use them for a course I was in. I was having issues connecting because they kept insisting I used some Flash based tool. Their proctor started going into various settings on my Mac, clicking rather carelessly and what seemed like at random then declared the platform was unsupported. I immediately said &#34;ok, so now your going to return my machine back to the state that it was in before you started messing around...&#34; They immediately dodged the question and ended the chat. It took 3 more attempts to even get the test started and like a week to find all the damage they did to my settings. Terrible company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always loved playing video games. From the moment I realized there were places called arcades with wonderful machines that ate your coins, I was hooked. Game and Watch? Nagged my mom for every single one. Nintendo Famicom? We had ALL the bootleg cartridges. Gameboy? Couldn&#39;t afford it so I burned with envy. Original Xbox? I have 4 of &#39;em stashed away somewhere. Playstation 1-5? Heck, yeah. Mobile? My husband bought our first iPad because we saw someone playing Angry Birds on it. PC? I&#39;m playing The Ascent with my whole family right now.More than playing video games, though, what I wanted to do as a kid was to MAKE games. I still remember punching in a borrowed Mario Bros cartridge for the first time, pressing START and having a freaking epiphany. How cool was it that someone MADE this?? To heck with being an astronaut, when I grew up, I was going to do THIS. I knew it with all the certainty of 8-year-old me. But you know how it goes: like most childhood dreams, I put this one on a shelf and gradually left it behind. I didn&#39;t become an astronaut either (in case you were wondering).What I did was drop out of university in my third year. And since then, I&#39;ve been a copywriter, graphic designer, business owner, immigrant, stay-at-home spouse, and for a long time, the stay-at-home parent. And it&#39;s been great.  Life with all its up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A&#39;s...it&#39;s all been wonderful.&#34;Hold up,&#34; you might say, if you&#39;re still reading this. &#34;Why are you telling us all this? Boring.&#34;Right. Let me get to it. I&#39;m 48 and if there&#39;s a lesson that has been inescapable these past two years is that we may not see tomorrow. So, I&#39;ve decided to focus on happiness in the here and now. Carpet diem, as my kid used to say when he was little. And you know one thing that has added to my happiness? Dusting off my dream, sitting my ass down and finally learning how to be a game developer. And happier still? I&#39;ve done this with my husband.So we&#39;ve published our first mobile game. It&#39;s called &#34;Slingshot Effect&#34; and it&#39;s available on App Store or on Google Play. It&#39;s an infinite jumper that&#39;s easy to just pick up and play. Perfect for commutes or if you&#39;re stuck in a waiting room somewhere. It&#39;s a paid app because we feel strongly that the level of monetization in the casual game space is just...ugh...it&#39;s bad.  Thanks for listening, I really appreciate it.TLDR:
When I was a kid, I wanted to make video games. And now that I&#39;m kind of old, my husband and I made one.App Store:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats! It&#39;s absolutely refreshing to dust off an old hobby and do something with it!I&#39;m only 28, but during the pandemic I decided to dust off my old electronics hobbies that fell by the wayside when the mobile app boom started.Middle school and early high school me thought I was going into robotics, but the iPhone came out the year I started high school. When the App Store came out the following year, the smartphone revolution started, and about a year later I went all in on mobile apps and gaming for the rest of high school and my college years. Contract iOS and Unity3D work got me through college.It&#39;s somewhat ironic, because I haven&#39;t written or worked on a single mobile app since I left college (nor have I owned an Apple device). I ended up taking all of the knowledge of embedded Linux systems I gained doing robotics and started doing esoteric high performance storage virtualization systems as the starting point of my career. Never saw that one coming.I hadn&#39;t really done any serious hobby electronics in nearly a decade, but I&#39;ve continued to lug all of the equipment around every time I move. So, I dusted off some old hardware and got hooked once again, only to find out that the AVR is old news and everyone is into ESP32 and ARM these days :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@bananabat, congrats on launching your game and on your beautiful write up here. It made me remember Randy Pausch‘a famous “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams”, better known as “The Last Lecture.” (https://youtu.be/ji5_MqicxSo). Like many others, I remember being deeply touched by it. It is ultimately being about a man reflecting on a life well lived and achieving some childhood dreams like this is part of it.It is wonderful that you have been able to do something you find worthy in and of its self and find fulfillment here. Thank you for sharing."</p>

I wish they had mentioned the actual effect on CPU.Compare to the recent thread &#34;The LZ4 introduced in PostgreSQL 14 provides faster compression&#34; [0] where the loudest voices were saying that zstd would not work due to increased CPU.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is super good. Again, the point is not Europe in and of itself, but also India and China.The demand for power in India and China is outstripping everyone else. And it is still stuck using coal power. India and China do NOT have land (for renewables) commensurate with the population or energy demand.
Also one of the biggest sources of renewable hydro power is a  geopolitical flashpoint for India vs China (https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/china-proposed...). Almost a hundred soldiers died in an India vs China battle recently around this area.Both India and China have unilaterally rejected COP26 restrictive measures from developed nations... simply because it is not possible to reduce the power demand coming from populations (the size of Europe) being lifted up from poverty.The only answer for the next 50 years is nuclear tech. And France is literally the only game in town right now. So let us pray, this happens sooner than later. You do NOT want coal from 2 BILLION people in the atmosphere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Macron said &#34;We are going, for the first time in decades, to relaunch the construction of nuclear reactors in our country&#34;.
This is a blatant lie, as France launched a project and never ceased trying to build.  However it failed flat.The last delivered reactor was Civaux-2 (generation II), in 1999. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civaux_Nuclear_Power_PlantThen in 2002 the project Flamanville-3 was launched (a generation III reactor, the &#34;EPR&#34;, first one of its kind), and the building phase started in 2007.  It is a major failure, not delivered, at least 11 years behind schedule, and will cost at least 19.1 billion euros (initial budget: 3.4 billions €).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this book would be perfect for me - I have been using Emacs for quite a while, but never mastered elisp: I could never figure out how to structure things properly.Looking at the book landing page, I think I would have passed on it because the Table of Contents make it look a bit like the book is just covering specific tasks (about rearranging sentences) rather than general tasks, like using best practices for creating packages.It would be good to include the paragraph from your blog in the book landing page:    In the first chapter, it tells you basically how to find Elisp functions doing things you need.
    In the second, longest chapter, it walks you through writing a complete, useful package, showcasing lots of Elisp features and good practices.
    In the third, last chapter, it hints at a few more advanced techniques – functional programming, lexical scoping and regular expressions.

This made me a lot more excited about the contents!"</p>

Most people aren’t getting materially more stuff or even need that much more stuff, consumption’s already god damn conspicuous.Maybe everyone can afford a jet ski all of a sudden? No, the stims didn’t really do /that/ kind of wealth expansion.To me, this still looks like the bullwhip effect, which is expected to have an outsized effect on demand over at least a year or two.Buyers, who got used to “just in time” shipping, got spooked by shipping delays and shortages from their suppliers, because of supply demand imbalances during shutdowns, and as a response they all put in orders for 2 to 3 times the amount they usually buy from their suppliers with the intent of rebuilding domestic stock so they don’t miss out on sales.All of a sudden, aggregate demand explodes.Shocking."</p>

I suggest reading Paul Krugman and Claudia Sahm for dovish views, or Adam Ozimek for a more critical view. In particular, the idea that “inflation expectations” can perpetuate inflation via a self-fulfilling prophecy effect has been called into question lately: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2021062pap..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll take this opportunity to mention one of my favorite apps: Paprika [0].It&#39;s a recipe app that can import from just about every recipe site/blog/etc and if it can&#39;t auto-import it then you can use the really easy tools to grab all the pertinent information. Once imported you can edit/scale/rate/tag/categorize/etc the recipe. Furthermore it has meal planning tools and a grocery list built in. I love the grocery list feature because you can easily click &#34;Add to Grocery List&#34; (of which you can have multiple if you want) and then just uncheck all the things you already have. It has a &#34;Pantry&#34; feature but I&#39;ve never used it, I assume it will auto-uncheck items you already have when you go to add them to the grocery list but I&#39;m not sure about that.It&#39;s great to import a recipe and then tweak it after making it and see what works/doesn&#39;t so you don&#39;t have to find the recipe again later and/or remember the changes you made to it.It&#39;s cross platform (Mac/iOS/Windows/Android) and running it on an older tablet in my kitchen is an awesome experience (timers built in, switch between multiple recipes easily, cross out ingredients after adding them, etc).I have no connection to the company, I just love the app. If I had 1 request it would be a way to share recipes with friends through some &#34;social&#34;/&#34;friend-ing&#34; concept in the app (not using a social network). You can share a &#34;.paprikarecipe&#34; file that includes everything about the recipe but passing around a file isn&#39;t always easy and Discord just cuts off extensions longer than like 12 characters which makes it harder.[0] https://www.paprikaapp.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Although the exemption protects people who circumvent digital copyright protections for the sake of accessibility — by using third-party programs to lift text and save it in a different file format, for example — that it&#39;s even necessary strikes many as a fundamental injustice.This is not only an injustice, but also a stupidity. What I do with something I paid for should concern only me as long as it&#39;s within my personal bounds (no redistribution, no profit, no business, etc.) Breaking DRM for personal use should not and cannot be illegal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years ago, I wrote the code specification for our ebook conversions. I made a priority of specifying good semantic structure, employ ARIA tags where needed, etc. I work for a university and there was yet no mandate for it, but it seemed only a matter of time. In the long run being a little ahead of the curve aid paid off, but now I need to go through and revise things to account for changing standards, and my own improved (I hope) understanding of what&#39;s needed.I&#39;m also reminded of an incident years ago when I was working in a New York, and an agent (for a popular, well-paid writer) called our contract department from my desk phone to insist they remove the clause allowing the LOC to make audiobooks for the blind. As agent crimes go, it might not be the worst, but it always struck me for how egregiously petty it was."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run forums, I write forum software, I am pro forums.However I&#39;d also add that it&#39;s important how to engage with a forum.My top tips:1. Financially fund a forum, but have the enthusiasts run it so it is arms length but official. If you run it, spin it up as a distinct thing so that future independence is possible and easy.2. Bless it fully, point everything you have at it and have your support staff answer questions, and allow your engineers to go deep on details where they can. Transparency wins, if you can&#39;t do it don&#39;t run a forum.3. Have someone else run it... That was #1, but it means &#34;Don&#39;t moderate away dissenting voices&#34;. You will never have a more vocal and clear line of feedback to help you improve, you might not like it... your job is to either listen and learn, or to explain why you are where you are and not going to do something, etc. People aren&#39;t dumb, &#34;for money&#34; is a fine argument, but don&#39;t use moderation to silence feedback you don&#39;t like.4. Forums are great for content that ages well, know your audience... it&#39;s not only the person you&#39;re replying to, it&#39;s the 1,000 visitors who will never create an account but found this issue via a search engine.5. Don&#39;t use moderation to silence feedback you don&#39;t like! (Also #1 and #3). Don&#39;t even use threats of &#34;we&#39;re withdrawing support&#34; or &#34;unblessing&#34;... these are your users and customers, listen to them rather than fight against them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh please do.  This seems like the perfect time to bring this up:I had a piece of software that used Discord for support.  They required that users be verified, which requires you to give you phone number to Discord.  I gave them my Google Voice number, which is the only number I have, and they rejected it because they don&#39;t support VOIP numbers.  I asked them if there was any other way to verify my identity.They told me, &#34;Just use a friend&#39;s phone to verify.  As long as they don&#39;t try to verify on Discord in six months it should be fine, we won&#39;t check again&#34;.Their official answer to identity verification was to impersonate someone else!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just wish people would use a system that&#39;s integrated into where the code is. I don&#39;t want to have to register for a forum when GitHub has a perfectly good ticketing system (and now discussions), and yet I have to register at another place where my details can be leaked from because who knows the technical capability of this one single person who may or may not have done any security.If it&#39;s a company, please have the forum integrated into your software.I seriously do not want yet another login unless there is a good reason. It&#39;s ridiculous. I have nearly 700 logins in my password manager and I&#39;d say probably 500 of those items are websites I&#39;ve registered once to ask a question (quite often questions that go unanswered). Half of these forums do not even provide the capability to removing my account without contacting the admins, which is just an unnecessary hassle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bing image search has solved this problem.For each result you can see multiple pages that include the image. It also shows the resolution and file size of each version. I did a test search for &#34;bear&#34; and clicked on the first result. It showed 14 different pages containing the same image with different sizes and possibly slightly different crops. You can also select a subsection of the image to search for that.It makes Google image search feel like an old school internet tool. I know Bing isn&#39;t cool or popular, but their image search is undeniably superior.I don&#39;t think we need to blame Pinterest for having indexable content. This is a failing of Google image search for not showing alternate matches for the same image.Bing has it figured out. I can&#39;t tell if Google just doesn&#39;t care enough about image search to implement it, or if there&#39;s some obscure patent preventing them from doing so."</p>

Same story if somehow 1 license = 1 target. This is something that I don&#39;t think was explored enough in DD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be fair, it is quite murky to what extent groups like Al-Haq are associated with the PFLP (which, with its history of aircraft hijackings and suicide bombings, is undoubtedly a terrorist group).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me Hot Reload is the most important feature, which will very likely be a reason for me to move a bit from Python over to .NET, which I haven&#39;t touched for 10 years. Back then I really used it a lot (after moving away from OLE/DCOM/ActiveX), in C++, Managed C++, C# and IronPython (no GIL!). I absolutely loved it, but it was limited to the Microsoft ecosystem.Yesterday, while randomly googling for &#34;hot reload&#34; I got aware of the drama which went down around two weeks ago, when Microsoft decided to remove this feature from the release, even after including it in the previews.Here is a good summary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_pzDjw9HQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In .NET 6, in-memory single file apps have been enabled for Windows and macOS. In .NET 5, this deployment type was limited to Linux. You can now publish a single-file binary that is both deployed and launched as a single file, for all supported OSes. Single files apps no longer extract any core runtime assemblies to temporary directories.This is a great! Now I can publish statically linked executables and run it everywhere. I don&#39;t have to tolerate Golang and its quirks just to have cross-compilation and static binaries, even though they will be larger in size."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Supported for three years as the latest long term support (LTS) release.This is the first thing I look for in these announcements.  .NET 6 is the successor to .NET Core 3.1."</p>

Why not get a PC that you can automatically use for other things, can play games from any vendor etc (some of the issues mentioned in the thread).Are consoles cheaper “per transistor” or sth? If so, why? Is it about the vendor locking you in and charging more per game? That would seem even more skewed against the buyer: buy this pseudo-pc so we can sell you expensive, limited-choice software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So for context I looked at the papers behind the scenarios.- The heart rate sensing is done on a smart watch, not a phone, and needs data from the actual heart rate sensor every couple of days [1].- The breathing rate is determined from a phone put on the breast or the abdomen [2]. Not really a threat vector in that form.- The audio stuff is incredibly impressive [3], but it doesn&#39;t look like they can reconstruct text with meaningful reliability, it&#39;s more about identifying the person or at least the gender of the person on the other end of the line.The location and activity detection scenarios seem the most credible to me, but the for targeted attacks the audio reconstruction might also work. The other two don&#39;t really seem credible to me yet, but good to be aware of them.1: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04667.pdf2: http://www.ijetch.org/vol8/900-M302.pdf3: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05972.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Facebook reads the accelerometer all the time. Facebook actually shows a support prompt if a shake event is detected across the app. This could be one reason why Facebook reads accelerometer data.No. Shake gestures are handled at the OS level and you only get began/changed/ended callbacks. Raw accelerometer data requires the CoreMotion framework, and it’s a lower level API. They are definitely using it for something else.This is also confirmed by this:&gt;The prompt has an option to switch this feature off. However, switching it off doesn’t stop the app from reading the accelerometer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, if this social app is reading accelerometer data on your phone as well as the passenger’s phone, the app can easily figure out that both phones experience the same vibration pattern. ... Don’t be surprised if you receive a recommendation from the app to add this passenger as a friend.Overall I find the article interesting but this quote is borderline tinfoily. Given the amount of noise in the accelerometer data and signal s much closer to the sensor than the bus itself - such as body movements, it would be hardly precise. Moreover the cost of doing all that research and computation as well as data transfer would hardly pay off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; A futuristic dystopia. A place where the real world sucks. Where people consider talking to someone a chore. Connection, closeness, ambition are replaced by detachment and dogmatic slumber. Society is satisfied with shallow thoughts and the pursuit of artificially created stimuli in an imaginary world.Beautifully written top-notch orwellian poetry. Seriously inspiring.Also as someone who has only ever used social media as a low-level content creator (we used to be called deadbeat artists) I feel like this starts an important conversation about the new problems that develop when you stop consuming and start doing.In my experience over the last  decade there are fewer and fewer ways to find a community and any success as a creator of any kind without getting corralled into social media and furthermore getting corralled into being a daily active user / consumer as to not get shadow banned by any given app.Doing rather than consuming feels much healthier than doom scrolling, but theres a larger dialogue that has to happen about the problems with creating in the 21st century imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This may not be terribly popular, and its admittedly just conjecture, but I&#39;m of the opinion that its less about the quantity of social media, and more how one interacts with it and even more so consumes it.Some platforms are clearly more toxic than others, though I&#39;m increasingly of the opinion that they are all pretty toxic, just different flavors of &#34;world outlooks&#34; to choose from.I feel that those that actively participate (commenting, posting, responding, reacting) are more affected and more caught in the feedback loop. Those that more or less passively read these platforms, rarely interact, and largely work to keep &#34;perspective&#34; seem to have less of a tough time on it and allow it to impact their outlooks and moods less.Those that tend to interact more seem to get caught in a sort of feedback loop. measured/Nuanced/Moderate or considerate takes are generally frowned upon on most of the major platforms these days. Outrage and simplistic viewpoints reign supreme, and most will bury the rest, forcing even those with moderate stances to either &#34;consider a side&#34; when continuing or just outright not partake. And all of these seem to be, relatively speaking, vocal minorities.There are plenty of people that consume stuff and just dont have anything useful to say, or just dont have the energy to say it and defend it etc. Of course this seems to depend on the platform as well, for example I would never post this take on reddit....With that said, I go agree generally, that these are toxic and create unbalanced viewpoints and world views. As Dave Chappelle said, &#34;twitter isnt real&#34;, and to an effect that true. Twitter, reddit, youtube, facebook, dont necessarily pan out to the larger population&#39;s opinion as a whole, at least where its measured (such as in politics and polling)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another day, another person telling you how to live your life...Sorry, but even though we know social media has its downsides, it also has advantages: keeping in touch with friends, socializing, a way to stay up to date with your community, new recipe ideas, exercise ideas, time management ideas, maybe even the occasional envy that someone&#39;s success triggers more ambition in you to succeed etc.It&#39;s a tool, like any other, and if used properly it can enhance your life.Don&#39;t want to dunk too hard on this article, because the points made in it are valid. But they can be achieved while you&#39;re still active on social media.For example, if used properly, you can get exposed to a lot of novel ideas in 2-minute bite sized clips. You can get motivated to hit any of the points mentioned in the blog.Saying that, of course the article was written to be a very one-sided view on the topic. Given that, it&#39;s obviously going to be shared on social media and garner even more attention / clicks / eyeballs. It&#39;s not ... irony per-se, but something close to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we create decentralized library (catalog) protocol, so it can&#39;t be taken down? I&#39;m thinking about libgen/sci-hub/whatcd(RIP), but entirely decentralized, protocol-based. We already have basically all necessary tools: BitTorrent/IPFS to distribute files, magnet links to link them, DHT to discover peers. We just need to combine them together in a smart way and maybe add some bits of missing functionality, like:- categorization and search;- voting for every entry;- maybe reputation system. Where peers regularly publishing good, high quality content get their &#39;karma&#39;[1] upvoted. So when downloading you can choose people with higher reputation. Or when building catalog of materials in certain area of interest, you can filter only peers with certain threshold karma.- incentive for peers to keep seeding whatever they downloaded at least until achieving certain ratio (say, 2:1). Maybe by rewarding with &#39;torrent tokens&#39; that you can spend on downloading, commenting etc.[2]- comments to every entry (published torrent). With means to combat spam, insults, irrelevant stuff etc. E.g. with voting system, where comments with, say, -3[3] votes become collapsed. Or/and with aforementioned &#39;tokens&#39; that you spend when comment.- personal blacklists to block people whose torrents/comments you don&#39;t want to see.Maybe I&#39;m reinventing the wheel here and something similar already exists, but for some reason not popular (since I never heard of it)? In that case we need to figure out why it didn&#39;t shoot and fix it to make it work.[1] Your ID will be a cryptographic key a la cryptocurrency wallet.[2] With rare but sought after torrents rewarding you with more tokens.[3] Personally adjustable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Master Foo and the RecruiterA technical recruiter, having discovered that that the ways of Unix hackers were strange to him, sought an audience with Master Foo to learn more about the Way. Master Foo met the recruiter in the HR offices of a large firm.The recruiter said, “I have observed that Unix hackers scowl or become annoyed when I ask them how many years of experience they have in a new programming language. Why is this so?”Master Foo stood, and began to pace across the office floor. The recruiter was puzzled, and asked “What are you doing?”“I am learning to walk,” replied Master Foo.“I saw you walk through that door” the recruiter exclaimed, “and you are not stumbling over your own feet. Obviously you already know how to walk.”“Yes, but this floor is new to me.” replied Master Foo.Upon hearing this, the recruiter was enlightened.Source:  http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/recruiter.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t true at all. Its obvious for a senior/staff/principal engineer to claim that their skillset is infinitely transferrable to any job role that needs a staff level skillse, but its simply not true. There are tooling agnostic skills you learn (managing complexity, upleveling team members, how to actually be a technical leader and make improvements that a manager doesn&#39;t explicitly tell you to do) and there are tooling specific skills that you need in an organization (EX: dependency management in java, performance issues in certain DBs, the unwritten/not explicit API issues in different cloud platforms). If I am hiring for a staff engineer, I will be trying to get the combination of &#34;tooling agnostic&#34; staff engineering skills AND &#34;tooling specific&#34; staff engineering skills for my job opening because you don&#39;t end up paying more for an engineer that has a well matched &#34;tooling specific&#34; skillset, but they will be more productive. The net cost to me as an employer is simply time, I might need to source 3x the candidates to get a good fit, but its worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly disagree.A senior engineer that has always worked in the backend won&#39;t be able to be up to speed with a complex frontend app quickly and be as effective as a senior frontend.There&#39;s just too much to know about browsers and underlying tech and a myriad it things.Same for a senior frontend starting to work on a complex backend all with god knows how many interconnected technologies.Being able to go from JS to TS? Sure. Being able to go from JS to Rust + Docker + (all your backend stuff here) not so much."</p>
