								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bartosz&#39; blog posts are in a league of their own.They way he is able to explain complex subjects by starting from first principles, gently adding more and more layers, with beautiful, custom-made figures and animations is truly, literally, awesome.I strongly recommend supporting the author via his Patreon if you enjoy his blog posts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"+1 for the recommendation for &#34;The Scientist and Engineer&#39;s Guide to
Digital Signal Processing&#34; by Steven W. Smith. I spoke to Steven many
years ago about his putting all of the book PDFs online for free and
since then have recommended at least 5 university libraries to buy it
because the students could get free copies of a great book that can be
referenced in the library.FWIW the The Scientist and Engineer&#39;s Guide doesn&#39;t actually cover a
lot on sound. It starts in a particular DSP way with frequency domain
definitions and convolution - and I actually think Steven&#39;s background
is in medial imaging, though I could be mistaken."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Instagram&#39;s tagging system was actually really effective at categorizing content and discovery because each hashtag was treated as a node in a (giant) graph, where each node has multiple properties, including post count (number of posts using a tag), &#39;velocity&#39; (number of posts using a particular tag per unit time), etc. I could write up a big post about it as I made a study of it in when I created a web app for finding the most relevant tags a few years ago.All that to say there was a lot to their system and it worked because users became aware that they were rewarded for using the most relevant tags. Using irrelevant tags was punished. This guided users towards using a mix of relevant popular and niche tags to maximize their reach, which, in turn, further improved the tagging system.Instagram&#39;s tagging system isn&#39;t as important anymore as their algorithm has deemphasized it, in favor of other methods for classification and discovery, but there were a couple of golden years where it worked very well. Most users still look back on those years as the &#39;good times&#39; even if they don&#39;t know exactly why. I&#39;d go so far as to say they ruined the app after they deemphasized tags (and added way too many ads)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I adore tagging systems and have worked on them in several different applications and implementations, but there are always pitfalls and trade offs, and it’s possible to bury yourselfNowadays I nearly always store the assigned tags as an integer array column in Postgres, then use the intarray extension to handle the arbitrary boolean expression searches like “((1|2)&amp;(3)&amp;(！5))”. I still have a tags table that stores all the metadata / hierarchy / rules, but for performance I don’t use a join table. This has solved most of my problems. Supertags just expand to OR statements when I generate the expression. Performance has been excellent even with large tables thanks to pg indexing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with the Wikipedia category system a few years ago, and you could see the problems with hierarchical tagging systems right in action back then. (Though it may have gotten better in the meantime)The system appeared simple: There were just two relations, &#34;Article A is a member of category B&#34; and &#34;Category X is a subcategory of category Y&#34;.However, in practice, the community was using this system to represent a whole host of wildly different relationships between items, often with different implications what a category actually applied to.E.g., if A has a subcategory B, this could mean one of several things: B might be an additional constraint on the items in A (&#34;American writers&#34; -&gt; &#34;19th century American writers&#34;), the things in B might be more specific than the things in A: (&#34;Writers&#34; -&gt; &#34;Novelists&#34;), A might apply to the concept B, not the things in B (&#34;Occupations&#34; -&gt; &#34;Writers&#34;) or A might refer to the category B (&#34;Categories with more than 100 entries&#34; -&gt; &#34;Writers&#34;) and on and on...Of course those different aspects could even be combined. E.g. &#34;Categories with more than 100 entries&#34; might have a child &#34;Categories with more than 100 entries in need of review&#34;, which represents a constraint but might itself contain less than 100 entries...The basic question &#34;Is item X in category Y&#34; becomes impossible to answer generally, because there is no clear indication if a category only applies to its direct children or to all of its descendants or only to the subcategories itself.I&#39;m sure there are sophisticated ontological systems which would allow users to specify all those different relationships separately. I&#39;m also pretty sure that users would become sloppy after a short time or would disagree which particular relationship to use in a particular situation..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; - Rounding of corners. Religion at this point&gt; - Homogenization. JetBrains wants to be like VSCode&gt; - Animations. Haven&#39;t seen them but it will be filledSeriously, HN? This is the quality that you reward with hundreds of points? Unlike the author, I happen to have used this UI for the past five months and it solves many of my longstanding gripes with IntelliJ:- Gutters are now much better at highlighting local changes, while also being less visually obtrusive.- The shaded tool window background nicely separates them from the editor- Showing the git branch next to the title makes it so much easier to understand where I am, when I work with multiple projects and branches.- Breadcrumbs in the Statusbar save some space and look much cleaner---Also, many of the complaints that I&#39;ve seen in this thread are either wrong or exaggerated:- &#34;Monochrome icons&#34; - Only the toolbar icons are monochrome, everything else still uses coloured icons.- &#34;The toolbar has less icons now&#34; - It&#39;s customisable, you can put whatever you want in there. Yes, with colourful icons.- &#34;More Whitespace&#34; - The vertical space from the top of the screen to the editor is the exact same. The Project view actually looses some vertical space, but only because the font size is bigger (Which you can change obviously). The spacing between the list items is the same according to a designer on Slack.- &#34;This is just some incompetent designer pushing their agenda on us, breaking my workflow because something something trends&#34; - go touch grass.And finally, just to be clear: no, there are no animations - everything is instant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eh, I have used vim, spacemacs, sublime, vscode, atom, eclipse and netbeans. Jetbrains IDEs have superior functionality out of the box across languages and don’t require me to mess with and debug a million plugins. I don’t mind a UI refresh, it’s going to be just like the gmail refresh everyone hated it and now we’re all fine with it.I just wish they would invest more money into things that are actually a problem currently like how slow indexing is and how disruptive it is when you do a clean re-install and it indexes all your dependencies again.I have tried spacemacs which gives a lot of functionality out the box with less configuration needed than DIY vim or emacs but it still just doesn’t compare to the ease of use of Jetbrains IDEs across languages (I use Java, Python, Ruby and Typescript every week)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seriously! Their slick, compact, and beautifully well laid out UI is one of the primary reasons I use I Intellij Idea.If they force this update, I&#39;ll just not update it. Not to mention, since I now will not be updating it, I can cancel my yearly, recurring subscription too.Hey Jetbrains: You just have to do one thing. And that is: to NOT mess up existing thing.Even if you stop launching new features into your product for next few years, I&#39;ll still happily pay you folks just because your product is so damn perfect as of now.Please don&#39;t ruin it. Forget what VSCode is doing. They are far far far behind you folks. Don&#39;t let THEM ruin your product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a situation once where we had a minor re-org and I ended up with a new manager. Literally day one, he made an attempt to change everyone&#39;s role. We were a team of developers and business analysts. He decided that everyone would become both and spend 50% of their time on each activity. Not sure why he thought this was a good idea, but he did.After he announced it, I had a 1x1 with him and clearly let him know that he was the boss and I&#39;d do my best to accomplish anything he assigned me. I also let him know that the business analyst duties didn&#39;t fit well with my skillset and that I would very likely struggle to produce output. We had a good, honest conversation about the situation and I ended up staying 100% as a developer. In the end he was happy and I was happy.Why am I telling you? It&#39;s that I&#39;ve learned it better to communicate and hopefully work things out then just pack up and head to another place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I think the concept of growth is a scam to get people to work harder for less. You can certainly grow your skill set, but intelligent people can rise to the occasion in most jobs. Including CEO/Director/High level decision making jobs.Everytime I have received some insultingly low offer from a startup, they start talking about &#34;growth&#34;, &#34;what I can own&#34;, &#34;wearing many hats&#34;. Meanwhile, the founder is sitting on some 40% equity grant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a leadership book called &#34;First Break all the Rules - What the World&#39;s Greatest Managers Do Differently&#34;.  It&#39;s data driven by a large meta-survey and research project.One of the conclusions was that, essentially, the normal instinct with Performance Management to focus on improving weaknesses is wrong and leads to sub-optimal outcomes.  The best managers actually doubled down on each individuals strengths, and simply accepted weaknesses as something to be smoothed out to the minimally acceptable level. (e.g. someone may not be &#34;good with people&#34;, but they can&#39;t be openly hostile with co-workers.)  Instead the manager would look for another employee which had that weakness as a strength, and manage responsibilities appropriately.It speaks exactly to what was wrong in OP&#39;s experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is the essential similarity of the key trick in Godel&#39;s incompleteness theorem and the Y combinator well known?  I finally &#34;got&#34; the incompleteness theorem when that relationship dawned on me.  As a cute entry point, consider the standard lambda term with no normal form, &#34;(lambda x. (x x)) (lambda x. (x x))&#34;.  Now consider the Godel formula &#34;Substitute(F, n)&#34;, which takes a number F, the Godel number of a formula with a single free variable, and another number n.  It simplifies to a number M which is the Godel number of the formula F with n replacing all instances of its free variable.  One might interpret F as function-like, in the sense that for any number n, F [free_var := n] simplifies to some other number m.  So now consider &#34;Substitute(F, F)&#34;, which is suggestive of &#34;(x x)&#34; in lambda notation.  Let M be the Godel number of this formula, which has one free variable.  Finally, use an analogy to the above self-referential lambda term to create the formula G, defined as &#34;Substitute(M, M)&#34;.  To what number does this arithmetic formula with no free variables simplify?  The delightful answer is that it simplifies to its own Godel number!  Just as it is a short step from the above simple self-referential lambda term to the Y combinator, so it is a short step from the above fact to the standard Godel formula for which neither it nor its negation has a proof."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool page, though the Halting Problem brings with it a lot of stuff, so using it to prove Godel&#39;s first incompleteness theorem is (imo) a bit like cheating. I&#39;ve proven it before using diagonalization on my blog (but also using concepts like computability for free). At the end of the day, using these ideas, you get the Curry–Howard correspondence for free (which, again, is a bit like cheating).&gt; Gödel’s original proof was slightly strongerTechnically speaking, a lot stronger. Proving Godel&#39;s first incompleteness theorem (don&#39;t even get me started on the second) from first principles is actually much more involved; and certainly more difficult to make it intelligible for non-logicians."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things I have a hard time conveying to non-parents is that the most time-intensive parts of parenting don&#39;t last forever.I&#39;ve talked to a lot of young people who say they don&#39;t want kids because they think their personal lives will permanently halt the moment they have kids. I spend a lot of time trying to explain that:1) I still spend a lot of time with friends and can do most of my personal hobbies/activities on weekends. My wife and I are good at sharing the load. You don&#39;t need 2 parents watching kids 100% of the time.2) The sleepless nights and diaper changes are a mere blip on the scale of a lifetime with kids. You deal with it, then the kids grow up quicker than you think. Don&#39;t let the idea of the first few months/years define your entire decision for how you want to structure your family for the rest of your life.3) You actually like hanging out with your own kids. I talk to a lot of people who are anchored to some negative experience they had 10 years ago babysitting for someone else&#39;s kids, as if that was representative of parenting life. It&#39;s not at all. At the end of the day, I actually rush to finish up my work so I can have more kid time. It&#39;s fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A huge asterisk here is that this varies greatly by culture. For better or worse* certain cultures value strong family bonds and time spent with the parents, as well as bilateral support well into adulthood. Many cultures also encourage multigenerational living within a single household (or in extremely close proximity like my parents did).For example, my parents were happy to have me live at home as long as I wanted, and in fact encouraged me to stay so I could save up. Ideally in their eyes I wouldn&#39;t even move out until I was married. In my parent&#39;s culture, I&#39;m not seen as a loser or a burden because I&#39;m living with them as an adult, only if I wasn&#39;t contributing to the family&#39;s prosperity. Of course I wanted to live my own life sooner than that, but that doesn&#39;t mean I left as soon as I was 18.Because of these strong family ties I live within minutes of my parents, and still make sure to visit often, even if it&#39;s just for dinner.*Where this can breakdown is if one does not fit neatly within the boundaries and expectations set by cultural norms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed the comments section much more than the article itself (even though it&#39;s a great article)There is something magical to me about seeing other people&#39;s experiences (especially positive ones)P.S. I&#39;ve noticed we&#39;re in a need for more streamlined info on being a parent in the world we live in so I created a weekly newsletter for remote-working parents - https://thursdaydigest.com/Most of my subscribers are coming from comments just like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here are a few thoughts I haven&#39;t formulated before:It seems clear enough to me that training AIs on copyrighted works is typically or commonly a fair use under existing law, because the AIs can and commonly do learn non-copyrightable elements and aspects of those works. It&#39;s very obvious from enormous numbers of examples that current AI systems are capable of learning much more abstract features of human culture (grammar, concepts, facts, cultural tropes, and many others).A human being doesn&#39;t violate copyright in learning from a copyrighted work, including when that human being is later more able to produce other works based on that learning (e.g. reading fantasy novels and learning concepts, tropes, or vocabulary that one uses to produce other fantasy novels; reading a newspaper and learning facts that one incorporates into an essay; learning artistic techniques or stylistic conventions from studying existing artworks and using them when producing new artworks). Current AI systems are (amazingly) becoming capable of all of these things and may do them in ways that are somewhat akin to how human beings do them. (although I guess Jaron Lanier would object &#34;that&#39;s what they want you to think&#34;)But there are also examples in existing copyright doctrine where people accidentally repeat enough of a prior work to get in trouble for infringement -- most often with song composition (like George Harrison&#39;s &#34;My Sweet Lord&#34;) because relatively small pieces of melody (which a person might easily memorize) may be considered copyrightable.If human beings had much more accurate memories, copyright would be quite a bit more intrusive (and/or quite a bit less effective) because, following any exposure to some kinds of works, we could use our own memories to reproduce those entire works from scratch for our own use or pleasure without obtaining authorized copies from elsewhere.Computers do have such accurate memories, and machine learning systems, which are optimized for things like maximum likelihood estimation, can and do reproduce both copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of works that they&#39;ve been trained on. After all, the maximum likelihood continuation of a fragment of a text or a song is ... the complete original work. And the ability to reproduce the complete original work would, other things being equal, reduce loss in training. After all, that&#39;s something someone might specifically ask for, and if the system could oblige, it would be doing a better job of providing what the user wanted.It&#39;s relatively foreseeable that machine learning systems would potentially be able to reproduce both copyrightable and non-copyrightable elements of various works, because the distinction between the two isn&#39;t especially clear from an algorithmic or mechanical point of view. (For instance, facts aren&#39;t copyrightable, but the notion of what constitutes a &#34;fact&#34; for this purpose is a culturally-bound legal notion and not at all straightforward to make precise.)But if you had a human author or artist or scholar or programmer who was &#34;trained on&#34; exposure to an enormous body of works, and that person had an exceptional eidetic memory, you could imagine that he or she would be perfectly capable of recreating many of those works from memory (and that other people might request such recreations). (Again, in music in particular, it&#39;s already routine that someone could have unambiguously copyrightable material memorized and be subject to copyright restrictions on performing songs. Like if a singer or band performs a cover from memory.)If you wanted to avoid this ability then you might need to build in an explicit notion of copyright that limits the accuracy or level of detail inside of the model in some way. This is tricky because (1) I don&#39;t think people have really tried to do this much so far, (2) copyright applies very differently to different categories of work, (3) it obviously wouldn&#39;t satisfy critics even if it mitigated the most extreme examples of &#34;regurgitation&#34;, and (4) it would be kind of weird because you would be intentionally limiting the quality and extent of learning that the system was allowed to do. (I imagine Jaron Lanier getting mad again about my repeated comparison between human learning and machine learning, and between human memory and machine memory)Some of the weirdness in point (4) is that accurate prediction is usually cool / great / impressive / accepted as an appropriate goal or capability, but if it&#39;s too accurate in certain contexts, it may be deemed a copyright infringement. Like if you said &#34;what word comes next? FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO OUR FATHERS&#34;, there&#39;s a clear correct answer and knowing it requires having a certain text memorized. OK, if you said &#34;what word comes next? MR. AND MRS. DURSLEY OF NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE WERE PROUD TO SAY&#34; ... same thing, but Bloomsbury Publishing may be unhappy if you have a system that can get all such questions right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be sad if someone succeeded in shutting down CoPilot for this kind of copyright stuff. It is genuinely useful. I don&#39;t care that it reproduces copyrighted content. The only way you can get it to do that is to bait it with the function names of functions that have already been copy and pasted thousands of times onto GitHub without proper licenses.Luckily, someone will probably come out with a &#34;renegade&#34; version trained on whatever makes it a useful assistant to my coding. I won&#39;t be afraid of accidently violating copyright myself, because I won&#39;t be trying to bait it into reproducing heavily copy&amp;pasted cherrypicked examples, and I won&#39;t use 20 lines of its output with zero modification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A sizable, possibly plurality cohort of fully adult tech people is young enough to not know about United States v. Microsoft Corp. This would explain a lot of comments I see on this topic.If you don&#39;t know Microsoft&#39;s history, a lot of what more informed people are worried about seems overblown. Copilot was Microsoft&#39;s first test of people&#39;s trust after the GitHub acquisition. It&#39;s going very, very, very poorly. There were ways to do this with consent and collaboration with the people and projects it takes code from, but they&#39;re acting like classic Microsoft here.Too many people are focused on what&#39;s legal. It&#39;s fine to think of, but law is the last stop before the breakdown of society. Microsoft skipped society and went straight to sparking an inevitable test of and possible reshaping of copyright law."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m sad that this is happening to an app that&#39;s useful to its users, but the reality is that scraping is legal, always possible, but difficult.This particular case is a bit harder since it&#39;s not purely using public data, but may still qualify since it&#39;s likely scraping with legally-obtained credentials.I know of businesses (scraping for ride-sharing, scraping for business intelligence for retailers, scraping from LinkedIn - see HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn) that have continuously succeeded via scraping in ways that large businesses oppose.The key is: you must make enough profit to justify dedicating engineering and legal techniques to defend your scraping.- Scraping public data is legal, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in Van Buren v. United States [1] and HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn [2]. Defending yourself or suing the data owner in court are both expensive though- Defeating anti-scraping via technical means is pretty much always possible, but can be costly depending on the scraped site&#39;s technical expertise and value in keeping their data private. The benefit to you must exceed the cost to you, and ideally should also exceed the cost to the data owner- Mobilizing PR and internal resistance may also be effective, but it&#39;s usually hard to have outcry from a large enough group to change an organization&#39;s policies. In this case, the union can push for it, but AA may try to withhold improvements until the next set of union negotiations1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Buren_v._United_States2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really a story about a celebrity&#39;s mental illness and public breakdown. If you haven&#39;t been following the news, West has spent the week saying increasingly unhinged things, not just about politics but about Pete Davidson, his wife, and (if I&#39;m remembering right) his kids and the fake actor children that have been installed in his former home to corrupt them. He was interviewed for a show on Fox and a big chunk of what he said was edited out and later leaked; the &#34;people at the Gap&#34; knew about Uvalde, Kanye is now a Black Hebrew Israelite, &amp;c. He&#39;s quite evidently sick, and these Parler people are scamming him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Musk and everyone else is right that we do need a platform with free speech. The only problem is that all those free speech advocates are actually NIMBY&#39;s when it comes to free speech.I have been following self proclaimed free speech absolutists(because I too, believe in free speech but don&#39;t believe it exists) and they are totally not the kind of people that say &#34;I hate what you say but I will die defending your right to say it&#34;. In all places, these people are curating comments and posts to push agenda.The only somewhat free place I&#39;ve seen is 4Chan but it contains so much toxicity, that&#39;s its barely bearable.Yet again, I like that Musk and Kanye kind of people claim that they want free speech because at least we can hold them responsible when they don&#39;t deliver it. This is in contrast with the pure fascist where they cannot be held responsible for anything because they don&#39;t claim virtue in first place. It&#39;s a bit like companies doing greenwashing, which can be exposed when they don&#39;t deliver on their claimed virtues versus companies who don&#39;t even claim such virtues and instead pretend that it doesn&#39;t matter. Those who claim virtue are better even if they ultimately fail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How could an average outside observer distinguish between another&#39;s mental illness and a guy who&#39;s just a real out of the box thinker who might be wrong about many ideas but might also add value to the world by perceiving reality in an atypical way?A lot of posters are claiming Kanye is mentally ill and unable to manage his own affairs. What is the direct evidence of this? And I don&#39;t simply mean &#34;provide examples of opinions he&#39;s said that I don&#39;t understand or care for&#34;.I think it&#39;s pretty dangerous to be labeling people involved in the national dialogue as mentally ill without a diagnosis, or at least some substantial and direct evidence. This label could be weaponized by an authoritarian political movement in a very dangerous way if that&#39;s the precedent we&#39;re using."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m curious how Sci-hub&#39;s approach compares to the What.cd/Redacted approach.IIUC Sci-hub has scooped up science docs through a good enough UX that it was able to leverage the goodwill of science folks to upload docs (plus whatever other methods it has used to scoop up docs), and it uses a public blitzkrieg-style distribution mechanism. I.e., I guess if one had a big enough harddrive and a fast enough internet connection, one could start downloading the lib right now and see if they win the race against the copyright holders.On the other hand, the What.cd/Redacted approach seems to use Bittorrent ratios to create a private-tracker economy. New users get a few gigs free download on joining. But apparently because a) there&#39;s a 1:1 upload/download ratio, and b) a few first-mover fat cats are sitting on enormous ratios, this means there is a scramble by everyone else to upload new FLACs to build up their ratio so they can continue to be able to download FLACs. It seems that would mean the library-in-its-entirety cannot be easily replicated at will. Yet the tracker was apparently already nuked off the internet as What.cd and reappeared later as Redacted. Was any data lost between the two services?Oh yeah, there&#39;s also apparently another approach in rutracker, which seems to be blitzkrieg to add content and publish, at the (apparent?) cost of quality of content.It&#39;s really a shame that the nerdy, completist domain of digital archiving through torrents isn&#39;t covered by fair use. Perhaps we could exclude the most recent 10 years of music so that the hopeful young musician streamers can get paid a few hundred dollars for millions of streams and then receive the silver lining of fair use protection against a label refusing to release one of their albums."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Alexandra Elbakyan actually did not want to be revealed as the librarian behind Sci-Hub, it was her poor opsec that led to her being identified.Basically her servers were set up to emit detailed error messages from PHP, including full path of faulting source file, which was under directory /home/ringo-ring, which could be traced to a username she had online on an unrelated site, attached to her real name. Before this revelation, she was anonymous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an active hoarder I think there is problem with &#34;6. Distribution: Packaging it up in torrents, announcing it somewhere, getting people to spread it.&#34;.I miss a p2p application with torrent packaging and Kademlia like per-file advertising and discovery, where I could point it to my hefty NAS directory of random things and they could be wired to released torrents. This way we could make torrents live much longer, even partially complete. In super extra option the app could even notify me to load DVD because somebody asked for a file which I indexed and advertised previously.For years my program preferences changed, file locations changed - I have moved files around, made them offline, burned on DVDs, deleted some parts of torrent just to keep interesting stuff. Now these torrents are lost, at least my seeding contribution is gone. But I almost never change the content of these files, their checksum stays the same forever, so they could be still discoverable.The digital preservation needs better distribution system."</p>

Shocked I say!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have refused to shop at numerous stores because they make a point of not accepting cash. Cash is incredibly important for modern society due to actually being untraceable and allowing for private transactions. Plus, a society without cash is one where you are forced to use central banking. Blockchain is just trying to imitate cash digitally, which as it turns out is really hard to do. So it just ends up that people use central services anyways.The point is, cash is hard to trace. And that&#39;s a good thing. I personally refuse to shop anywhere that refuses cash, and I encourage you to do the same if possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, it&#39;s entirely built on the idea that every transaction is known by everyone. I think Lance is a bit confused. Maybe he should look into Monero.The point of Bitcoin is to enable anyone to exchange value with anyone. And it does that very well. When the US justice department declared that credit card companies had to stop processing donations to wikileaks I could still donate through bitcoin."</p>

The server uses a crontab which checks to see if the Git repo has been updated once a day, and runs the tests inside a Docker container if the repo has changed.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi there - one of the few pro sellers on HN here.You&#39;re planning on prospecting into one of the most rejection-heavy domains out there with small physical business. These people get dozens of calls per day from companies they&#39;ve never heard of - many of whom are trying to rip them off - and even the best ones (Groupon, Yelp, google ads, etc.) are basically just rent-seeking. Oh, and most have gatekeepers who don&#39;t care the slightest bit about your pitch.Because of that I&#39;d stay away from all this &#34;smile and dial&#34; advice. You&#39;ll have no chance. Go out there and hit the pavement and meet these people at their establishments at off hours. If you catch the owner in there at a good time - do your best to inform them of your products benefits and come up with a really good offer to get started (something that loses you money and time). Free Trial, free month of services, whatever makes sense based on the context of your business. The goal is NOT to make money or build a book of business at this point - it&#39;s to get a person happy with your software to sell to later.If the owner is too busy or whatever - have some stuff printed out for them to read later that you can drop off. Ideally with a small gift (coffee, food, candy, etc.) and come back in a few weeks to see if you catch them at a better time (again with a gift, until they talk).A solid entry level book would be Fanatical Prospecting by Jeb Blount.Good Luck.*edit to fix book name"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be frank you&#39;ve already committed the classic blunder of developer initiated startups.  You built before you sold.  Now there&#39;s no telling if what you built is what anyone wants.IMHO, and extrapolating a lot here it&#39;s very unlikely you will get any sale based off your MVP.  It&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ve hit the right market fit without first having found customer #1.So I&#39;d back up a step and find someone with the problem you&#39;re trying to solve.  Offer the deal of a custom built solution to meet their need.  Once that&#39;s built and validated that it actually solves the problem then start selling to others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a difference between marketing and sales. You&#39;re building a solution to a problem. Marketing is about getting people who have the problem to know your solution exists. Sales is about convincing them to pay money to solve the problem.If you built the MVP but don&#39;t have customers yet, you should already have some people in mind who suffer from the problem your solution is supposed to solve. Selling is then just a conversation that loosely follows the following steps:  (a) Ask if they still have the problem
  (b) Ask if your proposed solution solves their problem
  (c) Ask them to spend money to buy your solution

Note that every step starts with &#34;ask&#34;. This means that you need to listen to their response. If they don&#39;t still have the problem, walk away. If your proposed solution doesn&#39;t solve their problem, listen to why not, and focus on improving your product until it does solve their problem (hopefully in a generic way such that your improvements will help you sell to other customers in the future). If they aren&#39;t willing to spend the price you&#39;re asking to buy a solution that they consider to be a solution to a problem they have, then find a way to add more value so that they will be willing to pay that price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It makes sense from a technical perspective why you&#39;d build a system like XCheck. The problem is that once you build XCheck you actually need to say to your C-suite and PR department &#34;Actually no, you can&#39;t say we treat everyone equally, we&#39;re manually going in and exempting certain people from scrutiny, and that&#39;s entirely within our discretion.&#34;The problem isn&#39;t technical, it&#39;s legal - you can&#39;t build a system that operates one way and then publicly misrepresent it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Howdy, folks. Ryan here from the GitHub Copilot product team. I don’t know how the original poster’s machine was set-up, but I’m gonna throw out a few theories about what could be happening.If similar code is open in your VS Code project, Copilot can draw context from those adjacent files. This can make it appear that the public model was trained on your private code, when in fact the context is drawn from local files. For example, this is how Copilot includes variable and method names relevant to your project in suggestions.It’s also possible that your code – or very similar code – appears many times over in public repositories. While Copilot doesn’t suggest code from specific repositories, it does repeat patterns. The OpenAI codex model (from which Copilot is derived) works a lot like a translation tool. When you use Google to translate from English to Spanish, it’s not like the service has ever seen that particular sentence before. Instead, the translation service understands language patterns (i.e. syntax, semantics, common phrases). In the same way, Copilot translates from English to Python, Rust, JavaScript, etc. The model learns language patterns based on vast amounts of public data. Especially when a code fragment appears hundreds or thousands of times, the model can interpret it as a pattern. We’ve found this happens in &lt;1% of suggestions. To ensure every suggestion is unique, Copilot offers a filter to block suggestions &gt;150 characters that match public data. If you’re not already using the filter, I recommend turning it on by visiting the Copilot tab in user settings.This is a new area of development, and we’re all learning. I’m personally spending a lot of time chatting with developers, copyright experts, and community stakeholders to understand the most responsible way to leverage LLMs. My biggest take-away: LLM maintainers (like GitHub) must transparently discuss the way models are built and implemented. There’s a lot of reverse-engineering happening in the community which leads to skepticism and the occasional misunderstanding. We’ll be working to improve on that front with more blog posts from our engineers and data scientists over the coming months."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just tested it myself on a random c file I created in the middle of a rust project I&#39;m working on, it reproduced his full code verbatim from just the function header so clearly it does regurgitate proprietary code unlike some people have said, I do not have his source so co-pilot isn&#39;t just using existing context.I&#39;ve been finding co-pilot really useful but I&#39;ll be pausing it for now, and I&#39;m glad I have only been using it on personal projects and not anything for work. This crosses the line in my head from legal ambiguity to legal &#34;yeah that&#39;s gonna have to stop&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a heads-up that the person who writes this is Tim Davis[0], author of the legendary CHOLMOD solver[1], which hundreds of thousands of people use daily when they solve sparse symmetric linear systems in common numerical environments.Even if CHOLMOD is easily the best sparse symmetric solver, it is notoriously not used by scipy.linalg.solve, though, because numpy/scipy developers are anti-copyleft fundamentalists and have chosen not to use this excellent code for merely ideological  reasons... but this will not last: thanks to the copilot &#34;filtering&#34; described here, we can now recover a version of CHOLMOD unencumbered by the license that the author originaly distributed it under!  O brave new world, that has such people in it![0] https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html[1] https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love htmx and this talk is a brilliant run down of where it works well.But as always it’s about choosing the right tool for the job. Server rendered pages/fragments solve so many issues around security and time to develop a product, however it only gets you so far.Ultimately I think the decision when choosing a stack comes down to how much state you need to managed in browser. The vast majority of sites needs very little client side state management, htmx and other tools such as Alpine.js are perfect for this. But eventually as you reach a more “app like” experience with multiple layers of state control on the front end you need to reach for a front end JS framework.Now that doesn’t always mean going all in on a full SPA covering the whole of your product. It could just be a small fragment that requires that level of interaction.Point is, don’t pick a tool because it’s “in vogue”, pick one because it lets you build the best possible product as efficiently as possible. For 80% of websites that could be htmx, and for the next 15% htmx probably works for 90% of their pages. It’s the 5% where htmx is not one of the right choices at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years ago, a bright guy created something called 7 GUIs. It’s a collection of seven problems that all UI systems must successfully implement, and it was intended to act as a guide for comparisons.Unfortunately I think the author has passed away, but it would be interesting to see it rekindled and used for baseline comparisons like these.https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are four main problems in the React SPA world:- State management - hooks are awful for anything complex- Packaging + Bundling - Webpack kitchen sink, JS/TS, browser vs node vs random runtimes, packaging vs bundling, etc- Data/API binding - Adds distributed state to your data and the complexity that goes with that (cross dom reuse, caching, staleness, realtime updates, etc)- SEO/Prehydrating - Mostly applies to landing/CRM/blog type things.These &#39;old school&#39; solutions help you avoid some of these issues in favor of relocating the complexity a bit (those templates in the talk are absolutely gnarly and I&#39;m sure very bug prone) and reducing the experience. Also the API boundaries are blurred should you ever need one for non UI usage. Ignoring HackerNews taste for simpler websites, some complexity of UIs can and should only be captured with client sided javascript.With that said, after a few years of things shifting around I&#39;m really happy with the Typescript (lang) + Parcel (packaging) + MobX (state management) + Vercel (when server side rendering is needed). They&#39;ve been really stable, no fuss, always work. Especially MobX for state, absolutely game changing for the dev experience.As for the data binding problem, still sucks and my 4th attempt at solving it internally is still meh. This feels like it comes with the territory.As much as I loved my working with Django/Jinja2/etc, I think theres a light at  the end of this tunnel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"After seeing this, I can&#39;t be the only one who got curious as to how many emojis there actually are on iOS.Obviously, a quick google doesn&#39;t work right now.So I did this to try to figure out: emojipedia.org, the site that supposedly breaks google, has a page that appears to show all the available emojis on iOS [1]. On this page, all except the first 21 emojis are displayed in a way that uses lazy loading of the images. These images are contained in &lt;li class=&#34;lazyparent&#34;&gt; elements. Assuming that there are no other &lt;li class=&#34;lazyparent&#34;&gt; elements on the page, we should get the number of emojis on iOS simply by counting those elements.Opening up the console and running  document.getElementsByClassName(&#39;lazyparent&#39;).length

gives us 4037. So the total number of emojis on iOS should be 4037 + 21 = 4058. If the above method is correct, that is.[1] https://emojipedia.org/apple/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"[Firebase founder]I no longer work at Firebase / Google, but two points:1. There may be issues with the GCP integrations &amp; UX/DX, but GCP integration is good for many customers and necessary for the future of the business.One of the common failure modes for the 2011-2014 crop of Backend-as-a-Service offerings was their inability to technically support large customers. The economics of developer tooling are a super-power-law. So, if you hope to pay your employees you&#39;ll need to grow with your biggest customers.Eventually, as they become TheNextBigThing, your biggest customers end up wanting the bells and whistles that only a Big Cloud Platform provide.This was a part of the reason we chose to join Google, and why the Firebase team really really really pushed hard to integrate with GCP at a project, billing, and product level (philosophy: Firebase exposed the product from the client, GCP from the server) despite all the organizational/political overhead.2. I&#39;m excited to see the current crop of app platforms emerge. It has been 10 years since we launched (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3832877) and there are now some great innovations in the space. I like the way Supabase (https://supabase.com/) has exposed Postgres and InstantDB (https://www.instantdb.com) graphdb+realtime is really promising."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny because Google pretty much invented this model that users want and love. App Engine was launched in 2008, before GCP, before docker and before Cloud was a term, basically. It had a globally replicated persistence layer, job queues, auth, scale to 0, a generous free tier, a fully fledged local dev server and a single command to deploy, and all config lived in a single file. At the time it was really innovative, and attracted a lot of hip startup- and college grad types.The reason people liked it is, imo, because it was a single product with multiple features. GCP OTOH, has been about decoupling (or loosely coupling) the product suite, and users are supposed to pick and choose from a giant array of half-products. Simply being aware of all products, their interoperability and predicting the cost is a full time job, easily (it&#39;s mostly large enterprise who can absorb that cost). There&#39;s nothing wrong with the pick-and-choose model, if your products are simple, low level, and interoperable. But the product suite has grown organically, seemingly without coherence, so there&#39;s very little in terms of paved paths to walk – it&#39;s so confusing. When a shining star like Firebase comes along (2014) Google clearly knows not to mess with it too much. But even Firebase isn&#39;t strong enough to resist the gravitational pull of the GCP behemoth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, Firebase is mostly about convenience/development ease:
1. Authentication? Firebase Authentication2. Database? Firebase Cloud Firestore. Sometimes, you don&#39;t need SQL.3. Push notification? Firebase Cloud Messaging4. File storage? Firebase Cloud StorageAll of my needs are served by single platform. Seems like Supabase handles all of them, except #3. Let&#39;s try :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was electrifying. Understand that by 1984 there were millions of Americans using computers with a command line interface. While they could all do game graphics, you always started out in text mode and had to learn incantations that are familiar to many users of this site but which are no longer a part of most users’ daily life: dir, cd, del, etc.Seeing how dramatically different a computer experience could be was like opening a door to an alternate universe for people. The day after the Super Bowl in 1984 when their famous big Brother commercial ran, my girlfriend’s computer-illiterate father announced to us “I know how to use a computer now” and of course I knew exactly why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Credit to @Stammy on Twitter who shared this over there. Thought everyone here would find this pretty cool. I&#39;m a sucker for this era of advertising. This is a particularly beautiful spread, and super cool to see a snapshot of that moment in time and how Apple was positioning this brand new product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I especially like what is being printed out:In America, the &#34;Yuppies&#34; -- Young Urban Professionals -- are having babies at an unprecedented rate. And literally nothing is too good for these infants of the affluent. In fact, they&#39;re called Gourmet Babies! So we propose to offer traditional Yuppie foods -- sushi, pasta salads, brie cheeses, etc. -- in baby food form.That business model work work today. Say what you will about Apple, they really know their target demographic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is also my experience dealing with unions.  Management is legally required to make concessions during collective bargaining, so anything that can be considered an improvement to mandatory bargaining topics (pay, benefits, or working conditions) gets held back for the contract negotiation.In one case, management wanted to purchase sit/stand workstations for employees, but HR pointed out that this was a change to working conditions and should be included in the collective bargaining negotiation.  However management had already started taking measurements for the tables, so the union knew what management was intending.  During the negotiations, the union decided to try and call HR&#39;s bluff and refused to ask for the workstations as a concession.  So in the end, the whole plan was scrapped so that HR would have concessions available for future negotiations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"- Why did my store not get this new benefit that other non-unionized stores are getting?- Why was my store not affected by layoffs but other stores in the area were?- Why was my raise X% but employees at other stores got Y%?The answer to all of these is the same – you will get exactly what is in your collective bargaining agreement, not a penny more or less. If you want more perks, ask your union reps to bring it up in the next contract negotiation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main benefit mentioned in the article is a $400 annual credit to Coursera.  Everything else is &#34;some education&#34; or &#34;some doctors&#34;, which usually translates to practically nothing useful.They should have found out what the average pay is for union vs non-union, and then compared if the new benefits actually translated to something meaningful.My guess is that the union members earn more than $400/yr in cash, and then they can spend it on whatever they want - education, doctors, whatever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In the early years of our sample, women were less likely to be selected as members [of AAAS and NAS] than men with similar records. By the 1990s, the selection process at both academies was approximately gender-neutral, conditional on publications and citations. In the past 20 years, however, a positive preference for female members has emerged and strengthened in all three fields. Currently, women are 3-15 times more likely to be selected as members of the AAAS and NAS than men with similar publication and citation records.https://www.nber.org/papers/w30510The paper is not peer reviewed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The idea that women don&#39;t do science because they are dumb is correctly dismissed. But let me introduce a different, more interesting, idea. What if most women don&#39;t do science because they are smart?Young people don&#39;t care about the numbers, they are impressed by success, and bios of most obscure figures doing science, lets face the ugly truth... aren&#39;t good models of success.We are fixing the wrong problem here, with too simplistic premises (the problem is that people is ignorant / that we don&#39;t have exactly the same number of people in each demographic category doing science / That everybody should have the same interests and goals and think in the same way)When the real problem to address is that working conditions in science are, often, terrible and that our society punish people in many different ways for wanting to be scientists"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last I heard, Wikipedia doesn&#39;t want to carry an article for every university professor or scientist who has published some papers. In glancing through Wade&#39;s entries, it seems like many of them are just published scholars without any additional notability. I wonder if Wikipedia&#39;s notability rules are being uniformly respected here, or are they being selectively applied based on the gender of the person?I think it&#39;s great that Wade is bringing more visibility to lesser-known female scientists, but if we are valuing that, I think we should do so regardless of the subject&#39;s identity. Maybe Wikipedia should relax its notability rules a bit for scholars.If you are inspired to downvote this, I would be curious to know if you disagree with my proposal, or just dislike that I brought up the issue at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There seems to be a lot of confusion in this discussion about what the change is and how egrep and fgrep work. These are not symlinks like some have suggested but rather shell scripts. You can see the exact commit diff here:https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=grep.git;a=blobdiff;f...I remember around ~10 years ago being told &#34;you should never use `egrep` because it is slower than `grep -E`.&#34; precisely because the former requires extra forks() compared to the latter. However I&#39;d counter that advice saying &#34;if you&#39;re concerned about the performance of forks() then why are you running your code as a shell script to begin with?&#34;... and I stand by that assessment now. In fact it would probably take me longer to type `-E` than it would for any modern system to run fork() (and I&#39;m sure as hell not planning on using `grep` inside any hot loops!)I think what will likely happen here is that distro maintainers will either remove that warning themselves or take ownership of the `egrep` and `fgrep` shell scripts. I&#39;d be surprised if that warning made its way to the mainstream distros. I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the GNU grep maintainers did a u-turn on this change -- though it has already been committed to git for more than a year now and this is the first I&#39;ve heard people complain about the change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use fgrep all the time.  Why should I spend time converting scripts, and retraining my fingers, and forever after taking longer to type grep -F?  This is a breaking change that has no upside, only downside.  It is idiocy.Just to elaborate, there must be many thousands (hundreds of thousands? millions?) of shell scripts out there that use fgrep.  For no reason at all (whatever maintenance burden fgrep represents must be far outweighed by the time wasted debating this issue), these scripts will no longer work.  There is no guarantee that defining an alias somewhere is going to fix all your usages of fgrep.  And even if it did, the cost for every single installation that is affected of someone realizing there is a problem, finding the source of the problem, figuring out that an alias will fix it, making sure that that alias gets preserved after updates, and testing that everything now works will exceed the benefit to the maintainers of grep (which is actually negative, as explained above).  So looked at from a community-wide perspective, the cost is many thousands of times greater than any possible (but actually non-existent) benefit.And as the post mentions, there are also all the books, and all the stackoverflow answers, that use fgrep, and which will now have non-working code.As for the argument that this is open-source software maintained by volunteers, who can therefore do whatever they wish - if you are a maintainer of widely-used open-source software, and decide that you personally are not interested in working in a manner that benefits the community of users, then you should resign and let someone else take over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On my system, egrep and fgrep are _already_ shell scripts, just changed to add the stupid warning:    $ cat =egrep =fgrep
    #!/bin/sh
    cmd=${0##*/}
    echo &#34;$cmd: warning: $cmd is obsolescent; using grep -E&#34; &gt;&amp;2
    exec grep -E &#34;$@&#34;
    #!/bin/sh
    cmd=${0##*/}
    echo &#34;$cmd: warning: $cmd is obsolescent; using grep -F&#34; &gt;&amp;2
    exec grep -F &#34;$@&#34;

Looking at src/egrep.sh in the git repo[1], I see that before this warning was added in 2021, the last change was back in 2015. In fact, since the git repo history began in 1998, there have been a total of 4 changes to this file. Clearly the maintenance burden of these scripts is not sufficient to require the maintainers to drop them. My guess... this is being done out of some weird sense of purity over practicality. Bad call by Paul Eggert IMO[2].1: https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=grep2: commit a9515624709865d480e3142fd959bccd1c9372d1 added the warnings"</p>

One of the songs we’ve used is, aptly, America by Simon and Garfunkel.There are a bunch of books about hitchhiking across America. We have hitched a few rides ourselves. We picked up one called The Last American Hitchhiker by Mark Kneeskern, that we read aloud to each other during journeys. Fascinating vignettes of the culture across the continent.Thanks for the fun game and for bringing back some memories."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay so I got to the wrap-up at the end, about &#34;why did nobody else find this&#34;, the author sets up some logical dominoes but doesn&#39;t knock them down. Allow me to try:Earlier in the article, the author mentions that they recently upgraded some network hardware, and the problem seemed to become more frequent after that.Packet loss or other network issues would force the stack to fall out of fast-path and update the counter, avoiding the bug.Running over ssh would avoid the bug. The only time you&#39;d run rsync not over ssh would be within your own network.So it sounds like (this is my conjecture here) this would only appear to someone running rsync internally, over a high-performance network with no packet loss, and upgrading the switches might&#39;ve finally gotten the network good enough to expose the bug?"</p>

What if Westinghouse had just completely failed and ceased operations?  Who would support the remainder of projects like Vogtle 3 &amp; 4, and ongoing maintenance for the next however-many decades?I guess a company in a heavily-regulated sector like this must have some sort of succession plan, but it&#39;s not clear to me how this would work, in the case of e.g. the company going bankrupt, and all the staff with institutional knowledge about a reactor design dispersing to various other companies.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m quite familiar with this whole lawsuit, and I still think it&#39;s total and complete bullshit (and, to be clear, I have huge concerns about Google&#39;s tracking and surveillance).Incognito Mode basically puts you in a mode as if you had installed a fresh, new instance of the browser every time, e.g. none of your past cookies can be accessed by any websites. Websites, though, can still use analytics APIs, including things like Google Analytics, to track you within that Incognito Mode session. They may also be able to correlate you by, for example, matching your IP address. And, to be clear, the Incognito Mode new window has always made this clear.I can still be really concerned about Google&#39;s overall tracking and also point out this lawsuit is a bullshit money grab from lawyers hoping for a lotto payout."</p>

It is, in fact, reasonable for naive users to expect that their identity would be concealed while using &#34;incognito mode&#34;, Google&#39;s disclaimers to the contrary notwithstanding.&#34;What?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(I work on Stripe Billing).  This is a question we raise fairly regularly internally at Stripe. The real, prosaic answer is because when we started working on Stripe Billing in 2017, Stripe had already built an internal billing system to bill its own customers. Stripe was 7 years old at that point.At the time, we got lots of feedback from the folks who had built that system. Our goal was to build a flexible billing system for all kinds of companies at different sizes, but we were definitely focused on smaller (doing maybe $100k–$10M of ARR) SaaS companies to start. We&#39;ve come a long way since then and now power billing for a number of large/public companies. Atlassian, Figma, Notion and Slack are either using or migrating onto Stripe Billing today.Stripe Billing is a powerful tool with a role to play in any company&#39;s revenue management system, including Stripe&#39;s. Newer Stripe products (such as Atlas) do build on top of Stripe Billing but we haven&#39;t gotten around to migrating our existing stack. That said, I do have a personal goal of taking on more internal billing responsibilities over time (e.g. I think we could easily use Stripe Invoices internally today, and it&#39;s mostly opportunity cost keeping us from actually doing so).I do want to say that the specific use case covered in the post is something we have thought about a lot. I think about it as a pipeline with stages for collecting high volumes of usage events, aggregating them, mapping them to rate cards based on usage, and then producing recurring bills, collecting payment, dunning, etc... The post claims we don’t do a good job on the first two stages (collecting usage events and aggregating them) is perhaps missing that the style of percentage-based fees is a one-line addition to a Connect integration as my colleague edwinwee mentioned below.  It is also possible to have a scalable usage event collection/aggregation pipeline integrated with Stripe Billing.  You can read this AWS blog post https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/building-a-third-party-saas... for information about how to build such a system according to our best practices.While I’m here, I’m always eager to hear feedback on Stripe Billing from folks who are using it.  My email is ark@stripe.com."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work at an HR/Payroll company with a phenomenal app that we put our blood, sweat, and tears into every single day. And every single day I clock in with Oracle Time and Labor. There&#39;s a legal reason for this and we do it for compliance. I&#39;m guessing Stripe is in the same boat with this product despite its flaws."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First off, yes, Stripe uses Stripe to bill our own customers. In fact, for our larger customers who have negotiated complex pricing plans, we&#39;re currently migrating much of our manual billing to a system that&#39;s inspired by Stripe Billing.Second, this article seems to miss the point of Stripe. It seems to want to build a platform, which is what Stripe Connect is designed for.For example, charging a percentage fee is just one line (https://stripe.com/docs/api/application_fees):` $application_fee_percent = 5`Slack, Atlassian, and Notion have all built their B2B billing on top of Stripe. But we don&#39;t target just B2B or B2C ecommerce in case a business has multiple revenue streams (which many businesses are increasingly adding). In fact, we designed Billing so it can flex across any business model—per-seat, usage-based, tiered, or even graduated.This is the point of Stripe. A single stack that flexes with your business as it grows and pricing that&#39;s public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that isn&#39;t really covered in this article is relevance calculations.A surprising (to me) thing about PostgreSQL FTS is that it doesn&#39;t do TF/IDF or BM25 relevance calculations.These calculations take statistics about the entire corpus into account - they do things like ranking a document higher if it contains terms from the search which are statistically rare in the overall corpus.PostgreSQL FTS uses how often the search terms appear in the document as part of the ranking score, but doesn&#39;t look at how common/rare individual terms are. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls....OpenSearch/Elasticsearch uses BM25: https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/expla...SQLite stores these kinds of statistics and can support BM25 or TF/IDF or custom ranking functions. I wrote more about that here: https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-releva...Meilisearch does something a bit different (on reading this I don&#39;t think it considers full corpus statistics, but I may be misinterpreting that): https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/relevancy.h...It looks like Typesense only considers the documents, not the overall corpus: https://typesense.org/docs/guide/ranking-and-relevance.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case you skip to the comments like I usually do, this post is a light comparison of Postgres FTS vs:  - MeiliSearch: https://www.meilisearch.com/
  - OpenSearch: https://opensearch.org/
  - SQLite FTS: https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html
  - Typesense: https://typesense.org/

Some of the callouts from the results:  - Even when consuming similar content, engines can produce different results, but generally ratios between queries on the same engine should be consistent.
  - Postgres FTS is quite close performance-wise to many other solutions, at least in their default configuration.
  - Only Typesense and MeiliSearch properly handled mis-spellings (the &#34;suprman&#34; query).
  - Typesense was relatively strict with matches compared to other engines.
  - OpenSearch was very fast with ingest, but also failed with the misspelling out of the box.
  - In-memory SQLite is by far the fastest, and PG isn&#39;t too far behind for this small data set."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty much all these engines (and PG) are fast enough.Gist/Gin indexes are great and do a fine job to make millions of records searchable in very few milliseconds.The problem is accuracy.I’ve tried a few of these and accuracy is wildly different with most of them.Accuracy depends on how much you index.For example, even with decently designed weighting: If you index title, subtitle, tags and content — too much of content ruin relevancy.And yes, we have proper relevancy sorting setup nicely.The best is something like elastic search, but it does not integrate nicely with PG for our use case. Because of the multi tenant nature of our data setup.PG will get us to that magic 80% but that leaves the all important 20% which is not great.Not to mention the inability to index and search Asian character sets.So even though we exclusively use it, it’s not great and every time our team can’t find something that drives my team into the Psql CLI — I start searching for alternatives again.The big brick wall is updating, inserting and deleting from an external solution fast enough so we don’t miss stuff.And quickly searching multi tenant records in that external solution.And no I’m not ready to use ES as my primary database."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey HN!Plane came from our desire to build tools that have the low friction to use of running in the browser, but use more memory and compute than the browser will allocate. The basic idea is to run a remote background process, connect to it over WebSocket, and stream data.This ends up being a surprisingly useful primitive to have, and it&#39;s been used to:- Pixel-stream X11 applications to the browser over WebRTC[1]- Run IDEs and notebooks- Power Figma-style realtime collaboration backends (including https://rayon.design).Here&#39;s a direct link to our repo: https://github.com/drifting-in-space/plane and docs: https://plane.dev/[1] https://twitter.com/drifting_corp/status/1552773567649091584"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A related and also very useful usage pattern: &#34;backend instance per customer&#34;.Because…There are many ways to implement multi-tenant SaaS; but a highly underrated approach is to write a single tenant app, then use infrastructure to run an instance of it per (currently logged in) customer. Plus a persistent database per customer of course.This has the tremendous advantage that you can add another column to your pricing page easily: the &#34;bring a truckload of money and we will set you up to run this behind your firewall&#34; tier. There are still a lot of orgs out there, large ones with considerable financial capacity, who really want this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The implementation makes some weird choices like rebuilding a bunch of services like DNS, cert, weird dependency on SQLite. Wish people would stop reimplementing Kubernetes and just build on top of it.I think &#34;per-user&#34; is probably the wrong killer feature for something like this. Much more potential in shared distributed processes that support multiple users (chat, CRDT/coauthoring). Appears that the underlying layer can probably do that.In any case, super cool idea, and I hope something like this lands in the serverless platforms from all the major cloud providers. It&#39;s always been mind blowing to me that Google Cloud Functions supports websockets without allowing you to route multiple incoming connections from different users to the same process. That simple change would unlock so many useful scenarios."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I &#34;like&#34; how the beginning of the segment states the &#34;biggest impact&#34; is gonna be on the fishing economy, not on the restaurants.I&#39;d argue the biggest impact is on... the crab population? Guess nobody really cares for those after all. In which case losing them serves us well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something similar happened to the cod fishing industry in Newfoundland and other parts of eastern Canada 30 years ago. The reason: overfishing, due in large part to technological advances. Here&#39;s what happened:Canada and NAFO continued to overestimate the abundance of cod in the Atlantic Ocean and therefore continued to set dangerously high [Total Allowable Catches]. This was in large part due to the widespread practice of calculating cod populations from catch rates in the commercial fishery – if fishers filled their quotas with ease, then officials believed the stock size was at adequately high levels. However, fishing technology had become so efficient by the 1970s that commercial catch rates remained high even as the cod population dropped to dangerously low levels. Electronic tracking devices could find fish no matter how small their numbers and trawlers could harvest most species with relative ease. ...Although overfishing in international waters did tremendous damage to northern cod, Canada also failed to maintain a sustainable fishery within its 200-mile limit. The government ignored warnings from inshore fishers and university scientists that cod stocks were in danger and chose to maintain quotas instead of scaling back the fishery, in large part to prevent economic losses and massive unemployment.By the early 1990s, after decades of sustained intensive fishing from Canadian and international fleets, the northern cod stocks collapsed. The spawning biomass of northern cod had dropped by about 93 per cent in only 30 years – from 1.6 million tonnes in 1962 to between 72,000 and 110,000 tonnes in 1992. In July of that year, Canada imposed a moratorium on the catching of northern cod and ended an international industry that had endured for close to 500 years.https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/economy/moratorium.phpThey called off the season in 1992 and it never came back. A pillar of the local economy in the Maritimes was wrecked.As for climate change and its impact on East Coast fishing, I&#39;ve read that lobster fishing is no longer a viable industry in Long Island and it&#39;s declining in southern New England as waters get warmer and the lobsters permanently migrate north."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new coalition government has pledged $40B (approximately the market cap of Twitter, heh) in loan guarantees for nuclear power construction.They have also pledged to create legal guarantees that future politicians will not be able to shut down functioning nuclear power reactors without suitable monetary compensation to the owners/operators of these reactors.In addition to this, they are commissioning an urgent study on how to rebuild Ringhals 1 and 2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringhals_Nuclear_Power_Plant, about 1 GW each), two nuclear reactors that were prematurely decommissioned by the previous social-democratic government and shut down about 20 months ago.Personally I&#39;m really happy; I think massive expansion of 
 nuclear power is the only realistic way to fix climate change.The first reactors built will be modern but traditionally large. From then on: There has been a lot of interest in small modular reactors (SMR) from the political party that is driving all of this, and they actually got the nationally owned energy company Vattenfall to begin building prototypes at Ringhals a few months ago.In summary: Lots of champagne bottles popping tonight in Sweden in the homes of clean nuclear power proponents. We have been waiting for this for a very long time. Cheers!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit of context, the south area which this reactor is suggested to be built in has occasionally a 1000% electricity higher price from the northern regions. A big reason for this is that prices in the south is highly connected to markets that the south region is connected to, and those region are heavily importers of electricity creating a higher demand than there is available of cheap energy. For example, in order to address this there is a oil power plant operating basically 24/7 and does so very profitably even with high oil prices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something about this just seems very odd to me.As someone who grew up in the global South, this reads to me like a person from a privileged background trying to relate to the everyday people in other places and the marginalized- but it comes off sounding like a lot of projectionand assumptions- it would read much better if the conclusions were accompanied with dialogue from people, maybe explanations of where those statements are coming from.&gt;I don’t travel like most people do
I would think most travel is done by a wealthy few, but most travelers aren&#39;t wealthy- if that makes sense? It sounds like the &#34;travel&#34; being referred to here is &#34;flying somewhere and being a tourist&#34; but in fact to many people &#34;travel&#34; means taking the train/bus to another city, staying in a hostel, wandering around. Most people who go to see a wonder of the world do it because this might be the one time in their life they can afford to visit NYC, a place many people dream of seeing, and so they want to experience those things that are iconic there. I guess it really stands out to me, this writing sounds like &#34;I&#39;m not like those other stereotypical tourists&#34; and the stereotypes are those behaviors associated with privileged westerners- which isn&#39;t really an accurate representation of most travelers.From the Istanbul post:&gt;Most Turks are not secular though, and neither are they religious nuts like them ArabsHe considers education by traveling as sufficient, which I believe is not the best approach. Might be a good idea to read up a little about the history and cultures of a region before going.There is a lot going on with his writing that comes off ethnocentric, uninformed, insensitive. I&#39;m not going to dissect it, but I&#39;ll just say I recommend familiarization with cultural geography, anthropology, and ethnography if the topic of understanding people in different places interests you- because this blog is rife with problematic bias and some really broad generalizations that are prejudice at best, racism at worst."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like people are criticizing this partially because it&#39;s pitched as an alternative to normal tourism. Just wanted to point out that Chris Arnade has done quite compelling photo journalism based on his way of engaging with communities, so what might seem like non sequitors or edge lord stuff might be in service of an implicit goal of his that most travelers don&#39;t share. Not that he does himself any favors with some of the framing.Highly recommend his book Dignity. https://www.amazon.com/Dignity-Seeking-Respect-Back-America/...Some of his work in the Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-arnade"</p>

I have been in the &#34;back room&#34; and heard them speak surrounded by people they felt safe around. It&#39;s pretty much everything you can imagine: sexism, homophobia, racism, misogyny, and the list goes on. They way they talked about the people they ostensively &#34;serve&#34; was absolutely disgusting, literally made me sick to my stomach, they had complete distain for citizens. This specific visit happened in 2018 IIRC. My eyes should have been opened after 2013/BLM but they weren&#39;t, what I saw/heard was shocking and completely altered my perception of the police, my mind was fertile ground for when 2020 rolled around.At of mid-2020 I was in full support of police reform but resisted &#34;ACAB&#34;. At this point no sane people could support the police and I fervently believe ACAB, the is no reform for this horribly broken system. It must be dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up (without using the same ~~people~~ bullies)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those not in the know the &#34;4080 12GB&#34; as compared to the 4080 16GB was not just the same card with a little less RAM, as you might assume from the name. It also had ~20% fewer GPU cores and was significantly slower for that reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My two cents on Nvidia&#39;s rollback reasoning:4080 12GB was universally panned. The 40 series launch also got heat for price gouging, particularly the higher cost for the low end of the launch (4080 12GB). They had to raise the cost of the lower end of the 40 series though if they wanted to maintain the value of the 30 series cards and clear out the remaining inventory. They couldn&#39;t just release a true 4070 for a true 4070 price. While the name was obviously bad, it seems likely that they wanted to obscure the release of a 4070-quality chip for a 4080-price while attempting to sell off remaining 30 series. Pure speculation: maybe they were hoping a &#34;cheaper 4080&#34; would come across to the uninformed as Nvidia trying to lower the entry cost for 40 series rather than raising it through an expensive 4070.Two potential reasons for the rollback come to mind:
1) higher than expected 4090 demand means they can wait to launch a 4070.
2) higher than expected heat for the thinly veiled 4070 price gouging made it worth it to wait on the release since it helps sell more 30 series cards by raising the entry price for a 40 series while getting better PR in the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just that the 12 GB 4080 was a confusing name - it wasn&#39;t the same class of card, at all.In previous generations when they&#39;ve had differing memory sizes for the same card, that was the ONLY change. So, it was useful for something like CUDA, but usually not for gaming. A specific audience.For the 4080, the 12GB version has the following changes:* 12GB VRAM vs. 16GB VRAM (the obvious one from the name)* 7,680 CUDA cores vs. 9,728 CUDA cores for the 16 GB.* 192-bit memory bus vs. 256-bit memory bus (understandable, since this scales with memory size... but also probably means the memory itself is slower).This isn&#39;t just a different amount of memory, it is fundamentally a different product and should be marketed as such. Instead it&#39;s Nvidia being greedy."</p>

Smartphone, tablet or laptop users usually do not need the level of performance that requires running that stuff in the kernel when browsing the web.I get that there are some use cases where performance really matters to the point where kernel network stack and drivers make a difference (high-throughput and/or low-latency services running on servers, high-performance routers...), but that should not be the default for everyone."</p>

Obsidian seems to have ascended to the top of the heap with a team of three and no apparent VC funding. Anyone that roots for small companies and passionate programmers should appreciate Obsidian proving that the best tools don&#39;t have to be built by the biggest teams.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulations, and also: holy fucking shit!! no app has changed my day-to-day life to this degree in many, many years.I use Obsidian every morning on my roof deck for my journal (automated with the plugin, of course) and then at my desk all day long for my daily WTF blah blah info-capturing tool.Sure I wish it had more features (persist collapsed/expanded state, even in a best-effort, might-not-last-forever kind of way! build in git support because apple makes it too hard for plugin guys to do on mobile!) but the fact that it is all just &#34;standard&#34; markdown and image files washes away all almost my complaints.I use the paid Sync plugin, too (even though it&#39;s standard files and folders; could totally do it myself! could totally just use SyncThing! etc!) so that it is on all my machines and virtual machines. Perfect for sysadmin logs of things you touch only annually, e.g. Dad&#39;s iMac.To HN readers who haven&#39;t tried it: it&#39;s the millennials&#39; VisiCalc, basically, except for words."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This release includes a feature I added [1] to support partial foreign key updates in referential integrity triggers!This is useful for schemas that use a denormalized tenant id across multiple tables, as might be common in a multi-tenant application:    CREATE TABLE tenants (id serial PRIMARY KEY);
    CREATE TABLE users (
      tenant_id int REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,
      id serial,
      PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id),
    );
    CREATE TABLE posts (
        tenant_id int REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,
        id serial,
        author_id int,
        PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id),
        FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, author_id)
          REFERENCES users ON DELETE SET NULL
    );

This schema has a problem. When you delete a user, it will try to set both the tenant_id and author_id columns on the posts table to NULL:    INSERT INTO tenants VALUES (1);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 101);
    INSERT INTO posts VALUES (1, 201, 101);
    DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 101;
    ERROR:  null value in column &#34;tenant_id&#34; violates not-null constraint
    DETAIL:  Failing row contains (null, 201, null).

When we delete a user, we really only want to clear the author_id column in the posts table, and we want to leave the tenant_id column untouched. The feature I added is a small syntax extension to support doing exactly this. You can provide an explicit column list to the ON DELETE SET NULL / ON DELETE SET DEFAULT actions:    CREATE TABLE posts (
        tenant_id int REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,
        id serial,
        author_id int,
        PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id),
        FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, author_id)
          -- Clear only author_id, not tenant_id
          REFERENCES users ON DELETE SET NULL (author_id)
          --                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^
    );

I initially encountered this problem while converting a database to use composite primary keys in preparation for migrating to Citus [2], and it required adding custom triggers for every single foreign key we created. Now it can be handled entirely by Postgres![1]: https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CACqFVBZQyMYJV%3D...[2]: https://www.citusdata.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SQL MERGE looks great! I hope I remember it when the time comes, instead of writing 3 separate queries.edit: Postgres docs on MERGE: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-merge.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; PostgreSQL 15 lets users create views that query data using the permissions of the caller, not the view creator. This option, called security_invoker, adds an additional layer of protection to ensure that view callers have the correct permissions for working with the underlying data.Thank you, kind friends. This is a huge QOL improvement when using row-level security with views and is the top reason I&#39;ll be upgrading from Postgres 13 to 15."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"TikTok livestreams are a bizarre experience that doesn&#39;t get fully conveyed by this article. Scrolling through TikTok it will start showing you live streams every once in a while, and they tend to fall in to patterns like:* baby with a giant deformed head in some kind of medical setting, unable to tell if that baby is real -- if it is, then it&#39;s not a good situation for that baby* people who outwardly have disabilities of some sort, but it also looks like how you&#39;d act as having a severe disability if you&#39;re a con-artist (like constantly shaking, or very slurred speech, I still can&#39;t whether these are legit or not)* people with these vibrating bowls of sand with crystals in them, and they take crystals out of the bowl every once in a while to show you* a teenager building a house of cards, and when they get a certain sticker, they have to destroy the house of cards and start building it again. they are pretending to cry while doing this, and begging you not to give them that sticker    \* there was also a variation where it was a kid deleting games off their PlayStation when they got a certain sticker

* people pretending to sleep, and if you donate different kinds of stickers, it plays different loud sounds or trigger lights to &#34;wake&#34; them* people freestyle rapping on the spot, but it&#39;s more like 
melodic rambling to the same backing track, so you don&#39;t really have to rhyme, you just have to rap in a way that sounds like it rhymes or makes sense* and my favourite: some workers in what seems to be a Chinese factory assembling something like AirPods. they take the airpods, they take the case, they put the airpods in the case, and they throw the whole thing on to the completed pileI came across one last night that I hadn&#39;t seen before and was kind of cool. It was a livestream of a woman filling a washing machine with different detergents, and like, way too much detergents for a load, way too much, and then eventually she turned the machine on.It&#39;s a wild show that you don&#39;t ask for, it gets thrust on you every once in a while when scrolling. The whole game is to give viewers a reason to use stickers on the show, which gives the streamer money (and TikTok like 70% of it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really is a story for our age:Rather than giving money to organisations and charities that can distribute donations cheaply and fairly to those that need it, people give direct to the prettiest/most entertaining/most harrowing channel on a social media app and even then most of the donation ends up in the pockets of middlemen and for profit corporations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; TikTok clearly states that users are not allowed to explicitly solicit gifts, so this is a clear violation of their own terms of services, as well as the rights of these peopleWhy does the headline want to suggest otherwise?To me it sounds like users want to profit from the donations, they get 30%If they used proper infrastructures to encourage people to donate, they&#39;d get 0%BBC yet again is using and spreading the &#34;TikTok bad&#34; propagandaInstagram scam:https://dailytargum.com/article/2021/11/its-time-to-call-out...It&#39;s a systemic problem in the west from western users, where is journalism?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. Every sufficiently complex framework-free application contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a framework.2. If you have a talented team, that half of a framework can be much better than using a one-size-fits-all framework that is popular because it used to be lean and mean with a small surface area, but has grown over time to do everything for everyone, becoming a complex monster.3. If you have a small team that hires slowly, it&#39;s relatively straightforward to bring new devs up to speed on &#34;the way we do things.&#34; if you are hiring rapidly and/or have a large team, the more bespoke things you have, the harder it is to maintain them.4. Over time, everything degrades. In the long run, many framework-free applications either get walled off as &#34;legacy&#34; apps with new work done in separate services, or replaced outright. If it makes you money before that happens, you win. It is not necessary to try to design architecture that will last for centuries.5. My last and--to me the most significant--observation is this: You want to pay the majority of your attention to the code that has the greatest impact on your desired outcomes.Using libraries and frameworks is like a business outsourcing things that aren&#39;t its core competency and also aren&#39;t competitive differentiators. Most software shops do not win by having their own framework or by not having a framework, they win by using something bog-standard and saving their attention for the part of their code that &#34;moves the needle.&#34;But that&#39;s only &#34;most,&#34; and your business may be one of the few."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I see anti framework posts I am forced to frusteratedly chime in. This mentality makes me fume... not all of us work on massive teams where building stuff without a framework is even an option.And even then, whats really a &#34;framework&#34;? You could argue it&#39;s even the language itself. Android apps used to be written in Java, and now they are pushing Kotlin way harder (and it may even be the default soon). Everyone who wrote those JavaScript apps back in the 1990s without TypeScript, are they still just as maintainable as their TypeScript counterparts? Such a shortsided and ignorant view IMO.I think what bugs me the most is any sort of purist mentality (about anything) in software engineering. WE ARE ENGINEEERS. ENGINEERS USE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE RIGHT JOB! It should NEVER be &#34;always use X&#34;, &#34;never use Y&#34;. Both X and Y exist for a reason, so they are both useful for some reason.And again, because I&#39;m an engineer, I&#39;ve also built my fair share of apps in just &#34;purist&#34; languages, the classic HTML / CSS / JavaScript, so I&#39;m not against the purist approach either. Again, right tool for the right job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The post is promoting building applications in a loosely coupled but highly cohesive manner. It mentions using libraries when appropriate and not duplicating code.I agree with this but it requires a lead who&#39;s good at architecting such a codebase. That person also needs to stay with the company for a long time because they&#39;re essentially replacing the &#34;framework&#34; with bespoke human logic.I think many, maybe most, companies that try to build loosely coupled and highly cohesive code bases end up failing and it ends up being a mess.Frameworks aren&#39;t perfect. But know what&#39;s less perfect? Humans. The really big frameworks try and take the human component out and replace it with codified conventions."</p>

Well, few days later Aspose&#39;s support sends me a nicely worded note saying that they noticed that it was there and invalidated it for me.

I thought that was very proactive and excellent customer service."</p>

Once I found the right people to talk to things got better, but the entire experience was really reflective of how bad large orgs are with security.A friend once told me he was having a hard time getting a client to take his security concerns seriously. So I went on github and found a commit in their repo that included a production password and sent it to him. Maybe took 5-10 minutes to find? Apparently once they found out about the commit, they panicked a bit and started taking his concerns more seriously."</p>

I can’t help but feel that there are so many tens of thousands of similar stories without such a successful conclusion.In previous roles I’ve used BuiltWith before and it’s an invaluable tool. There’s a few companies with similar approaches except focusing on social media profiles (HypeAuditor comes to mind) that spawned in (iirc) 2017 after Instagram made significant changes to what data were available through their API.It seems similar that Etherscan had this type of first mover advantage with automated data indexing and basic discovery tools for the Ethereum blockchain.I wonder what the next wave of straightforward software utilities will be like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t hire until you need to.And then don&#39;t hire until you want to.I&#39;m doubtful every business can make it to $14M ARR, but I bet many companies could generate $1M ARR without needing employees. And that amount of money would be life-changing for many people (with, of course, the potential to sell what you&#39;ve created to exit).I&#39;ve spent much of my life chasing the &#34;make it big&#34; startup dream. I&#39;ll be pretty content if I can generate meaningful recurring revenue by building things I love. Still trying to decouple hours worked from the paycheck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Texas state politics/law is completely f&#39;d in so many ways, but one thing they do that I think is fantastic, and I wish all states did, was have a &#34;Sunset Review Commission&#34;, https://www.sunset.texas.gov/how-sunset-works.Basically, all agencies that are authorized by the legislature are set to automatically be abolished in (usually) 12 years. Once the expiration date is near, the Sunset Commission reviews the agency and recommends whether to reauthorize it, in which case the legislature must pass a law to reauthorize, but the &#34;default&#34; is that the agency expires.This really helps fight the natural tendency of lots of these professional agencies to grow to protect their own power, regardless of their original purpose. And even if agencies are normally always renewed, the review process itself is really useful to, when necessary, smack these agencies upside the head to get them back to their original goal. One example I&#39;m familiar with, a couple years ago the Sunset Commission basically tore the Texas Veterinary Board a new one after they decided to go after animal shelter vets for trying to save animals with extremely limited resources, https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/One-third-of... - actual report at https://www.sunset.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/reports/St..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest difference between an official site survey and you (or him) doing it themselves is liability. It is pretty clear from the language on the site that they aren&#39;t accepting legal liability and are just a convenience over doing it yourself using Google Maps or a tape-measure.I think the article is very well argued, and if this board&#39;s closure notice is allowed to stand then it will infringe on Californian&#39;s right to simply draw a map of their home or business. His business isn&#39;t offering site surveys and doesn&#39;t proclaim to, and to be honest even Google Maps/Bing/Apple could be at risk if this board&#39;s ability to close/ban this were allowed (they do show property boundaries after all).The biggest problem they&#39;re going to run into is: Who has deeper pockets? Since often in the US legal system that can decide the winner/loser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really feels like a &#34;spirit of the law&#34; vs &#34;letter of the law&#34; situation - requiring that only a licensed surveyor &#34;depict the location of property lines&#34; seems totally reasonable as to prevent the &#34;location of property lines&#34; from eroding legally, but banning a site loaded with &#34;THIS IS NOT A SURVEY&#34; disclaimers does not.A discrepancy between requirements from building departments and planning and platting departments is par for the course. Everywhere I have ever lived, the building department will accept an informal description of boundaries to determine whether or not a plan interferes with setback requirements, while a planning department or platting recorder will demand an officially certified survey to determine the actual parcel boundaries.I think this site&#39;s &#34;If your building department DOES NOT require a Surveyor, Engineer, or Architect Stamp our plans are just what you need!&#34; disclaimer is quite spot-on and it is rather frustrating that they are getting targeted.My own county (Boulder County, CO) offer a county-sponsored GIS service which is not surveyor-approved, with similar disclaimers. My surveyed parcel at my current household differed from their assessment by 5% and at my last household, by 10%. While this is a significant number, for building purposes, it isn&#39;t unreasonable - just a few degrees either way in the projection of edges. I think these sites should be allowed to stand with the acceptance that a suit based on the material contained in these sites would be bogus."</p>

The teacher asked him what he was doing that was so important that he couldn&#39;t listen, and to please come up and solve the problem.This kid walked straight up to the board and explained how you can design a computer program to factor any polynomial equation string input to it, and in fact had implemented a polynomial equation factoring program while the teacher explained how to factor simple quadratic equations.Since then, I don&#39;t feel bad if someone achieves more than me, because clearly there are some people out there that are born to solve certain classes of problems (maybe their brain structure is better for those, or something, who knows)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Summary:1. Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem: if p is prime, then b^p = b (mod p) for all integers b. i.e. b^p - b is always a multiple of p. 8^3-8 = 512-8 = 504 = 168 x 3.2. Is the inverse true? Does b^n - b = 0 (mod n) mean that n is prime? No. Sometimes n is non-prime (like n=561, divisible by 3). We call these n, Carmichael numbers.3. Okay, so these numbers exist. How common are they? For primes we know they&#39;re common. Bertrand postulated (Chebyshev proved) that for any n&gt;1, there is a prime p between n and 2n. That&#39;s cool!4. Is it true that there is such a bound for these pretend-primes? Well, we have an interesting fact that there are x^(1/3) of them below any x, once we pass a certain point (i.e. there exists an X such that there are x^(1/3) of them below any x &gt; X) so that makes us think it could be true! Worth seeing!5. But what about this common-ness measure like the B-C result for primes? Well, it turns out that it exists. It ain&#39;t as pretty as just between straight integer multiples, but the fact that it exists in some shape at all is cool! That&#39;s what this kid proved. Absolutely rollicking fact. https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06963"</p>

I see a similar thing in the children of world-class athletes."</p>

Not even the plaintiffs are claiming to have evidence of a demand to go with the bribe. But I expect it should be enough to subpoena the financial records that could prove that the information is true."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; alleged Meta employees added their accounts and others linked to OnlyFans competitors to databases used by companies internationally to identify malware and accounts linked to terrorism.If this is true, I&#39;d guess the situation might not only include issues of bribery, a quasi-public platform silencing speech, interfering with commerce, etc.It sounds like it might include abusing/compromising/eroding mechanisms intended for protecting people against violent attacks, as well as other aspects of national security."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Allocating all required memory during startup has been idiomatic for database architectures as long as I can remember. The obvious benefits to doing things this way are wide-ranging.There is a less obvious benefit in more schedule-driven database architectures. By implication, the code knows exactly how much of which resources are instantaneously available at all times since it is directly managing those resources. This enables the database to dynamically adapt its behavior and scheduling decisions in response to specific resource pressures or excess resource capacity. This is basically a fine-grained form of internal micro-backpressure, dynamically prioritizing subsets of the workload that minimize impact on the resources under pressure at any moment in time. In some versions, you can switch internal execution strategies to take advantage of currently under-utilized resources. If you outsource this to the OS, you have no idea how close or far you are from the limits, it doesn&#39;t really work.This doesn&#39;t add much performance per se but is great for minimizing tail latencies. It helps to create a robust internal resource equilibrium that handles transients and concurrency more smoothly and consistently than if the database couldn&#39;t make a fine-grained decisions about what to do from a position of total resource awareness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Building a system that allocates memory once up-front requires up-front thinking.sqlite apparently  has some support for this, although of course you make it more predictable if you control all the code.https://www.sqlite.org/malloc.htmlThey even provide some nice math for you to create the fixed size heap!The problem of dynamic memory allocation, and specifically the problem of a memory allocator breakdown, has been studied by J. M. Robson and the results published as    J. M. Robson. &#34;Bounds for Some Functions Concerning Dynamic Storage Allocation&#34;. Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, Volume 21, Number 8, July 1974, pages 491-499."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t this just a bunch of static object pools? That&#39;s extremely common in embedded programming. I&#39;m glad to see someone recognized it could apply to a database.My students do this on the GameBoy Advance specifically so they don&#39;t need to learn about dynamic memory allocation to get useful things done early in my course. In fact, they only learn about dynamic memory allocation for academic reasons later on and never _need_ to use it in their games."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Signal for a long time. I have repeatedly been unable to convince iOS users to use Signal because &#34;I don&#39;t want another app&#34;. Android users have been much more willing to give it a shot.As an android user myself, I much prefer having SMS built in because I use the search feature often to look back through all my SMS/Signal chats. I also regularly forward an SMS message to a Signal user, or vice versa. I&#39;m already starting to feel like those iOS users who told me &#34;I don&#39;t want another app&#34;...Signal seems to be trying to move further and further from &#34;my preferred way to chat with people&#34; and closer to the chat equivalent of &#34;that protonmail account I only log in to when I need secrecy&#34;.I obviously love having security on messages in transit, but I also like being able to keep my message history around and search my conversations for something that happened a year ago. It seems like Signal is on a trajectory to turn everything into disappearing messages. Are they the &#34;safe for activists&#34; communication app, or the &#34;let&#39;s try to make as many as possible safer by default&#34; app? Feels like they don&#39;t know.And on top of it all the messaging is just frustrating. &#34;we&#39;ve taken away an incredibly useful and heavily used feature so we have development resource to better implement shitcoins and such&#34; is such an irritating defense of the decision that I disabled my monthly donation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an awful decision. I&#39;ve converted some friends and family to Signal over the past years (it took a while) and it is now their default messaging app on their phones. This is going to confuse them and is going to make it difficult for me to keep convincing them that Signal is the route to use. (&#34;Why do I need 3 apps (Android Messages, Signal, Whatsapp) to talk to people?&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very upset by this decision. I&#39;ve been using Signal as my SMS app for a very long time.Messages that I would have sent via SMS currently will automatically get sent via Signal if the person I&#39;m sending to has started using Signal without my knowledge. This has happened in several instances where I was pleasantly surprised to see a friend had started using Signal. Now that I&#39;m forced into a separate SMS app, this will no longer be a possibility. I certainly won&#39;t be firing up Signal to see if a contact has joined before sending them an SMS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Eh.  If you don&#39;t want to donate, don&#39;t, but I don&#39;t quite get the outrage here.  The Wikimedia Foundation is still small as far as charities go and is visibly making Wikipedia better: the new UI is a breath of fresh air, and given the insane complexity of MediaWiki markup, the visual editor is a piece of unimaginable technical wizardry.  Wiktionary is an unheralded gem and even Wikidata is starting to be genuinely useful.For what it&#39;s worth, Charity Navigator gives them 4 out of 4 stars with a 98.33/100 rating: https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/200049703Meanwhile eg the American Cancer Society gets 73/100 and spends more on fundraising than WMF&#39;s entire budget, so oncologists can snort blow off hookers in Vegas, but nobody cares."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this the same person who every now and then appears on HN utterly outraged by Wikipedia&#39;s fundraising?I donate to Wikipedia.And I am glad they have lots of money.  I do not feel outraged about it, I feel happy about it.I do not feel outraged that they use whatever persuasive tactics that they use - this is necessary in the modern world.Wikipedia is a great service, it should be valued.  They should not always be living close to the edge of going out of business.  How they spend their funds raised is their business.This anti Wikipedia person is really annoying and I wish they would stop their crusade.EDIT: it seems the outraged guy is a right wing Murdoch journalist.   Enough said, it all adds up.  I still remember how Murdoch ran a successful campaign here in Australia to sink the planned national fibre to the home broadband network - 10 years down the track we never got our national fibre network.  These guys hate tech, especially free information services like Wikipedia and national broadcasters like the ABC Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Murdoch wants to own it all and hates free."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man, Wikipedia is like the best website I can think of. No joke.No silly 25MB framework, no hype, no popup banners (except the donation), no ads, no tracking, doesn&#39;t ask to sign up when I scroll down, no paywall...Just doing it&#39;s thing providing all the world with all knowledge for free, in a lot of languages.These managers can earn $4 million for all I care.Hell, I work for a mid-sized company that doesn&#39;t even come close to being as useful as Wikipedia and our C-suite earns a million a year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eno&#39;s most celebrated musical experiments were not exclusively confined to ambient music. He was also involved in a project which asked the question: what would it sound like if you created an orchestra which used standard, established musical instruments, playing well-known classical standard themes, but one that was composed of a combination of both fully competent musicians and totally inexperienced and utterly incompetent first-timers? Eno&#39;s answer was that you would produce extraordinary musical experiences for the listener which amounted to a unique combination of choice and chance. For me and many others, his translated into some of the funniest musical experiences I have ever known. Please listen to The Portsmouth Sinfonia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpJ6anurfuw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went to see him speak at a music festival in the summer. He spoke about one of his recent projects - the 10,000 year clock:
 https://www.solidsmack.com/design/what-jeff-bezos-and-brian-...
The idea is that modern living has been divided into smaller and smaller sub-divisions as processors get faster, media competes for attention and attention spans get shorter. The 10,000 clock was an artistic endeavour to engineer and design for a much broader time span - and every day the peal of bells is unique to that day only.
I found the way he thinks about extending the bounds of creativity in new ways quite inspiring."</p>

(Just like an MRI can construct a 2d slice from 1d info). So the first person game should have maybe a depth info on those pixels.What I mean, mario does not see only a line.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was an undergrad in college, I helped design a study on the role of gender perception in expertise.We had a piece of text that the subjects (undergrads) would read and rate the expertise of. We had the same text but we randomized whether the name would be a commonly male name, a commonly female name, or initials.We also randomized if they&#39;d watch a clip of men&#39;s sports beforehand (men&#39;s basketball), women&#39;s sports beforehand (women&#39;s basketball), or no sports. And finally we randomized whether the person giving the subjects instructions would be a young woman (one of my classmates) or a young man (me).Our small study showed what you&#39;d expect- students- men and women students rated male writers more highly than female writers, and initials were right in the middle, though they tended to be more like responses for men.The tester&#39;s gender made no difference that we found.The sports thing made a measurable difference, but it didn&#39;t reverse the skew.My 18/19 year old self was somewhat skeptical we&#39;d find a difference, but I was totally wrong. It taught me a lot about bias and perception, which this study also shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a former researcher with multiple high-impact publications I can 100% confirm it:- when I was a researcher in Italy for an unknown lab, all of our articles were generally very scrutinized and went through years of reviews before publication- when I worked in Michal Graetzel[1]&#39;s laboratory things get published much more easily on more higher impact journals with less scrutiny. Not only most of the publications didn&#39;t really add much to the scientific knowledge, but they didn&#39;t even have the very high standards required when I was in ItalyWhy is this bad? You get more funding the more you publish...So labs that publish easier due to the names involved get much more money...which they can use to publish even more and get even more money...which they can use to publish even more...There&#39;s excellent scientists anywhere, really. But funding, fame and politics are extremely asymmetric in academia.[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gr%C3%A4tzel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Double-anonymous/blind reviewing is completely standard in most areas of computer science, e.g. networking (SIGCOMM, NSDI, IMC, HotNets, MobiCom, MobiSys), systems (OSDI, SOSP, USENIX ATC, HotOS), security (Usenix Security, S&amp;P), machine learning (NeurIPS and ICML), graphics and HCI (SIGGRAPH and CHI), and at least some top-tier theory conferences (like FOCS).So I think most computer scientists would agree with the article&#39;s conclusion that double-anonymous reviewing, while flawed, is better than the alternatives. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done a non-anonymous submission in 10 years, and as a reviewer, usually I don&#39;t have a strong guess about who wrote the paper (and when I think I know, often I turn out to be wrong). It&#39;s a little annoying that this news article in Nature Magazine ignores the longstanding widespread prevalence of this practice in a conference-driven (but... we like to think important) academic discipline. :-)But:
(1) I don&#39;t think the big benefit of double-anonymous reviewing is that a lousy paper from a Nobel laureate (or, from CMU/Berkeley/MIT/Stanford) isn&#39;t let in unfairly. To me the big benefit seems to be that reviewers have to review every paper as if it might be from their friends or a famous person, and consequently have to review each paper with due care and try sincerely to understand its contribution, which maybe they wouldn&#39;t do if they knew it&#39;s from some random place/author they&#39;ve never heard of or don&#39;t think highly of. I think the way it affects judgment may be more in equalizing time/effort spent to read and understand a paper (and the generosity you give a paper because &#34;maybe&#34; it was written by your friend or somebody you respect), rather than a straight-up bias towards liking whatever the faculty at a famous university are writing about this year.(2) While I do think it&#39;s true, and a good thing, that double-anonymous reviewing helps &#34;marginalized groups of authors who often struggle to have their work see the world&#34; as the lead researcher says, we should probably acknowledge that authors are not the only beneficiaries of a scientific publication. The interests of the reader matter too -- the journal or conference has some duty to serve them. On the margin, maybe some readers would be more interested to learn what Albert Einstein is thinking about these days, or would like to see a well-balanced conference program that includes a good talk by a known-provocative speaker, instead of one more random (but adequate!) paper from a nobody. I&#39;m not saying we should give a huge weight to this -- it&#39;s fine to make people eat their vegetables, but, I don&#39;t think we should act like scientific publication is only to give authors a line on their CV and the readers&#39; preference is 100% irrelevant. A scientific journal shouldn&#39;t exclusively serve the authors. (Other kinds of media care way too much about what the reader wants, e.g. Facebook giving you whatever it thinks will keep you clicking things on Facebook, but there is probably a happy medium somewhere.)(3) The challenging frontier may be in grant submission and reviewing, where proposers are typically not anonymous to the reviewers, which surely leads to some biases. I have heard about government programs where they did use double-anonymous reviewing and it seemed weird to me. (Probably this is a situation where track record should matter, yet trying to summarize your own track record while remaining effectively anonymous seems really hard...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who&#39;s been closely following the Infowars/Free Speech Systems trials (watched all the depos, trial footage, etc.), all I can say is that I&#39;m glad these families are finally getting justice. Even though I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be tied up in appeals for awhile (and reduced on appeal), hopefully it&#39;ll prevent future harassment campaigns against families when tragedies occur.And before anyone says &#34;but why wasn&#39;t Jones given a trial to determine his guilt? The first amendment is under attack!&#34;, Infowars has repeatedly failed to prepare its employees for depositions, refused to respond to discovery requests, and has perjured itself numerous times. The default judgements received in both this and the Texas cases were well deserved, and anyone with a less explosive personality and media presence would have been given far fewer chances to comply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good verdict - defamation in the media is a very serious problem. It&#39;s unfortunate that it took a person like Alex Jones to convince people of it. If anything he should not be taken seriously. Those who are taken seriously have gotten away with much worse by merely apologizing or correcting themselves (as he did as well).As for the amount - the highest fine paid by Wall Street firms for the 2008 crisis was less than $100M. One of those numbers is unjust for sure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This title is so misleading, &#34;to pay&#34; and &#34;told to pay&#34; are not remotely the same. 
There is no chance Alex Jones will pay this amount.Actual headline is: Alex Jones told to pay $965m damages to Sandy Hook victims&#39; families@dang pls fix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks really promising. But by far the biggest moat that Jetbrains is going to have to cross to get into VSCode territory is the plugin ecosystem. Personally I work on React projects so my first thought was: &#34;is there a Prettier[1] plugin?&#34;. Looking through the landing page it looks like Plugins are in the works but until that is implemented, it&#39;s going to be hard adopting it.ALSO I just noticed this but can someone (ideally from JetBrains) explain what this line means: &#34;Requires login and periodic connection to JetBrains servers to verify the project&#34; (specifically the last 3 words of that sentence). Quite frankly this line is extremely alarming, are you saying that you&#39;re scanning my project to make sure it&#39;s not a &#34;professional&#34; project? I&#39;m going to assume this line means that they are checking the IDE and not your source but I won&#39;t be using this product until I get an explanation for this. You can find this at the very bottom in the licensing and pricing section.[1]: https://prettier.io/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Fleet is our new distributed polyglot editor and IDE.Ok, polygot makes sense, it supports more than just one language. But what does distributed mean in this context? You run the editor across many machines? What does that mean? Coming from a backend perspective, it quite doesn&#39;t make much sense. Thinking about it from a client-side perspective, I&#39;m guessing they mean the architecture is decoupled, meaning basically plugins/extensions but with a fancier word?Judging by the &#34;Features Matrix&#34; (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTWt9RlJ...), sad to see not a single non C-like language is being considered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funnily enough when you look at the countries in the &#39;happiness index&#39; they all happen to be countries which fundamentally have pretty good underlying economies (and often they tend to be from european countries that have decent social support structure).Well-being is probably a third-order effect from a strong economy, good healthcare / social care, culture and a variety of other factors. But because it is a third-order it is very hard to measure the impact of policy, because:* They are &#39;arms length&#39; from policy changes.* The indexes are slow to respond to changes.* They are noisy and affected by unrelated factors (i.e. does a colder winter decrease happiness?)* A policy which improves well-being today could very well decrease well-being far into the future (e.g. increasing a countries spending and decreasing tax)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So — suppose we give this sort of combined well-being survey to a random sample of people, and also measure what products and services they&#39;ve used and purchased. From this dataset, we could make reasonable statistical inferences about the amount of well-being increase or decrease associated with a certain product or service among a certain class of people.Unfortunately, no, you can&#39;t.  There are lots and lots of problems.  Just a few off the top of my head:1.  The effects of products are not uniform across the population.  Alcohol, for example, catalyzes well-being for some people, but for others it has a dramatic negative effect.2.  The effects of consumption on well-being change with the time horizon over which you measure them.  Eating ice cream might improve my subjective well-being today, but harm it tomorrow when it has a deleterious effect on my health.3.  Externalities.  Owning a private jet might improve my subjective well-being, but harm everyone else&#39;s with its noise and emissions.Measuring economic output is actually a not-entirely-unreasonable proxy for measuring well-being because in a free market people presumably make rational choices and spend their money in a way that maximizes their well-being.  The problem is not that the proxy is wrong, the problem is that people turn out not to be very good at making these choices.  It&#39;s not entirely their fault.  A big part of the problem is information asymmetry: producers know a lot more about the potential negative outcomes of their products than consumers do.I think a much better way to tackle this problem is with education and stronger consumer disclosure laws rather than trying to change the metric to something as poorly defined as &#34;well-being catalysis&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And that is exactly what New Zealand started doing in 2019[0].A large problem with metrics is that they have a tendency of becoming a goal of their own. Instead of them being used as mere indicators, we end up with entire countries whose sole goal is to eternally increase their GDP - to the extent that it ends up harming the general population.People do not solely exist to generate revenue, and it is about time we stop pretending they do.[0]: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/07/11/new-ze..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This study was in Chinese people who were overweight and were eating a lot of carbs (~300g a day). Presumably this was largely high GI rice. IF made a modest difference. They also lost some muscle mass, as expected. The study tested a lot of different variables, apparently without adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing.Hard to generalise these results. If you are eating a toxic diet, I guess more time without it is a good thing. A similar study in a Western population showed no effect of isocaloric IF [1]. In another study, IF with energy restriction in obese subjects was more effective than energy restriction without IF [2].I don’t see that the data supports IF as a universal strategy. If you are obese, then these studies suggest eating less, for less hours of the day and less at night is probably beneficial. Otherwise, as far as health interventions go, exercise has a much larger magnitude of benefit than dietary interventions. It also has the major advantage of simplicity - more exercise is better for everyone everywhere at every age [3]. Contrast this with the utterly confusing state of nutrition science. And exercise also makes a difference even when you do a little bit, whereas eating a little bit better does almost nothing.[1] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullar...[2] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/articl...[3] This is not 100% true. There are some contraindications to exercise for people with specific conditions.EDIT: When talking about the benefits of exercise versus diet, I mean the effects on health in general (mortality, lifespan, healthspan). Exercise isn&#39;t an effective method of weight loss as others have indicated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What an incredibly frustrating video. Here is the actual run without all the unnecessary fast-and-furious computer graphics rubbish at the start: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDK0LhKkMs&amp;t=76s"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Students break acceleration world record...for electric vehicles.This isn&#39;t close to the record for dragsters; if they can increase the energy density per unit mass there are traction and downforce improvements that can be used to improve this. It&#39;s very hard to beat chemical energy like detonating gasoline or nitromethane - you&#39;re looking at roughly a factor of 100, with ~40 MJ/kg for gasoline and 0.4 MJ/kg for a lithium ion battery - especially if you&#39;re racing through a 15 PSI gas that you can use in your chemical reaction without having to accelerate it onboard.I suspect that traction control for an electric motor may someday allow electric vehicles to exceed the records held by internal (well, mostly internal) combustion engines. You could keep the tire at exactly the right amount of slip for maximum acceleration, rather than trying to balance centrifugal clutches to get just the right amount of power at the right time.I wonder what the record is for a vehicle that can pick up electric energy from a tether/rail/overhead wire...though cables that can carry megawatts of energy are probably pretty heavy.Edit: I think the most interesting category here is the typical friction-propelled, human-carrying vehicle of either chemical or electric power sources. Railguns, rockets, fan cars (using active downforce), and vehicles which engage the ground by rack and pinion are qualitatively different. When the question is accelerating your own mass forwards using the friction developed by your own mass being pulled down by gravity, there&#39;s an interesting optimization problem trading off weight and power."</p>

If not: DSL or mobile data (if your data cap allows) is fine for HN front page. Judging by the current page weighing 100KB, you can have 10 visitors every second at 1 MiB/s upload. (HN reaches that rate only in spikes, even at a top three position.)&gt; I’d also like it to be quick!It&#39;s currently not quick at DigitalOcean (2 seconds for TLS setup, 12 seconds for HTML, 8 seconds for JavaScript, etc... 27 seconds total). It can only get better!I can recommend something beefier than a raspberry pi, though, or at least than than the pi 1-3 speeds that I&#39;m used to. I personally use an old laptop which is plenty fast for, well, anything you&#39;d also ask of a daily driver, except it now doesn&#39;t need to render a GUI which speeds things up a lot. They can peak up to 100W depending on the model, but are usually very low power when nothing is being asked of them.&gt; Oh, and I don’t want to have my home network hacked.Then install unattended-upgrades, put admin panels (phpmyadmin, wp-admin) behind basic authentication, don&#39;t host things you don&#39;t trust (random code written by &#39;someone on the internet&#39; that has never been tested by anyone), put it in a VLAN if you want to be extra cautious, and you&#39;ll be fine.

People became friends that otherwise were in different cliques irl.One time we were supposed to be doing work during class, but everyone was on IRC chatting. The classroom was completely silent. Somebody wrote &#34;somebody say penis&#34; in the channel and the whole classroom started laughing at the same time, for seemingly no reason.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m baffled by the reaction here. I agree that productive VR work is still not ready for prime time, but most of you haven&#39;t tried any of this (let alone the new hardware) and you&#39;re already dismissing even the possibility of it becoming good in the future. Reminds me of the Dropbox thread. You know which one.Also what I really don&#39;t understand is how anyone can have anything against them spending $$$ on R&amp;D? Worst case scenario: their whole productivity angle doesn&#39;t work out, they lose billions upon billions in the coming decade and eventually scrap the whole thing. Then they&#39;ve still invented a lot of super interesting tech along the way. High resolution displays, low latency rendering pipelines, novel human interface technologies, high fidelity hand tracking, lightweight and sharp lenses, the list goes on and on. There&#39;s lots of applications for each of those things and almost nobody else is willing to spend this much cash for such an uncertain roi.
I, for one, am super excited about what the future iterations of this will look like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really can’t understand why there’s so much time and resources being put into re-inventing virtual meetings.This is supposed to capture subtle facial expressions. I’m sure every generation will capture more subtleties and have increasingly realistic avatars.  So why not just see real faces then?I always see mentions of virtual sticky notes on a whiteboard.  That sounds awful.  Do you need to squint to view them from your virtual seat at the table?  Do you need to walk your avatar to the board and avoid bumping into others who might be posting their own?  We don’t have those issues today with sites like Miro. If the metaverse will somehow avoid these annoyances then how would it be any different from the non-metaverse experience?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been a very early adopter of this tech (Kickstarter backer of Oculus), get zero motion sickness and have a great time working in VR through a virtual desktop. This looks like a few floating screens in front of my face, in a space station and I’m typing on a real Bluetooth keyboard. I think this is the only way companies will be able to keep remote-friendly polices and stay competitive with product. YMMV because I am biased to be for this, but, the way they’ve tuned this Pro model looks like it’s exactly for my use-case."</p>

An interesting concept but I never felt like I was listening to a conversation between two people. Jobs sounds weirdly far away, he also was never a &#34;fast talker&#34;. Listen to his interview at MIT where he takes questions. He always stopped for long pauses, stares off into space for a minute. He didn&#39;t rush into responses and tended to nail timing really well.Rogan sounds more believable but I suspect you&#39;d get the same results sitting down at Audacity and cutting together an MP3. You just have better quality samples of him talking to people in a podcast setting.It&#39;s an interesting demo but I&#39;m not sure why I would want this to exist.

Jobs does sound a bit off tho, a bit thin...there should be enough data on him to do a sparse reconstruction of his voice to a level of accuracy beyond human discernment tho.The thing this got wrong about Job&#39;s voice cadence, tho is: Jobs speaks a lot more slowly and deliberately, and with a lot more pauses, than here. I suspect the cadence / timing is not so emphatically modelled by this AI.I think also they&#39;re missing some emotional trajectory coherence in both their voices. Like the emotional register of the voice does not sound or transition as naturally, and is less diverse.Incredible PoC. AI folks are the new dark wizards. WTF can they not do? That list is shorter"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi everyone, cofounder of play.ht (the startup behind this podcast) here. let me know if you have any questions.To give more context, the podcast was totally AI generated, the content itself was generated from a finetuned GPT3 on SteveJobs&#39; biography, the voices were cloned from few hours of both Joe and Steve voices, even though it was tough to get good content for Steve Jobs. And the podcast artwork was generated by SD.We will be releasing more episodes soon which will be even more mind-blowing!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reddit discussion for the original mod-replacement incident: https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/y12jo3/sta...The entire subreddit is in a process of community migration now: https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unbelievable behavior from SD. The subreddit is currently an unmoderated mess, illustrating they have no clue how to run the community.I am unsurprised at Discord&#39;s behavior, handing over a server like that. They have essentially been hostile when not silent to us at WSB with our 600K user server.Reddit has an opportunity to do better here. Hand back control of r/StableDiffusion back to OP.Steve Huffman alluded to the disaster that is sub transitions in the recent Mod Summit. If someone at Reddit is reading this, this is your opportunity to do better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Discord&#39;s use of the word server is misleading, and it leads people to think they own something when they don&#39;t. Discord owns it and can pull the rug out from under you at any time, regardless of how much hard work you put into building a community, and that hurts.I understand that &#34;server&#34; is an abstract term and just means &#34;something which provides a service&#34;, but most other uses of the word relate to something owned by the person operating it. E.g., if I run a Matrix server instance, it&#39;s mine to administer, manage, destroy, etc. If I start a Discord &#34;server&#34; it&#39;s a glorified chat room or set of chat rooms owned and maintained by the company.Language is powerful and helps shape our world, and by redefining &#34;server&#34; to mean a segmented part of someone else&#39;s website, it&#39;s another nail in the coffin for the concept of real ownership."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to put away a liter of vodka a night. I kept it up for years, accumulating a solid decade of heavy drinking. I was miserable. It was souring my relationship. The stress from work, personal life, and declining mental state of course made me feel even more compelled to drink. I was becoming a shell of my former self, and my dreams were becoming strictly that.I had a confluence of events that changed my course:1. I attended a tech conference where someone I personally knew who had went through rehab was hosting and speaking, and he was filled with a vivacity I hadn’t seen from him before.2. My spouse gave me an ultimatum to quit or he’d be out the door. It wasn’t the first time he had said this, but I had a feeling it was probably going to be the last.3. My progression in life was stalling. I couldn’t keep up commitments anymore, and I was starting to feel like I had already passed my peak.So I quit. Cold Turkey. It was a dangerous, stupid thing to do, but I knew if I tried to taper off, I’d just slide back. The withdrawals were nightmarish, and I was lucky I didn’t die from it. But I pulled through, and then started to do some heavy soul searching for why I ever picked up the bottle — what was I escaping from? And I found those answers, and got to work — A real kind of personal work that most people will never have to put into themselves.Since then, I have been a cofounder, jumped multiple levels in my career, and have been working towards several academic publications, on top of drastically improving my personal life. It’s been nearly five years since I put down the bottle. And every day I choose to never pick it up again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t had a drink in 27 days, which is the longest I&#39;ve gone in a while. Left to my own devices, I tend to settle into a pattern of 2-4 drinks per night, 5-6 nights a week (I actually tracked this for a while with a spreadsheet).It&#39;s not like, ruin my life, wake up in a gutter type situation, but it leads to just feeling somewhat crappy all the time, and I didn&#39;t like it, so I wanted to stop.Some things that helped / are helping:I have an app Habit Tracker. It&#39;s a pretty simple app with a list of habits you want do do, you can set on some schedule. When you do them, you tick them off and it keeps track of how many times, so you build up a streak. I made a &#34;don&#39;t drink&#34; habit, and check it off in the morning if I didn&#39;t drink the day before. It also shows a notification bubble on the app if you don&#39;t check it off and I hate that. It&#39;s like this little negative reinforcement that I have to live with that bubble all day if I drank the day before. It&#39;s silly, but it helped.Reading the book This Naked Mind and listening to The Huberman Lab podcast episode about alcohol (#86) also helped. Alcohol messes up your body in a lot of ways, even at what&#39;s considered &#34;moderate&#34; or &#34;normal&#34; levels of drinking./r/stopdrinking on RedditAlcohol is an addictive drug and when you stop after using it regularly, you&#39;re going to feel cravings. It&#39;s not a moral failing, it&#39;s physiology. They do get less intense and less frequent after the first two weeks or so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was drinking heavily and knew that it would be the quickest and most effective hack towards being a better father and husband. I first stepped into an AA meeting and as the opportunity to speak was going around the room I started seeing many similarities between the people sharing their stories and myself. I thought to myself &#39;If I were perhaps an alcoholic, what could I share about it and how it may hurt me and those that love me?&#39; When the opportunity for me to share came up, I said &#39;screw it!&#39; to myself and spilled the beans. &#34;I am an alcoholic...&#34;The meetings made me feel good at first as I kept telling myself that my stories could potentially help someone else. I did not end up sticking with the AA program but the meetings really launched me into the right direction and finding my own path. I do drink NA beer and as many others in the comments have pointed out, there is a lot offered in that arena as of lately.I am a very social person and navigating that lifestyle for the first time without alcoholic beverages was the biggest challenge for me. But I learned to like the challenge and found that sparked a lot of conversations with friends that were interested in quitting or dialing it back. It also identified and strengthened a lot of friendships where people normally wouldn&#39;t drink while doing whatever it was we are doing, but they did because I was &#39;the drinker.&#39;Next week marks my first year of sobriety, so I am certainly no expert, but feel free to reach out if you ever need to hash some things out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know much about the whole space, but from what I&#39;ve read so far about Wayland, it starts to feel a lot like yet another &#34;perpetual next-gen&#34; tech, such as IPv6, fuel cells, the Semantic Web or XHTML2 (before that one was officially declared dead at least).Like, according to the linked article, the standard is out there since 2008 - so the adoption period is already 14 years! And people are still haggling about basic stuff like color management, mouse cursors and window decorations?What exactly is the envisioned timeframe for Wayland to replace X11 as the dominant windowing system?If the standard has been promoted as the obvious next step for linux desktop environments for 14 years but still hasn&#39;t actually caught on, are we sure it really is the right direction to go?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work at a different FAANG and it seems like more and more the only news that we get from corporate is related to DEI. Also a lot of hiring details are now hidden from ICs. It used to be that you would be apart of the interview panel as an interviewer and then you would get together with your team afterwards and everyone on the team would vote yes/no and that would pretty much be it. Now it’s made by a manager elsewhere and you have no idea why the decision was made.I do worry that my kids won’t be diverse enough to be able to get into a decent school or get a good job like I was able to when they’re older.We used to argue for equality, a level playing field, for all. Now we’ve had the rug swapped from underneath us.It’s no longer about equality of opportunity, it’s about equality of outcome. To quote Kamala Harris’ recent remarks “to make sure everyone ends up in the same place”, i.e. “equity”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I shut my mouth at work and go along with this stuff because I have no choice. I have a family to take care of. I&#39;ve accepted this. But man, why do they always throw in the line about striving to make the workplace a &#34;diverse and inclusive culture where everyone can bring their full and authentic self&#34;? Everyone knows that&#39;s a goddamn lie. I almost want to cry when I read that - it makes me so angry. I haven&#39;t been anything like myself in the workplace for over a decade now and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll never be again. I live a lie when I&#39;m here and so do many, many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You might imagine this policy doesn’t bias the hiring process, since managers are still free to choose who to hire after interviewing the diverse candidates. But because of the number of applicants, most are rejected based on their resumes. Imagine diversity candidates are 1% of the applicants but 15% of those interviewed. This gives those candidates opportunities to do well in interviews that their peers with similar resumes do not get.So minority candidates are given an advantage in getting their foot in the door, but still have to prove themselves qualified for the job by doing well in interviews.On average, those candidates would have started with a disadvantage in getting their foot in the door for several reasons – including outright discrimination, and the cumulative effect of past discrimination, but also softer factors such as being less likely to have helpful personal connections.  This applies not just to the Microsoft job at issue, but to the previous jobs that would have populated their resumes (and for younger candidates, even schools).Compensating for that sounds like a good policy to me.Now, the post also suggests there is pressure to actually hire or promote less-qualified candidates, which might be a problem, but in that area the post is more vague and speculative."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OkCupid was bought by Match Group (who run almost all online dating sites, including Match, eHarmony, and Tinder) in 2011 and took down this post not long after.EDIT: the purchase was Feb 2011 [1] and the post was removed sometime between Jan 2011 [2] and Mar 2011 [3].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related personal anecdote:I am experimenting with Tinder subscription at the moment, and it feels incredibly exploitative. When you make a profile, matches are frequent and you can tell that you show up for people. However it gradually falls down with time, and the only predictable and obvious way to get back up is to pay for Boosts and/or Priority Likes.Right now my 6-month old profile gets ZERO likes outside of the time it&#39;s Boosted ($3 a pop or something). I get plenty once I&#39;m boosted, so the profile attractiveness doesn&#39;t seem to be a factor.It feels like the app&#39;s algorithms are rigged to gradually push you towards paid subscription options. There must be a huge invisible market of Tinder whales given how exploitative it is, gambling addiction, loneliness, and desperation for dates are correlated traits and I would absolutely bet on Tinder exploiting this heavily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem really happens when you do algorithmic price setting, which incentivizes you as the developer to get people addicted to the experience of swiping, regardless of whether or not the swiping has the desired outcome for the end user. A user base with just the right levels of dopamine from interactions and loneliness will probably end up buying one of the weekly promotional deals.That&#39;s why when you first start on any dating service, you&#39;re (typically) inundated with activity, so that you can always chase that high, and when you can&#39;t get it, you try to pay for it.Online dating is a tough problem to solve, tougher still when profit incentives misalign with user success incentives! I&#39;m not even sure what an equitable but also successful dating service would look like, because there&#39;s this fundamental mismatch in values."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried Firefox again a few days ago, and it was indeed noticeably snappier. In fact, it felt snappier than Chrome on the handful of sites I tried.With all the things they&#39;ve addressed in Firefox recently and with Chrome&#39;s manifest v3 nonsense, I&#39;m running out of reasons not to switch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This blog post has some good discussion about what makes a good locking primitive. On macOS, os_unfair_lock is generally a good choice for many applications. That said,&gt; At this point, you might wonder if os_unfair_lock – possibly coupled with the undocumented flags – would be a good fit for your codebase. My answer is likely yes but you’ll have to be careful when using it.I would hesitate to give this advice. The overwhelming majority of applications on macOS do not have performance profiles like Firefox does. The system allocator (rather than jemalloc) is the right choice for all but very few use cases. There are a vanishingly small number of usecases where using the undocumented flags is appropriate.The rules are different when you’re a popular browser with an existing relationship with Apple and dozens of smart engineers who can (at least in theory) understand the consequences of using this API, and leverage an existing relationship with Apple to ensure that it doesn’t become a liability in the future as the platform evolves. For pretty much everyone else, this should be nothing more than a “wow, neat” blog post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve used Helix for all my recreational programming projects (in Rust) for about 6 months and I&#39;ve written about 10kLOC of code with it. Still using vim at $WORK for a variety of reasons (giant c++ codebase that does not easily plug in to clangd/LSP), but I might be doing the switch soon.Installation was easy and the default configuration is good. Plugging in rust-analyzer still needed a line or two of config file editing, but that should not be necessary for very long. Hint: use `hx --health` to check that all the tools are properly installed and configured (it shows a matrix of programming languages and their associated tooling, with red/green check marks).My Helix config file is about 5 lines long, but my Vim config is in the hundreds of lines.I had very little friction coming from Vim and a little bit of Kakoune.I particularly like the fact that all the important features are built-in and not half baked scripts with unintended side effects (e.g. opening a Makefile in Vim triggers a ftplugin script that messes editor-global config instead of buffer-local, with the default out of the box scripts).Lots of people are requesting a plugin extension system, which is kinda understandable since every editor seems to have one. But I haven&#39;t had a need to add any kind of plugin, and it&#39;s easy enough to fork a shell for an external process if needed.It&#39;s still rough around the edges, but good enough for a daily driver.Thanks to everyone working on the project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fully expect Helix to replace Vim, Neovim, and Kakoune for most users in the long run.Helix is built from the ground up around Tree-Sitter and LSP. This means you get the best syntax highlighting available, and IDE-like functionality, with zero configuration required other than installing the appropriate language server.Those are by far the most important features for a text editor to have, and crucially, they are fully integrated into Helix, but are an afterthought in (Neo)vim and Kakoune. The quality difference is obvious the moment you try it side by side. Nothing else really matters. Vim&#39;s and Kakoune&#39;s syntax highlighting is terrible, and while Neovim can now use Tree-Sitter as well, there always seem to be some additional hoops the user needs to jump through in order to get it to work. Not so with Helix.Regrettably, Helix has inherited Vim&#39;s worst design flaw, namely being unusable with non-English keyboard layouts, but all other Vim derivatives share this flaw as well so I don&#39;t see that stopping Helix from steamrolling the competition once it matures and the word spreads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been trying out Helix for the last few months as part of my now 24 year quest to incorporate some form of vi into my daily routine. This time, it&#39;s looking good. What sets it apart are the (zero-conf) built-in LSP and tree-sitter highlighting, and the select-verb modal keybindings instead of vi&#39;s verb-object syntax, where you see what you&#39;re about to do before you do it. Some of the key combinations also show a reminder menu, aiding the learning process, which is a nice touch over plain old vi which has zero discoverability. General performance is also very good, the editor feels a lot snappier than a fully loaded Neovim or Doom Emacs, or a monster like Visual Code.I think there are plans to see if a graphical editor could be built on top of it, which would be an interesting project. As a new Rust graphical tree-sitter based editor, it would probably rival the upcoming open-or-not Zed editor by the Atom folks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there is more behind SerenityOS that elevates it above being just another OS project. They&#39;ve attracted hundreds of contributors and have instilled a unique sense of culture within their community (as an example, going as far to devote an entire GitHub repository to documenting a list of &#34;yak-shaving&#34; yak emojis[1]).I think that kind of social endeavor isn&#39;t something a lot of maintainers can accomplish, not even those with the skills to work on such a project all by themselves.[1] https://github.com/SerenityOS/yaksplained"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Andreas and his project SerenityOS was a huge inspiration for me to start my side project daedalOS (https://github.com/DustinBrett/daedalOS) which I&#39;ve almost been doing for 2 years now. I really enjoy watching his monthly updates on his channel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if, at some point, some commercial project adopts a part of Serenity and turns it into a huge hit, even outside of tech.Such things have definitely happened in the past.. Not many (average) people have heard of KDE or its web engine, KHTML, but almost everybody these days uses Chrome, which, through Apple&#39;s WebKit, is descended from KHTML itself.Serenity uses its own libraries everywhere, to the point of replacing C++&#39;s std with their own library, AK, which might make stripping it for parts more difficult, but it&#39;s certainly not unimaginable.If Serenity&#39;s web engine gets good enough, I can even imagine some EU government sponsoring an independent competitor to the Google / Apple browser duopoly."</p>

Then you need to deal with DirectX, audio (hello PulseAudio, my old friend), input devices (gamepads, joysticks), etc. It’s a lot of work!These last paragraphs just made me realise how grateful I am to people who work on these open source projects without expecting any compensation or even praise for their work.It has happened once or twice that I tried running something in Wine and it just wouldn&#39;t work which made me a little annoyed.But reading how complex and difficult it is to make such things happen I am surprised the amount of effort it takes to even make Notepad.exe work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I&#39;m curious about (and probably there are some good write ups about this somewhere) that how come modern Linux and modern Wine is better to run old Windows applications than modern Windows (7 to some extent but mostly 10&amp;11). Did MS &#34;intentionally&#34; &#34;left behind&#34; certain APIs and system calls to sacrifice it for some greater good? Like I use Windows every day and have no problems at all. And I use Linux every day too for work. But by my experience if I come around an old Windows application (Vista, XP, 2000 or before) then I probably have a better chance to run it as it meant to be on Linux w/ Wine than on Windows 10/11"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems there is some confusion of what this page is about or why it might be relevant. This is not about an end-user product to run desktop virtualisation, but it is a page for developers in the Apple ecosystem to programmatically make use of OS-native virtualisation to create virtual machines with graphics output.The value in this is not as much that &#34;it is possible&#34; because there are plenty of implementations of this possibility, but it&#39;s more about the vendor-native support, vendor-native documentation and examples and the signal it gives about the current state of support.In the wild, an end-user (that includes developers, it&#39;s not a derogatory term, it simply mens the person the product is intended to be used by) might see applications like UTM, Veertu, Q and others use this under the hood.VirtualBox doesn&#39;t work on ARM by the way, they only release for x86(_64). So it can only virtualise, and only on x86 hosts for x86 guests."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I thought Elon&#39;s tweet was pretty funny, not just because &#34;X&#34; is already taken by X.com which he founded, but also because we already kinda tried an &#34;everything app&#34;. It&#39;s called Facebook, and the reason why other social networks like Instagram and Twitter exist _at all_ is because Facebook could not keep everyone on their network.Lest we forget, Facebook was the ONLY social network people used for a good long while, at least when I was graduating HS and entering college. You had Facebook for actual social networking, band/music pages on MySpace, and everything else was essentially porn bots and pedophiles, aka &#34;spam city&#34;. So you have to wonder, if an everything app actually is a good idea, why couldn&#39;t the one company who had the most opportunity at the perfect time with as much funding as they could possibly need...not be able to do it?Just because something works in China, doesn&#39;t mean it will work everywhere else. Actually, I would say that if something works in China, your best bet is that it _won&#39;t_ work anywhere else. TikTok being a notable exception."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The web is an everything app, and despite capture by incumbents it is still the most open platform we have and it is not illiberal. The reason for that is open standards that are not owned by anyone. We need open identity standards and open payment standards so we can have an everything web that is liberal. But governments have to allow those things to happen. Right now their legislation favors the incumbent monopolies"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I could go back in time and just curb crypto from growing into the current tumor it has become. Decentralization efforts applied to app servers and services would have been such a better use of time and energy imo.If there was a protocol for cab hailing, and anyone could roll it out for someone to connect to their network (like xmpp), and anyone could offer to become a driver or play another role like customer support, they earn their local currency and are a part of their local economy. The same protocol could be used in Norway and in Taiwan. There might be a gap that’s too hard to fill, and someone else could create another protocol that works in their local economy, maybe like a matrix protocol. They’re completely different but serve to solve the same problem of real time communication.Then Elon’s super app could offer users a platform which tries to implement multiple protocols, or have a in app protocol marketplace which is the sub apps. Apps for buying shoes, or buying groceries, or hiring movers. Users could become consumers or agents, so they can both work for various protocols and spend their money on them. They would be vetted and backed by the super app.It would be fully decentralized, except for the payment part. If you have everyone on your platform you don’t need to issue tokens and other bullshit. Just build something useful and they will come."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is &#34;cheapest&#34; the right objective? Because if that&#39;s the case, book piracy seems like the clear winner.But maybe we should consider &#34;cheapest with some boundaries&#34;. For instance, we probably agree that bookstores are nice for a myriad of reasons, even if we don&#39;t frequent them. They employ people in the area, they offer curation and recommendations, they invite speakers and host events, and they help local authors get started. They may offer benefits or profit sharing.But a physical space like that costs money. Experience costs money. Curation costs money (indirectly).I&#39;d argue that cheapest as a metric undercuts best as a metric. Cheap is one important input to the purchasing decision, but it shouldn&#39;t be the only one.We have to learn to accept some inefficiencies and some personal inconveniences for the sake of a healthier social ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking of SD, I wonder if 1.4 will be the last truly open release as Emad said 1.5 would release a while ago but it&#39;s been held up for &#34;compliance&#34; reasons. Maybe they got legal threats due to using artists&#39; works and stock images. If so, that would be sad to see it.In a way it reminds me of people who make unofficial remakes of games but get cease and desists if they show gameplay while in development. The correct move is to fully develop the game and release it, then if you get C&amp;Ds, too late, the game is already available to download."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s always nice to hear about someone writing a cool program just because they felt like doing so.  Every time I think about writing a forum server, I find I return to the thought that Usenet was better, and that if I wanted a web forum, I&#39;d consider putting a web front end on an NNTP server.  That would among other things let people keep using NNTP clients (I like gnus.el) if they don&#39;t want to use a browser.  There are a bunch of NNTP web clients already, but afaict they all needlessly suck.You might take a look at Fossil (fossil-scm.org) which is not a forum, but is an all-in-one source control system, bug tracker, wiki, and web backend, all implemented as an SQLite client written in C.  Its blurb says a scripting language might sound more attractive than C superficially, but in Fossil, SQLite does all the heavy lifting that would otherwise have been done with scripts.  On my bottomless todo list I want to study its implementation sometime, since I think it would be a good example of &#34;advanced&#34; uses of SQL and SQLite.  That is completely independent of Fossil&#39;s purpose as a VCS application.  I&#39;m ok at basic SQL but not so clueful about sophisticated uses.One thing to watch out for is that since SQLite is an embedded DB, when you make an SQlite query, the overhead is basically a local subroutine call rather than the network traffic that a client/server DB would incur.  That in a way changes the asymptotics of an application: particularly, the &#34;N+1 queries&#34; antipattern of some client/server DB apps is a perfectly ok design strategy for SQLite.  I believe Fossil may rely on this in some way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I commend you for hand rolling it all and not using JS.I miss the days of good ole forum software (e.g. FluxBB/PunBB) before it was superseded with massive JS bloat/clunky forum software like Discourse, Flarum, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That reminded me of the 1KB forum: https://nerdparadise.com/programming/phpforumI actually shortened it, expanded it to add bot detection and published the update also under 1KB: https://gist.github.com/Xeoncross/1503594Such abuse PHP could handle back then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s an artist called Øystein Wyller Odden that works with mains hum. I find it pretty fascinating:Kraftbalanse is a musical translation of the hum from the mains; i. e. the frequency of the alternating current. The piece is based on the fact that this frequency is not stable, it fluctuates subtly around 50 Hz as a direct result of supply and demand in the power market.The composition consists of a self-resonating piano that is tuned to resonate on 50 hz and overtones of 50 hz (100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz etc.) The piano is fitted with vibration-elements – transducers – plugged directly into the electrical grid, causing the resonance and timbre of the piano to change with the fluctuations on the power market.The piano is accompanied by a string octet. The musicians are equipped with voltmeters that measure the frequency of the current in real time, as well as a score of instructions on how to respond to changes in this frequency.https://vimeo.com/370554138"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stripe is extremely bad at fraud. I have a company that continues to charge my credit card monthly, their website and email do not work anymore. I continue to charge back them every single month, and Stripe continues to charge my card. This has been going on for about 7 months now. If I ask them to help, they tell me to contact AMEX, I contact AMEX they tell me to contact Stripe.The website doesn&#39;t work, the email doesn&#39;t work, I charge it back every single month, yet Stripe doesn&#39;t care one bit.Attempting to contact Stripe results in emails asking if I need help resetting my password (yes I legit sent an email asking for them to investigate the &#34;company&#34; and they sent back a reply with details on how to reset my password), to telling me to contact my credit card provider.Honestly both companies are giant bags of turds, if you can you should look elsewhere, you can save money on almost every fee, there are alternatives to every single product they provide, and pretty much all of the alternatives are varying degrees of better or cheaper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one part of this article that I totally agree with is how terrible the API integration has become. In the early days, Stripe sold itself on a few things, one of which was the simplicity of integration. Since the whole PaymentIntents and SetupIntents introduction (along with the documentation fiasco that happened at the same time), integrating with Stripe is something like PayPal from 10 years ago. Its shit.PaymentIntents workflow (including the necessity to listen for webhooks) deserves a special place in hell. Its like they decided to copy Paypal IPN.I have used, recommended and intgrated Stripe to multiple businesses over the years (generating hundreds of US$ millions). For the past 2 years or so, I have migrated most of them away from Stripe, and any new integrations are done through other payment processors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is extremely confusing and filled with do many errors it&#39;s hard to even list them all. However, the bit I wanted to focus on was the author&#39;s claim that PayPal got &#34;sued&#34; and &#34;stopped taking money from people&#34;. Getting sued is part of the ordinary course of business for a company like PayPal, and ~85% of lawsuits like that go nowhere, and result in no internal changes. The specific lawsuit the author seems to have been talking about was dismissed entirely by a judge in July, because the contact you sign with Facebook when you use their account explicitly forbids you from suing them instead of going through private arbitration proceedings: https://www.pokertube.com/article/chris-moneymaker-s-class-a... (Chris Moneymaker&#39;s Class Action Lawsuit Against PayPal Falls At First Hurdle).And again, this is the kind of thing that happens to PayPal all the time. The fact that some random lawsuit that never even required a substantial reply from PayPal got picked up by Zed as evidence of their bad behavior &#34;finally catching up to them&#34; really erodes my confidence in the way he represents any of the other details in this article. What else is he misrepresenting or exaggerating?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"May I suggest a purely rational, evidence based take?The trap is your belief in a linear relationship between effort and
outcome. Working harder and longer produces more productivity, right?That&#39;s false.As you say so yourself, your memory goes to shit. It&#39;s not just a law
of diminishing returns. For coders, past a certain point, exhaustion
leads you to start undoing your work. You are into negative
productivity.I&#39;ve pushed through all-nighters where I poured out a few thousand LOC
only to find the next day that I had broken everything and introduced
more bugs than I had time to fix. I just had to revert. An exhausted
hacker is worse than no hacker at all. You&#39;re a liability to yourself
and the project.So, like driving when tired, realise that the urge to continue is
completely irrational, and probably based in the emotional drives of
fear or pride. It would be completely irrational for any manager to
want you to code in that state, and anyone who pushes you to is also
the idiot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; small hurdles spike my anxiety, my anger flares at the slightest confrontation, I notice fewer jokes, fewer attempts on my part to make people laugh. My memory goes to all hell too and I can’t seem to concentrate on prolonged amounts of anything. Books fall off my radar, I stop listening to music. My phone is in my hand at all times, scrolly-anxiety-inducing apps become impossible to avoid.This describes me perfectly. Unfortunately I can’t take a break because it’s entirely due to being the parent of young children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On top of taking regular breaks, I think we should also work slower. Burnout is a scary place to be in. While the news calls it “quiet quitting”, I think many people are simply burnt out from the last few years of world conditions and add on the rubber band effect of everything going back to “normal”. It’s just too much change in a short amount of time.I wrote a book about this topic when I was in a state of burnout. I had enough of the many different aspects of the world (overwork, the news, social media, etc) that I believe led to stress based illness.I don’t feel bad for taking time off anymore. You got to put yourself first sometimes to be able to show up for others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everytime I read about this, it makes me think about this game:https://termsandconditions.game/(SSL warning)These shenanigans are not required, they are very much designed on purpose.Indeed, corporations can follow the &#34;Do Not Track&#34; header. There is nothing in the EU law that requires a banner, only informed consent.So if I have DNT=1 set in my browser, pop a quick non modal notification saying &#34;we wants to track you but but we won&#39;t because you said not to. Click here if you want to change that&#34;. Solved.I&#39;m informed. I made my choice.But that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about.Because the vast majority of people would not consent. Who are you kidding? This tracking is not benefiting us. It&#39;s like when politician says it&#39;s &#34;for the children&#34; or &#34;to fight terrorists&#34;. Everybody knows there are full of it.So the banner is just the most annoying way that is legally allowed to try to get people to force-accept tracking. In fact, some banner are crafted to make rejection the hardest path for this very reason.Those corps chose to make the web terrible a little bit more every day: tracking, auto play, scroll hijacking, dark patters, cookie banners...We should thank the UE a 1000 times to reveal who are the bad players."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firefox also plans to have builtin support for auto-rejecting cookies when there is a consent banner. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1783015. From my understanding, this should be similar to Consent-O-Matic. It will be available on both desktop and mobile versions. This is enabled recently by default in Nightly (but I don&#39;t use Nightly)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ugh i hate these banners.The web browser should control the consent. Like how it worked in IE5 before everyone realized asking was super annoying and just assumed yes.It makes no sense for a web site to collect state to know if its allowed to collect state."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I hope Google go through with this as it will direct people to Firefox so they can continue using ad-blockers like uBlock Origin.I don&#39;t know how many will come but if Google wants to implode their plugin ecosystem in favour of more advertising, and if that action increases Firefox adoption (and thus a healthy browser ecosystem via competition) then I am for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Benefits of the Manifest V3: noneV3 not allowing remote code execution is actually a serious benefit. Of course, this does not negate the fact that V3 is mainly there to boost the ad ecosystem of Google, but I&#39;d never want my screen casting extension to be mining bitcoin on the background. That said, I&#39;m not sure how this is going to scale long term, given that it sometimes takes 2+ weeks for the web store review team to approve a genuine one-line change. Lack of RCE is only going to make this review backlog bigger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is hard to overstate the impact that having a BBC micro in my 1980s rural primary school had on my career, without that I&#39;d almost certainly have had a very different path through life.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"After playing with a C64 Maxi replica (mine has the VIC-20 colors) I can&#39;t think of using a vintage computer without a matching keyboard (and often mouse). The experience is not only the pixels on the screen and the sounds of the speaker, but the whole spatial relationship with the physical object.It probably doesn&#39;t need to be an almost perfect replica like the 64 Maxi, but having the keys in the same places (even if there is no ESC key - looking at you, DEC LK-201). On my desk, my two daily drivers are a Sun Type 7c (Type 7 is in storage, waiting for its rotation) and an IBM/Lexmark/Unicomp PC-122 Model M, and I can say each of them provides a unique experience, tactile, spatial, and, on the Model M&#39;s case, auditory.I&#39;m thinking about learning how to build keyboards and make a couple DIY ones. Switches can&#39;t be the same, but, at least, physical layout, keycap shapes, labels, and colors can be matched."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This point is so good and so important:&#34;Getting lost in your knowledge management system is a fantastic way to avoid creating things. Or calling that friend you’re estranged from. Or doing anything else even mildly threatening. It’s also a fantastic way to convince yourself that unpreparedness is what’s between you and creative work. If you believe you’re unprepared, know that you will never transmute into the perfectly prepared person that you think exists in the future.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we conflate two types of note-taking:  1. List-style notes of things we need to remember

  2. School-style notes of information and ideas

I think the former requires a tool, but nothing particularly sophisticated - Apple Notes for example with its search indexing is fineI think the latter we write only to stimulate our brain to process information and learn better.I think there is a discrepancy where a lot of tools attempt to make Type 2 notes more &#34;convenient&#34;, i.e. to trying to somehow make them an extension of our brain, but the truth is that it&#39;s like hacking a hard drive to work as fast as a CPU register -- retrieving and working with information is always going to be orders of magnitude slower than working through your thoughts in your brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Any article that pretends to know what the right way of taking notes (say, &#34;This is known as a commonplace book, and it is about how detailed your note-taking system should be unless you plan on thinking more elaborately than Leonardo da Vinci.&#34; in this article) is missing the point.People think differently, people have different purposes and goals, people have different constraints on their time, their memory, their field. Can you procrastinate on note-taking? Sure. So can you on writing, and publishing, and building an audience, and writing papers, and doing the dishes.Can people have a fantastic creative output by just opening a blank page and jotting down their thoughts? Sure. Can other people write great books with an elaborate notetaking system? Of course. There are plenty of people out there with terrific, obsessive note-taking and reference systems, Kubrick being one of the prime examples.As someone with what looks from the outside to be an overarchitected note-taking system ( https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel ), it is a system that works great for me, and it is a system that makes me more creative and helps me discover ideas I would have never been able to articulate without. I used linear sketchbooks where I would write and draw whatever for years, filling hundreds of notebooks, and it came nowhere near my obsidian setup in terms of output and effectiveness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was curious how this worked so I did some reading which I found interesting. In short, this uses ptrace, which is the same Linux kernel mechanism used by debuggers, to attach to a running process and manipulate the open file descriptors (amongst other things) while it runs. So basically it attaches to the process, and changes stdin (fd 0) and stdout (fd 1) to point to your tmux session stdout and stdin.Pretty cool use of ptrace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a nice tool (reptyr), but not particularly convenient to use, requiring several steps to move the process to the background and remembering the PID etc. I do wish this was a more streamlined, standard feature of Unix/Linux shells. Something like a simple integrated &#34;pushproc&#34;/&#34;popproc&#34; command."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Take away the ownership from the shell using disownInteresting. So far, my only ever use of disown was to decouple GUI apps that I launched from the terminal.
