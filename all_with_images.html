								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone actually believed it was &#34;code red for humanity&#34; they&#39;d be pushing nuclear power. There is zero chance of moving off carbon energy sources without causing catastrophic mayhem, unless we use massive amounts of nuclear.For instance, the last 4 years my state has averaged 37% production of total possible installed wind generation capacity. This is a very windy state which is in the top 2 for installed wind capacity and number one per capita. But throughout a day wind power can very from nearly zero to close to max capacity. Those periods of near zero production can last non-trivial amounts of time no realistic battery could provide for.The only solutions are continue with our gas turbine/wind power mix where we build enough gas turbines to handle 100% of the load for when the wind production is bottoming out, or replace everything with nuclear.Nuclear gets us to net carbon zero fastest and with technology easy to export to developing countries in desperate need of plentiful, reliable, cheap electricity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just. Tax. It.We have warmed the earth because we love comfort and money. We will never stop loving those things. So instead let&#39;s use the same systems to fix this (or at least slow things down).As an individual my largest carbon impact is air travel. I like to go places, it&#39;s one of the main things I work to afford. Every single plane ticket I take should have a tax which is used to offset or capture the carbon emissions of my flight. I will pay it. Anyone not willing to pay it will have to fly less. Any airlines that can&#39;t operate under the tax will not operate.Now do the same thing for corporate polluters, packaging waste, etc. If a country won&#39;t do this for domestic goods we can at least impose climate tariffs at borders.The only other thing that could work is some fantastic new technological solution, but let&#39;s not wait for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s just so hard to know what actions have what impact on CO2 production. Some are high-pain, low-gain (switching devices off instead of standby?), some are opposite (cycling instead of driving when possible etc).For that if for no other reason, I’d rather if consumer prices included an explicit CO2 tax. The here can be a rebate for poorer people, or personal allowance, whatever, but there would be a fixed yardstick for measuring your personal impact.Off the top of my head, I have no idea which if my activities generates the most CO2. My car? Energy use? Diet? Going skiing once a year? No idea.Newspaper articles only help a little, they usually present an incomplete picture, and optimising against an incorrect utility function is often counterproductive.I’m imagining something like VAT, where “value added/carbon” adds up over the lifetime of product/service production."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This invasive capability on the device level is a massive intrusion on everyone&#39;s privacy and there will be no limits for governments to expand it&#39;s reach once implemented. The scope will always broaden.From the article:Apple’s choices in this case, though, go in the opposite direction: instead of adding CSAM-scanning to iCloud Photos in the cloud that they own-and-operate, Apple is compromising the phone that you and I own-and-operate, without any of us having a say in the matter. Yes, you can turn off iCloud Photos to disable Apple’s scanning, but that is a policy decision; the capability to reach into a user’s phone now exists, and there is nothing an iPhone user can do to get rid of it.A far better solution to the “Flickr problem” I started with is to recognize that the proper point of comparison is not the iPhone and Facebook, but rather Facebook and iCloud. One’s device ought be one’s property, with all of the expectations of ownership and privacy that entails; cloud services, meanwhile, are the property of their owners as well, with all of the expectations of societal responsibility and law-abiding which that entails. It’s truly disappointing that Apple got so hung up on its particular vision of privacy that it ended up betraying the fulcrum of user control: being able to trust that your device is truly yours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; . Yes, you can turn off iCloud Photos to disable Apple’s scanning,so, Apple now has the ability to reach into every law abiding citizens personal phone - report them to the FBI when the algorithm makes mistakes (and it will - nothing is 100%, particular in image recognition), AND THEN THE PERPETRATORS CAN STILL GET AWAY BY JUST TURNING IT OFF??!??!?!My goodness, I couldn&#39;t imagine a stupider way to fight CSAM.&gt; Facebook made 20.3 million reports of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) in 2020.Were there 20.3 million arrests of offenders?  I don&#39;t think so. I doubt they caught 20 perps from that data.  While it may be a better algorithm, it should be a good warning of how often your&#39; very legitimate and non-CSAM data will be leaked to a &#34;verifier&#34;, and worse, to the authorities.Take a look at how often YouTube channels are taken down by &#34;auto triggers&#34; that are then &#34;reviewed&#34; and you will get a good idea of how often the government is going to screw law abiding citizens.  It&#39;s not zero, and imho, it will be well above a range of &#34;acceptable fallout&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These efforts will evolve and expand over time.I have no doubt they will. Pandora’s box has been opened, and okay, today the scanning is only for images uploaded to iCloud, and only for CSAM. But that is not auditable and subject to change at any time without notice.And today it is only looking at known hashes but the devices already have a capability to analyse images and even run OCR on them, this is not a matter of of these things will be weaponised but when.Can’t believe this is the same Apple that publicly defended the right to privacy for known terrorists by using the slippery slope argument themselves. The mind boggles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The scary thing about this is that many people have images that look like child porn at home: Family photos of naked grandchildren playing at the sea or in the mud, as well as sexting between consenting teenagers. There is no way automatic classification can distinguish these from real child porn, because they look almost identical and thus many private pictures will be shared with the government. This not only infringes the privacy of those people in the most drastic way possible, but might also lead to lawsuits that can tear families apart (think your father being accused of having CP only for it to turn out months later it was an old picture of yourself). The article mentions that 40% of CP investigations in Germany are started against minors (implied: through sexting), which shows that this concern is not purely theoretical at all.This was not an issue with the old approach of comparing checksums against public CP images, but it will increasingly be if we use more AI algorithms for this.EDIT: Probably Apples neural hashes that are currently in the news won&#39;t be vulnerable to this since they trained specifically to only detect changes in color/cropping/rotation. But we can&#39;t know for sure since the white paper is not that detailed and &#34;naked kid on beach&#34; photos all look really similar usually."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to cry if is see such dangerous things.  
Most European parties send unknown politicians to Strasbourg and let them vote on important topics with low media coverage. Later the local politicians - which act mostly in Bruessels - claim that they have no way but follow Strasbourgs/Bruessels decisions and write even worse state laws upon it.I think we need a new Europe state with a actual parliament in charge, which means the people there are accountable and in power. Without the Commission, Council and Presidency of Council[1]. Instead one actual parliament and one actual government. The Europeans state are integrated part of it, like elsewhere. Next the stuff can be fixed: We just need one army. And one social-security system with one economic policy. And one state department (foreign politics).Most politicians still think of Europe as a economy council but we people expect a sovereign country/state. The former &#34;economy council&#34; could solve economy related issues within Europe in the 1950s. But I think we have much bigger things to do.[1] I don&#39;t know how somebody can seriously use something like a rolling presidency. You can do that with a mediator position or referee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Privacy is something that people usually only care about on a theoretical level. Practically speaking, they&#39;re often happy to not care so much at all if they get something more tangible in return.---Company: Excuse me, would you mind us profiling you through an accurate survey of most of your everyday purchases?Customer: Heck no!Company: What if we let you collect &#34;points&#34; that will maybe someday safe you a little bit of money on one of these purchases?Customer: Sign me up!---Company: Excuse me, would you mind us recording everywhere you go all day every day and store that information for at least six months?Customer: Heck no!Company: What if you get a pocket computer with fast mobile internet connection in return, the corner stone of modern life?Customer: Sign me up!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really hope there is enough momentum to stop this. It&#39;s definitely the last straw for me in terms of apple products. I haven&#39;t bought a new iphone for 4 years, I&#39;m slowly trying to switch to a lightphone (non smartphone). My mac needs a change but I will probably switch to linux.It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous what apple has become. The exact opposite of what they used to represent, when I loved them. God rest Steve Jobs soul, his 1984 ad is exactly what apple is now. Screwed devs on app store, strongarmed into compliance, cooperation with china, worse and worse UX on phones, and now this...Really disappointing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I was ignorant on the issue and completely against the approach of Apple.Then HN taught me that any company storing images on their infrastructure in the US must report pedophilic images to the US government.At this point, the approach taken by Apple seems like the best one to me, if you don&#39;t want to store pictures in clear on your servers.What other technical approach are people advocating for?Another point it is to try to change the law, but this is beyond the scope of the conversation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“other tech experts“ want to keep Apple from using End2End encryption so they have a reason why they don’t provide it to their customers. With Apple‘s approach Apple can only decrypt Data hosted with them if the (false) positives are over a threshold. It‘s a pretty neat way to implement a usecase so deeply wrong. All other companies protesting now want to keep access to userdata in the clear.Apple‘s approach is the only way to - at the same time - act lawfully regarding to EARN-IT act in the US and provide E2E in iCloud.I really hate these laws, but Apple is not the problem here. Read up on EARNIT and the EU laws currently in the works. All communication WILL HAVE TO BE SCANNED by the provider. Beating the drum against Apple will just lead to E2E encryption being forbidden. What needs to be forbidden instead is any access to communication.https://www.apple.com/child-safety/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting that they started with data. Some of the most interesting discoveries I&#39;ve made have started with me saying &#34;that&#39;s weird&#34; while looking at data. From the article:&#34;Graham&#39;s team was doing an unrelated project on plant genetics and noticed that the western false asphodel had a genetic deletion that&#39;s sometimes seen in carnivorous plants. The researchers started to think about the fact that this flower grew in the kind of environment that&#39;s home to various other insect-eating plants.&#34;And then they have these sticky stems,&#34; Graham says. &#34;So, you know, it was kind of like, hmm, I wonder if this could be a sign that this might be carnivorous.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the technique of testing if it was carnivorous. For the lazy people, they put a nitrogen isotope inside fruitflies and then tested the plant later to see if it was absorbing the nitrogen, and it was."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got a specimen of one of these preserved in a photoalbum from a school project from 10 years ago or so. There was no idea at the time these were in any way carnivorous.For all our knowledge, there really is so much about all the other life around us we just don&#39;t understand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some have speculated that with the introduction of the PSI/CSAM system Apple will enable E2EE backups. Given the lack of an explicit statement on Apple&#39;s part and their history regarding E2EE backups (this article, and other statements). It seems really unlikely to me that Apple will enable E2EE backups.Under E2EE, assuming the device key is randomly generated, if you have one device (as many users do) and you lose that device you would lose all your data. The alternative is the key is derived from your iCloud password, in which case, if you forget your password, you lose all your data.Right now, you can browse your photos online. There&#39;s been no statement that this is going away. Implementing this functionality with E2EE backups seem highly problematic.These are huge changes to iCloud functionality that Apple would surely announce...There are many open questions. And given that there’s no clear statement from Apple, I’m inclined to believe that they retain the ability to decrypt all data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s likely true, but quite probably even worse.A friend here in NSW Australia told me some years ago, while working at one of the larger coal-fired power plants we have, that emissions are measured on only one of the four stacks, and the results are then extrapolated.Obviously this was ripe to be gamed, which is precisely what happened.   Good coal (black, low-emission, cleaner-burning) was used to power that turbine, the other three turbines got the low-quality / high-emissions brown coal.Either way, studies like TFA rely on the accuracy of the data that different nation states collect and publish, and I seriously doubt the accuracy of much of those data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Misleading title ? Its Global emissions caused by “electricity generation”. Power generation is 25% of overall global emissions.. so this is about 73% of the 25%."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I viscerally hate this title, because the top 5% of power plants probably also account for &gt;50% of electrical generation, and the entire exercise is dominated by how small of a plant counts for the statistics. If all the portable generators sitting unused in people&#39;s garages counted, I bet that 0.1% of &#34;power plants&#34; would be responsible for 99% of emissions, which would make a great headline but still wouldn&#39;t tell you anything meaningful about the world.I would love to know about how efficiency varies with plant size (are bigger plants more efficient?) but this study is _mostly_ just stating that bigger power plants produce more emissions in absolute terms, which should be obvious to pretty much anyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have encountered something similar to this for a submission that I reviewed for a scientific journal.  I will not list any names or give much detail past those generalities, but I pointed out that the authors were misusing a particular technical term. In my review I defined the term and explained it briefly.  I asked the authors to revise their submission accordingly.  The paper was not bad but the authors did not know English very well, so it was quite difficult to read.  That was its main problem.  However, when I received the revised submission, I noticed that the authors plagiarized my definition and explanation almost word for word (from my confidential review). I pointed this out to the editors and they said to just reject the paper with the stated reason being plagiarism, which I did.  The journal ended up rejecting the article, but I discovered it a few years later in a different journal.  The plagiarized section remained, but the authors swabbed out a lot my phrases for these kind of &#34;tortured phrases&#34;.That said, the authors did not fabricate their research (as far as I can tell).  They just did not know English well, so it was easier to just copy things that you know are phrased well than to learn to write English well.  As the saying goes, do not attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance or laziness. That does not excuse it but it makes it more understandable.I agree with the article that this is probably just the tip of the iceberg.  There are likely many more lesser evils being committed with similar tools that are just much more difficult to spot.  I would not have noticed my particular example if I were not a reviewer for the paper, for example.  It makes me wonder how big the problem really is."</p>

Of course, a popular well-designed device running linux instead of windows CE at the time was not in ms&#39; best interest. Tomtom stood by their position as much as they could and, as time passed, microsoft&#39;s bully behavior cooled out.Congrats for your courage Tomtom! If I ever plan to buy a GPS or navigation device, I&#39;ll certainly consider your history."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NCMEC has essentially shows that they have zero regard for privacy and called all privacy activists &#34;screeching voices of the minority&#34;. At the same time, they&#39;re at the center point of a highly opaque, entrenched (often legally mandated) censorhip infrastructure that can and will get accounts shut down irrecoverably and possibly people&#39;s homes raided, on questionable data:In one of the previous discussions, I&#39;ve seen claims about the NCMEC database containing a lot of harmless pictures misclassified as CSAM. This post confirms this again (ctrl-f &#34;macaque&#34;)It also seems like the PhotoDNA hash algorithm is problematic (to the point where it may be possible to trigger false matches).Now NCMEC seem to be pushing for the development of a technology that would implant an informant in every single of our devices (mandating the inclusion of this technology is the logical next step that seems inevitable if Apple launches this).I&#39;m surprised, and honestly disappointed, that the author seems to still play nice, instead of releasing the whitepaper. The NCMEC seems to have decided to position itself directly alongside other Enemies of the Internet, and while I can imagine that they&#39;re also doing a lot of important and good work, at this point, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re salvageable would like to see them disbanded.Really curious how this will play out. I expect attacks either sabotaging these scanning systems by flooding them with false positives, or exploiting them to get the accounts of your enemies shut down permanently by sending them a picture of a macaque."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, however-&#34;Due to how Apple handles cryptography (for your privacy), it is very hard (if not impossible) for them to access content in your iCloud account. Your content is encrypted in their cloud, and they don&#39;t have access. If Apple wants to crack down on CSAM, then they have to do it on your Apple device&#34;I do not believe this is true. Maybe one day it will be true and Apple is planning for it, but right now iCloud service data is encrypted in the sense that they are stored encrypted at rest and in transit, however Apple holds the keys. We know this given that iCloud backups have been surrendered to authorities, and of course you can log into the web variants to view your photos, calendar, etc. Not to mention that Apple has purportedly been doing the same hash checking on their side for a couple of years.Thus far there has been no compelling answer as to why Apple needs to do this on device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see many people pushing back on the child pornography laws themselves that are the cause of this. I&#39;m stepping into a hornets nest by even bringing this up, because any criticism of the laws on the books makes one look they&#39;re a pedo, so I&#39;ll preface by saying, child pornography (filmed with actual kids) is vile and disgusting, but it is the production of it that is evil to be fought and suppressed, not the possession of it. Remember in the 90s, we had to deal with the Communications Decency Act I &amp; II, because every time they want to crack down on the internet, the excuse is always &#34;it&#39;s for the children!&#34; And pedophilia is the go-to excuse in a lot of circumstances.The CPPA had bans on virtual child porn (e.g. using look-alike adult actresses or CGI), that was overturned by SCOTUS, and then Congress responded with the PROTECT act which tightened up those provisions. These laws on possession are practically unenforceable with modern technology, peer to peer file sharing, onion routing, and encrypted hard drives.Thus, in order to make them enforcement, the government has to put surveillance at all egress and ingress points of our private/secure enclaves, whether it&#39;s at the point of storing it locally, or the point of uploading it to the cloud.While I agree with the goal of eliminating child porn, should it come at the cost of an omnipresent government surveillance system everywhere? One that could be used for future laws that restrict other forms of content? How about anti-vax imagery? Anti-Semitic imagery? And with other governments of the world watching, especially authoritarian governments, how long until China, which had a similar system with Jingwang Weishi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingwang_Weishi) starts asking: hey, can you extend this to Falun Gong, Islamic, Hong Kong resistance, and Tiananmen square imagery? What if Thailand passes a law that requires Apple to scan for images insulting to the Thai Monarch, does Apple comply?This is a very bad precedent. I liked the Apple that said no to the FBI instead of installing backdoors. I&#39;d prefer if Apple get fined, and battle all the way to the Supreme Court to resist this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Slowly and almost imperceptibly if you look at it day-to-day, public research repositories like arxiv and biorxiv, along with public code repositories like github and gitlab, are becoming or maybe already are the world&#39;s most important academic &#34;journals.&#34;All research and code posted on them gets a quick once-over; good work gets the attention it deserves; bad work is quickly ignored. Reviews take place over the Internet via both public and private forums.Gatekeeping power lies more and more in the hands of a global, distributed scientific community open to anyone willing and capable of doing and reviewing the work. It&#39;s fabulous IMHO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reed Elsevier and the other rent seekers got no reason to live.That said: in the legal world, where PACER extracts $0.10 per &#34;page&#34; even now that you get things electronically and the cost is near zero:There&#39;s a service RECAP (PACER spelled backwards), where you can install a browser extension which automatically copies anything you download from PACER to a free archive. So one person pays, and the rest get it free.It is amazingly complete, much more than you would think. For instance, here&#39;s the entry for the Elizabeth Holmes (Theranos) trial:https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/7185174/united-states-v..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good development - depositing papers in OA journals is extremely expensive and internationally, most funding bodies requiring OA don&#39;t give you money to publish OA. For example, Nature Communications charges around $5,000 for a single paper; I can send a student to an overseas conference for that kind of money!Public repositories like arxiv or biorxiv are free."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The worst offender recently in my opinion is Spotify on desktop.It used to be that when you clicked on an artists page you would see all the music tracks listed. Now it&#39;s all buried deep in and you have to search through the individual albums. Even the list of albums itself is not shown on the main artist page, you have to click &#34;See Discography&#34; first.The &#34;Home&#34; page is even worse. Where is my discover weekly playlist? Sometimes it&#39;s near the top, sometimes it&#39;s in this &#34;Made for you&#34; section. Sometimes you have to click &#34;See All&#34; next to that to find it.I mean moving shit around when you update your software is bad enough. Spotify moves shit around every time you boot the app!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It’s obvious. Every high-tech company has people called “Product Managers” (PMs) whose job it is to work with customers and management and engineers to define what products should do. No PM in history has ever said “This seems to be working pretty well, let’s leave it the way it is.” Because that’s not bold. That’s not visionary. That doesn’t get you promotedThis mentality isn&#39;t unique to product managers. Mobile developers and front-end developers increasingly don&#39;t want to work on technologies that are perceived as outdated, or even to work on someone else&#39;s code. Everyone wants to list new technologies and greenfield projects on their resumes.This was one of the biggest hiring challenges at my most recent large project: iOS developers wanted to rewrite everything in Swift. Android developers wanted to rewrite everything in Kotlin. Our web app was already written in React, but the web developers constantly wanted to refactor it to use the latest state management trend. When Hooks were introduced in React, we spent far too long arguing with developers who wanted to refactor all of the working code to use hooks instead.The bigger problem is that nobody wanted to work on someone else&#39;s codebase. Everyone wanted to work on greenfield projects and technologies that would look good on their resume going into the next job. Some of the most talented developers we hired were obviously only interested in using our company as a stepping stone to FAANG jobs (which didn&#39;t actually pay much more, but they were more prestigious on a resume so they wanted to switch).Blaming product managers is an easy out and will likely match popular opinion among people who aren&#39;t product managers, but the problem extends to development teams as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ecosystem has also lost its mojo, and Apple is the one that killed it.The good old days of really good, dedicated mac software studios are over. Made by Sofa, Delicious Monster, SubEthaEdit, TextMate, Panic Inc, Rogue Amoeba, Strange Flavour. These were really great software studios that really upheld a standard of excellence for Mac software.But how are you supposed to keep that up when apple forces you into a marketplace that basically relies on customer handouts, where your only way to make profit on your 99ct app is to hit it so big, that your have several million customers.It&#39;s no wonder that there are no good apps anymore, we&#39;ve swamped the market with cheap cheap stuff, and nobody wants to pay for quality anymore.I&#39;ve recently switched from VSCode to Panics Nova, and for a very brief moment I felt like I was back in the old days of Mac Os X where things just worked, and where I felt at home with my OS, without constantly waiting for a better alternative to come along."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a giant variety of &#39;Pachyrhizus erosus&#39; or Jicama, which is also a street snack widely sold in Mexico. I&#39;v never seen ones as large as the one in the article, but the watery texture and how it&#39;s condimented (lemon, sugar, salt, chili powder) is exactly like Jicama. Seems wikipedia has a reference to ones as large as 2 meters and 20 kg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachyrhizus_erosus so it may be like those tree trunk sizes in the article.It&#39;s not Agave. Agave roots are very fibery and dry, there&#39;s almost no moisture in them and you wouldn&#39;t be able to cut such thin slices like the article points out, agave roots are mashed up to start the Tequila process, here are some pics http://www.todomezcal.com/Elaboracion/molienda.htmlSource: I&#39;ve cut open both Agave and Jicama plants, I grew up in Mexico. You can find Jicama/(fruit) street vendors in most Mexican cities main streets or outside Mexico a mexican market is also a safe bet. They have rough peel,  like a potato but rougher, and they&#39;re about 90% water."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have eaten it many times, vendors say it&#39;s a root.  But the last time I ate it, it was little more fibrous and hard and I ate little more than the usual.  For the next couple of days my tongue was itching and I had little difficulty speaking. Then I googled it and read somewhere that it&#39;s not edible.It&#39;s surprising experts don&#39;t know what the thing is given it&#39;s so commonly available."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s something… different about how people (techie people are most of my sample) would write before the 00’s. I’m not sure if it has to do with the medium, or the constraints of the time, but reading it always fills me with something I can best describe as peace/nostalgia. The belief that technology honestly can change the world for the better and that the most influential people driving it have good motives instead of profit motives. And they were real visionaries most of the time. By contrast, anything seemingly after the dot com boom (I can’t draw a clear line, this is just throwing a dart) seems, I don’t know how to describe it. Too self-aware, too clever? It’s similar to the contrast between HN and other forums/social media out there. I’m not sure, but whenever an older article or something shows up, I usually enjoy it. Perhaps it’s that only the best have survived till now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From an old comment of mine on the topic:https://youtu.be/sKOk4Y4inVY?t=518 [1]1. &#34;In 1995, there was a debate at Harvard Law School – four of us discussing the future of public key encryption and its control. I was on the side, I suppose, of freedom. It’s where I try to be. With me at that debate was a man called Daniel Weitzner who now works in the White House making Internet policy for the Obama administration.On the other side was the then Deputy Attorney General of the United States and a lawyer in private practice named Stewart Baker who had been chief council to the National Security Agency, our listeners, and who was then in private life helping businesses to deal with the listeners. He then became, later on, the deputy for policy planning in the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and has much to do with what happened in our network after 2001.At any rate, the four of us spent two pleasant hours debating the right to encrypt and at the end there was a little dinner party at the Harvard faculty club, and at the end, after all the food had been taken away and just the port and the walnuts were left on the table, Stuart said, “All right, among us now that we are all in private, just us girls, I’ll let our hair down.”He didn’t have much hair even then, but he let it down.“We are not going to prosecute your client, Mr. Zimmermann,&#34; he said. “Public key encryption will become available. We fought a long, losing battle against it, but it was just a delaying tactic.” And then he looked around the room and he said, ”But nobody cares about anonymity, do they?&#34;And a cold chill went up my spine and I thought, all right, Stuart, and now I know you’re going to spend the next twenty years trying to eliminate anonymity in human society and I am going to try to stop you and we’ll see how it goes.And it’s going badly. We didn’t build the net with anonymity built in. That was a mistake. Now we are paying for it.&#34; -Eben Moglen"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me this effect is significantly compounded by not being from the US / North America. This has come up on HN before (e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25226805 ) but it still strikes me as so odd that you need quite a bit of USA cultural / vernacular knowledge to navigate the internet anywhere in the world (or at least English speaking sites?). What a strange view into another country to see each day!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read the whole article, and I see so many comments agreeing or even adding detail to the post. Am I really in the minority if this kind of thing couldn&#39;t even cross my mind or feels like written by someone living in a parallel universe?A few poorly shot street photos are &#34;unbearably depressing&#34;? And there&#39;s even a detailed explanation breaking it down into points, each one feeling more alien than the last. They&#39;re just pictures from the street! Just how? How does a person come up with a whole emotional essay for this?I am failing to understand the author to the degree I feel like there&#39;s something wrong with this person&#39;s psyche or something is wrong with mine. Am I having a stroke and words are no longer making sense? Am I too young, or am I too old at 26 to &#34;get it&#34;? Is it because I live in a third world country and lack perspective or have &#34;too much&#34; of it? Is this homework for an English class and it&#39;s just trying to talk about literally anything for a given arbitrary word count? I almost feel like I&#39;m dissociating from reality by an article talking about a freaking captcha."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NASA&#39;s response, printed as an addendum, contains the sort of non-sequiturs that, contrary to the presumed intention, can only suggest that NASA is doing exactly what is alleged here: hoping a serious issue will go away.&#34;As shared by NASA&#39;s Kathy Lueders and Joel Montalbano in the media telecon following the event, Roscosmos regularly updated NASA and the rest of the international partners on MLM&#39;s progress during the approach to station...&#34;As far as we know, nothing untoward happened during the approach to station. Restricting this comment to this period renders it irrelevant and signals that NASA is trying to avoid the issue.&#34;When the unexpected thruster firings occurred, flight control teams were able to enact contingency procedures and return the station to normal operations within an hour...&#34;So there&#39;s no need to be concerned over why it happened, how long it took to discover the problem, or the inability of those at NASA who discovered it to counteract it until the ISS was in a position where Roscosmos could intervene? As the article author points out, this &#34;all&#39;s well that ends well&#34; attitude is what led to the Challenger and Columbia crashes.&#34;We would point you to Roscosmos for any specifics on Russian systems/performance/procedures.&#34;So, NASA seems to be saying, it is not our problem - but, of course, anything that threatens the integrity of the ISS most definitely is.That covers the whole of NASA&#39;s response so far to IEEE Spectrum, other than the utterly anodyne &#34;We continue to have confidence in our partnership with Roscosmos to operate the International Space Station.&#34;What I would like to know is why public relations spokespersons think it is in the interests of their organizations to make those organizations look clueless, while simultaneously insulting our intelligence by implying we will fall for this nonsense?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a piece of commentary from a Russian insider covering the launch of Nauka, but not the docking, in Russian [1]. There was a litany of smaller issues with the launch, probably stemming from the fact that the module has been tossed around for 25+ years.I generally don&#39;t expect Roskosmos to make any comments regarding Nauka unless it blows up or something. Part of the reason, apparently, is that Roskosmos is being assessed for new funding (from the blog post, Google translate edited for clarity):&#34;&#34;&#34;Docking is scheduled for July 29. The future of Russian manned astronautics depends on its success. With Nauka, the Russian segment will be able to operate for another 10 years, and be more effective as a research platform.The future of the independent Russian Orbital Service Station (ROSS) is also indirectly related to the success of Nauka. With Nauka, Roskosmos gets a chance to show that it has the ability to create and launch manned space stations. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of obtaining the funding for ROSS.Probably, this is the reason that Roscosmos has been reluctant to voice any of the problems with Nauka. When half a trillion rubles is at stake, you will inevitably lose your voice.&#34;&#34;&#34;Half a trillion rubles is about $7bn American. I&#39;ve been hearing about plans for this new station for a few years now. I don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s real. Involvement with the ISS, where Americans shouldered 80% of the financial burden, is really what kept the Russian space program relevant. So I don&#39;t expect us to pull out of the ISS voluntarily. If the ISS ends up being decommissioned this decade, hopefully we can piggy back with the Chinese on their new projects or something. That&#39;s assuming we have anything they want, which is a big question mark come year 2030.[1] https://zelenyikot.livejournal.com/158629.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In principle I agree, but there&#39;s a lot riding against a proper, non-nasa investigation.1. No one died, unlike Columbia, there won&#39;t be a Congressional committee put together on this.2. Even if there was a congress committee/investigation done, what changes can actually be instituted? Block any more Russian modules?That&#39;s requiring putting pressure on a foreign country to make changes where the relationship runs a knife edge balancing act of frenemy.The Russian space program is a shell of its former self since ~2010.The most realistic course of action (at this moment) of any corrective recommendation is to remove them from the ISS. They&#39;ve been threatening pulling out for a few years now, so let them?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No, the space being shown here remains entirely flat.  There is length contraction and time dilation at play, but that’s a uniform effect.  The reason the image appears distorted is because we have more time to catch up to light rays emitted from farther away.  This visual phenomenon is called Terrell rotation.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotationIt’s based entirely on special relativity—not to be confused with general relativity, which deals with curved spacetime in the presence of gravitational fields."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also check out the game &#34;A Slower Speed of Light&#34; [0] if you are interested in visualization of relativistic effects. It includes effects like Doppler shifting of colors, perceived warping of space and time dilation. Good luck at not getting nauseous.[0] http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I found very interesting when I learned about it several years ago: it&#39;s possible to formulate SR and GR with the Euclidean (++++) metric instead of the Minkowski (+---) or (-+++) metric. Such a formulation (there is a variety of them) is sometimes called Euclidean Relativity (ER).See: https://www.euclideanrelativity.com/Some ER research is particularly fascinating to me, e.g. Montanus&#39; work on Flat Space Gravitation:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-005-6482-0   A new description of gravitational motion will be proposed. It is part of the proper time formulation of physics as presented on the IARD 2000 conference. According to this formulation the proper time of an object is taken as its fourth coordinate. As a consequence, one obtains a circular space–time diagram where distances are measured with the Euclidean metric. The relativistic factor turns out to be of simple goniometric origin. It further follows that the Lagrangian for gravitational dynamics does not require an interpretation in terms of curvature of space–time. The flat space model for gravitational dynamics leads to the correct predictions for the bending of light, the perihelion shift of Mercury and gravitational red-shift. The new theory is free of singularities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think back to how we have responded to this pandemic.  We were in denial until the pandemic was spreading unchecked wildly through the population, and even a good chunk of the population is still in denial after 100,000s of dead.We are a hopeless species when it comes to organizing effective collective action ahead of known disaster.  We seem to only respond collectively once disaster has struck, and even then it takes time.I read a book in 1997 that was about this.  Can not remember the name or author of it for the life of me.  It was about climate change and the risk that North Atlantic currents would shift causing a state change that would be hard to reverse.  24 years later we think it is getting closer, but we still do not act swiftly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often hear that as individuals we can&#39;t really be held responsible for climate change and that instead we should look to our government to impose laws that restrict carbon output.This made me curious: what is the &#34;fair&#34; amount of carbon dioxide that the average individual can emit? According to this article[1][2] published in Nature it looks like the answer is 1.61 metric tons of CO2/year.That strikes me as close-to-impossible for industrialized nations to achieve. A round-trip flight from NYC to SF emits 1.5 metric tons per passenger. In order to reach 1.61 metric tons an individual would not be able to own a gas-powered car, could not regularly consume meat, could not live in remote areas only visitable by plane etc. Many things people don&#39;t even consider &#34;luxuries&#34; (like visiting family overseas) would be a non-starter.In France they implemented a modest fuel tax and they got the Yellow Vest Protests[3] in response. I can&#39;t see the average individual ever voting for a party that wouldn&#39;t let them visit family and nearly eliminate meat consumption.As China, India and Indonesia have industrialized their per-capita emissions have shot up well above these levels as well. I imagine the same thing will happen with African nations over the next 25-50 years.I don&#39;t really see any way out of this other than some miraculous technological breakthroughs like solar powered planes which I understand to be near-impossible with today&#39;s technology.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0021-4[2] https://sci-hub.se/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-01...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_protests"</p>

Bento, who did not respond to a request for comment, said officials in that office had instructed him not to hand over any documents related to Castleberry’s 2006 drug case, including all records filed after May 2017 that actually pertained to Spriestersbach.&gt; Spriestersbach was not entitled to the documents, officials said.&gt; The reason: He was not the defendant in that case. He was not Thomas Castleberry.They are saying he is not allowed to get the documents for the case which he was the main suspect and subsequently hospitalized for since the documents for the case is for the other person. Even though it happened to him and not the other person. I&#39;m dumbfounded."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nevertheless, the officer insisted that Spriestersbach was actually Castleberry and took him to jail. He was fingerprinted and had his photo taken, generating records that could have been used to prove he wasn’t Castleberry, the Innocence Project asserts.It&#39;s beyond me how anyone has one iota of faith in the US judicial system anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I&#39;m glad to see a non-insignificant amount of people in tech take this seriously, especially when the goal Apple announces appears to be for the greater good. It can be hard to stand on the side that doesn&#39;t immediately appear to be correct. We have already lost so many freedoms for &#39;national security&#39; and other such blanket terminology.Just be warned, there will be those that unfairly try to cast this as helping the distribution of CP. Expect a headline tomorrow: &#34;Edward Snowden et al Supports Child Porn&#34; - or some other hot take.A few other things:1. Vote with your feet - Put your money in the pockets of the people aligned to your values.2. Actively support projects you align with - If you use some open source hardware/software, try to help out (financially or time).3. Make others aware - Reach out to those around you and inform them, only then they can make an informed choice themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related but slightly off-topic: am I the only one that thinks more technology is not the answer to catching crooks?
 Can’t the police do good old fashioned police work to catch people doing these things?
Why does EVERYONE need to be surveilled for the 0.01% (or less?) who don’t behave properly.
To further this point: why do we need cameras on every street, facial recognition systems and 3-letter orgs storing huge data silos and maintaining lists etc etc…
One thought: is it because over 10, 20, 30+ years the police have been de-funded everywhere and become useless for difficult cases and/or militarised to deal with peaceful protesters instead?
Genuine questions.. I just don’t think this surveillance nightmare is the answer, and police could still catch crooks before the internet so what’s the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, if I understand correctly, the NCMEC provides a bunch of hashes of CSAM for Apple to match. This way Apple doesn’t get exposed to the content of images themselves? Then Apple will provide a user’s details plus the IDs of matching content. This identifies the direction of travel for any CSAM content?So, now NCMEC and any local NCMEC can provide new hashes and identify – possibly even historically – the epicentre of the distribution of a group of images.Except, if Apple only gets the hashes, what’s to stop a bad actor in a NCMEC from providing non CSAM images to Apple for other purposes?Seems like this technology should be illegal without a warrant. It’s a wire tap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, buried in the middle of this article is an important point:&gt; In fact, as of the fall 2019 semester, Gerber had been officially enrolled only at the university in China, not at St. Gallen.So he was a Swiss person doing a PhD at a Chinese university. His relationship with the professor at the Swiss university was an unofficial one, so the word &#39;dismissal&#39; here is pretty misleading. No information about what happened to his actual PhD program at the Chinese university that I noticed.The actual evidence of chinese influence?&gt; She said she had received a message from a Chinese doctoral student doing research at a Canadian university.So, it sure sounds like some people had their feelings hurt.My totally made-up hypothesis on this article: honest reporter researched a story, realised it was pretty weak, then when they wrote it up shuffled things around a bit to give an exaggerated impact, but couldn&#39;t bring themselves to lie or leave out any facts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an article spun to make controversy out of nothing.The narrative is that a student tweeted something critical about China, and the CCP pressured his advisor into dropping him.The reality is that the student published a tweet that &#34;depicted a comic character that had been altered and had stereotyped Chinese features, with yellow skin tone and slit eyes&#34;. This understandably was perceived as racist by a Chinese student in Canada, who complained to the advisor. The advisor agreed and dropped her racist-seeming doctoral student.The CCP wasn&#39;t involved. Nobody cared about his criticism of China. It was his racist-looking tweet that got him dismissed.Edit: But yes, the CCP can have a chilling effect on free speech. See the Blitzchung controversy. This article is just a non-story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The professor should be fired and the university punished (doubtful), but the student was also an idiot to do what he did. It’s not like he was some random guy who just tweeted at China, he lived in wuhan for years and has actual family there now, being critical of a totalitarian government in that scenario is the height of monumental stupidity. It’s ironic that the article paints him as methodological and thoughtful because he seems anything but in his actions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple&#39;s mistake is that they seemingly believe there is pushback because people misunderstand how it works. The reality is more nuanced: People understand exactly how it works, and how it works is that it is turn-key onboard spyware, that Apple pinky-swears isn&#39;t being used wrong today.For example if the scope/mission expands (e.g. foreign governments), suddenly you&#39;ve created a drag-net for whatever &#34;badness&#34; is of interest in whatever today&#39;s moral panic is (e.g. terrorism after 9/11). Plus perceptual hashing, by its very design, is created to be less precise than traditional cryptographic hashing.A cryptographic hash + file size combo is unlikely to have a false positive within our lifetime (and it has been used successful by multiple companies to combat CP). The interesting thing about a perceptual hash is that the closer the source material is to the banned material in terms of actual content (e.g. nudity), the more likely for a false positive.Therefore, if Apple does mess up via false-positive and manually review your material, it is more likely to be sensitive private materials (involving consenting adult(s), not CP) because that is what the perceptual hashes are looking for similarities to.PS - If you think this concept cannot happen in a Western country, see the UK&#39;s internet filters as a textbook example. Originally started to fight CP, and now used to fight a ton of other stuff too with more proposals every year: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_blocking_in_the_United_Kin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Take a close look at the way this works. If there are enough hash matches, Apple apparently gets to look at all the pictures on the phone. The description says &#34;threshold reached, all content visible and unlocked&#34;. &#34;All&#34;, not &#34;Matched&#34;.Matches can be forced from the outside, by sending pictures to the phone. They don&#39;t even have to be from the known-bad image set. Using an adversarial system to try to create hash matches might allow generating innocuous pictures which trigger a phone dump.Expect a toolset for doing that to be developed. Although it may take a while for word of it to leak out. This has applications for entrapment, swatting, political retribution, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunalty if our experience from the past with such events teaches us anything, it&#39;s that a minority of us will stop using apple products (or keep not doing it) but the rest of the world will quickly forget and carry on as usual.Worse, if your decision to not use an iphone makes others people life slightly anoying for 2 seconds a week, many will bash on you.As a FOSS user with no FB nor whatsapp account that ask to avoid photos to be taken of him with smartphones, I can tell you I pay regularly the price the price for what I think is doing the right thing. It&#39;s just easier to let the abuse go on.And we have other fights in life. I didnt pick up smoking (pot of cigarets), stopped drinking alcohol, became vegetarian. They all come with social challenges. Add then you have your familly, job, health and goals that needs your care, attention and time.At some point you just want to say &#34;screw them&#34;, create your own bubble of freedom and let them enjoy their distopia. Except we kind of live in it, don&#39;t we?I&#39;m usually an upbeat person but these types of event arrive in a never ending stream, and today I feel tired."</p>

They think we don’t have cities like that because we’re lacking some fundamental European-ness.No. We just put cars everywhere. Cars ruin everything. Now you have wider streets. Louder streets. More dangerous streets. Far less foot traffic which means very low chances of discovering a new favorite place. You have lower business density which totally changes the economics of an entire neighborhood. Etc.In this and so many other things Americans say they want what they see elsewhere but are uninterested in doing anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Add up the roads, parking spaces, parking garages, gas stations (not to mention auto shops, drive thrus and car washes) and the total urban footprint is a gargantuan 50-60% by many calculations. That&#39;s not automatically a bad thing, especially if you are a car, but all of that space creates massive buffers separating all of the other stuff that humans want to walk to. To make it worse, those buffers are far and away the most dangerous thing in any urban environment.On the bright side, the pandemic seems have enabled many cities to finally reclaim some of that car land for use by people. Though it&#39;s not clear how long that will last."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like my car and I like driving.That said, I don&#39;t like driving _everywhere_. When I moved to university, it was incredibly freeing to just be able to walk somewhere I wanted to go rather than getting in my car and driving miles to get anywhere. I grew up in a suburb in Texas so walking anywhere except _maybe_ a friend&#39;s house was entirely out of the question.I visited Portland recently and it was lovely to be able to get around the whole city without a car. We didn&#39;t rent one, save for one day when we went &gt; 100mi out of the city. No Ubers, no Lyfts- just walking, buses, and lightrail.Just my experience as an American."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is no such thing as a trustworthy third party and even trusting yourself is questionable at the best of times. We are constantly balancing a bunch of different considerations with regards to the way that we compute, purchase devices, and utilize services. Security and privacy are of course important, and Apple to date has had a fairly good (if shallow) track record in this regard, at least in the United States.With that being said, what Apple is doing here is just a blatant violation of that &#39;trust&#39; and certainly a compromise to their commitment to privacy. Under no circumstances is it justifiable to essentially enlist people&#39;s devices to police their owners, while using the electricity that you pay for, the internet service you pay for, and the device itself that you pay for to perform a function that is to absolutely no benefit to the user and in fact can only ever be harmful to them.It doesn&#39;t matter that the net data exfiltrated by Apple ends up being the same as before (through scanning unencrypted files on their servers). The distinction is so obvious to me that I find it incredible that people are legitimately arguing that it&#39;s the same, or that it in some way this is actually helping preserve user privacy.As mentioned in the article, this does absolutely nothing towards protecting children other than directing all but the biggest idiots towards platforms that can&#39;t be linked to them, which I&#39;d imagine, they already are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this new Apple stuff has made me decide not to buy an M1. I&#39;m leaning Framework laptop.For my phone though... no idea. My iPhone is honestly such a solid piece of tech. I don&#39;t _want_ to go Google either... so what else do i have?I know lots of people run de-googled Androids, which i guess works, but i&#39;d prefer to avoid them entirely. Is there anything that works?edit: I know of the Purism phone (https://puri.sm/products/librem-5-usa/) but that&#39;s the only one i know of. Anyone know of others?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Planting false evidence is getting a new twist here. The attacker doesn&#39;t even have to make a report! The victim&#39;s computer does it for him. Disk encryption malware may have new successor. Effective and scalable extortion as a service."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to donate to a lot of &#34;tech/free/open-source&#34; related and free speech non-profits to the amount of about $5,000 per year but this past year I ended up paring down my choices and only donating to Archive.org, Archive.is, FSF and Sci-Hub. I still feel like Sci-Hub is the least robust of the orgs and I feel like they need most of the help. I also use it at least once a day.My only child, a 5 year old girl, has a fairly rare degenerative disease and I&#39;ve been reading the latest research on it and have been using this knowledge to inform her physician about possible treatments. She ended up in a promising drug study because I kept on top of this field and ended up talking to researchers about it. In a large part, this is thanks to Sci-Hub.Nothing in this world is free. If you depend on some &#34;free&#34; or non-profit service that you use often, consider donating to them. You&#39;d be amazed how far even $10 goes when put in good hands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of people saying this seems not a big deal, or that his leadership deserved promotion.It’s because this is a second order article. The original, most substantive source that I could find is quite thorough:https://archive.is/wqdkF&gt; &#34;He would ask us to do personal things for him,&#34; one of these people said. &#34;He said, &#39;I need you to write a briefing for me on Russian history and politics.&#39; [...] We had absolutely no work in Russia.&#34;I originally made a joke in a now-deleted comment, but then was slightly horrified to hear people excusing this behavior. So here’s a serious one: if you get locked into a prestigious institution under someone like this, run.EDIT: I should have known this would turn into a sub thread about whether it’s ok to demand an AI researcher brief an executive on Russian political history.Here’s another one: gossiping about firing someone across the entire office, before you fire them. This article says he did that. I recommend reading through it. I have to go move into our house now, so I can’t paste everything. Suffice to say, the behavior patterns were not productive.I think people want to recognize DeepMind’s eventual success. Having worked under some effective YC founders vs some Suleyman types, I’ve learned that sometimes a startup can succeed in spite of flaws. And remember, DeepMind was bought by Google. At that point they were the anointed child. Their success wasn’t guaranteed, but it wasn’t as tenuous as pre-billions Google investment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this story is overblown. He was clearly a bad manager. From what I can gather, he was placed on leave after an investigation and then moved to a policy position where he does not manage anyone.Calling it a promotion is pure spin."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Employees said Suleyman encouraged them to use private chat groups on Signal and Telegram for work conversations, some of which were set up to automatically delete messages after a set period. Employees were also on occasion asked to delete messages from their phones, a former employee said. They were also told to notify the group once they had done so.&gt; &#34;Mustafa was super paranoid about Google spying on him, so he didn&#39;t want to use corporate apps, even though we were doing corporate work,&#34; one former employee said.Interesting but I can&#39;t wrap my head around its implications."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone else has given you some good advice on your messaging, so I&#39;ll give you some business/technical advice as a former Netflix employee:Try to negotiate your contracts with global streaming rights.  It shouldn&#39;t cost too much more but will make your life a lot easier as you try to expand globally.  That was one thing that slowed Netflix&#39;s global expansion -- a lot of the content was not globally licensed.You will have to develop a very robust system for identifying a user&#39;s location based on IP address as well as advanced proxy detection.  Maybe not at first, but as you move up into more &#34;Hollywood&#34; productions they will require you to show that you are protecting their content from theft.  You will also have to show that you are encrypting everything with DRM, or they won&#39;t license content to you.Don&#39;t try to stream your video from AWS.  Netflix uses AWS as the control plane but built their own CDN, and some of how they build it is publicly available:  https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/appliances/. Before they built their own CDN, they used Akamai and Level 3.Try to build your system for future white label resale.  If you&#39;re successful, maybe some Asian or Hispanic filmmakers will be interested in a platform focused on their needs.  If you build it for white labeling you could potentially resell it for them (this is how HBO started streaming, by buying what MLB had built).Here are the Netflix black content categories that I know about, but there could be more:https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/81299227https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/81305957Good luck!  It&#39;s a hard space to compete in, and if Netflix starts to notice you I can see them trying to copy you, but hopefully you&#39;ll be big enough by then to fend them off!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All: please don&#39;t turn a thread like this into a same-old flamewar about race. It&#39;s tedious, nasty, and never changes.  HN is for curious conversation, and there&#39;s zero curiosity in that, obviously. If you want the sort of angry activation that comes from repeating the same thing over and over, please find some other place to do it.These guys have identified a market opportunity and are going for it. There are a lot of interesting aspects to discuss. If you don&#39;t want to do that, there are other threads to read—you don&#39;t need to muck this one up.As for &#34;how is X for black people a thing&#34; - come on you guys, BET was founded in 1980. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEThttps://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strategically, are you trying to be a brand, a studio, a platform, an marketplace, or maybe all the above? I think the question I have is what to try to build first.As a brand, I see you trying to become a trusted provider of content for an underserved black-identifying audience with diverse tastes. To build brand first, I wonder if you don&#39;t want to put BlackOak-curated content out on existing media platforms. That could be #BlackOakRecommends on twitter.As a studio, and one competing with other producers, how will you differentiate yourselves to content creators? I guess that starts with the ability to get one&#39;s content in front of subscribers, but is there something beyond audience (which you are building), and money (which you are growing), that you can offer creators? Maybe that is access to and information about audience.As a platform, you are starting with UScreen.tv, and categorically the questions I have are how does your consumption experience road map and analytics &amp; recommendations road map line up with theirs? How will you be able to deploy your own tech relative to theirs? Analytics might differentiate you. Netflix reportedly does not share much. How might you be able (through analytics) to inform creators about audience response through your platform?  Can you use analytics uniquely to reinforce and maintain the trust of your audience - e.g., when the platform recommends a video or creator to a user, be able to answer the user&#39;s question &#34;Why am I seeing this?&#34;As a market place, you are an intermediary between content consumers and content creators. How do they to find each other and be rewarded from that - how users browse and how you recommend would be central. Maybe you license curator channels on your site. Perhaps that is in part potentially how you are able to connect creators directly to audiences, i.e. like hosted artist&#39;s pages. Perhaps the &#34;BlackOak artist&#39;s page&#34; is the place that consolidates an artist&#39;s identity, catalog and channels - twitter, instagram, twitch, etc - vs the artist&#39;s own page, youtube channel, weebly, etc. So, that&#39;s MySpace, of yore, on BlackOak.If there&#39;s a theme to all this, I would say it is how to make consumers, curators, and creators more visible in relation to a consumption experience. Ideas are cheap! good luck with everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know the privacy approach Apple has been pushing was just marketing, but I didn&#39;t care too much because I enjoyed my iPhone and M1 macbook.Because of this decision (and the fact that my iPhone more-or-less facilitates poor habits throughout my life), I&#39;m considering moving completely out of the Apple ecosystem.Does anyone have any recommendations for replacements?* On laptops: I have an X1 carbon extreme running linux, but it&#39;s entirely impratical to take outside of the house: it has terrible battery life and runs quite hot.  I also cannot stand its trackpad.  Is there any linux-capable device with an okay trackpad?* On phones: are there any capable phones out there that aren&#39;t privacy nightmares?  All I want is a phone with a long lasting battery that I can use with maps, a web browser, and texting.* On cloud: I&#39;ve considered executing on a NAS forever, but I&#39;m unsure where to start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do people still think they have _any_ power over user-hostile corporations and its proprietary code?Apple can (and likely will) say they won&#39;t do it and then do it anyway. It&#39;s a proprietary platform. They already have it, now. All they are claiming is an excuse not to be caught in a certain way they wouldn&#39;t like at a later point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently listened to a Darknet Diaries episode on messaging app Kik. This app is apparently being used by many people to trade child pornography. In this episode, there was some criticism expressed on how Kik doesn&#39;t scan all the images on their platform for child pornography.I would really like to hear from people who sign this open letter, how they think about this. Should the internet be a free for all place without moderation? Where are the boundaries for moderation (if it has to exist), one-on-one versus group chat, public versus private chat?To quote this open letter: “Apple is opening the door to broader abuses”. Wouldn&#39;t not doing anything open a different door to broader abuse?Edit: I would really love an actual answer, since responses until now have been &#34;but muh privacy&#34;. You can&#39;t plead for unlimited privacy and ignore the impact of said privacy. If you want unlimited privacy, at least have the balls to admit that this will allow free trade of CSAM, but also revenge porn, snuff-films and other things like it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The issue here has nothing to do with children, they would always use &#39;children&#39; as excuse. The issue here is installation of Spyware Engine.The very fact of existence of such Spyware Engine has effect that each person would behave as &#39;someone is looking&#39;.This means zero privacy. This means &#39;no privacy&#39; feeling. Everyone is more &#39;careful&#39; when people around. And this has prolonged effect on society&#39;s freedom, democracy and rights of individual because independent thinking happens when true privacy is there.Even a fear of false triggering the system and exposure of one&#39;s private thoughts/pictures/events to other people during &#39;sorting out false alarm&#39; would make people behave differently. Even if they have nothing to do with any children the fear that their private moments can become public just because some AI would decide so would make each person think twice about each step.This is a huge attack on privacy of individual and should not be taken lightly. The effect will be also huge. Just imagine what they will do next if they get away with this. Just imagine what other companies will do once this is accepted for apple devices.I think this can/should also be considered as a fraud because when one bought apple device one was never told that spyware would be installed some day later.Edit: I think it should be illegal/made illegal to install any spyware on any device for any excuse without warant. Spyware is a Search of &#39;home&#39; without warrant to some degree, isn&#39;t it? Done through the hands of some private company under some excuse...  What about Fourth Amendment?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Im really starting to develop a visceral hatred for Apple.They are talking sanctimoniously about privacy out of one end of their mouth, put on a family friendly face by banning anything offending prude sensibilities, while having no qualms about doing as much business as they possibly can in China. Now this.They are the ultimative dystopian corporation, I find them even worse than Facebook in that regard, at least Facebook has some interest in free speech and does not operate in China.I guess the reason I am so angry is that I like the devices and engineering marvels they can produce. But I cannot be a customer of this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know about you, but I just decided to switch from an iPhone back to a Nokia feature phone (where is mobile Linux when you need it?) and start backing out of Apple&#39;s ecosystem. I&#39;m quite positive I can live without apps, just as I used to before Y2K. And, in case you&#39;re wondering, no: I have nothing to do with illegal adult imagery. [Edit #1] This article gets (at least) one thing right: when it comes to certain kinds of crime, an accusation is ALL it takes to destroy your life. [Edit #2] I used to laugh at all the &#34;we have your password, send Bitcoin or...&#34; spam. The first &#34;you have a picture of a gray cat on your phone, send Bitcoin or...&#34; message would give me a friggin&#39; heart attack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I purchased a Pixel phone to test this stuff on.I installed LineageOS and found I couldn&#39;t run some google apps. I reinstalled LineageOS with https://opengapps.org added during the install and made the mistake of transferring from my old phone which brought all the google services and everything back to the phone (mostly).I then installed CalyxOS - much easier install process than lineage. Really liked the defaults. Could not get many apps that relied on google play services though. If I didn&#39;t need so many Google-tied apps I would pick this as my phone OS for basic stuff like messaging and browsing.Installed LineageOS again, found there were a couple apps I could not get working after all (50 different apps installed).In the end I gave up and re-flashed Google firmware back onto the phone. I spent about 10 hours on all this stuff and simply ran out of time for now. I though I could get away from Google but I didn&#39;t realize how much my apps needed Google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"CalyxOS is an awesome project. I have worked with the lead developer a bit over the past few years and it&#39;s been such a pleasure. We share some bits of code between our projects here: https://github.com/AOSPAlliance.If anyone is interested in building their own custom android OS in the cloud (AWS) with same ability to lock your bootloader like CalyxOS, you can checkout my project I&#39;ve been maintaining for a few years now called RattlesnakeOS: https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack.And if you prefer to not build in the cloud, there is also a really great project called robotnix (https://github.com/danielfullmer/robotnix) which provides a way to build many flavors of OS (AOSP, GrapheneOS, LineageOS, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the context: Calyx Institute is a 501(c)(3) with a digital privacy and security mission. For a while they&#39;ve offered, for a few hundred dollars a year donation, unmetered access to sprint&#39;s network. I don&#39;t know the details but I think they have retained access to the network through the merger due to some non-profit provision (something like the sprint merger was allowed with stipulation that certain agencies using the network for certain purposes would be grandfathered over). There&#39;s apparently more history related to the founder previously running an ISP under gag order, which drives their mission.Access to the network is only possible through wifi pucks. I asked if I could register the IMEI of my ThinkPad&#39;s modem/radio, but they wouldn&#39;t allow it citing the usual &#34;we are responsible for the behavior of the devices on the network so you have to use our certified device&#34;. Sadly, these phones do not participate in Calyx&#39;s data network, they require a traditional carrier. Maybe it&#39;s part of their roadmap to eventually offer their data services on these handset form factor devices? But until then, I don&#39;t see a huge point. It would be really awesome to say &#34;I get my network access through a privacy oriented non-profit&#34; (:"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reeks like a con-artists rephrasing perfectly normal and mundane observations into scary-sounding situations so that people would buy the air-filter companies that are funding your research.I&#39;m all for cleaner air and I don&#39;t doubt that the already well-established negative effects of high CO2 or VOC concentrations on us, but can we at least keep any discussion to non-anecdotal, strong scientific evidence? None the articles linked both here show any rigorous statistics that pinpoint cause and effects, it&#39;s all handwavy conjectures with &#34;common sense&#34; evidence and statistical dressing to show correlation. Correlation doesn&#39;t even necessarily mean causality. Some of the articles even have *may&#34; in the title, you can be the judge.Probably an unpopular opinion given the large amount of anecdotal science already posted.Dust on carpet is bad and particularly if you don&#39;t clean it and let stuff grow - we all know that already and we don&#39;t need a laser pointer to show kids how scary it is. Just because you can see it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s worse, and just because you can&#39;t see it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s better.It&#39;s just insanity that everyone is suddenly a scientists with a few anecdotes or links to articles that show correlation but not causality."</p>

It has deep bass, and it keeps the air near the child extremely clean. We have been doing this for our kids for almost 10 years now since birth.A fun experiment for kids: if you have a laser pointer, shine it close to the ground indoors and kick up dust near the floor.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do they look at the relative contribution between CO2 and VOCs? These two require very different solutions. The first is about ventilation in closed spaces, and the second can be solved with only a $300 air purifier.EDIT: Here is the original study: https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510037I really don&#39;t understand their methods pertaining to VOCs. Maybe someone can fill me in. Their method pertaining to CO2 seems straightforward."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A somewhat oversimplified summary of the new UUID formats:UUID6: a timestamp with a weird epoch and 100 ns precision like in UUID1, but in a big-endian order that sorts naturally by time, plus some random bits instead of a predictable MAC address.UUID7: like UUID6, but uses normal Unix timestamps and allows more timestamp precision.UUID8: like UUID7, but relaxes requirements on where the timestamp is coming from. Want to use a custom epoch or NTP timestamps or something? UUID8 allows it for the sake of flexibility and future-proofing, but the downside is that there&#39;s no standard way to parse the time from one of these -- the time source could be anything monotonic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a quick reference for readers:The UUID specs use the terms &#34;variant&#34; and &#34;version&#34; a little funny; &#34;variant&#34; is essentially the revision (so all modern UUIDs have variant=0b10 to specify RFC 4122 UUIDs), and &#34;version&#34; is a 4-bit number identifying the sub-type within that variant:    UUIDv1 time-based
    UUIDv2 legacy DCE security thing, not wideley used
    UUIDv3 name-based with md5 hashing
    UUIDv4 randomness-based
    UUIDv5 name-based with sha1 hashing

This draft registers a few new sub-types:    UUIDv6 sortable time-based, Gregorian calendar
    UUIDv7 sortable time-based, Unix time
    UUIDv8 sortable time-based, custom time"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem of hash or NN based matching is, the authority can avoid explaining the mismatch.Suppose the authority want to false-arrest you. They prepare a hash that matches to an innocent image they knew the target has in his Apple product. They hand that hash to the Apple, claiming it&#39;s a hash from a child abuse image and demand privacy-invasive searching for the greater good.Then, Apple report you have a file that match the hash to the authority. The authority use that report for a convenient reason to false-arrest you.Now what happens if you sue the authority for the intentional false-arrest? Demand the original intended file for the hash? &#34;No. We won&#39;t reveal the original file because it&#39;s child abusing image, also we don&#39;t keep the original file for moral reason&#34;But come to think of it, we already have tons of such bogus pseudo-science technology like the dogs which conveniently bark at police&#39;s secret hand sign, polygraph, and the drug test kit which detect illegal drugs from thin air."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given all the zero day exploits on iOS I wonder if it&#39;s now going to be viable to hack someone&#39;s phone and upload child porn to their account. Apple with happily flag the photos and then, likely, get those people arrested. Now they have to, in practice, prove they were hacked which might be impossible. Will either ruin their reputation or put them in jail for a long time. Given past witch hunts it could be decades before people get exonerated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These cases will be manually reviewed. That is, according to Apple, an Apple employee will then look at your (flagged) pictures.I&#39;m surprised this hasn&#39;t gotten enough traction outside of tech news media.Remember the mass celebrity &#34;hacking&#34; of iCloud accounts a few years ago? I wonder how those celebrities would feel knowing that some of their photos may be falsely flagged and shown to other people. And that we expect those humans to act like robots and not sell or leak the photos, etc.Again, I&#39;m surprised we haven&#39;t seen a far bigger outcry in the general news media about this yet, but I&#39;m glad to see a lot of articles shining light on how easy it is for false positives and hash collisions to occur, especially at the scale of all iCloud photos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have to say, LÖVE 2d holds a special place with me because it&#39;s the first &#39;real programming game engine&#39; (as in language only no accompanying ide or such) I ever actually developed anything that I would consider a fully fledged completed program I made entirely by myself with.This looks pretty awesome and all but I can&#39;t see the benefits over something like unity or unreal or the amazing for the cost and features Godot.I really like Lua. I&#39;ve always recommended it to beginners or anyone curious about programming for fun over every other language. I&#39;ve used it myself extensivelyBut in this day and age, I can&#39;t really see recommendating this or even LÖVE2d anymore to anyone interested in getting into game programming.There&#39;s just too many high quality alternatives these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool, but I find it hard to find any use case for it. I did plenty of work as an indie game dev in the past, shipped and made money out of games based on my own C++/OpenGL game engine and also shipped a few indie games with some external indie game engines. Then I moved away from gamedev, but recently started playing around with Unreal engine again and was blown away by how much Unreal does for you. It felt like with Unreal engine, game dev is mostly about art and game design and not so much about programming anymore. Given game dev has become so much more competitive and harder to do than in the old days, and the fact that you can get a AAA game engine like Unreal for free (and only 5% royalty after 1-5M in sales), it doesn&#39;t make any sense to use anything else other than Unreal/Unity IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This framework is what I use for most of my hobby projects. There are some videos here: https://twitter.com/j_miskovI went through Unity and Godot before picking it up. I like LOVR because it&#39;s so code-based, with boring boilerplate parts hidden away. I&#39;m no artist and I prefer simple code editor to full engine IDE. The Lua API is easy to understand and remember, and even the framework code is simple to read and modify as needed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here, thanks for posting.Here&#39;s some more color on the reflection on comments, straight from the Linux Kernel documentation that capture my intention much better:&#34;Comments are good, but there is also a danger of over-commenting. NEVER try to explain HOW your code works in a comment: it’s much better to write the code so that the working is obvious, and it’s a waste of time to explain badly written code.Generally, you want your comments to tell WHAT your code does, not HOW. Also, try to avoid putting comments inside a function body: if the function is so complex that you need to separately comment parts of it, you should probably go back to chapter 6 for a while. You can make small comments to note or warn about something particularly clever (or ugly), but try to avoid excess. Instead, put the comments at the head of the function, telling people what it does, and possibly WHY it does it.&#34;[0][0] https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with almost all of these viewpoints. The comment one though isn&#39;t quite right.Sometimes you just need a comment. For example, I was writing some code to an API and the company was offering a private experimental feature. The API was JSON, but this one feature was enabled by adding a small stringified JSON object to a field of the larger JSON post body. If a developer looks at it, they&#39;ll think &#34;this must be wrong&#34; but with a comment that briefly mentions why, everyone will be saved some time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Know when to break the rules. For rules like &#34;don&#39;t repeat yourself,&#34; sometimes a little repetition is better than a bit of dependency.Glad to see DRY called out here. I&#39;ve seen so much crazy code simply to avoid breaking, The Rule."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I was scratching my head for a good couple of minutes trying to figure out how this works, being familiar only with HTTP Response Splitting/HTTP Cache Poisoning.So it seemed that somewhere along the years while I haven&#39;t been paying any attention to websec, it became a common practice to send requests from different clients through the same TLS connection. And due to the non conforming way HTTP 2/1.1 interop was implemented by these webservers/load balancers request boundaries were not delimited correctly, making it possible to inject requests on behalf of followup clients.Fine I get the issue. Sounds like another &#34;good enough&#34; optimization that backfired.What is the solution aside from playing the patching wack-a-mole game? Should maybe a HTTP2.1 protocol work without a strict TLS requirement so that protocol downgrades aren&#39;t necessary to squeeze out extra performance (unless I misunderstand why the HTTP2/HTTP1.1 bridge was in place). Or is the problem that some application servers still don&#39;t support HTTP2 out of the box?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems most of the vulnerabilities here (at least, the first several that I read in the article) come at a point where an HTTP/2 request is transformed into an HTTP 1.1 request. So the insecurity seems to come at the point where a translation occurs and there is redundant information that can be handled in several ways, meaning that there&#39;s lots of room for bugs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@albinowax_, can you say anything more about how widely you have investigated the prevalence of the &#34;H2.X via Request Splitting&#34; vulnerability?Although all of your attack vectors are fascinating, this seems to be the one which is particularly terrifying. It seems like one single request can basically mess up user authentication across an entire website, and for every active user, until the server becomes resynchronized somehow. If I were running a large public-facing site or application, checking for this vulnerability would be my #1 priority this morning."</p>

However, I&#39;m not sure that I support what they are implementing for child accounts (as a queer kid, I was terrified of my parents finding out). On the surface, it seems good - but I am concerned about other snooping features that this portents.However, with icloud photos csam, it is also a horrifying precedent that the device I put my life into is scanning my photos and reporting on bad behavior (even if the initial dataset is the most reprehensible behavior).I&#39;m saddened by Apple&#39;s decision, and I hope they recant, because it&#39;s the only way I will continue to use their platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember an Apple conference where Tim Cook personally assured us that Apple is fully committed to privacy, that everything is so secure because the iPhone is so powerful that all necessary calculations can happen on the device itself, and that we are &#34;not the product&#34;. I think the Apple CEO said some of this in the specific context of speech processing, yet it seemed a specific case of a general principle upheld by Apple.I bought an iPhone because the CEO seemed to be sincere in his commitment to privacy.What Apple has announced here seems to be a complete reversal from what I understood the CEO saying at the conference only a few years ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m really conflicted about this.For context, I deeply hate the abuse of children and I&#39;ve worked on a contract before that landed 12 human traffickers in custody that were smuggling sex slaves across boarders. I didn&#39;t need to know details about the victims in question, but it&#39;s understood that they&#39;re often teenagers or children.So my initial reaction when reading this Twitter thread was &#34;let&#39;s get these bastards&#34; but on serious reflection I think that impulse is wrong. Unshared data shouldn&#39;t be subject to search. Once it&#39;s shared, I can make several cases for an automated scan, but a cloud backup of personal media should be kept private. Our control of our own privacy matters. Not for the slippery slope argument or for the false positive argument, but for its own sake. We shouldn&#39;t be assuming the worst of people without cause or warrant.That said, even though I feel this way a not-small-enough part of me will be pleased if it is deployed because I want these people arrested. It&#39;s the same way I feel when terrorists get captured even if intelligence services bent or broke the rules. I can be happy at the outcome without being happy at the methods, and I can feel queasy about my own internal, conflicted feelings throughout it all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I understand correctly, they want to scan all your photos, stored on your private phone, that you paid for, and they want to check if any of the hashes are the same as hashes of child porn?So... all your hashes will be uploaded to the cloud? How do you prevent them from scanning other stuff (memes, leaked documents, trump-fights-cnn-gif,... to profile the users)?Or will a huge hash database of child porn hashes be downloaded to the phone?Honestly, i think it&#39;s one more abuse of terrorism/child porn to take away privacy of people, and mark all oposing the law as terrorists/pedos....also, as in the thread from the original url, making false positives and spreading them around (think 4chan mass e-mailing stuff) might cause a lot of problems too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny to see anyone here could find this acceptable. I wonder what&#39;s comments would be after Apple start to scan phones for anti-censorship or anti-CCP materials in China. Or for some gay porn in Saudi Arabia.Because you know in some countries there are materials that local government find more offensive than mere child abuse. And once surveillance tech is deployed it&#39;s certainly gonna be used to oppress people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cuomo also sent thousands of elderly people to their deaths by forcing them back into nursing homes.And yes, I mean forcing.Do you remember the hospital ship?  The field hospitals?  Javits center?Did you know the hospital ship went home after being almost completely unused?  Did you know it treated IN TOTAL 182 people?  With a crew of 1200 and 1000 available beds?Did you know that javits center never even got remotely close to full?  In TOTAL in treated about 1000 patients and had 4000 beds.And yet he’s forcing these elderly back into nursing homes because it makes him look in charge, and fuels his idiotic feud he had going with the federal government over who was more leadery.  He won an Emmy for it!Cuomo should be facing prison.  The people who have been helping him cover up killing thousands of elderly people as a political play should as well.The fact that he was transferring state employees around so he could kiss them on the cheek and touch their face should get him disgraced and fired.  It is absolutely a distraction from the horror he has inflicted upon thousands of people.  Imagine him sending your grandmother to her death so that he could look good on television.  Absolutely evil."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; Dani Lever — who had worked in Cuomo’s press operation since 2014 but left in August 2020 to join Facebook as a communications managerThis is the sort of hire that drives me nuts.  I&#39;m sure this person is a fully capable communications manager, but what Facebook really purchased was political access.  Is it no surprise then that long after beginning work she was doing favors for her former employer?  Maintaining a connection to powerful politicians might well have been in her job description.&gt;&gt; Prior to joining Cuomo’s office in 2014, Lever worked as a press assistant for President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign and worked in press relations at the Clinton Foundation, among other roles, according to her LinkedIn profile.Which is more valuable to Facebook: her skills as a &#34;communication manager&#34; or the fact that she probably has the personal numbers for half of Washington?After some quickly googling: she appears to be the daughter of a prominent NYC attorney, which might have something to do with her previous work, as a student, for NY&#39;s attorney general.  And for NYC&#39;s comptroller general.  I would have killed for such jobs during law school.  She seems to have bounced between them while an undergrad.&#34;Lever, who grew up in Quaker Ridge, graduated from [redacted] and the University of Wisconsin-Madison also worked for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, President Obama&#39;s 2012 campaign, and Clinton Foundation. She is the daughter of Joel and Debbie Lever of Bradford Road.&#34;https://scarsdale10583.com/about-joomla/the-project/5776-sca...I love that &#34;Bradford Road&#34; reference.  That is New England code for an old and well connected family.  (The implications of her highschool are just inappropriate and so I redact it.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The shocking thing about Cuomo is how blatant it all was. Not just the sexual harassment but his character across the board.This is a guy who wrote a book about his leadership in the covid pandemic during the covid pandemic. That&#39;s like Churchill writing his memoir of World War II during The Blitz.We ought to have a culture where someone who behaves like this is laughed out of the building."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s so irritating to be an American that has moved overseas. Basically the only country in the world that charges taxes on money you make and spend somewhere else, just because of where you were born. Thanks to IRS regulations, 90% of investment firms will just reject me outright rather than deal with the paperwork. Getting someone to help file my inordinately complex taxes costs thousands of dollars more than I actually pay in tax. I can&#39;t have a proper retirement account here since America doesn&#39;t recognize the local pension providers, so my government mandated pension is deducted from my salary here and then also taxed as income in the USA. If I ever want to leave, the IRS charges a small fortune for the privilege of not being a citizen too.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a small number of rich people gaming the system, but for the vast majority of expats the citizenship-based taxation system is almost cartoonishly cruel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting facts about renouncing American citizenship:- There is renunciation fee that has to be paid and currently stands at $2,350 (the highest in the world).[1]- A final tax return will sill need to be filed. [1]- An Expatriation tax is payable if [..] Your net worth is $2 million or more on the date of your expatriation. you will be treated as having disposed of your assets the day before your expatriation and will be subject to capital gains tax.- The highest capital gains tax bracket in the USA is 20% [2]Now there will be ways this is avoided but it would seem that the IRS is trying very hard make this process unappealing[1] https://www.expatnetwork.com/how-to-renounce-us-citizenship-...[2] https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-r..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an &#34;accidental American&#34; who has navigated this issue and it&#39;s incredibly easy. Just don&#39;t file. Every professional that writes blogs about this has a professional duty to give legal advice but the practical advice is just don&#39;t file. Look into what exactly triggers data to be sent to the IRS under your tax treaty and the policies of your financial institutions. Being &#34;accidental&#34; is the key here. If you tell your bank you aren&#39;t an American and you have a non-American birthplace and birth certificate they have absolutely zero way of knowing and your information will not be sent. If you have an American birthplace you can lie and say you renounced, but this carries some risk as the IRS maliciously publishes lists of renouncers so it&#39;s possible they could guess you lied. FATCA and FBAR are egregious violations of your rights. Not even the NSA has the right to spy on Americans abroad, but the IRS can do dragnet surveillance on American financial data from foreign countries with no probable cause and no warrants. You have a duty not to comply."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was doing research for something else and found this great anecdote about Kid Pix that I&#39;ve saved.&#34;Other product teams do not have the time or resources to work with children as often. In the case of Kid Pix, when it was first released back in 1989, Borderbund sponsored their first Kid&#39;s Day. It was a weekend testing day for 20 children to try out Kid Pix. Developers offered their testers cookies for a break and a crafts table with paper, glue, glitter, etc.--just in case the testers got bored. According to Broderbund employees, few cookies were eaten and almost none of the crafts were used. It was determined that Kid Pix would be a hit (Druin and Solomon 1996).&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man this brings back memories.I must have been 6 years old. My dad came home with a computer that they were getting rid of at his work. He set it up that night and, having never seen a computer, I wanted to play with it. Well, for some reason, it had Kid Pix installed. I remember drawing something with a couple of green lines and a few rabbit stamps for good measure. As I recall, I then insisted that we had to print it and wouldn’t take no for an answer."</p>

And at that point isn&#39;t that a vast invasion of privacy to the perfectly innocent?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The link leads to a reddit post, which leads to another reddit post, which leads to this article in Swiss: https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/hsg-und-china-kritik-auf-twitter-...I can&#39;t read Swiss... but the comments on Reddit seem to show that this isn&#39;t as cut and dry as the title makes it sound. Quoting /u/hamsterman20:&gt; &#34;First of all, he was going to a chinese university with a chinese scholarship.&gt; He left the swiss university because of some weird technicalities while attending the Chinese university.&gt; He posted political messages against china and 1 picture depicting a chinese with yellow skin and slit eyes.&gt; Im not surprised he was kicked out of the chinese university and that the supervisor wanted to distance themselves. Though I wish they would stand up against China, its hard when your career depends on it.&gt; His swiss university refused to take them back. Don&#39;t know why. Technicalities I guess.&#34;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still more to the story, and that it obviously isn&#39;t entirely the student&#39;s fault, but it isn&#39;t like a Swiss Student randomly tweeted about the CCP and got kicked out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Als seine Freundin einige der Tweets sieht, ist sie schockiert. Sie bittet ihn am Telefon, damit aufzuhören. Nicht weil sie bei allem anderer Meinung wäre. Sondern weil sie sich vor Repressionen der chinesischen Regierung fürchtet. «Ich bin in der Schweiz, nicht in China», antwortet er. «Hier kann ich sagen, was ich will.»Translation:When his girlfriend saw some of his tweets she&#39;s aghast. She&#39;s asking him on the phone to stop. Not because she disagrees. But because she is afraid of repercussions by the Chinese government. &#34;I&#39;m in Switzerland, not China&#34;, he replies, &#34;here I can say whatever I want&#34;.Of course he should be able to speak his mind.But when your girlfriend (who is Chinese and living in China) pleads for you to stop, maybe you should just take the hint. Not even for your sake (&#34;I&#39;m in Switzerland&#34;), but for hers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Deep down in the reddit comments there is a statement from the university, which mentioned &#34;The former supervisor&#39;s desire to clearly distance herself is understandable when an accusation of racism is in the air.&#34; Some other comments also mentioned a &#34;racist cartoon&#34;.It is also mentioned in the report: https://www.nzz.ch/english/swiss-phd-students-dismissal-spot...&gt; The writer accuses Gerber of a «racist attack on the Chinese people.» He was referring to a specific tweet: a cartoon that Gerber had posted in response to another user&#39;s tweet. It depicted a comic character that had been altered and had stereotyped Chinese features, with yellow skin tone and slit eyes. This drawing circulated on social media in the spring of 2020, and was deemed racist by some users. Gerber said he only shared the cartoon because of its political message. The underlying topic had been China&#39;s stance toward Taiwan and Hong Kong. «In retrospect, I realize I didn&#39;t question the rendering of the Chinese person enough,» he said.So it is about &#34;yellow skin tone and slit eyes&#34;.This is crazy. I don&#39;t understand how is this OK. One Twitter of cartoon , you are expelled? No chance of explanation or apologize?Even the CCP wouldn&#39;t do this. I am pretty sure a Chinese student wouldn&#39;t be expelled from the university from one single anti-CCP social media post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author&#39;s revenge seems to be against his users who opted to used Sign In with Apple. Since they will be the one suffering because they trusted to use the particular app. 
I can find merit in complaining about apple&#39;s restriction in accessing payments. But SignIn with Apple, as a user I will always opt for that given my email won&#39;t be available with a third party forever for them to spam or sell. 
I have integrated SignIn with Apple both in an app and backend. I never felt it was particularly difficult or under-documented."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This literally could have been written by any developer in the UK. I think most of us start out like this! I think the best one was a company I worked for in Leeds, it was building a secure learning platform for schools which ultimately fell flat on it&#39;s arse. The company was run by a self-made millionaire who was notorious for scamming people.He&#39;d randomly lay off huge numbers of the sales team, and the first anyone would know about it is when the door code would be changed and we&#39;d have to ring the &#34;office manager&#34; (ex-SAS) for the new code.His grand idea to save the failing online learning platform was &#34;pivoting&#34; to selling personalised dog food online........... (and I mean personalised in the sense of just slapping the dogs name and their face on some generic crap dog food, not actually nutritionally personalised to the dog)Left that place being owed 3 months wages (which I never got).Last I heard he was being investigated for fraud. (this was the scum bag in question: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/04/barclays-sm...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is eerily similar to a job I had. I also worked for a young asshole CEO called Andrew, with multiple rubbish businesses, pretending to have more money than he had, having no idea what he was doing, and faced jail time a few years after I left.If you replace &#34;property market&#34; with &#34;education sector&#34; and &#34;UK&#34; with &#34;Australia&#34; we could have almost written the exact same article.I wonder how many of these companies are out there. Be wary of CEOs that don&#39;t bring anything other than money to the table. The more useless someone is, the more of a cunt they can be. Obviously this guy was struggling to pay his rent so he was going to take whatever job came up, but if you&#39;re entering startups and have the privilege of a bit of money in the bank and time on your side, try and pick the one with founders that are actually doing the work themselves. Look for some proof that they&#39;ve built, designed or sold something substantial, before you agree to do all the work for them. Because if they haven&#39;t even begun to do the hard yards themselves, they&#39;re not likely to respect any of your work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first paid developer job was writing backend code for what I would later learn was the Canadian mafia. I was doing some backend and embedded work to build super shitty gambling kiosks for them. They already had some person &#34;managing&#34; project and the Indian contract house that was building flash games for the kiosk. He was useless, so I was stuck figuring everything out. Including getting things running on a then obsolete HP Itanium Integrity server with an old insecure version of Fedora on it. Plus figuring out how this was all going to work in the Dominican Republic where power was not a given at any particular time nor was connectivity. These kiosks would be scattered across 10&#39;s of casinos down there.Eventually things got weird, and I figured out that it was probably a form of scam against their investors. Since they wanted things very insecure and unlogged. Then they wanted me to come down to the DR and help with setup there. I bounced at that point, I was unwilling to give them that sort of power over me. They were in with the former president down there and I would have been at their mercy.10 ish years later I would hear from the &#34;manager&#34; again. He wanted me to help with an automated locker system. I helped a bit but once he begged me to go to an ATT store and recharge his prepaid phone I was done with him. (I did recharge his phone because I am a sucker for a sob story)If someone seems scummy, DO NOT work for them. Your gut is probably telling you something.That said, a good work ethic and a baptism by fire where you have to do everything can be an effective way to get your start."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The value of work is not in the work done; it&#39;s in the decisions being made. It&#39;s the ability to handle edge cases, to work your way through ambiguity, to &#34;unstuck&#34; a stuck situation, and to resolve tricky unforeseen issues.If you build a robot that only handles the main workflow and can&#39;t handle any of the exceptions, you&#39;re not automating anything; you&#39;re building a convenience tool. Basically, you&#39;re removing some of the labor part of the job, but still keeping the decision making part of the job for humans.This is both economically unviable and largely unpopular. You&#39;re not reducing labor costs by much, because you still need humans around. And workers lose control over their job, and have to &#34;work around&#34; the robot&#39;s limitations. Instead of being freed up to do more work, they become babysitters of machines that they have to oversee so it doesn&#39;t mess up everything.This is why partial robotic systems don&#39;t really exist; either it&#39;s a nifty tool that speeds up a small repeatable process of your work, or it&#39;s building the entire house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question I would have around automated building construction is &#34;why use bricks?&#34;.Bricks are great for humans to build with, they are just the right size and weight for the human hand to manipulate and place.  They are not optimised for machine manipulation.I would guess that if you wanted to automate construction you would start by making things like walls on an automated production line, then ship the largest practical piece to the construction site.  Once there I&#39;m guessing some automated cranes could move them into location far more easily than thousands of slightly randomly sized pieces of hard clay.Work out what problem you are trying to solve.  Do you want cheap construction?  then why choose a material that requires thousands of operations just to build a wall regardless of if it is a human or machine doing the building.  There are far more efficient building materials used every day... Just see how fast commercial buildings can be constructed and you can be sure that they are optimised both for speed of construction as well as (hopefully) energy efficiency and ease of maintance after construction.The problem seems to be people have a emotional idea of what a dream house is, an idea that is firmly stuck in the red brick house of 1970&#39;s sitcoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you think bricklaying is a simple task, you&#39;ve probably never laid bricks, or likely ever worked a construction job.There is _a lot_ that goes into laying a brick wall. From excavation, base compaction, material choice, mortar composition and viscosity, wall type, overlap patterns, leveling, overhang patterns, set time, and much more. Using an incorrect overhang pattern for instance can allow water drops to fall and contact the relatively soft surface of bricks and destroy them in a few years. Having an incomplete mortar seal allows the elements to penetrate through what would normally be waterproof, especially in places with high wind. An improper excavation, compaction material or compaction of said material, improper leveling, and many more factors will lead to failure within just a few years.The best way to learn about this stuff is to go try it! One could volunteer for Habitat for Humanity or a local shelter that builds homes and get some time with the tools. None of this stuff is simple, straightforward, or easy, and there are a million ways to do it incorrectly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article touches on &#34;Request Coalescing&#34; which is a super important concept - I&#39;ve also seen this called &#34;dog-pile prevention&#34; in the past.Varnish has this built in - good to see it&#39;s easy to configure with NGINX too.One of my favourite caching proxy tricks is to run a cache with a very short timeout, but with dog-pile prevention baked in.This can be amazing for protecting against sudden unexpected traffic spikes. Even a cache timeout of 5 seconds will provide robust protection against tens of thousands of hits per second, because request coalescing/dog-pile prevention will ensure that your CDN host only sends a request to the origin a maximum of once ever five seconds.I&#39;ve used this on high traffic sites and seen it robustly absorb any amount of unauthenticated (hence no variety on a per-cookie basis) traffic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While the article is correct, it omits most of the actual function of CUPS. Many printers are capable of accepting various types of documents directly over the network, with postscript, HP PCL, and PDF being commonly supported---and ASCII pretty much universally supported.The problem is that few printers support _all_ of these standards. Postscript, for example, is surprisingly complex to implement in practice, which leads to a lot of inexpensive network printers actually lacking postscript support. Further, printers are very slow at rasterizing, and so while support for PDF rasterization is very common you probably don&#39;t want to use it. You can easily see a minute per page for printing modest PDFs. In-printer PDF rasterization is also of very uneven quality, and I have seen issues like completely broken kerning in documents due to the printer&#39;s poor handling of embedded fonts.One of the key functions of something like CUPS is to address this problem: CUPS standardizes the format of all printed documents to something that is well-supported by the printer, and performs much of the rasterization ahead of time on the much faster print server. This saves time and improves reliability since you don&#39;t need to figure out if a given document is supported by the printer. For most printers these days some variant of PCL is the preferred language for jobs, as it&#39;s simpler and easier to implement than Postscript. It also presents fewer security concerns.Of course the other major problem CUPS solves is the management of the queue, including across multiple users. That&#39;s an important feature but not one that matters in a lot of home situations. That said, if you don&#39;t use a printing system you can and will run into annoying situations where you cannot print a document because you are waiting for the previous one to complete sending, which often gets blocked on the printer&#39;s memory space or rasterization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hah. I had a similar moment of enlightenment with FreeBSD when somebody explained that you can just cat a wav file into /dev/audio (or /dev/dsp? forget the exact name). And that you can produce white noise by catting /dev/random to the same destination. With no barrier to the sound card like that, I was free to experiment with programming dfferent noise algorithms and figuring out how digital audio works. I eventually did things the proper way with OSS and finally sndio on OpenBSD, but direct, universal interfaces like files invite that initial exploration and help you get things done quick and easy.netcat is also a secret weapon around the house. My girlfriend runs macOS, but it&#39;s way more reliable to just nc files to each other over wifi than deal with all the cloud and airdropping bullshit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, the Internet Printing Protocol (and IPP Everywhere in particular) make printer setup in CUPS far, far easier, but distributors seem reluctant to encourage it.  I wrote about my experiences with IPP back in June (https://lwn.net/Articles/857502/).  I expect to never have to hassle with printer drivers again..."</p>

Or maybe I should say, I&#39;m not a Facebook product)&gt;Facebook moved to penalize the researchers in part to remain in compliance with a 2019 data privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, in which the company was punished for failing to police how data was collected by outside developers, Clark said. Facebook was fined a record $5 billion as part of a settlement with regulators.That&#39;s a reasonable explanation for their action, right? Even if it&#39;s not 100% true, if you&#39;re a manager at Facebook, and the situation isn&#39;t 100% clear cut, you&#39;re still going to act, so you can show it as an example the next time the FTC tries to fine them.And they did offer an alternative:&gt;Clark said Facebook offers targeting data sets for political ads, and has suggested the NYU group use that information."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The debate on who has control over data typically creates two parties: the individual user who it is related to, and the corporation providing the platform or product.We ought to add another party: the public. Perhaps data should be able to be used for the public good, and we should be able to participate in deciding what data is collected and how data is used.In this case, having data about what ads are seen, by whom, and why they see those ads, seems like it could lead to us better understanding how FB and other companies algorithms are segmenting the population and how certain ideas proliferate within those segments. This seems beneficial to the public, since as we&#39;ve seen over the last 5 years or so, these platforms and the way they choose what information we see can have drastic effects on the economy, politics, etc. If I had a choice, I would choose to continue collecting data about the behavior of advertisers and the platforms that serve them for that kind of analysis. But we don&#39;t have a choice, because facebook &#34;owns&#34; that data.A number of people in this thread have referenced Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook does choose to share data with other parties, we have no say over what data is shared with them or what they may do with it. We don&#39;t even get a choice in how Facebook internally uses our data. Instead of democratizing the decision of what data is collected and how it is used, the FTC applied the rules of private property and fined FB for lack of privacy.The public got nothing out of that situation. Facebook now is more defensive of their ownership over our data, which also precludes us using it for the public good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; And finally, something that would, in my opinion, really add to the realism and historical flavor of a medieval-themed city builder would be the introduction of mechanisms in which agricultural surpluses are skimmed by the church and the feudal lord. Tithes, taxes and rents! Instead of merely abstracting the taxes into an income modifier or letting the player be the extractor himself, we could be shown the tax collector visiting the village, counting the sheaves by the side of the road, selecting the calves and chickens. This way, the experiences of our medieval forebears are visualized and may help to educate the public about medieval village life.This is the part that&#39;s most interesting to me. I always feel tax policy &amp; land use is very rarely explored in games; in most of these games if you can set tax rates at all it always seems to be a straight tax on productivity so you just have to pick the amount of deadweight loss you&#39;re willing to accept to generate the revenue you need to run your government. There&#39;s also very rarely any distinction between government spending and private spending, and how government spending on public goods influences the asset values of private interests. You could make an entire game about just that subject.EDIT: As a follow-up, I found this history of land &amp; tax policy in Denmark going back to the middle ages to be quite fascinating and might be a useful point of contact for this sort of thing: https://bibliotek1.dk/english/history/centuries-of-experienc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love a building game where you can&#39;t build roads. All of those building games so far allowed that, but I think it would be more fun to just allow for constructing building, and roads/pathway would form depending on their connectivity inside the production chain. I.e. you wouldn&#39;t connect your farm to a butcher, but pathways would form and eventually turn into street based on the amount people from dependent shops walking to it (also depending on terrain and usage of i.e. horse carriages)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hrm.  My opinion is that complete accuracy isn&#39;t all that fun.  Folks have used tax records to do analysis of, say, how many farmers it takes in a village for a blacksmith to be present, and so on and so forth.  It was a lot more than you might imagine.On the other hand, looking at the D&amp;D 3.5 Dungeon Masters Guide 2, they have finally fleshed out Saltmarsh.  Bizarrely, a town of less than four thousand people actually has an assassins&#39; guild, with roughly ten members.  Do they take turns, each assassinating one person a year?  Because that&#39;s roughly how infrequently it would have to occur for their little club to escape notice.  Hardly worth paying dues for, sitting around, discussing that murder you managed five years ago and how you look forward to one in another five.Take a look at city-building ... in most games you rarely see the hub-and-spoke develop around a port city, despite that being a prevalent pattern, or the unique feel of isoheight versus steep streets in a hilly region (the San Francisco pattern).  If you watch city maps over hundreds of years, many forces are at work, and I think they might be simulable but I don&#39;t know if the end result would be enjoyable enjoy to warrant it.If you look at our actual cave ecosystems, troglobionts, which are adapted for living strictly in caves, are typically quite tiny.  There&#39;s simply no food down there!  Resources are scarce.  Hence you would get no gelatinous cubes or hook horrors or carrion crawlers stumbling around the caves, lurking about, waiting for adventurers or the average bear.  Instead you get some very small, pale shrimp.  This is not exciting for the adventurer.  Some handwaving of a source of energy called &#34;Faerzress&#34; eventually takes place and is only vaguely acceptable if one does not look hard, serving as kind of a bottom trophic level for the game.The balance between actual plausibilty and what one might call &#34;fantastical satiation&#34; is quite difficult.  Your large-sized dragon, perhaps your standard-issue Vermithrax Pejorative, would need something like a log flume ride of virgins delivered straight to its gullet to sustain its bulk, not to mention the caloric expenditure.  Clearly, this isn&#39;t very satisfying for your story-telling, either.The balance is rough and I suspect that nitpicking in the name of accuracy can undermine most of what is constructed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; (...) roughly 4mm of distance is required between the two circuits. (As I discuss in Tiny, cheap, dangerous: Inside a (fake) iPhone charger, cheap chargers totally ignore these safety rules.Which is why I immediately destroy any charger at my home that is suspect to not come from a brand name producer.Is it really worth to risk your life for couple of dollars?Electronics is my hobby and I also happen to design some switch mode power supplies for AC. I can&#39;t overstate how difficult it is to design a good safe SMPS. Comparing to my other projects it seems it is at least 20-50 times harder to design a dedicated SMPS than the rest of the circuit, even with a lot of specialized literature on the matter to help me out (meaning I don&#39;t create my own topologies, I just learn the ones that are well described in the book). And that for applications under 100W."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a shame so few companies still make high quality 5V/1A chargers anymore. Apple seems to be the only one left that does so, and with consistent and predictable manufacturing.5V/1A is great for overnight charging. I&#39;ve noticed my phone battery lasts so much longer the next day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty dismal discussion in here at the time of writing. Largely complaints about tyranny. Makes me sad that we can&#39;t have a calm discussion about the merits of the policy.From what I can tell, you might be opposed to this policy if:1. You have fears about getting a vaccine, moreso than for coronavirus. If this is you, do you prefer a mask mandate? And if so, how do you enforce this in a restaurant, where anyone eating takes off their mask right away?2. You have fears about the privacy implications. If so, what are those fears? Perhaps your vaccination status can lead people to make inferences about your health?3. You are not particularly concerned about the community spread of coronavirus (and the implications of that)There aren&#39;t a lot of choices. You can 1) avoid high-risk areas and escape infection/spreading disease, in which case, this policy doesn&#39;t really directly affect you. Or 2) you can take your chances with coronavirus, which you will get sooner or later, and spread it. Or 3) you can &#34;take your chances&#34; with the vaccine which, statistically and biologically, is safer than getting coronavirus and reduces spread.This policy allows people to choose from 1) and 3) but not 2), which is in all ways the worst decision. Unless, of course, you think that the vaccine is more dangerous than coronavirus. And then I don&#39;t really know what to say.(lightly edited for clarification)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Vaccine requirements have been in place for decades. 
For pre-K in NYC kids need shots for PCV and Hib.For kindergarten they need more shots: Hep B, Polio, Chickenpox, and Measles, Mumps and Rubella.Going to middle school? Then you&#39;ll need more shots, the TDAP and meningococcal conjugate.These are all vaccine requirements. Is it an invasion or privacy to demand children&#39;s records? Is it the nanny state? We could go down that road, but who wants to live in a world where we lose herd immunity to all of those diseases because 30-40% of people choose to opt their children out?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To preface: I got the vaccine months ago (as soon as I had access), I&#39;m a big believer in vaccines.With that being said, this policy doesn&#39;t sit well with me. None of the currently available vaccines in the US are FDA approved. Of course, a lot of people have received those vaccines, but I also don&#39;t necessarily fault individuals for feeling hesitant (the nuance here is that I think people ought to get the vaccine).  mRNA is a new, unknown technology, and the vaccine was rushed faster to public access than any other vaccine before. We have absolutely no idea if there are any long term side effects of these vaccines.Both candidates Biden and Harris expressed the need for full trials and transparency in regard to the vaccine before they were in office, then changed their tune after (see: https://twitter.com/pbhushan1/status/1416969060890210305).  Biden says:&gt; When we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, Who’s going to take the shot? Who’s going to take the shot? You going to be the first one to say, “Put me — sign me up, they now say it’s OK”?If the vaccine is as effective as it seems, then this decision feels positively nanny state to me. It takes away an individual&#39;s agency to inform themselves of the risks on both sides and make an informed decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case anyone is interested, this is what it looks like on Internet Explorer 5 in Windows 9x: https://i.imgur.com/g668yBy.pngWhat&#39;s happening is that the &lt;h3&gt; tags are all nested, since they don&#39;t auto-close in this situation, and modern browsers define the &lt;h3&gt;&#39;s size as &#34;font-size: 1.17em;&#34; which of course adds up over time. I&#39;m not sure how IE5 interprets the page. Maybe I can get an older embedded version of Firebug to check.I think it&#39;s important to not break even older websites even if they have totally busted HTML, but this is probably such a rare case that no one ever thought of it, and at this point it&#39;d probably be much more disruptive to try and &#34;fix&#34; it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The font-tags are getting unfairly blamed!The increasing size is due to the unclosed &lt;h3&gt; tags combined with unclosed inline level tags. This is parsed into a nested structure, with h3&#39;s nested into h3&#39;s deeper and deeper. The font-size of h3 is defined as relative increase, so the nested h3-elements get increasingly larger size.The effect can be reproduced with this HTML snippet:     &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello
     &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello
     &lt;h3&gt;hello

Which is parsed as:     &lt;h3&gt;
       &lt;span&gt;hello
         &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;hello
               &lt;h3&gt;hello&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;/h3&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;/h3&gt;

Usually a h3 would be automatically closed when a new h3 (or any block-level element) is encountered, but because of the unclosed inline element (span in the above example) it is instead parsed as a nested structure. In OP it is unclosed font-tags which cause the h3&#39;s to nest, but it has nothing to do with the semantics of &lt;font&gt; per se, it is just because they are unclosed.So why did it look correct in old IE? I think this comes down to the built-in browser style-sheet. I suspect h3 is defined with an absolute font size in the IE browser style sheet which means nesting does not increase the size."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m kinda just pulling this out of the swamp of 25-year-old web design knowledge, but the unclosed code on that page consists of &lt;font&gt; tags, which are long since deprecated, and those font tags have size=&#34;2&#34; / size=&#34;-2&#34; attributes. I&#39;m pretty sure the old behaviour was that &lt;font size=&#34;[signed int]&#34;&gt; affected the size relative to the parent in the same way that CSS &#34;font-size:200%;&#34; or &#34;font-size:50%;&#34; would do. So nesting them doesn&#39;t create any new block elements, but it modifies the font size within a &lt;td&gt; or &lt;p&gt; relative to the parent. Just at a look, that seems like the explanation for the increase in font size, in this admittedly odd document.[edit] I believe the page would look as intended if each &lt;font&gt; tag overrode the prior unclosed &lt;font&gt; tag, rather than treating it as a parent, and that was probably how IE 6 interpreted it. In fact I think old browsers would auto-close &lt;/font&gt; if you wrote a new &lt;font&gt;."</p>

Even if you&#39;re sure you will never need one or more of those features, get them all. Wifi and Bluetooth and NFC are strictly optional, and probably not worthwhile.If you need color printing, send it to a printing company. There might even be a local one. It will be done at a higher quality, with better ink and good paper, than you can do at your office or house -- unless you are big enough to utilize a whole flock of printers, or you are a professional. If you are a pro, you don&#39;t need this advice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There should be a law that states for any subscription product I should be allowed to buy a fixed-term version with no auto-renewal.

Reading the fine print says that I can buy it and cancel it the next day and still have lifetime access to the version at the time of my purchase. Why make me jump through the hoops?
  * I wanted to support a writer on Substack by subscribing for a year. But I can&#39;t, I can only start a perpetual sub. So I subbed and canceled 1 day later. Then I got a &#34;why did you cancel?&#34; email. I didn&#39;t really
  * I saw a cool open source project I liked and wanted to donate. They only had a Patreon link. Patreon only has recurring subs. So I had to email them and ask for their PayPal so I could send them $100.

I really wonder how much of SaaS revenue is people who have forgotten to cancel. I would guess 25% industry-wide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of good thoughts in here. The one I personally want everyone to take away is that most plastics are not recycled.Unless it’s glass, fibre, or aluminum, you are lying to yourself if it’s going into the blue bin.Glass-contained milk delivery seems great.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s good to just delete the packages. Same goes for Android Apps in the Google Play Store or for Chrome Extensions.These compromised packages should have their page set to a read-only mode with downloads/installs disabled, with a big warning that they were compromised.This is specially troublesome with Chrome Extensions and Android Apps, where it is not possible to get to know if I actually had the extension installed, and if I had, what it was exactly about.Chrome Extensions getting automatically removed from the browser instead of permanently deactivated with a hint of why they can&#39;t be activated again, and which was the reason why the extension got disabled, is a problem for me. How do I know if I had a bad extension installed, if personal data has been leaked?This also applies to PyPI to some degree.----Eventually the downloads should get replaced with a module which, when loaded, prints out a well defined warning message and calls sys.exit() with a return code which is defined as a &#34;vulnerability exception&#34; which a build system can then handle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why our build systems don’t use public repositories directly, and why we always pin to an exact version. Any third party dependencies (js/python/java/c/you-name-it) are manually uploaded to our Artifactory server- which itself has no internet access. All third party libraries are periodically checked for new versions, any security announcements etc, and only if we are happy do we update the internal repo.It has been a bit of a challenge, especially with js &amp; node and quite literally thousands of dependencies for a single library we want to use. In such cases we try avoid the library or look for a static/prepackaged version, but even then I don’t feel particularly comfortable.I should really start specifying checksums too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to me like one low hanging fruit to make a lot of these kinds of exploits significantly more difficult is protection at a language level about which libraries are allowed to make outgoing HTTP requests or access the file system. It would be great if I could mark in my requirements.txt that a specific dependency should not be allowed to access the file system or network, and have that transitively apply to everything it calls or eval()&#39;s. Of course, it would still be possible to make malware that exfiltrates data through other channels, but it would be a lot harder.I am not aware of any languages or ecosystems that do this, so maybe there&#39;s some reason this won&#39;t work that I&#39;m not thinking of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To chime in with my own anecdotal opinion that is likely to anger some people... in my experience most developers do their best work after about 6-8 months of starting a job at a new company, and that comes to an end after about 24-36 months of working at the same company. After that the vast majority of people just stagnate, get complacent, the job stops being interesting to them and they move on.After observing this I don&#39;t really mind hiring people to work for 2-3 years and then have them move on to another role, and most people I hire I do so with the expectation that I&#39;ll get a good two years of work and not much more.A very small percentage of people continue to improve over the long term, and those people I am happy to continue increasing their pay, but I don&#39;t really go out of my way to retain employees and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly worth it to do so.This blog post mentions a kind of impact based compensation structure, and while I can respect the idea behind it, I am skeptical that they&#39;ve managed to find a deterministic and impartial way of measuring &#34;impact&#34;. I don&#39;t presume to have such a system so I pay based on what I observe in the market and let the market decide what the value is of software developers. For example, I genuinely don&#39;t know if software developers have more of an impact than the product designers, or the legal department even though I pay software developers much much more. What I do know is that it&#39;s much easier for me to hire a competent lawyer or UX designer than it is to hire a competent software developer and there are many more competent lawyers and designers out there... so I pay them less, regardless of whatever objective measure of impact may exist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really understand this article, or the current trend of job hopping. I&#39;m from the generation where you have one job, maybe two, and that&#39;s it: I&#39;ve had 7, but I really only ever wanted one good job.For some perspective: when I left Intel circa 2010, I was a Senior Staff Engineer fighting to get promoted to Principal Engineer (followed by Senoir Principal, then Fellow, then Senior Fellow, hahaha). FYI I loved Intel for the first 10 years, and hated the last 12.I made $130k base salary, $70k typical bonus (EB+ECBP), and stock options (most of which were worthless). This was after over two decades there, started in &#39;88.Recently, a friend (12 years younger than me) was hired by Intel to work in one of the ML groups. He asked if the starting salary was fair: they offered him $400k. I was angry, jealous, and shocked. I have friends that are STILL there, grinding away at sub-200k base salary after nearly 30 years, and they are too scared to leave.So this idea of coders flitting from job to job just seems so alien to me. I&#39;m obviously from a different generation. I don&#39;t even know what I would ask for pay if I ever left consulting. Headscratcher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The hard truth that many companies struggle to wrap their heads around is that they should be paying their long-tenured engineers above market rate.From an ethical point of view, maybe. From a rational point of view, maybe not.Jobs are &#34;sticky&#34; — it&#39;s a pain to apply for jobs, arrange interviews, deal with the possibility of getting rejected. And if you do get an offer and accept you will be leaving colleagues that may be friends, risk your position being less stimulating, have to move house and/or deal with a new commute.There is a very real salary range between &#34;low enough that I&#39;ll think about applying for other jobs&#34; and &#34;so low I&#39;ll actually start applying for jobs&#34;. Employers are aware of this and are paying salaries accordingly. It sucks for everyone in that salary band but — ethics and long-term viability aside — it&#39;s still the rational economic choice for employers. Every now and again someone will quit and get their deserved 40% increase, but many will delay leaving for years, or simply put up with it indefinitely, saving employers tons of money.Of course this may not be the case forever. It seems like recently the cohort of people who find interviewing and changing jobs more tolerable (the so-called &#34;job-hoppers&#34;) is increasing in size. If you happen to be a part of this cohort, then congratulations, you&#39;re winning the job-market pain-of-change-vs-salary arbitrage game and will enjoy above-average year-on-year salary increases for at least the near future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a bit of a story behind this. Oculus is owned by Facebook, but the Facebook website and the Oculus headsets/software are by different teams working in different states. When Facebook bought Oculus, they decided to get rid of the Oculus-specific account system and use only Facebook accounts. The Facebook account requirement took effect with the launch of the Oculus Quest 2, which launched in October 2020.October 2020 was the month before the US election, and the peak of both disinformation/influence campaigns, and of Facebook-the-website&#39;s efforts to combat those campaigns. So the spambot detector sensitivity was turned up to max that month, and if you tried to create a new account, there was a large chance you&#39;d be mistaken for a bot and banned immediately. So a bunch of people who weren&#39;t Facebook users got fancy new VR headsets, tried to create Facebook accounts in order to be able to use them, and got immediately banned. The support department for Facebook-the-website was not at all up to the task of dealing with this. This kind of wrecked their product launch; instead of the press coverage and public reaction being about how great their hardware was, it was about all the people who couldn&#39;t use their hardware because of account issues.So now Oculus has a completely separate support department for Facebook account issues, which acts less like it&#39;s supporting a free website and more like it&#39;s supporting a $300 piece of hardware. And if you have an account issue with the website, and you want to use that support department instead of the bad one, then buying a Quest 2 is not such a bad idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FB had an internal help system called &#34;Oops&#34;. It was meant for employees to get help for friends they knew in real life. It was discontinued not long ago (EDIT: maybe not according to a child comment). There were just too many requests for help.Facebook has a corporate structure that simply will not prioritize any effort longer than 6 months unless a senior company executive (Mark, Sheryl) supports it. Even if it affects the bottom line - and there were plenty of examples where large customers could not spend significantly more money with Facebook because of software bugs - they won&#39;t do anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Utility services start off as luxuries, and are private and unregulated.  This was true with telephone and electric companies.  When these services get to a certain point where there are real consequences for not being able to access the system, they need to have public regulation to ensure access and customer service.  ISP internet service has definitely reached this point, and I think that there&#39;s a strong argument that Google &amp; FB accounts (particularly for businesses) have reached this point as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is more than a privacy disaster. It is so far so vaguely worded (maybe deliberately?) that the government can target everyone in the ecosystem with penalties:While the language is still evolving, the proposal would seek to expand the definition of “broker” under section 6045(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include anyone who is “responsible for and regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets” on behalf of another person. These newly defined brokers would be required to comply with IRS reporting requirements for brokers, including filing form 1099s with the IRS. That means they would have to collect user data, including users’ names and addresses.The broad, confusing language leaves open a door for almost any entity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to be considered a “broker”—including software developers and cryptocurrency startups that aren’t custodying or controlling assets on behalf of their users. It could even potentially implicate miners, those who confirm and verify blockchain transactions. The mandate to collect names, addresses, and transactions of customers means almost every company even tangentially related to cryptocurrency may suddenly be forced to surveil their users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The downsides listed are just cryptocurrency lobbyist talking points.“Require new surveillance of everyday users of cryptocurrency;”What everyday users? There’s nothing you can do with this stuff except speculate, gamble and build obfuscated Ponzis.”Force software creators and others who do not custody cryptocurrency for their users to implement cumbersome surveillance systems or stop offering services in the United States;”Not offering these services seems like a positive outcome.”Create more honeypots of private information about cryptocurrency users that could attract malicious actors;”Losing your money to malicious actors is a standard part of the crypto experience already. Endless scams and ransomware don’t seem to worry the author.”Create more legal complexity to developing blockchain projects or verifying transactions in the United States—likely leading to more innovation moving overseas.”Ah, blockchain innovation, which is somehow so vital to the shining future of mankind, yet has utterly failed to produce anything of technological or economic value with the billions already invested. Overseas sounds like a fine place to continue this pseudoinnovation charade."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anybody who has followed cryptocurrency in the last year knows that major US financial institutions and hedge funds have become heavily involved. The regulations coming are entirely to do with making the legal burdens of individual custody onerous enough that users place their coins on completely centralized exchanges to manage legal risk, all so these institutions have access to these coins for manipulation purposes like borrowing for shorting. The ONLY regulation you will see is on the average user so they can suck up coins like Daniel Plainview drinking your milkshake, NOT on market manipulation or trading habits of institutions which is the key driver of malicious activity and harm in the cryptocurrency space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because my engagement with unions has only been positive, I am interested in the amazing number of people who seem motivated to say how negatively they feel about unions. I get that in an oppositional sense, if you don&#39;t want what a union wants, then they tend to cast into the bad, but for the middle ground who are not VCs, owners, Managers, and are candidates for union membership, I find it really strange how much people cast them into a class of &#34;money grabbers for no benefit&#34;Do people feel the same about life insurance, car insurance? Its not that you actually intend being harrassed or sacked (fall ill, have a car accident) It&#39;s that you don&#39;t want to find yourself on the wrong side of an employment dispute (accident claim) without some insurance.Unions may be taking your hard earned money. They may be doing things which you don&#39;t like (do I love my car insurance company?) But, they have a neccessary role in risk management.We talk about risk management in the ICT sector all the time. Why can&#39;t we talk about risk management for labour hire?Amazon used &#34;dirty tricks&#34; to win this election. I am sure the Union bust some minor rules too, but overall I am reasonably confident that the vote was neither free, nor fair. I also do think there is no latent 100% pro-union vote out there, and that a large number of the polled workers don&#39;t want a union, or the cost of the union, or the risk of jobloss from Amazon if they join the union (which is illegal but still has a risk of happening) -So I don&#39;t for a minute believe a re-vote will magically reverse the signal with an overwhelming result.What interests me, is the basis for opposition to the union in the first place. Do people really think the garment workers in  New York were backing the wrong horse? Do people think the machineguns which Ford arranged to turn on a union march in Detroit didn&#39;t happen?&#34;oh, that would never happen now...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This could work out. Each time the employer violates an NRLB rule during an organizing campaign, even if the employer wins, there&#39;s another election in 3 months. Until the union wins or the employer stops breaking the rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The surveillance seems like the more troubling ruling. Having a security guard stand outside a union meeting and photograph the attendants seems like a thinly veiled threat, and if I were in that situation I would likely jump ship."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations to the Vue team, this is definitely a big win for them.Reading through the RFC is really interesting. They specifically call out the dependency on Facebook as effectively being React&#39;s Single Point of Failure, citing their negative experiences with HHVM.And for all of the love that people give React&#39;s big shifts (like hooks), the RFC specifically counts this against them, given that best practices have shifted so drastically in the last few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I&#39;m in an alien world when it comes to Vue - it has this weird pattern of making strings do loads of heavy lifting.The Github Commits[1] example on their documentation has a load of stuff that just doesn&#39;t sit right with me.Things like    v-for=&#34;record in commits&#34;

to loop over something is insane to me - this isn&#39;t code, this is a string inside a html attribute! How can you get any sort of good type analysis/variable checking/syntax highlighting inside this?Similarly, accessing properties like    :href=&#34;record.html_url&#34;

has the exact same issues - what if there&#39;s a typo here? My IDE can&#39;t highlight that this is wrong because it&#39;s *not code* and is just a string.Maybe I&#39;m just the odd one out here, but vue (and angular) love to use strings as a makeshift programming language, which to me is a major smell.^[1]: https://v3.vuejs.org/examples/commits.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d clap harder if Vue weren&#39;t so desperate to become React and focus on their own strengths. React certainly appealed to a lot of devs who at best disliked working with HTML &amp; CSS, but Vue welcomed everyone with an excellent gentle slope to gently move devs away from direct Dom manipulation and embrace reactive paradigms. Folks with small shops could now refactor their codebases with relative ease.If only the Vue team could understand, we don&#39;t want React features. We&#39;ll use React when we want them. We want Vuejs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"China is not &#34;smashing its tech industry&#34;. It&#39;s cracking down on private Internet companies that acquired too much power through network effects. This is completely consistent with CCP doctrine. Anything that central has to be state-owned.Xi declared this year that while digitization is important, “we must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy… and never deindustrialize.” Right. China, remember, has a national industrial policy. It&#39;s expressed in the national 5 year plan, which is taken seriously and used to set priorities.What those priorities are is no secret. The current 5 year plan, the 14th, lists them.[1] Specific technology goals are in blue boxes.  Semiconductors, gas turbines, biotech, new energy vehicles, robotics, advanced agricultural equipment. Internet services are mentioned in the Plan. One key line section out here: &#34;We will strengthen the economic supervision of internet platforms in accordance with laws and regulations, clarify platform enterprise positioning and regulatory rules, improve the laws and regulations concerning the identification of monopolies, and crack down on monopolies and unfair competition. ... We will intensify anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition law enforcement and judicial efforts and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital.&#34;If you think this isn&#39;t to be taken seriously, go back and look at the 13th 5 year plan and check off the completed items.[1] https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0284_14th_Fi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; China may simply see things differently. It’s possible that the Chinese government has decided that the profits of companies like Alibaba and Tencent come more from rents than from actual value addedExcellent observation, and I hope, for China&#39;s sake, that this is the reason.The United States is likely in for a long-term rude awakening when it finally realizes that an economy predicated on negative-value-add activities like clicking heart icons on photos, repackaging financial securities into products with impossible-to-detangle risk profiles, advertisement and addiction optimization, and political outrage, will not remain any definition of &#34;global superpower&#34; for long.Facebook and Netflix are excellent examples of companies that contribute greatly to our GDP whilst simultaneously draining our reserves of actual capital and mental health."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There are certainly those in America who believe that Facebook and Google produce little of value relative to the profit they rake in; maybe China’s leaders, for reasons that will remain forever opaque to us, have simply reached the same conclusion.Arguably, capturing most of your country&#39;s top talent with absurd salaries and putting them to work on world-critical challenges like... how to generate more revenue from advertisement or... how to create as many &#34;phone-addicts&#34; as possible... could be quantified as producing tons and tons of negative value.If China&#39;s crackdown on &#34;consumer-facing tech&#34; is about this, that could be a very good thing for China long term.I grew up wanting to work on NASA and putting stuff on space, and during university got offered 10x the NASA salaries at FAANG companies, and was to week to just say &#34;no thanks&#34;.10 years later I am starting to wonder what my legacy is going to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My one and only Google interview went this way years ago.  Each round they&#39;d send me more books to study, which frankly I couldn&#39;t be bothered to read given the circumstances.My experience ended when an interviewer in round 3 or 4 asked me an obviously scripted question.  I answered sarcastically, he got peeved, and I never heard from them again.I&#39;m not claiming I&#39;m Google caliber, whatever that means.  Obviously I&#39;m not because I don&#39;t have the patience for their interview questions.To be clear, the entire question was:
What&#39;s not in a Linux inode?My answer was:
Lots of things...dinosaurs, the moon...The interviewer told me very matter of factly that it was in fact, the filename.I honestly lost all respect for the process, sorry Googlers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s happening is that companies want to completely remove risk from the hiring process.In the real world, you cannot remove risk. You can manage it, but you cannot remove it. Asking candidates to go through 6 interviews before making a decision and not telling them when a decision will be made signals a risk adverse culture that cannot make decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah Amazon... 14 interviews, an additional 5 hour technical test, spanning a total of 3+ months. Only to be informed at the end that I was too technical for the role they had in mind but they were offering me a Senior Principal SDE role instead.By the time we got to the end of the process I&#39;d already concluded that the hiring process was a reflection of their internal decision making and that this was not a company (or department) I wanted to work for.Then I was hired elsewhere and I saw something similar happen to a candidate and realised that this was truly an indication of the indecision. We had lots of roles, just none shaped in a way that fitted the person, and what we should&#39;ve done is reject the person but on that occasion we hired and it was a terrible decision. They were a good person and very capable, but not a fit for the role finally offered. I had the sense that if I had accepted the Amazon role that would&#39;ve been true for me too.An interview process of more than 3-4 defined steps that takes longer than a month to schedule, is a bad sign.Top tip for candidates: Ask what the process is, if they cannot conclusively tell you then double down on interviewing at a company that can."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For reference, I&#39;ve never seen the built-in Windows VPN protocols exceed ~70 Mbps in any scenario. Maybe it&#39;s possible with a crossover cable between two Mellanox 100 Gbps NICs, using water-cooled and overclocked CPUs, but not over ordinary networks with ordinary servers.I have gigabit wired Internet to a site with gigabit Internet. Typical performance of SSTP or IKEv2 is 15-30 Mbps. That&#39;s 1.5% to 3% max utilisation of the available bandwidth, which is just... sad.It&#39;s not the specific site either, other vendor VPNs can easily achieve &gt; 300 Mbps over the same path.It&#39;s a year and a half into the pandemic, there are record numbers of people working from home, and Microsoft is the world&#39;s second biggest company right now.Meanwhile, volunteers put together a protocol in their spare time that is not only more secure but can also easily do 7.5 Gbps!That needs to be repeated: At least ONE HUNDRED TIMES faster than the &#34;best&#34; Microsoft can offer to their hundreds of millions of enterprise customers that are working from home.Someone from Microsoft&#39;s networking team needs to read this, and then watch Casey Muratori&#39;s rant about Microsoft&#39;s poor track record with performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dKzubvpKE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very impressive performance:&gt; While performance is quite good right now (~7.5Gbps TX on my small test box),
not a lot of effort has yet been spent on optimizing it&gt; Jonathan Tooker reported to me that, on his system with an Intel AC9560 WiFi card, he gets
~600Mbps without WireGuard, ~600Mbps with wireguard-go/Wintun over Ethernet,
~95Mbps with wireguard-go/Wintun over WiFi, and ~600Mbps with WireGuardNT over
WiFi.Congratulations to Simon and Jason!  Very happy WireGuard user here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Wireguard team are simply brilliant. It&#39;s incredible how they have developed low-level, cross-platform solutions across Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and now Windows.I think they are truly exceptional programmers. It&#39;s hard to think of people who have come anywhere close to such an achievement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now I feel old. I remember vividly running around with my first camera, looking for objects worthy of being photographed. The film cost money, so did developing it into pictures. I really had to weigh the pros and cons of taking a particular picture. And in a class of ~25 kids, I was one of three who owned a camera. Not that it was such a luxury item, but most people weren&#39;t into that.These days, (nearly) everyone carries a camera around all the time, and one that is quite probably much better than the one I had in 1992. They can take dozens, even hundreds of pictures without breaking a sweat, and it does not cost anything.Nostalgia is a very warped mirror. Back then, I did not miss the ability to take dozens of pictures at no cost, because the option did not exist. Was it better? Worse? Neither, I think. But this is the first time I feel old and appreciate it for the history I have lived through. Getting old is weird, but it sure is interesting. (For reference, I&#39;m 40. &#34;That&#39;s not old&#34;, I hear someone say, but I have never been this old before, so for me it&#39;s all new.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I miss more than anything else is having an attention span. Years of abusing social media has left my brain pinballing all over the place. I am a collection of unfinished thoughts. Even as I write this, I can feel my mind needing to latch onto something new."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" The second paragraph is funny to me:&gt; I memorized phone numbers, jotted things down in notebooks, had conversations with taxi drivers, talked to random people at bars, wrote checks, went to the bank, and daydreamed.I did all of these (except the phone number one) in the last week.More than technological advancements or anything else, all of this nostalgia is really just about getting old.&#34;The human civilization peaked when I turned 12 and started declining when I crossed 25. I pity today&#39;s youth.&#34; – every generation ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you look at the history of the Public Broadcasting Act [1] that established the CPB and eventually PBS, it seems clear that it was passed in response to poorly-funded educational programming not being able to compete with high-budget commercial network TV. Its authors wanted to make it easier for smaller, non-commercial entities to produce and distribute high-quality educational content.In that regard, the Internet (aided by inexpensive video gear and editing software) has succeeded far beyond their wildest dreams. The breadth and depth of educational content available just on YouTube is incredible.The same forces that make it easy to produce and distribute educational content also make it easy to produce and distribute misinformation. This is a problem, but&#39;s unclear how a &#34;PBS for the internet&#34; would solve it.For example, if you look at the one concrete piece of legislation mentioned in the article:&gt; The Local Journalism Sustainability Act takes a different approach to the government grant model. The bill would, for example, give a tax credit to people who donate to nonprofit newsrooms, or to small businesses who buy advertising at a nonprofit outlet.It&#39;s not clear to me why people wouldn&#39;t just choose to donate to or buy advertising in outlets that promote whatever form of misinformation or partisan information that suits their tastes.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Act_of_196..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well there is:https://www.pbs.org/video/Also PBS has a great kids games app(s) that are free with games that are fun / no ads.And PBS kids video app is again free, great content, no ads.If you&#39;re in the US and care about that content, I suggest contributing to your local station.  The quality of the content from kids to adult is outstanding.   It&#39;s not usual for me to browse a few streaming services and just end up watching PBS&#39;s content in the end.Maybe when it comes to the article they mean more accessible?  But I&#39;m not sure as they seem to ignore the PBS content available."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would like to note that PBS does actually publish Youtube videos via PBS Digital Studios[0][1]. They have great creators making PBS quality content but in &#34;Youtube&#34; style formats with a wide range of topics (science, popular culture, art, food, news, and music).[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_Digital_Studios

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m not surprised that all statements from the Israeli government are filled with nothing. “We need to understand what happened” means “sorry not sorry”.This spyware is invaluable for the Israeli government because they have something that repressive Arab regimes want. These regimes can’t be bought with money, because some of them like Saudi Arabia and UAE have plenty of money. Israel needs friends and this is a great way to start and maintain friendships - provide a way for these tinpot dictators to cement their power. Sure, some people might be annoyed they were spied on but the news cycle will move on soon, while Saudi and UAE will remain staunch allies. MBS still loves them because Khashoggi remains dead.Israel would have gotten away with it too, if it hadn’t been for the meddling kids at Amnesty International."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A headline in Linux gaming circles that hasn&#39;t hit the wider circuit yet (probably because it hasn&#39;t actually been delivered yet) is that Valve are working with Battleye and EAC to get anti-cheat working on Proton for the release of the steam deck.If this happens it will be, without exaggeration, the greatest thing to ever happen to Linux gaming.I&#39;m not expecting a massive increase overnight, but it should mean that the marketshare will increase more likely than it will decrease."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"i’ve been using linux as my daily driver for just over a year. steam on linux has been great, and proton (wine) has been indispensable. big title games i’ve played with _no_ issues at all:* Cyberpunk 2077 (ok that has issues, but it has the same issues for windows users..)* Dying Light* Titanfall* The Divisionalong with _many_ other indie/small games.honestly the only thing left is titles that include invasive anti-cheat. when that day comes, i don’t know if most of my friends will have any reason to remain on windows.and who could blame them? finally, they won’t need to deal with a company that collects data from them without their knowledge, runs ads in their taskbar, demands they have a useless microsoft account, restarts their machine on a whim for updates, etc.i hate that i’m going to say this out loud, but could 2022 really be the year of linux on the des- why does it feel so wrong to say that? :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to be fair and balanced I&#39;m a hardcore linux user and gamer and I&#39;ve tried gaming on linux and I&#39;ve hit many issues. 365 games on steam and while some windows games work I&#39;ve hit probably just about every possible issue you can hit with other games. Graphical artifacts, freezing, stuttering, and even full OS reboots.Sometimes I read this thread and scratch my head. I get enthusiasm for FOSS, but enthusiasm to the point of delusion? Honestly, Linux is not up to par with windows in terms of running games that are basically designed for windows. Thus the experience compared to windows for these things is definitively inferior."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From my limited understanding this seems really impressive!I immediately associated this to possible disruption in the cement supply chain that&#39;s about to hit Sweden. Cementa, which produces about 75% of Sweden&#39;s cement, will no longer be allow to mine limestone on Gotland. Their permit was due to be renewed but due to the low quality of their environmental impact study the court was unable to determine if the mining might impact the local residents groundwater. So just a week or so ago a Swedish court decided Cementa muts cease mining operations some time in October. And as I said this mine/factory produces 75% of Sweden&#39;s cement. So there are more problems with the current way of producing cement than just CO2.Most probably there will be a limestone/cement void in Sweden that needs to be filled, and I&#39;d rather have you doing it than some new limestone mine. Best of luck to you!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My git productivity hack is `git diff --color-words`. Instead of showing the line-by-line diff, it shows only the words that changed. Especially useful if you have long sentences where only a comma changed or some other typo. With git diff, the two lines are shown, with --color-words, only the changed symbol is highlighted. The option --color-words also works with git show. I even made aliases for them: git cshow and git cdiff.Other than that, I recommend that people learn to use git properly. In my work, I often have problems with people overwriting their commits and trying to handle merge requests of commits where one commit message is &#34;did some updates&#34; and the other commit is &#34;some fixes&#34;. Getting to know git for an hour, may have prevented both issues. But I am biased, since I use git since my bachelor thesis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; with git checkout you can create and switch to the new branch in one command using the -b flag:
git checkout -b new_branch&gt; You can do the same with the new one, but the flag is -c:
git switch -c new_branchIt&#39;s like they had a design meeting where they discussed this and said &#34;so  I propose switch -b newbranch to create and switch to a new branch&#34; and the objection was &#34;nah that would make it consistent with checkout, which is against the project policy&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You don&#39;t need -- as much in the &#34;git restore&#34; example. With git checkout it may be necessary to separate the branch and the paths with &#34;--&#34; but since &#34;git restore&#34; does not take a branch (except with -s), doing this is totally fine    git restore test.txt"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They wouldn&#39;t be the first. An SVP of a major SV company once told me &#34;[my company] doesn&#39;t give a shit about accessibility, and no one in Silicon Valley does.&#34; When I went to the CSUN accessibility conference that year, guess which company&#39;s logo was emblazoned across the lanyards? Yup, their marketing department was happy to write checks that their company had no intention of cashing.Silicon Valley is famous for its &#39;patina of accessibility&#39;: https://medium.com/@nicklum/silicon-valleys-patina-of-access..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks so much for holding Cloudflare accountable for this. It&#39;s upsetting that they had so much input from you leading up to it and now they&#39;re dropping the ball. A lot of accessibility stuff and mission statements just honestly amounts to virtue signalling with companies and sad to see that&#39;s the case with Cloudflare so hope they step up. It shouldn&#39;t have to get to the point where they&#39;re sued but I feel like more often than not that&#39;s the only thing that changes things like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This problem unfortunately applies to a lot of remote access software, particularly when the web browser is the client.I know of one company that switched to Web VNC for accessing a specific piece of software. They had a lot of offices and the software was expensive (paid per machine). This way, they could switch to a much smaller number of licenses, letting any employee connect from anywhere and wait in line if necessary. A blind person has lost a job over this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a CS associate professor. I teach a course which consists in contributing to a free software, in third year at my uni. A few years ago a couple of students decided to make a contribution to GNU ls. The change was to have the output color independent of capitalisation (it is based on filename extension). Their code was accepted. It was a tiny tiny contribution, but it&#39;s probable that these few lines of code are and will be executed a few thousands times more than all other contributions my other students made."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quite a few years ago as a (very) junior FE dev I used mammoth.js to automate the generation of a biennial report. Three months had been earmarked for the task as this is what it had taken in previous years (due to bad tools and lack of expertise). I had it done in less than a week by using mammoth. Mike was also very accommodating with questions I&#39;m pleased I cant remember as I&#39;m sure they were embarrassingly simple.The project still took three months as it was one of those special type of organisations, but it wasn&#39;t due to the HTML generation :)Thank you for mammoth.js!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Companies isolate devs from customers by using Product Managers. PMs interview customers and then decide what to build. By the time the tasks get to the dev it’s hard to understand the motivation and impact. The best companies I’ve worked at put the engineers and customers in close contact so they understood the impact and shortcomings in their work. Alternately you need to foster a culture of shared purpose where you have “faith” that your work has impact."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you think you’re well paid, now is the time to look around. I’ve had a lot of friends, mentees, and coworkers get huge bumps on total compensation even as relatively senior engineers and managers. Pay is jumping and companies aren’t doing a great job keeping that up for their people who have been around for a few years. As an employer, that should be the top worry, keep comp up, don’t lose your people because you’ve become complacent on pay and don’t understand that the market is changing right now"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting corollary is that certain types of business are no longer economically viable. If I have a business that competes with advertising companies for niche talent, my business model has to be able to generate the same outsized returns on that talent if I want to be able to afford them, so this limits the work I can do.I don&#39;t think people should work for below market wages, only observing how it can change what kinds of products and services are available. And in the case of tech talent, salaries are being driven up by a few key industries that arguably are not where society would like to see tech product and r&amp;d investment concentrated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate that the market is so great right now because I really can’t take advantage of it.I would love to start the process, to try and get a salary increase anywhere from 30%-100% but unfortunately I’ve stagnated sharply skills wise. Don’t qualify for the jobs I see I think I’d enjoy, and don’t even qualify for the jobs that meet my salary preferences that I’d otherwise dislike. I also would have to be looking at immediately remote roles which just makes things harder. I also am about 90% I could not perform on interviews at most places. Digging myself out of the aforementioned stagnation and prepping for interviews is likely to take years at this point and who knows what the market will look like at that point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more project management tools I have to work with, the less likely I am to work for or with a company.I have a somewhat similar stance on software architecture. Sure, I’m TOGAF certified but if you actually expect me to work with notation correct Archimare/UML/whatever and not just draw boxes on a napkin you’re either insane or sell a product with no competition.This is anecdotal of course, but after 30 years of working with hundreds of companies to supply our municipality with software, we have yet to see a correlation between quality and “best practices”. It doesn’t matter if companies do this or that testing and use the full confluence suite or if they just pull spaghetti out of their asses and support is a phone call… the quality is the same over time, hell, often we get more from the spaghetti companies than the “best practice” ones. You might think that it’s a short term thing and that the spaghetti and no testing catches up, but it doesn’t. Maybe because we don’t have to fund those 8 people, that you never really learn the role off but it sure isn’t technical, that sit in on every meeting as opposed to talking directly with the spaghetti slinger and a sales person? I’m not sure, and I’d love to tell people that following this or that “best practice” is the way to go, but that’s just not what our data shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still think David Allen nailed it in Getting Things Done. Not the system necessarily, but he nailed the diagnosis of why we fail to get things done: an inability to be honest with ourselves about (1) the full scope and scale of the commitments we make, and (2) just how little time and attention we have at our disposal in meeting those commitments.Really, it’s the same sort of problem that is described in The Goal and The Phoenix Project, but on a personal level. Calendar timeboxing feels like a solution that actually addresses the real problem, although it is challenging to implement for people who are low in conscientiousness (or have ADHD)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. When we die, we will still have a giant todo list, and that’s OK. That doesn’t mean we haven’t done things, it just means the list didn’t capture the entirety of our desires and goals.Maybe the point of writing them down is mostly reflective; to contextualize them as much as possible and do the ones that we find most important by some unconscious heuristic. That means there will always be uncompleted things.Also we have to see when we itemize things to do, we also objectify ourselves as a doer of those things. Which is OK for making things graspable, but ultimately we are not mere doer of things, we are humans in an existential context.Maybe it is a good thing that we left todo items unchecked, maybe that is our protest against being reduced too much, maybe that procrastination is an attempt at gaining our humanity back, maybe that resistive Netflix binge has some unconscious meaning that needs to be honored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not under an illusion that it does any good, but I swore off all Blizzard products after the Blitzchung incident. It doesn&#39;t feel right giving money to a company that would side with the CCP over human rights in Hong Kong. I&#39;d previously played Hearthstone and Overwatch, and I&#39;d been a Blizzard fan since the original Warcraft. That happy company is dead, and something ugly is animating its corpse.I think company founders are often great, idealistic people. People who genuinely want to make the world better.When they step aside, however, the people who take over after them tend to be terrifying: zero empathy creatures who favor profit maximization over any and all human cost. Does anyone know why this happens?"</p>

Some of my veteran WoW friends returned with the release of classic and TBC classic, but no one stayed for long.

He blamed the players for Blizzard internal problem. this whole mess is Blizzard&#39;s own problem and he is dragging the players into it.he should just say due to internal problem. the patch for WOW 9.2 will be delay and leave it.Blizzard have been going down hill for awhile. They treat their players like cash cow and try to milk them anyway that they can.players = paying customers. if you can&#39;t cook the burger that a customer already pay for. your paying customer will leave. its simple as that.bottom line: Blizzard treat their employees and customers like shit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This problem won&#39;t get fixed without legislation.  Single use plastic is cheaper, so of course companies will use that if they can.  Most people don&#39;t have the income to support &#34;voting with their wallet&#34;, and even those who do don&#39;t always have the option.  IF the best solution out there happens to use single use plastic, you&#39;re not going to opt for a worse solution just because it doesn&#39;t.And even if one company cares enough to do something, they will change their tune when they have to start charing more.The only way this will get better is if the external costs of single use plastic are borne by the companies that make them and consumers are subsidized to absorb the extra cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pre pandemic, I&#39;d go often to trader joe, and they would give samples.  It was maybe a small bite of a food (ice cream, salat, or whatever else), and use a plastic fork for it.Just one bite, and you had to throw it out. It was more plastic than food.  Whole Foods was the same.  I think it is a crime against environment and I started feeling bad about it, and stopped taking samples when there were plastic utensils.It think behaviour like this should be legislated out.  For something like a sample, just a small wooden  spoon, or anything else renewable, should be enough.The externalities of that plastic, is something that neither Trader Joe or Whole Foods pays, but we all do in some way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The pioneering 2015 study of marine plastic didn’t include illegal dumping and export of plastic waste. In the new analysis, the team considered those actions, but only for the U.S. They say data for other nations were inconsistent or didn’t exist.&#34;Doesn&#39;t this seem like it&#39;s saying illegal + legal plastic waste in the US is greater than legal plastic waste in other countries?  That seems like a much different claim to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I’m always curious about is why we are so concerned with plastic waste.My local grocery store recently switched to paper bags. So I got curious. Turns out you have to re-use a paper bag 43 times for the energy use to be the same as plastic grocery bags. This is impossible since they are made of paper. Aluminum and glass bottles require several hundred times more energy to produce as well (between 170-250x).Then when you look at plastic pollution and see that for the most part North America is quite good at properly disposing of plastic you wonder why we are so obsessed with this as a problem.Plastic waste really isn’t a big problem unless you’re talking about developing nations. North America is responsible for about 3% of mismanaged plastic waste. Asia and Africa account for 86% of it.Don’t get me started on plastic straws. They make up 0.03% of plastic waste in the ocean.If we want to make a difference here we should be helping developing nations to better manage their plastic waste so that it doesn’t end up in waterways.The Yangtze and Ganges are releasing plastic into the ocean at a rate far greater than all of North America combined, and our response is to expend huge amounts of energy produced by fossil fuels trying to recycle our plastic instead of burying it in a landfill where it is unlikely to pose a major ecological threat.Like many environmental initiatives I worry that we’re more concerned about making ourselves feel better than actually solving the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was thinking these days, that when I was a kid some 20 years ago, people were all the rage against paper, because you had to cut trees and whatnot, everything was switching to plastic so you could &#34;save the trees&#34;I still wonder what that was about, all it did was screw the paper companies that had their own private forests, and cause the stupid plastic patch on the pacific ocean, and now everyone has to switch BACK to paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Pressure is also building for “polluter-pays” laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation… The American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy.This is the kind of solution that seems to appeal to HN and appeals to me personally. It’s a system-wide incentives problem. So just change the incentives and price in the externality, right? Same goes for carbon taxes. I hope these kinds of laws catch on."</p>

I’ve been casually looking around for some sort of NAS solution that would be compatible with older versions of Mac OS, but with native scp I can just download files from a Linux box (perhaps a dedicated Raspberry Pi) and skip right to the fun part: exploring all of the weird, cool and charming software and games from this era.

I disagree. A lot of the &#34;fluff,&#34; as the author describes it, is excess capital finding its way to things people find pleasurable, whether it be dope, travel, beauty, or rock and roll.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The ultimate tool for corporations to sustain a culture of this sort is to develop the 40-hour workweek as the normal lifestyle. Under these working conditions people have to build a life in the evenings and on weekends.I slightly disagree with this point. The 40 hour work week is a rather recent development; in the past, people had to work a lot longer with no or only one day of. The trend actually goes in the direction of reducing it further (at least here in Germany), where 35 or 32 hour weeks are getting more common (depending on the job, of course). Plus, there are alternative models, such as 4x 10h days + 3 days off.Sure, the current model serves corporations, but it is by no means their invention. And while they are a big part of why it still is so large, the reason is most likely that they need the labor hours, not the specific consumption behavior."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About a decade ago, I implemented the Causal Tree CRDT (aka RGA, Timestamped Insertion Tree) in regular expressions using a Unicode string as a storage. Later we made a collaborative editor for Yandex based on that code.
It used many of the tricks as described in the text, even the optimization where you remember the last insertion point. So I am terribly glad it all gets rediscovered.The code is on GitHub [1] There is also an article which might be a tough reading, so no link.
Recently I greatly improved CTs by introducing the Chronofold data structure [2].
Regarding that benchmark article, I spent many years in academia, so the quality of content problem is familiar to me. In other words, I don&#39;t take such articles seriously.
CRDTs are fast enough, that is not a concern.[1]: https://github.com/gritzko/citrea-model[2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09511"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a meta-level, does anyone else think that the whole idea of writing a peer reviewed paper that is just a benchmark of different algorithms should be really rigorously reviewed before being accepted? Writing good benchmarks is hard, and so highly contextual that writing fair comparisons beteen algorithms (or data structures) is almost impossible unless you&#39;re an expert in all of the algorithms involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the way, as someone who has published academic papers, if you&#39;re ever bothered about a paper or have some comments, don&#39;t hesitate to mail the authors. (Their e-mail addresses are always on the paper; especially target the first author because they have normally done the work.) We are happy to hear when someone has read our work and I at least would&#39;ve liked to have known if someone found a problem with my papers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s one lovely trick.If I may suggest one thing... instead of range requests on a single huge file how about splitting the file in 1-page fragments in separate files and fetching them individually? This buys you caching (e.g. on CDNs) and compression (that you could also perform ahead of time), both things that are somewhat tricky with a single giant file and range requests.With the reduction in size you get from compression, you can also use larger pages almost for free, potentially further decreasing the number of roundtrips.There&#39;s also a bunch of other things that could be tried later, like using a custom dictionary for compressing the individual pages."</p>

This, and Display Stream Compression are two.Just as high refresh and HDR were becoming really mainstream, Big Sur completely broke what was working flawlessly in Catalina (and it has not been fixed as of either 11.5, or the Monterey betas so far - and by completely broke, I mean does not work, at all, for anybody, not just &#39;some edge case&#39;).With Catalina, my Mac Pro happily drove 2 27&#34; 4K monitors in 10 bit color at 144Hz.With Big Sur? I can run those same screens at 60Hz 10 bit, or 95Hz 8 bit.I guess I just need to get a Pro Display XDR..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great write-up and a fun read.I was caught off guard by this note:&gt; the delivery guy called me about a laptop: the custom configured M1 MacBook Pro that costed as much as 7 junior developer monthly salaries has arrived!I tried the MacBook Pro configurator and could only get up to $2300 USD (excluding optional software like Logic Pro). I’m sure the price and taxation are higher in the author’s country, but I still don’t understand how that could cost the equivalent of 7 months of junior developer salary anywhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t used Lunar (https://lunar.fyi/), the app the author built, but it looks fantastic! Clearly great effort has been put into it!I really appreciate this class of application that exposes more hardware functionality to the end user. Flux (which may or may not be a direct competitor) is another great example, as is Halide, the pro camera app for iPhones. They&#39;re certainly not flashy, but they can be great quality-of-life improvements.And they&#39;re difficult to write! They require using APIs that are often woefully under-documented, and terribly difficult to debug. I wanted to write an app that would slowly lower your device&#39;s volume over time (so you could raise the volume for a song that you like, but then not accidentally spend the next 30 minutes with the volume super loud), and even doing simple things like listing audio devices and getting their names was endlessly frustrating."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Folks might find the author’s research paper [1] while at Harvard more informative. This is a great high-level description, but if you want more detail, I recommend the paper.[1] https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3315508.3329973"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A toy illustrative example, summing two arrays:  CUDA
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
    i += 1

  Triton
    c[i:i+16] = a[i:i+16] + b[i:i+16]
    i += 16

The 16 in this example is the &#34;block size&#34;, and could be anything. But this notion of expressing computation over blocks of dense data seems to be the big difference from other approaches.A very exciting result of the incredible performance that Triton achieves, is the ability to fuse NN operations such as Matrix Multiply + LeakyReLU + Batch Norm. Previously, you needed to rely on cuBLAS for fast hand-written Matrix Multiply kernels, and then your LeakyReLU would need to read that result out of memory, and then your Batch Norm would read the LeakyReLU out of memory again.The ability to write very fast kernels, and especially being able to fuse them together, to avoid unnecessary memory round-trips is a big deal!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was a cryptologic linguist for the army and went through a 16 month course of 6-7 hours of classroom instruction per day M-F, native speaking instructors, tons of immersion, and a couple hours of homework each night and left still feeling like I hardly knew the language that I was supposed to be interpreting. Unless your major in college is a specific language, you probably won&#39;t achieve any sort of fluency in your target language from taking a course in it, either.Language learning is hard and a multifaceted thing that no single application is going to adequately prepare you for. Speaking and listening are related skills yet speaking is much harder than listening, and both are much harder than reading (for the vast majority of languages). Rote memorization is necessary. Immersion is necessary. Comprehensible input is necessary.Language learning apps like Duolingo sell the idea of learning a language which is an extremely attractive idea to a lot of people. They also make it a fun activity and incentivize engagement with humor and gamification. The problem is that you can&#39;t possibly become fluent in a language with an app like it and there isn&#39;t any single app that will.I suppose in the end Duolingo&#39;s valuation is more a reflection of people&#39;s desire to learn a language rather than people actually learning a language, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly from using duolingo pretty heavily for a couple of years, attending language classes and doing my own individual study I&#39;ve found duolingo pretty useless. It&#39;s &#34;fun&#34; and gives one the sense of progress without really accomplishing much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick look at financials, they lost $25M in trailing 12 months, lost $14M in the previous year, lost $10M in the year before.How is Duolingo supposed to become profitable?How is a $6.5B valuation justified?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I am an AI skeptic. I am baffled by anyone who isn’t. I don’t see any path from continuous improvements to the (admittedly impressive) ‘machine learning’ field that leads to a general AI- I share the skepticism towards any progress towards &#39;general AI&#39; - I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re remotely close or even on the right path in any way.- That doesn&#39;t make me a skeptic towards the current state of machine learning though. ML doesn&#39;t need to lead to general AI. It&#39;s already useful in its current forms. That&#39;s good enough. It doesn&#39;t need to solve all of humanity&#39;s problems to be a great tool.I think it&#39;s important to make this distinction and for some reason it&#39;s left implicit or it&#39;s purposefully omitted from the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a confused and muddled post, trying to touch on psychology, philosophy, and mathematics, and missing the mark on basically all three. I&#39;m quite bearish on AI/ML, but calling it a &#34;parlor trick&#34; is like calling modern computers a parlor trick. I mean, at the end of the day, they&#39;re just very fast abacuses, right? Let&#39;s face it: what ML has brought to the forefront -- from self-landing airplanes to self-driving cars, to AI-assisted diagnoses -- is pretty impressive. If you insist on being reductive, sure, I guess it&#39;s &#34;merely&#34; statistics.Bringing up quantitative vs qualitative analysis is just silly, since science has had this problem way before AI. Hume famously described it as the is/ought problem†. And that was a few hundred years ago.Finally, dropping the mic with &#34;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re anywhere close to consciousness&#34; is just bizarre. I don&#39;t think that any serious academic working in AI/ML has made any arguments that claim machine learning models are &#34;conscious.&#34; And Strong AI will probably remain unattainable for a very long time (I&#39;d argue forever). This is not a particularly controversial position.† Okay, it&#39;s not the same thing, but closely related. I suppose the fact–value distinction might be a bit closer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What baffles me is the number of humans who think they are in the personal possession of some super special sacred form of magical and unexplainable intelligence. &#34;AI is just stats&#34; yes, indeed, but so is human intelligence. In many ways, AI from 2010 was already better than human intelligence.Three remarks:- The task many people seem to be benchmarking against is not just a measure of general intelligence, but a measure of how well AI is able to emulate human intelligence. That&#39;s not wrong, but I do find it amusing. Emulating any system within another generally requires an order of magnitude higher performance.- The degree to which human intelligence fails catastrophically in each of our lives, on a continuous basis, is way too quickly forgotten. We have a very selective memory indeed. We have absolutely terrible judgment, are super irrational, and pretty reliably make decisions that are against our own interests, whether it&#39;s with regard to tobacco use, avoidance of physical exercise, or refusal of life-saving medications or prophylactics. We avoid spending time learning maths and science because it&#39;s not cool, and we openly display pride in our anti-intellectual behaviours and attitudes. We&#39;re all incredibly stupid by default.- AI researchers need to work more closely with neuroanatomists. The main thing preventing AI from behaving like a human is the different macro structure of human NNs vs artificial NNs. Our brains aren&#39;t random assortments of randomly connected neurons: there&#39;s structure in there that explains our patterns of behaviour, and that is lacking in even the most modern AI. We can&#39;t expect AI to be human if we don&#39;t give it human structures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are also fans:
For our everyday workhorse typeface, we exchanged Roboto for Inter. Roboto is a little bit narrow, and it turns out that Inter was developed by a Swede living in San Francisco, Rasmus Andersson, as a solution to a bunch of limitations he found with Roboto. It looked good and it was widely available free of charge. Tack själv, Rasmus!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have contacted local authorities twice about anti competitive behavior from Chrome.If two - three other Norwegians do the same that should start to look like an earthquake ;-)Same if ten - twenty Germans or Brits or French do the same.I would mention:1. that some of their web properties (calendar and YouTube) have been intentionally incompatible with Firefox as evidenced by how well they work in Firefox if one changes how the browser identify itself.2. How they have pushed Chrome as a &#34;better browser&#34; on the front page of Google (were no one else have been allowed to advertise) to Firefox users since way before Chrome was anywere nearly as good as Firefox, making it both a lie and - more importantly - a massive abuse of dominance in one market to gain monopoly in another just like Microsoft did with IE.As we saw yesterday with AWS authorities are willing to punish rampant abuse if they have a good case and this definitely is one.Edit: since this comment is getting a lot of attention the relevant authority in Norway is Konkurransetilsynet with web address https://konkurransetilsynet.no(Finding the exact correct form on that site and for this purpose seems to be an art and/or science it seems but if you can&#39;t find any just submit somewhere and explain the situation.)It would be beautiful if everyone could post underneath with the address to the equivalent office in your jurisdiction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Firefox daily for over 15 years now.My experience with Firefox over the last 2-3 years in particular leaves me very disappointed and frustrated.The constant nonsense UI redesigns that come about with every new update. The instability, and ridiculous resources consumption. The slowness and slugishness.I want a browser that works, respects my privacy, stays out of my way and lets me get shit done. A browser built for professionals, by professionals. I want a consistent UI that remains stable over time. I&#39;m easily willing to pay for such a browser.Firefox used to be it, but I no longer feel like it is. Any suggestions for what to try next?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s honestly a pity. Firefox is it perfect but the Internet is becoming worse because of chrome. Google is able to fast track any non standard Web tech and the hordes follow. Soon after, that become the standard. I don&#39;t want to  cheer for a broken browser, but only Safari is able to stop this madness now.Also, Firefox on the Desktop is really good and still let&#39;s you do so much more than chrome clones. But it suffers specially when using Google websites."</p>
