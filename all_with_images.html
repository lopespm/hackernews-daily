								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So there&#39;s two options right - the first is that Parag is for some reason making big strategic decisions about the direction of the company despite the fact that we all know he&#39;ll be gone if the deal closes. Or he&#39;s making big strategic changes at the behest of the acquirers before the deal closes.Neither of these things seem particularly kosher moves to make. The question is how to figure out which one it is.It would seem weird for Parag to be following Musk&#39;s orders given how Musk has behaved. It also seems weird for Musk to already have the insight into the company to know specifically who to fire. There&#39;s not much advantage to making these changes now.On the other hand, going rogue and making big strategic decisions about the company really has the potential to burn Parag&#39;s reputation for wherever he would move next.I guess there&#39;s a third option - that Musk has expressed a specific view, Parag has a different view, but that they both think that this move is necessary anyway so just got on and did it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Twitter since it&#39;s main novelty was that it was a successful Ruby on Rails app, and honestly I&#39;ve been trying to figure out where the exit is for my personal use of Twitter lately. If the acquisition goes through, Twitter won&#39;t make enough money to service it&#39;s debt, and the things they will do to fix that are pretty much guaranteed to lower the quality of the platform, which frankly has never worked very well for me anyways. The fact that they&#39;re doing a leadership purge right now is not helping my opinion on this.I also think the proposal to have Twitter allow all content that is &#34;legal under US law&#34; is a dangerous idea for the platform being a healthy community that most people actually want to participate in. Content moderation debates have never been so ham-fisted as they are online so I won&#39;t try here, suffice to say there&#39;s some pretty horrible, disgusting things that are &#34;legal under US law&#34; (and as a content moderator, I&#39;ve seen them all). If Twitter allows people to do them, it will make it difficult for Twitter to maintain a healthy community, and the platform could quickly devolve into a scarychan-style sewer that only the craziest people on the internet will want to dwell in. To say nothing about whether advertisers will tolerate some of it, or even Apple&#39;s app store."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was some discussion on plausible NATO membership of Finland and Sweden. At that point the disucssion was based on guestimates from media.But now it&#39;s official. This is not the NATO membership application, but a statement from the political leadership in Finland that they support and suggest parliament proceeds with the application process with maximum urgency.The President and Prime Minister of Finland have published their position on NATO membership. This more or less seals Finland joining NATO.In Finnish system, the Prime Minister has most political power but president is the head of foreign policy. Their common statement was the required signal for the parliament to proceed with the process.Translation:
During the spring, there has been an important discussion about Finland&#39;s possible NATO membership. Time has been needed for domestic position formation both in Parliament and in society as a whole. Time has been needed for close international contacts with both NATO and its member countries, as well as with Sweden. We have wanted to give the debate the space it needs.Now that the time for decision-making is approaching, we also state our own common positions for the information of parliamentary groups and parties. NATO membership would strengthen Finland&#39;s security. As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance. Finland must apply for NATO membership as a matter of urgency. We hope that the national steps still needed to reach this solution will be taken swiftly in the coming days.Sauli Niinistö

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fact that they&#39;ve been minting billions of tether without collateral should make it abundantly obvious that this isn&#39;t a stablecoin and never had been. Anyone can pretend to have a peg in the good times, that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s really a peg or that the peg will remain in bad times. And if you can&#39;t count on the peg in bad times, it&#39;s not a stablecoin. If you&#39;ve been honestly working on the assumption that it is, then you deserve to lose your (real) money to some crypto VCs on an island somewhere.And this doesn&#39;t only apply to crypto, look at how many countries with currency pegs can maintain that when their economy turns down, and then look at how many people actually seek to own the currency at that point rather than a currency backed by something (like a gigantic economy)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that I think some people miss about Tether is that it&#39;s not about whether it is backed enough it&#39;s either fully backed or it isn&#39;t. If it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not a question of whether it&#39;s back enough to weather this storm, it&#39;s about whether the people running it think they can weather this storm. If they think they can keep it running they&#39;ll sell whatever backing they have and keep the peg. But if they even think there&#39;s a decent chance they can&#39;t permanently sustain the peg then the best thing for them to do is take the backing and run, not sink it into a stable-coin they now know isn&#39;t going to work. That&#39;s going to happen way before they run out of money.Let&#39;s say for example, Tether is 20% backed and there&#39;s $100Bn  of coins so the backing is $20Bn, and people start flooding out of it. Let&#39;s say $10Bn floods out. So the guys running it have handed out $10Bn. They now have $10Bn left, and money is still flooding out. Do they really continue to hand over the cash or do they say &#34;Well, the whole thing is about to explode anyway, I&#39;d rather keep the $10Bn cash I&#39;ve got left&#34;. At which point the holders of the coin have to play &#34;Find these fuckers and sue them&#34; which will be difficult since they&#39;ve got $10Bn to fight/flee/hide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The entire concept of a &#34;stablecoin&#34; reminds me a lot of something from SIGBOVIK 2014. Keep in mind, this was written in 2014, before any stablecoins actually existed, and that SIGBOVIK is supposed to be a joke conference where people present extremely silly ideas as if they were real breakthroughs.&gt;  DollarCoin: We propose skipping the middleman and providing direct proof-of-dollar with a blockchain that consists of videos of burning US $1 notes. Each video will be unique as the hash of every block header is required to be written on the dollar bill to be burnt; the block header includes the previous block’s hash, which means that each block is forced to build on every previous block, forming a valid blockchainhttp://sigbovik.org/2014/proceedings.pdfThe fact is, people have convinced themselves that this is somehow a good idea. And then half the time, the person behind it doesn&#39;t actually burn any money and just arbitrarily mints coins. It&#39;s absolute lunacy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those wondering if we could get sharper images with JWST, here’s the previously imaged black hole (same angular size as our own) compared to a single pixel from Hubble’s wide field camera 3:https://twitter.com/alex_parker/status/1116070667068170240?s...JWST will have smaller “pixels” but is in the same ballpark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am very skeptical of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images because they are not following a scientific method that results in a true representative image of their target. In my opinion astronomy is jumping the shark with these images by making this a big PR stunt.I&#39;ve looked at their methods for their earlier images and they seem to be hunting for a circle that looks like a black hole in their data. The EHT&#39;s full imaging stack has never been calibrated by looking at a known celestial body to compare images to validate their algorithms. They have calibrated their signals from results of other instruments, but their imaging algorithms change to fit their wanted results. This is my biggest problem with their approach. Anyone can modify algorithms of any arbitrary data to get an image of a glowing circle. A better method that shows a more true image would be to calibrate their imaging algorithms against a known celestial body to make sure their techniques produced comparable results from other instruments. Then they should have taken their calibrated imaging algorithms and gave it data from their target.I&#39;d have more confidence in the EHT if they would not change their imaging algorithms across images and give a side-by-side comparison of a known celestial body that other radio telescopes have imaged to verify their whole imaging stack.To me this a just a big PR stunt and I&#39;m very skeptical of their image."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am impressed.I have a few ignorant questions:1. There are three bright blobs on the image; I assume they are the same object, behind the BH. What are they/is it? They said the image was averaged; so presumably whatever the blobs are wasn&#39;t moving?2. Is it correct that the rest of the ring, ignoring the three blobs, is the far side of the accretion disk? Why can&#39;t I see this side of the accretion disk?3. According to the article, at least one submillimeter telescope was important. But submillimeter is infrared, isn&#39;t it? I thought infrared was blocked by dust, and if there&#39;s one thing there&#39;s a lot of at the centre of the galaxy, it&#39;s dust?[Edit] Questions 1 and two were prompted by this remark in the article:  &#34;The new view captures light bent by the powerful gravity of the black hole&#34;

The only &#34;light&#34; I can see is a ring with blobs in it; that&#39;s why I suppose the ring in the image is not the accretion disk, at least, not as viewed from the pole. Most other commenters here assume (or know) that it is the accretion disk, and we are looking at a pole.But if that is indeed the accretion disk, then that isn&#39;t light that&#39;s been bent by the gravity of the black hole.Perhaps the explanation is that many other commenters haven&#39;t actually read the article, possibly because they already know the story."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s scary, because CSAM (child sexual abuse material) is very, very broad, and quite vague in its definition¹. My three year old son stayed with my parents for a week, and he was being taught to swim in their swimming pool. Of course, I get sent pictures and clips of his progress by a proud grandma, and of course, him being a toddler, he felt swimming trunks to be completely optional (and of course, they are at his age in a private pool).That&#39;s not CSAM right? But who knows how the AI will mark those happy pics? Some quirk in its programming and training leading to them being pushed way up whatever ranking is used? It&#39;s a nude child after all, and that is most likely one of the few things such an algorithm can detect quite reliably.The automated filter won&#39;t care about the context though, and if any of the recent failures of algorithms ruining peoples lives are anything to go by (the Dutch Toeslagenaffaire comes to mind), being flagged by the CSAM filter is a high risk event — even if you can clear your name later by human intervention — because now you are on a list.1: People tend to conjure up horrific images of underage children getting raped by adults when they hear &#39;CSAM&#39; or &#39;child pornography&#39;, but when you read up on the legal definitions used it becomes very vague, quite fast. A seventeen year old boy sending a dick pic to his 18 year old lover is producing child pornography and can in many jurisdictions be sentenced as such, and nudism of any minor can be seen as CSAM if the pose they strike can be construed as &#39;erotic&#39; — yet there is no clear definition of what this means, falling squarely into “I&#39;ll know it when I see it” territory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this proposal is quite enough, we can do better to protect the children.The homes of the people who champion this proposal should be thoroughly searched for child abuse materials every week. Naturally, their personal electronic devices should be taken for analysis. I understand this may cause them some inconvenience, but think of the children!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The worst thing is that, while the EU proposes dubious stuff like this, the police doesn&#39;t actually try to remove such content from the internet or are at least really ineffective at doing so. There was a documentary[1] from the german public tv station NDR in which reporters / journalists managed to delete the majority of content from one such CSAM forum, by sending deletion requests to the hosters. The police just... did nothing about it? :/It&#39;s mind boggling. It would be nice if only 50% of the energy put into laws with questionable results like this, would be used to give victims of sexual child abuse more help and support (or, in many cases, some at all) to continue living as much as possible despite the monsters in their own heads that such sexual abuse creates, wouldn&#39;t it? :/[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iItLpwkQMUQ

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s less that I&#39;m glad the market is crashing, and more that I&#39;m glad that the insufferable crypto bros are finally getting a punch to the mouth. Seriously, these people are the worst. Your average &#34;crypto investor&#34; has no skills, no mathematical foundations, nothing. Except for pure stupid luck, and the ability to spew inane crypto babble 24/7. And yes, they think they are much smarter than you, because they achieved better financial results than you did while only doing 1/1000 of the work to get there. I truly hate the fact that these people are so rich. It makes me want to move to Alaska and just try to ignore society for the rest of my days.This came off as pretty bitter. I apologize, but I am bitter, and I&#39;m having a shit couple weeks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel bad for people losing money, but crypto has not lived up to its potential at all, remains a solution looking for a problem, and is an environmental disaster.I used to be a huge believer. Brian Armstrong gave me my first Bitcoin in 2011 at District in SOMA. Electricity was included in my rent so I bought 10 video cards and mined for about two years on 5 systems. At a company I founded, I use Bitcoin to pay for food and drinks. According to the Barista, I was the first person to ever pay for coffee with Bitcoin at Coupa Cafe (despite having to stand there and wait 10 minutes while the transaction cleared).But nothing has come of it. All the years of promises and applications, nothing. Ether DApps, sure, but how much of the modern internet runs on those? I also mined StorJ and Monero for years. Apart from a way of making money and storing value, crypto is useless. Processing fees are way too high to even be considered as a replacement for payments not to mention other barriers such as the ability to integrate with antiquated point of sale systems entirely designed around credit/debit and cash.So I put all of my holdings into a retirement account and don&#39;t worry about the price. But I&#39;ve given up on crypto and everyone who babbles on endlessly like they know something I don&#39;t about how it&#39;s going to change the world. So even if Crypto loses its value some, I&#39;m glad because the lack of easy, effortless gains will disappear for a lot of those people and most of these short term hucksters will fade away. I&#39;ll gladly exchange crypto&#39;s price for less crypto bros. My cost basis is around $150 so I have a long ways to go before I care that much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a Macro crash. SP500 is down -%5 YTD. Meta -37%, Netflix -65%. Lots of pain spreading. You shouldn&#39;t gloat or be happy. Give it a couple of more months like this, and lots of the HN audience would be worried about layoffs.The security of your average software developer job is strongly tied to market cycles.If you want a place to direct your hate and bitterness, I would do it at the architects of the BOOM/BUSTS cycles that keeps happenings and destroys people lives."</p>

I&#39;d done it for our institution, but it was sort of straightforward to generalize it to any institution for which this would be applicable. The code was... awful. Rather than doing it &#34;properly,&#34; since I already had all the code I had written to do the analysis for my institution, I literally just ran it on the entire data set (10GB or so) for every organization that existed and then just put some result file on S3. My &#34;site&#34; would just let folks search for their institution, and present the data with a couple graphs, some nice visuals, and have them print it out. I was ashamed of it in a technical sense.But I just bought a domain and tweeted at a journalist. Whelp, two weeks later, I had my picture in the city&#39;s biggest paper, my org got some positive press, did a service for other non-profits, had folks reaching out to me about jobs, etc. It took SO LITTLE effort, and every instinct I had was that it was bad and I shouldn&#39;t publish it. But the reality is I had already done 95% of the work... committing to just do the extra 5% was so hard to do, but in hindsight, so obviously amazing ROI, even if it hadn&#39;t gotten the attention it did.Secondly, I built a reading app for a teacher at my school to let him do an activity where kids would jumble up sentences and paragraphs in order to help them understand transition words. The only reason I agree to try to do this was that I was learning React at the time and wanted to play with the React drag and drop library. After a weekend, I had it essentially working, and it was a success in his classroom. And here, too, it was to be the end of it... but I pushed myself through it, added a simple login mechanic, user account, etc. I had a small technical question as I was wrapping up, and I posted it on reddit. Someone who worked at a nonprofit mentioned to me that the app could potentially qualify for a grant that the Verizon foundation was running for learning apps. I applied... and we got it. The money award helped pay for my entire grad school tuition.Really... just ship it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A big fallacy that I always see - and that is implied by this post - is that the work ends after shipping, a.k.a. &#34;build it and they will come&#34;. That doesn&#39;t happen any more. So after you &#34;ship&#34; it, you need to promote it, advertise it, create buzz around it and make people use it. 
And that is a totally different kind of beast than coding something.But on the flip side, if you develop a side project just for yourself, you most certainly learn something. Heck, the author explicitly mentioned learning React Native, which is absolutely great and definitely worth investing time into.Learning things is valuable in itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tone of this post suggests that if the author simply just shipped, they would be as successful as the competitor.Building successful products is not a matter of “shipping” but also promoting, selling, continually improving, studying user behaviors, providing customer support and engaging potential customers.Given that the author wasn’t even motivated enough to ship when all these other tasks weren’t even applicable yet, I can’t imagine they would be motivated to do all the work after shipping.Frankly, this is a good thing. I’ve never been more stressed than when I’ve managed to ship a product, picked up a tiny number of paying customers, and subsequently realized that many hundreds of more hours would have to be poured into the product to make it truly useful.You slowly start working on it, customers are upset and start churning, and you’re constantly questioning whether it’s worth it anymore to keep pushing.The most success I’ve ever had was building something I personally thought is fun and interesting with 0 expectations of money or profit, customers be damned.I’m building https://mintables.club right now, sometimes I pick it up for a few hours on a weekend, often I ignore it for weeks, but I visit it all the time because I love the artwork people upload. There’s tons of competitors that do similar things, even before I started it, but I couldn’t care less."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I noticed this too when I used steam to stream a game to my laptop over good wifi. Every minute it would stutter for a second. I set up iperf3 tests and noticed the wifi lag increasing every minute between my macbook and my server and between my windows desktop pc and my server (when connected over wifi). Of course no lag when using cables, so I reasoned it was wifi related, and had noting to do with my setup (I used different clients, and different AP&#39;s). I then took my macbook (only portable computer I had) it too a nearby coffee shop with good wifi and I could still measure lag spikes every minute. So then I was really puzzled, was there some rogue device interfering with wifi all over the neighborhood? Finally I found a suggestion to turn off location services (or whatever it is called), and the spikes disappeared. And I learnt that even when it is not used (not sure it the lid was closed) a macbook can cause significant interference to the wifi for all other nearby devices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is normal across all wifi clients; they can&#39;t scan for networks and transfer data simultaneously so there will always be increased latency during that event. You can test this yourself by doing a low-interval ping and clicking the wifi icon to show you nearby networks - you&#39;ll notice a brief latency spike.I agree that it&#39;s not a good default to have an app doing this, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m on Wi-Fi on my MacBook (Pro 16&#34; 2021). I opened Maps.app (which gets my location correctly), started pinging my router, it&#39;s been a few minutes...No spike. It must be occuring at some corner case, not for everyone."</p>

Unfortunately it suffered from a lot of spam and things like getting linked to very NSFW subreddits, and we didn&#39;t have the manpower to fix it or curate it, so the feature died."</p>

Right now though there&#39;s no commitment for any sort of stable userland ABI, and that makes that difficult (moving to a new driver version may break interfaces that nouveau uses)The press release does say that they have plans to figure out a more upstream friendly approach in the long term, which is great - and what has been released will undoubtedly help development of the existing nouveau codebase."</p>

And they aren’t SPIC insured in the situations where crypto is a security.It’s funny to see people shocked (SHOCKED!) when crypto doesn’t have the protections of regular banking and investments. That’s why you don’t invest with stuff that isn’t insured. Those aren’t real rates, they are risk adjusted rates for not having insurance.It’s fine to invest in these products, but scary because people aren’t doing due diligence and have unrealistic expectations.The CEO’s statement that they won’t go bankrupt it just comical. Of course he thinks they won’t. Few bank CEOs think that. But real banks and brokerages have insurance for their customers in the rare situation that they go bankrupt."</p>

And for the product where it most matters.I&#39;m guessing this is a single master database with multiple read replicas. That means it&#39;s not consistent anymore (the C in ACID). Obviously reads after a write will see stale data until the write propogates.I&#39;m a bit curious how that replication works. Ship the whole db? Binary diffs of the master? Ship the SQL statements that did the write and reapply them? Lots of performance and other tradeoffs here.What&#39;s the latency like? This likely doesn&#39;t run in every edge location. Does the database ship out on the first request. Get cached with an expiry? Does the request itself move to the database instead of running at the edge - like maybe this runs on a select subset of locations?So many questions, but no details yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this looks potentially very interesting. Since this is sort of fresh in my mind from the recent Fly post about it:* How exactly is the read replication implemented? Is it using litestream behind the scenes to stream the WAL somewhere? How do the readers keep up? Last I saw you just had to poll it, but that could be computationally expensive depending on the size of the data (since I thought you had to download the whole DB), and could potentially introduce a bit of latency in propagation. Any idea what the metrics are for latency in propagation?* How are writes handled? Does it do the Fly thing about sending all requests to one worker?I don&#39;t quite know what a &#34;worker&#34; is but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s kind of like a Lambda? If you have it replicated around the world, is that one worker all running the same code, and Cloudflare somehow manages the SQL replicating and write forwarding? Or would those all be separate workers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once sent out a proposal on the FreeBSD lists to merge /sbin with /bin, and /usr/sbin with /usr/bin. People were concerned that this would slow down the system, due to PATH lookups taking longer. Even when I demonstrated the opposite was true (it being faster due to fewer directories needing to be scanned), I wasn&#39;t able to get consensus. What a shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read this explanation a couple of times, and if you go all the way back to PDP-11 the split does indeed sound ridiculous. I had my first contact with Linux from some magazine CDs in the late 90s, I think it was Red Hat or SUSE based. The documentation there had a much clearer explaination:/sbin, /usr/sbin is for binaries that need root. You put them in separate directories so their permissions all match up, and so they don&#39;t show up when completing in bash.The paths without /usr - /bin and /sbin - are available from the get go. It is the very first partition that is mounted, and what is guaranteed to be available if you do &#34;init 1&#34; or boot in single user mode. You can also do fsck from there (assuming the boot partition is not damaged). I don&#39;t know how this integrated with initrd (initramfs wasn&#39;t a thing yet). I think there was only one &#34;base system&#34; - either initrd was very basic, or the whole base was in initrd, or something similar.The paths with /usr were managed by the package manager. Word of mouth was: don&#39;t install anything manually there. If you do (via make install), keep around the source so you can do make uninstall. But better install to /usr/local or /opt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bad/illogical/outdated directory structure is one of the most annoying things I&#39;ve encountered while using Linux, because it makes the admin job feel unnecessarily messy (things are all over the place), and it feels as if there&#39;s a fundamental imbalance in the system that you can&#39;t get rid of."</p>

My life is much worse now, I went into that job healthy and strong and now I&#39;m sick all the time. Perhaps celaic disease was always in the genetic cards for me, or maybe the stress triggered it? The worst part is the job wasn&#39;t especially bad, it was a reasonable job, and I can expect my next job to have similar stress I think. What am I going to do?I&#39;m always amazed at the change in perspective after being in a job for a while. While unemployed, I feel competent, I make progress on hard problems nobody else in the world is working on, and I feel good. While employed, stupid crap stresses me constantly, I can&#39;t leave the stress at work, I bring it home, I obsess about social hierarchies that can vanish in an instant. Everytime I&#39;ve left a job I&#39;m amazed that after just a couple days I can barely remember what I was working on before and what stressed me, like my brain knows all of that no longer matters and let&#39;s it go in an instant.How can I keep a healthy outside perspective while remaining employed? How do I avoid becoming mentally trapped in the workplace mindset? I&#39;ve been giving this a lot of thought, but no answers so far."</p>

He agreed with my assessment and then told me nothing was going to change. In the end, the team changed things on their own.Man I wish that didn&#39;t feel so relevant.  Literally on an all-day &#34;strategy&#34; meeting right now and heard a variation of this about 5 minutes ago..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recent Xoogler here. I&#39;ve never met anyone who was actually happy at Google when you sat them down for an honest talk. Everyone was either coasting and depressed/disengaged, or overworked and stressed (I would say 80% were the former). People were frustrated about the bureaucracy, the promo process, the slow pace, the meaninglessness of the work an individual IC does, the stress for managers. Even on a super sexy project dealing with cutting edge AI that got tons of press coverage, everyone was frustrated. This company has a serious cultural issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In 2020, the pandemic destroyed bucket #3 for most people. We were no different. Friends from back home in Canada couldn’t visit us. Even meeting up with local friends became hard. In January 2021 I tore my achilles tendon playing pick-up basketball. There goes bucket #2.&gt; Only then did I realize bucket #1 had been running low for a while.I&#39;m somewhat puzzled. If the author is struggling to socialize with friends (bucket #3) and struggling to pay attention to physical health (bucket #2) then why does he think that this is going to help improve work-life balance:&gt; I work more hours. I’m more likely to be working in the evening or on the weekend now.I can empathize with the desire to get caught up in a high-energy startup (it&#39;s fun!) but this whole blog post reads like someone trying to replace an increasingly disappointing personal life with excessive workaholism. Filling your days with extra work can fill the &#34;bucket #1&#34; (career) but it seems like a nail in the coffin for the author&#39;s problems with bucket #2 (physical health) and bucket #3 (social life).Posts like this are a dream come true for investors and startup founders. &#34;Lacking satisfaction in your life? Come work harder for less money at someone else&#39;s startup!&#34; I suspect this blog post is going to become a staple on VC Twitter and in startup recruiting pitches for the next few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bias up front: I work at Google.Something I try to do whenever I read articles like this: Whenever you see the name of the giant corporation that the author worked at, replace it with &#34;my team&#34;. Google has over 100,000 employees, so there&#39;s no real &#34;here&#39;s what it&#39;s like to work at Google&#34;. At that scale, there is too much variance for any simple neat summary (though there are certainly trends and commonalities).I&#39;ve met people who worked at Amazon who described it as a hellscape of misery and others who felt it was incredibly rewarding. There&#39;s been times when I worked at EA when I loved my job and times when I hated it.A single data point is useful, but it&#39;s only a single data point. I&#39;m glad the author found a better job that fits what they&#39;re looking for. That&#39;s all any of us really want in our careers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What will the author blog in 5 years?I am noticing a (darkish?) pattern in these recurring “I transitioned jobs” reports. Worryingly, they represent many of the words I imagine myself writing if I were again a blogger.It’s basically the honeymoon/wanderlust cycle. Person gets job. It is a dream job. It is described as a dream job because of reasons a1, b1, and c1. Delta t passes. Things have changed. Because of reasons x1, y1, and z1, job is no longer a good dream job. It’s now a bad dream/nightmare job. Person has awakened now, and for reasons, a2, b2, and c2 is living a new dream. Blink, flinch, repeat.The nagging suspicion is that while things change, they don’t so much actually. They shift around. What does change is how we come to see things. At one point, we convince ourselves things are awesome. Later we believe it’s not. Which is the real truth we ought to accept? It’s like trying to measure the one way speed of light. You can’t, just the sum of the round trip.So do we make the assumption that somewhere in the middle of this good-to-bad cycle is the reality? Or suspect it was always that bad, we were just able to initially gaslight ourselves? Or perhaps that it was and still is good, we’ve just let the negatives creep in and take over?Some would philosophize that all happiness is an illusion. Or a choice. Or whatever.But what frustrates me about this (having been through this cycle 3-4 times now), is that it is not a universal life experience. I have relationships with family, friends, and various institutions that grow stronger and stronger over time. They do NOT loop like work relationships do. Is there something inherit in work relationships that makes this loop inevitable? Do all experience it, or only a certain mindset of persons? Are there cases where this loop is broken, but they just rare enough, you don’t hear about them? Should I despair or hope?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Despite many maturity issues in practice Flutter is the only realistic option for true cross platform UIs that run everywhere. Apart from Qt , but the licensing issue is a hindrance. And yes, the web backend isn&#39;t ideal, but it will improve over time.I just wish Google had built Flutter on a low level core that isn&#39;t tied to Dart, so it would be usable from other languages.Dart isn&#39;t horrible and is getting better, but it is still a somewhat awkward mish mash of Java and JavaScript,  and  I  don&#39;t really enjoy using it.The only reason to use Dart is Flutter, which really hurts ecosystem health / library availability and prevents code sharing with the backend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was recently tasked to build a mobile app at my work, that would have maybe 5% of the feature-set of our gargantuan web product. However, this 5% was mission critical. Coming from React-TS, building with Flutter was a bit weird at first (where&#39;s my CSS???) but the productivity gains came quickly. The Pub ecosystem is fairly mature, in that all the third party packages are pretty high quality and address most common use cases. Unlike npm where there are 10+ solutions for the same problem, there will only be one - maybe 2 in Flutter land.I was very pleased to find out, that Flutter supported web as well. Now, it&#39;s not as good as mobile yet - some of the animations are render blocked by the JS main thread - but it is a very nice &#39;middle&#39; solution to somebody who needs to use the app who doesn&#39;t have iOS or Android (for example, Surface tablet). Also great for internal testing - push up the latest changes to a dev web environment, and everyone can test without installing APKs or using TestFlight.In my use case, I was actively discouraged against making something that looked beautiful or pretty - the software is designed to be spartan, minimalist and essential. Flutter is perfect for that.All in all, Flutter is awesome. Is it the right answer for everything? No. But when you only have one developer to spare whose job it is to build a mobile app, it&#39;s perfect for that. The web support is a nice bonus - haven&#39;t tried any of the desktop stuff yet.Dart, as a language, is nice. Not spectacular, but certainly tidier than Java or JavaScript. I&#39;ve gotten used to functionality programming, so writing everything in classes was jarring at first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flutter 3 comes with an upgrade to Dart 2.17 [1], which has quite a few improvements as well... including state on enums.While that&#39;s great, I was hoping it would be like in Rust, where each enum variant can declare its own state components, but unfortunately it seems to be more like Java: same state for all variants.Well, at least there&#39;s quite a few other small but useful improvements... and they showed how they really listen to the community by implementing the new syntax for passing on constructor parameters to a super-class... and by improving the docs of the 200 most popular packages with lots of examples, as requested by the people.I like how they&#39;re listening to the community as well to implement meta-programming (like macros) [2] to solve the main pain point, currently, in Dart, which is how verbose it is to generate code for things like serialization and data types.Once they get that, Dart will be a really good language to work on (it&#39;s already quite ok IMO, despite most people, usually those who don&#39;t actually use it much, hating on it).[1] https://medium.com/dartlang/dart-2-17-b216bfc80c5d[2] https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1482"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve recently heard about this YouTube account named Roel Van De Paar. If you&#39;ve looked up any error message on YouTube recently, you&#39;ve probably run into him. Because of the &#34;no dislikes&#34; change, he&#39;s everywhere now.And by everywhere, I mean EVERYWHERE. The account has over 2 million videos. Approximately 0.2% of ALL videos on the ENTIRE platform of YouTube can be attributed to this account, and if you check now they&#39;ve probably uploaded a few videos in the past couple minutes. The videos are generated crap, ripped from tech forums. Normally you wouldn&#39;t see it anywhere due to dislikes being easy to spot, but now they pop up all the time in search results due to dislikes becoming a sort of &#34;hidden feature&#34;.Hiding dislikes = less people press dislike (no feedback) = low quality videos are much harder to get rid of in search results. It&#39;s really, really bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t personally think the dislike button is the explanation. But something seems to have changed in the Youtube recommendations algo in the last few weeks.In my experience, the algo has gotten very noticeably worse recently:- Recommending lots of 6 - 12 year old videos on topics I&#39;m interested in (who cares about a 12 year old product review?)- Recommending tons of videos I&#39;ve already seen or recommending really, really old videos from people I normally watch. It&#39;s always done this, but it seems worse recently.- Trying to push &#34;streamer bro&#34; meme videos on me, which seem aimed at 12 year old kids- The algo seems to be really clinging to recommending only videos about the last few topics I searched and totally forgetting my main interests. Look up a video on a new car you just bought? Congratulations, Youtube will now recommend you every video ever produced about that car forever to the exclusion of whatever it is you are actually interested in even if you have never shown an interest in cars.Maybe someone who works at Youtube knows if a new recommendation system was pushed out recently or something? It&#39;s miserable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only explanation for getting rid of dislike count that makes sense to me is to make big brands happy as their videos can&#39;t be made to look bad with a high dislike count and they can&#39;t be &#34;dislike bombed&#34; for things that may be unrelated to the content (eg the recent Activision-Blizzard scandals).Why? Because in every other way (and every way for the viewer), this makes Youtube worse. So it&#39;s a hell of a price to pay to appease big corporate interests. That&#39;s why I have such a hard time comprehending this move.It definitely changes how people use the dislike button since there&#39;s no feedback for it. Maybe that too was by design? It&#39;s true that people are generally terrible at using dislikes and downvote buttons. Ieally it would be a quality indicator but really it&#39;s just used for &#34;I don&#39;t like what you&#39;re saying&#34;, &#34;I don&#39;t like you&#34; or &#34;I don&#39;t like something about you&#34;. And that&#39;s probably not a great signal.Side note: for anyone with such functionality, it would probably greatly improve the overall user experience to identify these low-indicator downvoters and shadowban them. Don&#39;t take away the downvote UI. Just make it do absolutely nothing as in it shows them they downvoted / disliked but just don&#39;t count it for anything. These people are toxic.Anyway, I actually hope to see more low-quality generated content on Youtube as it&#39;s probably going to be the only thing that causes this decision to be reversed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Totally agree with this article. It&#39;s not just about funding methods, but also playbooks for these types of businesses, and best practices.I&#39;ve bootstrapped IPinfo.io to millions in revenue and a team of over 20 - so we&#39;re squarely in the &#34;Middle class&#34;, and there&#39;s a tension between the &#34;bootsrapper advice&#34; (which mostly applies to optimizing for lifestyle and eliminating any risk) and &#34;VC backed advice&#34; (which mostly seems to optimize for scale and speed) - and a lack of advice for anything that balances those 2 (let&#39;s be ambitious and serve a large market and create the best products with great people, but let&#39;s run this as a marathon and not a sprint, and let&#39;s not risk everything on a big outcome)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Businesses that are shooting for the &#34;middle class&#34; (say, less than $50M in earnings at their peak) are of course possible and healthy and good for the economy. What&#39;s missing in this analysis is that those businesses are not going to be &#34;founder-friendly&#34; the way that the prototypical YC-seed-stage startup is. To use the article&#39;s definitions:* &#34;Bootstrapped from zero&#34; is, of course, founder-friendly - no investors and no board means you get to do what you want!* &#34;Raised $100M+ from VCs&#34; is also pretty founder-friendly, at least in the early days, because you&#39;re selling those VCs on the lottery-ticket dream that they could earn 3-5 orders of magnitude ROI. With such an incredibly high upside, VCs and angels are willing to take risks with zero due diligence on unproven founders and small dilution.If you remove the long tail of upside from the possible outcomes and tell your early investors &#34;the best case for you is 100x return, but zero is still just as possible&#34; then the market will compensate in these ways:* Less availability of capital* More dilution* Less faith in &#34;visionary founder&#34; CEOs and more desire by investors to bring in professional management* Long and protracted due diligence processes before the check even landsAll of that is fine! There&#39;s nothing wrong with building a business this way. But there&#39;s no free lunch here - companies that don&#39;t chase astronomical outcomes will have a harder path to getting those first few dollars in funding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post is describing a structural issue on the funding side of new ventures: -- bootstrapping is very hard- traditional credit/loans aren&#39;t structured well for the &#34;mid&#34; type risks of starting software businesses (not much collateral)- and on the VC side there is much less opportunity for the Unicorn 1 in 10 exits.Tackling this problem are two funds that I didn&#39;t see mentioned in either the article or the comments so far: TinySeed and Calm Fund.https://tinyseed.com/thesishttps://calmfund.com/shared-earnings-agreementBroadly both invest much less than a traditional VC would and are compensated differently. The details are different (and matter) between the two but it&#39;s more along the lines of profit sharing than looking for big exits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Progressive causes are near and dear to my heart. I am a feminist and staunch Democrat. As a federal public defender turned law professor, I have spent my career trying to make change in a criminal legal system that is riven with racism and fundamentally unfair to those without status and financial resources. Yet, as someone who understands firsthand that the fundamental rights to free speech and due process exist only as long as competent lawyers are willing to vigorously defend extreme positions and people, I view the ACLU’s hard-left turn with alarm. It smacks of intolerance and choosing sides, precisely what a civil-liberties organization designed to defend the Bill of Rights is meant to oppose.What an incredibly level headed take. It&#39;s so level headed that it seems fake when projected onto the landscape of modern political discourse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ACLU membership and staff have always been fairly left, but they were impressively focused on (IMO) the most important civil rights as rights through their work at ACLU, and largely kept their personal politics out of that.  A &#34;mission driven organization&#34;, as it were.  Pretty sad to see what&#39;s happened over the past few decades (accelerating; not sure when it started, but it got really bad around 2012-2016, and then far worse).  They always believed in &#34;all civil rights except 2A&#34;, but I could overlook that since there are other 2A-specific organizations.I still support them on specific issues, but they&#39;re often on the anti-liberty side on other issues, or just actually crazy. Sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is the testimony of the ACLU for this trial, if you&#39;re curious about it. I watched it live and was beside myself. There are a lot more shenanigans than listed in the article. It&#39;s important to listen to the actual words spoken and changes in voice, see the facial expressions, watch the dancing around the questions, hear the contradictions.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRkLmKJCKbw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a part of me that wants to abandon streaming services and just buy a couple of albums per month based on what I think might be cool. I find myself enjoying music significantly less now I have unlimited access to everything I could ever want. It’s become disposable; just background noise rather than something I’m actively experiencing.There is also a part of me that wants to take those albums and keep them on an old click-wheel iPod. I always thought the early iPod nanos were among the best consumer hardware devices ever made. Just the right mix of boxy and round; small enough to be novel (at least at the time), but large enough to still be perfectly usable. Unfortunately, finding one that both holds a charge and isn’t battered to all hell is quite difficult these days, and even so, it’s much harder to justify a single use device for music when I literally always have my phone with me.As someone who was a teen when the iPod really started taking off, it was a constant presence during the time music was starting to become an important part of my life. Sad to see it go, even though really it’s been gone since the iPhone launched."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a 6th gen iPod Classic that I used for almost 15 years before it finally died on me a few months back. Dedicated music players nowadays are a niche market, so it was really hard to find a replacement. I ended up getting a FiiO M5, and while it&#39;s definitely got some pros -- much better sound quality, can pop in a 512GB/1TB SD card for effectively infinite space for compressed songs, can play FLAC/WAV/OGG -- the ergonomics of the iPod were just so much better. It&#39;s funny how seemingly little things can be so frustrating: there&#39;s only enough space on the screen for 4 names at a time, the scrolling isn&#39;t adaptive so it takes forever to get to the bottom, the play order isn&#39;t consistent with the song display order within a folder... I used to love just browsing my music collection on my iPod on the train to work, but with the M5 I&#39;ll just pick an album or playlist and press play. It&#39;s just not as fun to flip through music.I don&#39;t consider myself an Apple fanboy, but the iPod was a rock solid product that got all of the little things right. Given that the market for standalone DAPs is tiny because most people today just use their phones and music streaming apps, it&#39;s unlikely that we&#39;ll ever see a music player that compares to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a press release: the actual main message -- iPod touch is being discontinued -- has been weasel-worded out of the entire text, to the point that a non-native reader of English wouldn&#39;t even be able to decipher what it&#39;s trying to say.I get that it&#39;s second nature for corporate marketing to try to dampen the message when they&#39;re taking something away, but this is on a whole new level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I took a 6 month sabbatical and am just now interviewing for work again. It&#39;s been one of the best decisions of my career and I would highly recommend everyone who can to save up and make it happen for themselves. I worked for over a decade before feeling burnt out and realizing I needed to make a change. Fortunately I&#39;d been saving for this for quite a while, knowing I&#39;d want to do it eventually. It&#39;s been amazing to have time to myself to ponder what I want out of the rest of my work life, enjoy hikes in the middle of the week, work on a side project, level up my cooking game, and spend time with friends and family without regard for having to return to work at the end of several week long vacations. I&#39;m eager to get back to work and am already looking forward to my next sabbatical and how it will affect my future self. Live a little leaner, save up, and take some time for yourself. We don&#39;t have much of it.Here&#39;s a relevant TED talk I found to be inspiring: https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_tim..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I prefer Apple Maps over Google these days. This is mostly opinion and feel, but it &#34;feels&#34; like:* Google is becoming less correct- ex: &#34;use the right 3 lanes&#34; when only the right 2 lanes work* Google is taking me on routes that are much less safe and more challenging- ex: taking small side roads to a left turn onto a busy road with poor visibility and no light rather than right turns to the main road and signaled lefts* Google is hammering me with unimportant details- ex: I don&#39;t care that I&#39;m on the fastest route- ex: I don&#39;t care that something 4 hours away has a traffic jam- ex: I don&#39;t need to be told to stay on just because an exit ramp has a disappearing lane* Google tries to send me on wild boondoggles literally all the time. It sends me off highway in an attempt to avoid traffic, along with several other poor lost souls who are aimlessly listening to the same computer as me while we drive through some rural thru street.So I stopped using google. Apple isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s unsurprising for long road trips and provides reliable instruction that follows major road paths."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, so I guess Apple Maps is the new DDG. By this I mean, every DDG related thread immediately descends into anecdotes about &#34;Google Search is terrible, DDG is much better&#34; that always leaves me wondering &#34;Are you using the same Google Search I am? Because it doesn&#39;t appear you are&#34;.Google Maps&#39; integration with, say, various forms of public transit APIs (in paritcular) is second to none. Like, it&#39;s not even close. It&#39;s true Apple Maps is a lot better than it was but most of those improvements, in my experience, have been very US-centric, meaning the gap is much, much wider in other countries. Google Maps listings are still way better.What I suepect is that the same people who have decided they hate Google have now let that define their opinions on Apple vs Google Maps just like they have with DDG vs Google Search.I can only recall two current complaints I have with Google Maps:1. I&#39;ve come across a listing that claims to be a supermarket chain. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a local market. I&#39;ve filed corrections about this. A year later it still shows the wrong supermarket chain. No idea why. You can see it on street view; and2. Maps decided to hijack the Menu tab on restaurants to use an ML pipeline from someone who really wanted to get promoted by classifying photos tagged at that location into menu items instead of, you know, just showing me the menu PDF on the website.Oh and while I&#39;m airing complaints, there&#39;s a standard for showing exchange rates. Google &#34;GBP to USD&#34; and you&#39;l get an answer of 1.23 (as of this writing). By the standard the entire finance industry uses this should be shown to 4 decimal places. It used to up until about 6 years ago. Someone changed it. It&#39;s clearly wrong. It&#39;s annoying. And if anyone from Google reads this, please fix this for God&#39;s sake.Unrelated to Maps but you have to try."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer Apple Maps in absolutely every way except their business info. Many businesses are missing, listed but no longer operating, or have incorrect/outdated business hours and other metadata. I do my best to add or correct info via the in-app crowdsourcing interface, but it often takes a long time for the information to be reflected if at all.That being said, it’s hard to compete with Google on data munging. Besides, if I’m actually looking for info on a business besides it’s location, I’d just Google it or visit its website anyways—especially post-pandemic as businesses close, open, and change hours so frequently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microservices was always a solution to the organisational problem of getting more developers working on a system at once. A lot of people working on one code base over the top of each other often causes problems and issues with ownership. The solution was services independently developed with the trade off cost being increased complexity on a range of things.There is an essay in the mythical man month about Conways law and microservices are very much about a way to use Conways law to achieve scale of development. You likely don&#39;t need microservice until you hit a scale where the monolith is a real pain point. You can probably cope with a monolith especially with some reasonable design effort up to the 100 developers maybe more with a lot of separation but at some point in the &gt;25 developers range it becomes cheaper and easier to switch to multiple deployed units of software and deal with the increased system complexity and interface designs and the inherent versioning issues it causes.It is easier to start with a monolith, find the right design and then split on the boundaries than it is to make the correct microservices to begin with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Come to Erlang/Elixir (and OTP), you get the best of both worlds:  - a mono repository
  - a single codebase for a single system
  - your micro services are supervisors and gen servers (and a few other processes) in a supervision tree
  - you decide which erlang node run which apps
  - your monolith can scale easily thanks to libcluster and horde
  - ...

Also, there is the midpoint between monolith and micro service, and this is called Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), you could have:  - a DAL (Data Abstraction Layer) service
  - a Business Logic service (talking to the DAL)
  - an API (talking to the Business Logic service)
  - a Frontend (talking to the API)

Your API (or gateway, or whatever you want to call it) can serve as glue for third-party services (like Stripe, or anything unrelated to your business).Microservices are a solution for an organizational problem, not a tech one. You need multiple teams to work on the same system without blocking each others. This is a solution for huge corporations, not your 2 pizzas team startup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The monolith vs microservice debate always seemed so misguided to me. It seems exactly like vim vs emacs. Or ruby vs python. The arguments are always the same.* &#34;In vim I can do this in 3 keystrokes, in emacs it takes 5!&#34; (where &#34;this&#34; is some vim-idiomatic thing you&#39;d never do in emacs).* &#34;Ruby leads to bad programs, I have inherited a legacy ruby codebase and you wouldn&#39;t believe what they did...&#34; / &#34;Python leads to bad programs, I have inherited a legacy python codebase and you wouldn&#39;t believe what they did...&#34;* My team took a python/ruby app and rewrote it ruby/python, and now it&#39;s 99% faster and our productivity is way higher!What I&#39;m hinting at is this: You can write a bad or good microservice or monolith. The rules are different. You&#39;ll have different frustrations and tradeoffs. You&#39;ll have to play to the architecture&#39;s strengths and avoid it&#39;s weaknesses. You&#39;ll NEED institutional standards to keep people from doing the wrong thing for the architecture model and making a mess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Last years, using MVC framework was not an option as soon as you wanted a dynamic front-end. Having to reload a full page for every user action leads to a bad user experience and is indeed, not acceptable in 2022.When it&#39;s needed, fine.But there are so many SPAs that just don&#39;t need to be. Rendering HTML server-side is just nice. It&#39;s simple and easy to work with. Weird states are unusual. The user gets a really normalized, predictable experience. And done well/quickly, there&#39;s little actual difference.Maybe I&#39;m just showing my age. This falls really close to my &#34;I miss the old web&#34; type sentiments. The last thing I built, and the next thing I will build, are purposely doing full page renders for any actions (no jQuery or React/SPA stuff). I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to have any javascript at all. It&#39;s really fun and lean. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just got me going lately--reminds me of when I was starting out.My last project is 300 lines of python, 270 lines of php, html/css of course, postgresql, and cron. Some scrapers run, ingest data, and the php sorts and displays it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The big MVC frameworks are in a great position to take advantage of the move back to hypermedia as a major network model for web development.  We are seeing a swing back to this model with modern hypermedia-oriented libraries like unpoly, hotwire and my own htmx, where javascript is used to augment the hypermedia model rather than replace it with a client-server RPC-style network model as with most SPAs.These older frameworks have been honed to a razors edge for producing hypermedia (HTML) server side and delivering it to clients efficiently.  As people begin to realize just how much you can achieve with this approach (and the simplicity it brings back to web development) I expect interest in these frameworks to soar.Bullish on 2005 tech books!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;But as a general rule, I think we must not discard a technology just because it&#39;s old. Doing so because it&#39;s too new would make more sense, if you want to build stuff for businesses.Agree with the first statement but, not necessarily on the second.People dismissed React for being &#34;too new&#34; or &#34;the latest stupid shiny new framework&#34; for a long time because they didn&#39;t understand it. But when I read about it for the first time, I understood the problem it was solving with the VDOM. It made perfect sense for me to start using it immediately because it quickly starts saving a lot of time formerly spent on writing DOM setting/resetting code and making sure it never breaks. It was something I was already thinking about: &#34;how could I avoid writing all this tedious DOM manipulation code&#34;. And there it was, and I knew it would become big. It took a while for the rest of the world realize it, but eventually it caught on.Sometimes tools pop up that make perfect sense. So you shouldn&#39;t dismiss any technology for its age, whether it&#39;s old or new."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; SQLite isn&#39;t just on the same machine as your application, but actually built into your application process. When you put your data right next to your application, you can see per-query latency drop to 10-20 microseconds. That&#39;s micro, with a μ. A 50-100x improvement over an intra-region Postgres query.This is the #1 reason my exuberant technical mind likes that we use SQLite for all the things. Latency is the exact reason you would have a problem scaling any large system in the first place. Forcing it all into one cache-coherent domain is a really good way to begin eliminating entire universes of bugs.Do we all appreciate just how much more throughput you can get in the case described above? A 100x latency improvement doesn&#39;t translate directly into the same # of transactions per second, but its pretty damn close if your I/O subsystem is up to the task."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fly is putting together a pretty great team and interesting tech stack. It&#39;s the service I see as a true disruptor to Heroku because it&#39;s doing something novel (not just cheaper).I&#39;m still a little murky on the tradeoffs with Fly (and litestream). @ben / @fly, you should write a tutorial on hosting a todo app using rails with litestream and any expected hurdles at different levels of scale (maybe comparing to Heroku)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Uhm... experience from a large project that used SQLite was that we where hit with SQLite only allowing one write transaction at a time. That is madness for any web app really.Why do everyone seem so hyped on this when it can&#39;t really work properly IRL? If you have large amounts of data that need to be stored the app would die instantly, or leave all your users waiting for their changes to be saved.What am I missing?"</p>

I sometimes forget to turn it off when I put it back in the case, and so far, over 6+ months, it hasn&#39;t run the batteries out.So it CAN be done.  Both devices are basicaally the same: LCD display and they measure a sensor.Back when I was in HS, I had a Casio calculator watch, but it ate through batteries (3-6 months IIRC). The bracket for the strap broke, so I just taped it up in my locker.  Soldered it to a D battery, and never had to replace it again.  :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My most ridiculous experience was when an MP3 player froze back in the day. We had no way to switch off, or pull the battery out, so we waited 2 weeks, until the battery was dead. Then it worked fine after a recharge."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in this industry for many years. The railroads were always hyper-focused on increasing throughput. I left the industry about ten years ago, but back then derailments were considered the most significant risk to average network speed. At the time, average network speed was roughly correlated with profit. The rule of thumb was a 1 mph increase in average network speed was worth about $100MM in profit. That was 15 years ago.There were a lot of systems in place to monitor rolling stock:- Wheel Impact Detectors- Hotbox detectors- Acoustic bearing detectors- Truck performance detectorsTo name just a few. There were also efforts to monitor the railway infrastructure. The things I remember:- Rail stress management (rails need to be under the right amount of stress, which of course varies with temperature)- Top of rail friction management- Rail profile management (the name eludes me, but the idea is you want the interface between the rail and wheel to meet certain parameters)I worked on the rolling stock side measuring wheel impacts, overloads, imbalances, and a handful of more esoteric metrics. One of the outputs of these measurements was a train consist. For each of our locations we were able to build up the consist of the entire train (which was a fun CS problem in itself).I stared at a lot of consists over the years. In North America I never saw anything longer than about 100 cars and 2-4 locos. However, in Northwest Australia they routinely ran 300 car trains meeting the description in this article. But, the reason they could get away with that is they were running a straight shot from the heart of the Pilbara to one of the port towns on the north west shoulder (Karratha and Port Hedland).I need to check in with my old colleagues and see if things have changed. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if train lengths have gotten longer, but I would be surprised if this correlated with a large increase in derailments, as that would have a tremendous impact on average network speed and thus profit.As someone mentioned elsewhere on this thread, there are a lot of single track corridors. It&#39;s bad enough when one train has to sidetrack. It&#39;s really bad when a train takes out the whole corridor. These aren&#39;t packet switched networks. It&#39;s not easy to reroute. And it&#39;s really expensive and difficult to lay new rail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also live in Ames, Iowa, where the author resides. I live less than a mile from the track segment he is talking about, owned and operated by Union Pacific. While I&#39;m pretty skeptical of this author&#39;s individual concerns given the twice-removed nature of the statements from their &#34;source&#34;, trains have unmistakably gotten longer during my 15 years near these tracks, and they are moving faster.A hazmat situation impacting only a one-mile radius around the tracks could effect up to 30 to 40 thousand people here. I interned for Union Pacific while in college, and yes, the company will state that safety is their number one priority, but it was very clear that their business was to profit by optimizing every single little part of their business for maximum efficiency. The company has an open distain for regulations, especially safety-related regulations, and did not shy away from sharing those views internally. I would not be at all surprised if crews are being abused, and safety sidelined, for the sake of maximizing profit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For myself: I believe it is Wall Street greed and investor demands. 16,450-foot trains weighing more than 42 million pounds are gratifying someone with power. Someone who wants it all and more. I believe it is those few, who live nowhere near here, who own their own private islands and jets. This is far removed from laissez faire economics, or the neo liberal model, coming out of the 1980s.This was an incredibly common economic outlook coming from the Midwest and South. It&#39;s both tickling and sad to hear. I do love the way this was written, and those PSR trains sound like a nightmare. When I worked the network engineering desk for a Class I railroad we took derails seriously to the extent of pulling anyone who made changes to infra to the dispatchers themselves. That wasn&#39;t that long ago either but it sounds like a lot has changed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new typeface is nice, providing the required feel without succumbing to cliche, but now whoever is actually using it to typeset titles isn&#39;t doing any kerning! This makes the title look like it is supposed to be &#34;Avata R&#34; (the typographer almost certainly did create proper kerning in the font, but as soon as you start messing with different sizes and increasing the tracking, the kerning is going to have to be adjusted as well, and that wasn&#39;t done).It&#39;s like James Cameron said &#34;Fine! I won&#39;t let my guy I had make the titles last time choose the font, we&#39;ll have a new font made. But I want the my guy to do the rest of the title work, because he&#39;ll still do it for just a crew jacket.&#34;https://www.creativebloq.com/news/avatar-way-of-water-logoAnyway, I quite appreciate the WIP sketches, it makes it plain what the influences are: the bones of the letters are somewhat reminiscent of typefaces like Lithos or Penumbra, and the slight blobbiness of terminals and serifs (which might otherwise be classified as either wedge or flare serifs) subtly recall both Papyrus and some &#34;runic&#34; typefaces. The &#34;runic&#34; influence shows up in some other details as well, like the &#39;v&#39; of the A&#39;s crossbar. The rejected &#34;too extreme&#34; lowercase has a hint of Fraktur or something similar.Like Papyrus, though, this is most certainly a display font. I hope the designer gets to create a toned-down text version that will be usable for subtitles, fixing the other poor typography decision made in the first movie."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Preview is one of those essential things that sets macOS apart from the other operating systems, and contributes to that “Mac has good UX” vibe. Last time I opened the Windows equivalent, it tried to sell me on Microsoft’s PDF-alike format… and asked me to connect Office365.Another tiny macOS feature I love is that you can drop a file icon on any Open or Save dialog to select the file in the dialog. On other OSs, this moves the file to the directory shown in the dialog, or does nothing. On Windows, I install Listary to get the same features https://www.listary.com/There are so many other little macOS things that make it easier to work in the GUI - but on HN they’re all overshadowed by the big “wow window management on Mac is 90s unless you install an app” issue, which makes me sad. I’m hoping that the post-Ive Apple - an Apple more comfortable with “pro” users and beauty in utility versus form - will try to fix that one… and bring back all the good Mission Control stuff from Snow Leopard (which IMO is the greatest OS ever released)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really enjoyed working with the Preview team before I retired from Apple. My small group created a private framework that added &#34;document reconstruction&#34; to PDF documents: basically an inferred DOM based on whatever information (mainly geometric) we could use in the PDF document.Our moment of fame game at WWDC 2009, when Bertrand Serlet talked about Snow Leopard during the Keynote. At around the 5:10 mark he talks about performance improvements to Preview. He then goes on to say &#34;There are also lots of little touches. The one I like is about text selection in PDF files. .... In Snow Leopard, we have used a little bit of AI to infer the structure of the document....&#34; (He then demonstrates intelligent selection across columns) [Applause from the audience]. (https://youtu.be/FTfChHwGFf0?t=306)My colleague and I presented the proposal to add this &#34;little bit of AI&#34; to a small group from the Graphics and Imaging department. Bertrand was in attendance, and it was thanks to him that we joined G&amp;I. They were a fantastic team to work with!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People also forget that you can use Preview to scan documents from your scanner rather than using whatever shitty software came with yours.Also, Preview &gt; File &gt; Import from iPhone &gt; Scan Documents gives you a virtual scanner instead of having to install one of those &#34;scanner&#34; apps on your phone. Its built into your iPhone already!I also use it frequently to change image file types.You can also make a digital version of your signature from a picture of physical version.There&#39;s just tons of small features that work well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently visited NYC and I can’t help but feel the city has a wide culture of laissez faire unenforcement. So many grocery and convenience stores in the city have no posted prices for any items, even in the airport. As a foreigner I was pretty shocked but the people I talked to said it was pretty much normal and there’s nothing really that can be done. Mind you we checked and it is actually not legal to have no visible pricing. I’m not sure what it is that’s stopping the city from actually doing anything about it, like the truck issue it seems it would be trivial to enforce."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With the Econic[1] Mercedes Benz as one of the established manufacturers of utility vehicles already offers a product which implements some of the mentioned advantages of lower position for driver an extended window area. Here in Germany they can be often seen as garbage truck or fire fighting truck[2] in the cities. An BEV version was announced[3].On the other hand, even tallest semi trucks (here 40 tons class) are allowed to roll through German cities widely. They are often involved in accidents with pedestrians or bicylclists with fatal outcome. The main reason is bad sight when turning right. Therefore turning assistants[3] will become mandatory. However, placing the driver better and giving him more field of view is preferred.[1] https://www.mercedes-benz-trucks.com/de_DE/models/econic.htm...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sat on a citizen&#39;s jury about cycling a few years ago and one speaker we heard from (in our lead up to working on recommendations) was from the trucking industry. We knew trucks had poor visibility, that cyclists could get knocked over and swept under the trailer, etc but this guy was an absolute buck-passer and unfortunately he had the rest of the jurors spellbound with irrelevant excuses. He&#39;d admitted that &#39;skirts&#39; on the side of the trucks would make a difference, but there was zero appetite for that change because obviously it would cost transport companies money.Even just better visibility with the side windows has to be fairly achievable.That said, I have a lot of respect for truckers here in Australia. In my experience, they&#39;re some of the more responsible drivers on the road, through sheer mileage and consideration of their heft. They&#39;ll almost always signal when it&#39;s safe to overtake, through necessity they&#39;re wary brakers and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The video interview at the bottom of the article discusses the source of capital for this enterprise to &#34;keep&#34; the peg. The interviewee claims that the source of the capital was basically a crowdfund. The team issued a lot of the tokens, kept a lot of it (about 1/2), and sold the rest. Perpetual motion is possible in finance, but you need fancy licenses and government appointments to do it. These guys are going to prison.This thing isn&#39;t just one token, but apparently at least three. One of them (Anchor) claims a 20% yield on savings. This alone should be a red flag because that&#39;s about 1900 basis points above what you can expect to get from a good savings account or short-term treasury.I don&#39;t have time to dive into the Rube Goldberg machine that this thing appears to be, but when it ends, it will end very badly.Every Bitcoin era seems to have its Ponzi scheme. In 2017 it was BitConnect. They offered something very similar to what Anchor appears to be offering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So we&#39;ve been in one of the longest bull markets in modern history. I have been amazed at the wilful ignorance of Crypto Andys when it comes to why financial markets, the financial system, central banking, debt and debt markets are the way they are.There&#39;s a certain delight [1] in watching increased market volatility exposing how understanding merkle trees and consensus protocols doesn&#39;t make you an expert on what the financial system is, how it works and why it is the way it is.So lots of countries have tried pegging their currencies to other currencies, most commonly the US dollar. Your ability to do so is limited by how much money you are prepared to throw at it to counterbalance market forces. I mean this is one reason why we moved from Bretton-Woods to floating exchange rates.Central banks have far more ability to defend a peg. Still a pet can be attacked  (eg [2]) if the peg is sufficiently out of line with the market.It&#39;s going to be funny to watch these crypto trainwrecks learn these lessons (again) the hard way.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCQGQ5qBQTA[2]: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/george-soros-ban..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like this (un-)stablecoin has lost its peg two times in the past. The interesting thing is that&#39;s it&#39;s an algorithmic stable coin: if its price is below a dollar, you can &#39;burn&#39; one UST to get $1 worth of LUNA (a regular crypto currency without an enforced peg). That has a deflationary effect and is meant to raise UST&#39;s price.
Conversely, if UST&#39;s price is above $1, you can burn LUNA to get back UST, inflating the supply and lowering the price.It&#39;s quite the neat idea really -- but I suppose it hinges on people believing that there is a healthy UST-LUNA ecosystem tomorrow that you can use to withdraw your funds if you want. Burning UST to get LUNA doesn&#39;t make sense if LUNA loses enough value by the time you could exchange it for something else, so I assume people rather take the loss on selling UST for less than $1, which would explain what we&#39;re seeing:
Right now UST is at $0.81 and LUNA is down 47% in the last 24h. We&#39;ll see if the system is robust enough to recover from a &#39;bank run&#39;, if you can call it that. It at least isn&#39;t the first time the peg has been broken, and so far it&#39;s stabilized at $1 again every time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"it will be interesting to watch NY (and/or CA) put something like this in place and observe from afar. i strongly feel that states should be much more aggressive running policy experiments if their constituents desire them, and at the national level we all get some benefit of seeing how things turn out in real time.all that said, assuming there is some tangible tax increase, NYC high earners are going to be knocking on the door of 60% combined rates (city, state, federal). tax avoidance and/or relocation services are going to be booming if so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coming from a country that has this, there should be caution: it gets more affordable, but you get what you pay for.  In my country of origin, you get a partially-paid-for ride to the emergency room, where you pay for things like casts, non-ward rooms, dental care out of pocket.  There is no prescription coverage.  There is no optometry coverage.  I would wait significant chunks of a year for procedures and diagnostics.  To cover the things that aren&#39;t covered, most have private insurance through work or also out of pocket.Since moving to the US, it is more expensive (than next to nothing), but I actually get good care.  Several conditions that were ignored or misdiagnosed for me are now cured.  My life might be significantly shorter had I not come here.If NY does this, the near zero chance of my moving there ever would go to absolute 0.  It is a terrible system for any place that does not have infinitesimal state or national government expenses and more-than-60% kind of taxes (e.g., Scandinavian countries)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m an MD who trained in NYC. I have also had emergency surgery in the NHS at one of their most prestigious hospitals in London and so I feel like I’ve seen the system a little bit from the inside.It was far cheaper for me than it would have been as a Brit in the USA, but the standard of care was lower. They didn’t have some technical and staffing resources late in the afternoon that would be a baseline in any of the hospitals I’ve been at in the USA. The English doctors were just kind of apologetic and bashful about it, talking to someone they knew was an American doctor who knew what kind of specific diagnostic algorithm was appropriate.The NHS hospital did have really excellent amounts of ancillary staff. Someone brought coffee and tea to me like 3-4 times a day, it wasn’t hard to get my luggage delivered to my bed, etc. Not like that in the USA from what I’ve seen.The NYC hospitals are somewhat financially strained as it is. Especially the public hospitals (Bellevue, Elmhurst, Metropolitan).Also related would be care at the VA hospitals, which is slower/worse than care at NYC flagship hospitals. But as a society we don’t want to prioritize or pay for good care for veterans, so it is what it is.I predict this will continue to basically just produce a more two-tiered system in the US. Most doctors who have a choice (large group practices) will take the wealthy patients with private insurance, and the big hospitals and whomever else who don’t have a choice will be forced to accept the NY single payers (basically the existing model, where the poor and 65+ are already covered under Medicaid and Medicare already). It will likely strain these systems even further, as reimbursements from Medicaid/Medicaid are insufficient to run large health systems which depend on higher rates from private insurers (payor mix). Good luck there.In NYC even more physicians and group practices will try to go to alternate models such as cash-only. Try being on Medicaid or Medicare and finding an outpatient psychiatrist in NYC now as it is. This will extend to more PCPs, chronic disease specialists, etc.Some patients will get better and more affordable care, but some will also get much worse care. It will be interesting to see what happens. I’m not necessarily opposed, but this is absolutely not going to be a clear and decisive win on all fronts as some commenters are suggesting. The US healthcare system, if you have private insurance, is the best in the world already in terms of level of service and access to rapid specialty and high-end care."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the early 2000&#39;s, I taught &#34;computers&#34; to a bunch of kids in DC.  I first started off with how a computer work; IO, CPU, storage and their eyes glazed over.I quickly ditched that topic and went right to building a web page.  Taught them a few HTML tags and they instantly became &#34;webmasters&#34;. They were so thrilled.  They could create blinking text, could make all the fonts pink.  All just by moving around some simple text in NotePad.Most importantly, they were creating things that they thought were only able to be created by &#34;scientists&#34;. I loved how it boosted their own self worth.I&#39;ve stopped teaching a long time ago.  Not sure if there&#39;s still tools out there where a 13 year old kid with no technical experience can immediately get gratification with something so simple on a computer. Maybe it is a time gone by."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My 1996 self feels very seen.I think a lot about the way the web was back in the mid 90s, compared to the bleeding-edge technologies of today, particularly blockchain and cryptocurrency.And one major aspect I keep coming back to is that web technologies in the 90s, and even their descendent technologies now, are simple enough for most technology-literate people to understand, and that carried with it a lot of comfort and trust.For anyone who had been using desktop computers and office software in the early 90s, which was basically everyone who was a student or an office worker, the web was just files on a computer, served over a network, which we already had plenty of experience using. And I think that&#39;s why my father, who was only a little older than I am now when I first showed him the web, grasped it straight away and was supportive of me building a website for his business.These days I&#39;m not spending much time writing HTML files in a text editor and uploading them via FTP; rather I&#39;m writing programmatic code that talks to a database (A database! Just like MS Access or FileMaker Pro), does some processing, and displays the result on the screen with some elaborate JavaScript to make it look and function how I want (I’m happily a heavy user of React for building rich web apps), but it&#39;s still fundamentally the same concepts. Files on servers, accessed over a network and delivering useful information to my browser or app. The beautiful simplicity is still there, and it still doesn&#39;t feel like a big leap from the kind of computing we were doing 1993.The world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies and &#34;web3&#34; feels vastly more opaque and esoteric by comparison and therefore untrustworthy to many of us, which I think is a significant answer to the question that was asked here in the past couple of days: &#34;Why is Hacker News so anti-crypto?&#34; [1].I can&#39;t quite accept that it&#39;s just that I&#39;m &#34;old&#34;; firstly because first heard about Bitcoin soon after it appeared and was excited by its potential, but also because I remember how people older than me reacted when the web arrived, and there was much more rapid acceptance and embrace than there I currently see for cryptocurrency, outside of those who are just chasing quick riches.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31302494"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I miss those times.
I could spend hours complaining about the depressive current state of the web, I imagine being a newcomer to such world and have to handle the over complexity of the current scenario without knowing that things could be simpler.I remember seeing a team member migrating a project from grunt to webpack, the project was just a 404 page. &#34;You need to compile your assets&#34; they say, just a cat *.css &gt; site.css would do it. Or even better, just do it inside the HTML and that is it.People who need a JS library to check if a number is odd or even went way too far, I&#39;m not exaggerating - https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PowerToys Run is fantastic as an app launcher. Not quite as good as Alfred on MacOS but then nothing is. There&#39;s a bunch of similar apps for Windows (I used to use Hain) but none ever worked quite right for me, PowerToys Run does though.FancyZones is awfully nice too for just putting a window somewhere at a reasonable size and location.As other folks have noted SysInternals is another similar rogue Windows product by Microsoft. Process Explorer from there is indispensible, as is Autoruns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of one of my favorite features from the Mac: Quick Look — press space to instantly bring up a big contextual preview window of the selected document in the Finder.You can bring it to Windows with this useful open source tool: https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use PowerToys just for the easy key remapping, which I wish was a built-in feature in more keyboards. Works very nicely as a simple alternative to AutoHotKey. My RSI has gotten a lot better by just remapping Caps Lock to Ctrl.If any PowerToys feature deserves to be added to Windows, it&#39;s gotta be the Keyboard Manager."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Welcome to the automated account suspension age of the internet, where companies shoot first and don&#39;t care later, as the amount of false positives is not worth putting any meagerly (if there&#39;s any already) real, physical support to resolve. This can apply to smaller companies too, for other but equally pricey reasons. The amount of fraudulent activity attempts online may warrant those aggressive measures from their business perspective (that are also not limited to passive data collection, but taking active steps such as scanning targets&#39; ports [0]).
Unfortunately, if you live in certain areas or are forced to use mobile networks, with IPs constantly refreshing multiple times a day, major services can be almost unusable, and the user may not even realize the reason why. Some—for reasons I&#39;m not knowledgeable about—do it better than others, but it may simply be about the resources put into it and the amount of risk a miss could amount to.0. https://blog.nem.ec/2020/05/24/ebay-port-scanning/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is every company that deals with fraud of some sort. They collect evidence. Once evidence is damning enough, they ban, without giving any information. If they were to give out their evidence, then their evidence collection methods would become known and would no longer be effective.Furthermore, even when they get it right, people who were banned correctly come on to the internet to complain.But sometimes they get it wrong. And the only recourse seems to be a public shaming online."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this was posted after someone saw this come up on HN yesterday: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31295427I&#39;ve been planning (for 2+ years now so it probably won&#39;t happen) writing a large blog post about this matter, which would be called “Tries, Packed Tries, and the Bentley–Knuth–McIlroy story”:• Part 1 would introduce the trie data structure both abstractly (the tree structure) and concretely (how exactly to represent the children of a node), with the trade-offs: as a linked list (space-efficient, slow lookup), as an array (fast lookup, takes space), or as some more nontrivial tree structure itself (“yo dawg…”). Then we&#39;d discuss the really cool idea of “packing” the array, as nicely described in Frank Liang&#39;s thesis https://tug.org/docs/liang/ (also mentioned in TAOCP Exercise 6.3:4 and answer, which incidentally refers to the CACM Bentley–Knuth–McIlroy article that we&#39;re talking about). We&#39;d also illustrate how hyphenation is done in the TeX program using packed tries (maybe this can be a separate post).• Part 2 would go into the Bentley–Knuth-McIlroy story:• Part 2a (&#34;Before&#34;): Bentley&#39;s thesis/book on writing efficient programs, and the Programming Pearls column. Knuth writing TeX first for himself in SAIL in 1977–78. The instant interest and ports/rewrites it led to. Knuth responding by rewriting TeX into its current form in 1980–82, and how the goals of portable software (thus Pascal, and its limitations! see BWK rant) and of eventually publishing it as a book led him to the idea of literate programming, which he still considers the most important outcome of his years into the TeX project. Meanwhile, at Bell Labs, McIlroy&#39;s invention of Unix pipes, and the instant excitement of &#34;pipe day&#34;. (“It was absorbed instantly into one&#39;s outlook on programming. And by the end of the week secretaries were piping the output of NROFF into the printer”) The Unix philosophy, and how it took a while to spread. How these three threads came together in 1986, when Bentley read Knuth&#39;s TeX, wrote about LP in his Pearls column, and published one program of Knuth&#39;s (the random-numbers one) and asked him to write another (the frequent words one).• Part 2b (the program): How Knuth ingeniously combined the idea of packed tries with that of hashing with linear probing, to create the data structure especially for this problem (maybe we can call it a hash-packed trie?). Another look at his very nice idea/program, presented differently (maybe some illustrations of how the data structure works), and some design choices he made.• Part 2c (the review and later): How Bentley got McIlroy to review it, a close reading of the review: its actual content and points about LP and Knuth&#39;s style, and finally the (first sentence and) last part where McIlroy used the review to advertise his own Unix philosophy and the short shell pipeline version. The further reactions to this, including Bentley&#39;s remarks in the same column, and later articles and reactions like the &#34;prefabs&#34; comment (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22406070). The short-lived LP column in CACM that it spawned (https://shreevatsa.net/post/programming-pearls/) and how it fizzled out, how it turns out everyone wants to do LP in their own system. How the story got bastardized over time (the misleading &#34;More shell less egg&#34; blog post for example, and some other examples of people misunderstanding the history entirely).• Part 3 would compare the two approaches (even though they are not meant to be compared!), mention how at https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/188133/ I simply translated Knuth&#39;s program into C++ and beat the then-fastest Rust solution (since beaten again by translation from C++ back into Rust: still based on the trie idea though!), some words about cache misses and 32-bit “pointers” in a 64-bit world (and Knuth&#39;s rant about it).Something like that: it&#39;s probably too long for me to ever get around to writing it (or for anyone to be interested in reading), though…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there more discussion about the &#39;framed&#39; part? I mean how was the counter perceived. The whole &#39;setup&#39; looks like:- show how to write a spreadsheet application- here you go, couple of hundred pages it is though- ahh, silly person, why not type &#39;excel&#39;So what happened next? Everybody rolled eyes, or people said &#39;yeah, typing excel is pure genious&#39;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am super excited by https://observablehq.com which has made an out-of-the-box literate programming environment for Javascript zero configuration (like Knuth&#39;s it has a non-linear execution order). Since switching to literate programming I have found myself adopting a documentation-driven-development methodology, where I ponder about the purpose of the notebook in the introduction, and because I reread it every time I open the notebook, the clarity of the software goes up, which also feedbacks into the ongoing development process too.It takes a little while before habits change, but I think I have learnt more in the last year at age 40 than I did in my first year of undergraduate aged 19.An aspect of Observable which is particularly compelling since Knuth is the fact that inter-notebook dependencies are hyperlinks, so these are not standalone literate programming artifacts, but they are a graph of explanation too. You can learn a lot by surfing notebook dependencies. Bundling code with documentation is such a win.The other thing about Observable is the cells are reactive, so your documentation is not necessarily static either. You can provide animated interactive explanations too.More info on the different types of content you can embedhttps://observablehq.com/@observablehq/cell-modesMore info on the spreadsheet like execution ordering:https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javas...
More info on the literate programming support"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML basics...and this is where it goes off the rails; teaching JS before HTML is how we will continue to have the ridiculous proliferation of app-sites that shouldn&#39;t require a single line of JS instead needing the latest version of $browser (you have a choice of browser - pick one ...) to even show any content at all. Forms don&#39;t need any JS to work, yet the impression this gives to beginners is that they do.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25915313But then again, this is Microsoft, which is now firmly in bed with Google in contributing to the Big Browser monopoly, so I suppose I shouldn&#39;t have expected anything else. The agenda is obvious to anyone who cares to look."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note: I&#39;ve had to help train a bunch of Java/C++ devs about web dev over the years. I&#39;ve also talked to a lot of new devs. One thing I noted is that there wasn&#39;t a good resource that tried to explain the key pieces of web dev concepts, terms, and technologies, and how they fit together. So, I ended up writing a &#34;How Web Apps Work&#34; blog series to try to fill that gap:https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/how-web-apps-work/The series provides an overview of HTTP and servers, client dev, browsers / HTML / CSS, JS / DOM, and AJAX.A number of folks have told me they found the series particularly helpful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an experienced backend developer but always struggled with learning modern web development.I understand all the core well (html, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), but struggle with choosing the right high level abstraction/framework/technology for ideas I want to implement.E.g. should I make it a single page app or not? Should I be using ES6 imports? Which build tool? Would I want React or Vue or something simpler here? Should I use SSR? NPM vs. Yarn? Do I need a CSS compiler? Maybe I should be using TypeScript? Wepback?Basically I&#39;m overwhelmed with choices, but struggle to find useful docs on why a lot of these tools came about, what problems they solve, tradeoffs for using them, etc.Asking the web devs I know in person doesn&#39;t help much (“just use React for everything, it&#39;s fine&#34;)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me a more reasonable explanation than any in the article is that after losing the vote, Amazon looked into the warehouse and decided part of the problem was that the managers were making the situation worse. This could have been that the rsi injury complaints were true and unaddressed promptly. Or that the managers came off as cold in communications. Or 5 other things they could have done better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The managers were told they were being fired as part of an “organizational change,”Nit: That language implies that they were laid off, not fired. The timing is a stupid move from Amazon, and these employees will likely be able to make a good case in court.Being from Europe I have mixed feelings about unions here in the US...On the one hand I think they are essential to tilt the uneven power dynamic between employer and employee towards the employee, and are thus dearly needed!On the other hand, unions seem to often go overboard with impractical demands and are more political than in Europe, which damaged their reputation - I think - and contributed to their demise over the past few decades. Which is truly a shame!
(I&#39;m reminded of alleged cases where only a union worker is allow to plug a power plug into an outlet at exorbitant prices. But this might a rumor too.)Any opinions here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a forefront issue that Buddhism tries to address, both modern pragmatic Buddhism and fundamentalist Buddhism. It&#39;s why right speech, right action, and morals is one of the first things they drill into you. Most pragmatic practitioners will refuse to teach you if you indicate that you have some mental problems or moral deficiencies that should be addressed by a professional first, as mindfulness may end up doing more harm than good. It&#39;s one of the flaws of teaching secular mindfulness, far from its Buddhist roots. I&#39;ve experienced all these interpersonal deficits after meditating seriously 2 hours every day for 2 years straight. Just need to have the self-awareness to address them, despite the goal of no-self.I saw a Dr. K video in another comment, and one of my favorite quotes he uses to describe meditation is that, &#34;if you run for 5 miles a day, there will be changes to your body that will definitely happen&#34;.More here:- https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-i-the-fund...- https://eudoxos.github.io/cfitness/html/index.html- https://themindfulgeek.com/ plus a talk he gave at Google https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2xxsA9Bn-4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would line up with a broader trend I&#39;ve noticed and would be interested in reading more about: the use of pop psychology to justify antisocial behavior.Ten years ago, telling a distressed friend you don&#39;t feel like hearing about their problems would be incredibly rude. Now you can find NYT articles explaining how to couch the same sentiment in more acceptable terms like, &#34;I don&#39;t have the bandwidth to perform that kind of emotional labor right now.&#34;Same thing here. Telling a person you wronged to &#34;get over it&#34; is unacceptable. Telling them that you&#39;ve been working on letting go of negative feelings about the past and being more mindful of the present, and you hope they can do the same? Well if anyone has a problem with that, you don&#39;t need that kind of energy in your life!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"10-20 minutes/day was enough to teach me how to be &#39;mindful&#39; on demand and mitigated a lot of mild ADHD-type problems in my life (impatience, anger, finding queues unbearable, high sensitivity to noise etc.).I spent a few months doing more, and it may not be related, but I became increasingly detached from the outside world, more self-absorbed and less motivated. Spent a lot of time just sitting and being content with nothing, which made me question why I should strive for -anything-. Always focused on improving myself, and the way I thought and felt, but it kept me stuck in my own head and not engaged with other people. There is a benefit in doing loving kindness and other forms of meditation that connect you with others."</p>

With files you need to be much more deliberate and I feel like you can accumulate a lot without really knowing what you have.Even if this is a simple visualization it already gives ideas on how much more information you could convey with something similar. Like number of pages, color of the cover, to remind you of the book, different font, etc. A set of cues that can help you navigate in the list of books, at least I suspect :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Look at a chart of the S&amp;P 500 from 1920 to 2008 and you&#39;ll notice something rather curious: the stock market has gone parabolic ever since the financial crisis. What made this period so unique? Tremendously low interest rates coupled with quantitative easing dissuaded capital from financing the real economy and instead encouraged herding and levering up in the financial economy for returns.At ever dip, it was an open secret the Fed would cut rates and ease again.At least for now, that game is over. We&#39;ve had moments in the past when the markets had a similar panic (see 2018), but this period is unique due to the inflationary backdrop. Since 2008 we&#39;ve never seemed to be able to create significant economic growth or inflation greater. The COVID fiscal canon blew growth and inflation skyward. The fed can&#39;t just turn on the printers again or cut rates until we hit proper a proper recession.That&#39;s when you buy the dip.[0]: https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-dat..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived through the dot-com crash and got out safely after hearing something so ludicrous that I had to ask myself &#34;How insane does this industry have to be for someone to think they can build a high growth internet company out of home cement delivery?&#34; My memory may be playing tricks, but it was something like that.After 2008 I became interested with crashes throughout history. There are so many fascinating little details that added up to one giant mess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to think that investing in the stock market, which I have only been able to financially over the last 5 years might have been much riskier than I might have previously thought. What I previously thought as &#34;okay I just leave it in the stock market for a bit of time to recoup&#34; is something I am now realizing would likely have to be 10+ years.It&#39;s kind of funny because I was getting shaky about having money in the stock market back in December, and I held onto investing some of my money there. But I ultimately relented 4 months later to lose 10% within about two weeks (and after just index funds). Now it&#39;s much worse, and I guess I&#39;ll just leave it all there.And in 15 years I&#39;ll be back to where I was when I originally invested it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Technology robbed workers’ of what had been highly valued physical knowledge about a job: the precise way to jimmy a stuck gear, the sound a machine makes when something’s about to break.There&#39;s an experience that lives rent free in my mind as well. As a teen, I worked at a bait shop that was on the Gulf coast. They sold mostly live shrimp but had other live stuff for bait as well. Salt water was pumped from the nearby innercoastal canal by two heavy duty swimming pool type pumps. From there, the water was split through several different pipes and manifolds and dumped into the live bait tanks. The overflow ran back out to the canal.There was this one customer I was getting bait for and he meandered around the bait room randomly (customers weren&#39;t supposed to be in there but I didn&#39;t feel like saying anything). He ended up way in the back of the room where the pumps were and I could see him touching them. Figuring I needed to get him out of there politely I walked back there pretending to check on stuff. Before I could say anything, he says &#34;You will need a new pump soon&#34;. Um &#34;What?&#34; I say. &#34;Put your hand on this one&#34;. So I did, I felt nothing. &#34;Now put your hand on this one&#34;. And that one had a really high frequency vibration coming through it. &#34;The bearings are shot, it will lock up soon&#34;.I was impressed. Granted for two more years I&#39;d regularly &#34;feel&#34; the pump again, the vibrations were slowly getting worse. But then a hurricane came and flooded everything anyway so we got new stuff.But still, anytime I see a high RPM electric motor running, I got to &#34;give it a feel&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Diminishing returns on productivity is obvious (eg working 80 hours a week outputs productivity somewhere between 1 to 2 times the productivity of 40 hours a week).However, rewards for work is also highly nonlinear, and usually rank based. For example, Usain Bolt is not twice as fast as the second fastest runner but Bolt is rewarded many multiples more than the second fastest runner.What is rational is to think of the payoff or reward space, and think how even a tiny incremental increase in productivity (which compounds) can result in disproportionately large payoffs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t find anything wrong with being addicted to getting things done if the productivity gains are shared amongst the labor force. Specifically, increase in productivity can be used to eg shorten the workweek even further and demand protections against work encroachment on personal life. I see that this is happening with some companies embracing 4 day workweeks, others adopting remote from anywhere etc. We need to accelerate this trend, possibly enshrine them in labor law.To be honest, the greediness of the managerial/investor class is kinda dumb. I keep thinking about how Amazon/Starbucks could have worked with their employees rather than exploiting and harassing them so relentlessly that now the labor movement is growing rapidly to their detriment. It was really stupid to think they could get away with being shitty forever. Incentive structures should be created that don’t bias so heavily towards the short term."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With JavaScript, these kinds of optimizations in an engine make sense due to the web being limited by it and thus speed is a huge factor. With Python, however, if a Python web framework is “too” slow, I would honestly say the problem is using Python at all for a web server. Python shines beautifully as a (somewhat) cross platform scripting language: file reading and writing, environment variables, simple implementations of basic utilities: sort, length, max, etc that would be cumbersome in C. The move of Python out of this and into practically everything is the issue and then we get led into rabbit holes such as this where since we are using Python, a dynamic scripting language, for things a second year computer science student should know are not “the right jobs for the tool.”Instead of performance, I’d like to see more effort in portability, package management, and stability for Python because, essentially since it is often enterprise managed, juggling fifteen versions of Python where 3.8.x supports native collection typing annotations but we use 3.7.x, etc. is my biggest complaint. Also up there is pip and just the general mess of dependencies and lack of a lock file. Performance doesn’t even make the list.This is not to discredit anyone’s work. There is a lot of excellent technical work and research done as discussed in the article. I just think honestly a lot of this effort is wasted on things low on the priority tree of Python."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During Perl’s hegemony as The Glue Language, I feel like the folk wisdom was:“Performance is a virtue; if Perl ceases to be good enough, or you need to write ‘serious’ software rewrite in C.”And during Python’s ascension, the common narrative shifted very slightly:“Performance is a virtue, but developer productivity is a virtue too. Plus, you can drop to C to write performance critical portions.”Then for our brief all-consuming affair with Ruby, the wisdom shifted more radically:“Developer productivity is paramount. Any language that delivers computational performance is suspect from a developer productivity standpoint.”But looking at “high-level” languages (i.e. languages that provide developer productivity enhancing abstraction), we can rewind the clock to look at language families that evolved during more resource-constrained times.Those languages, the lisps, schemes, smalltalks, etc. are now really, really fast compared to Python, and rarely require developers to shift to alternative paradigms (e.g. dropping to C) just to deliver acceptable performance.Perl and Python exploded right at the time that Lisp/Scheme hadn’t quite shaken the myth that they were slow, with Python/Perl achieving acceptable performance by having dropped to C most of the time.Now the adoption moat is the wealth of libraries that exist for Python—and it’s a hell of a big moat. If I were a billionaire, I’d hire a team of software developers to systematically review libraries that were exemplars in various languages, and write / improve idiomatic, performant, stylistically consistent versions in something modern like Racket. I’d like to imagine that someone
would use those things :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great read, and it&#39;s fantastic to see all the work being done to evaluate and improve the language!The dynamic-nature of the language is actually something that I had studied a few years back [1]. Particularly the variable and object attribute look ups! My work was just a master&#39;s thesis, so we didn&#39;t go too deep into more tricky dynamic aspects of the language (e.g. eval, which we restricted entirely). But we did see performance improvements by restricting the language in certain ways that aid in static analysis, which allowed for more performant runtime code. But for those interested, the abstract of my thesis [2] gives more insight into what we were evaluating.Our results showed that restricting dynamic code (code that is constructed at run time from other source code) and dynamic objects (mutation of the structure of classes and objects at run time) significantly improved the performance of our benchmarks.There was also some great discussion on HN when I had posted our findings as well [3].[1]: https://github.com/joncatanio/cannoli[2]: https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/1886/[3]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17093051"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good for him.These companies touting their solutions for creating a more connected world can&#39;t have it both ways. Apple was able to ship the M1 and roll out new iterations of many other offerings since the pandemic hit. They&#39;re just fine.Apple didn&#39;t collapse since the pandemic hit, and the flexibility offered by remote work is far more valuable to lots of people than the loss of in-person collaboration opportunities. We deserve to have input into how we work best and if that means walking away from companies run by egomaniacs that need to see butts in seats, then so be it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Warning: Hot Take.I genuinely believe many people who prefer working in an office versus at home have unfulfilling social lives or bad home lives. The social dynamics, competition, in physical offices fills the void in their lives. Also seems like most of the people clamoring for a return to the office are also climbers &amp; middle managers.For some work a physical presence is required not just preferable, but for most of a software engineer&#39;s day to day there really is no unquestionable upside.I&#39;ll quit before I go back full time. I&#39;ve never been happier or more fulfilled with my work/life balance, and I&#39;ve never been more productive with my time. I&#39;ll even take a different remote position at a 20% pay cut and a reduction in equity, at least, to retain WFH. Most I&#39;m willing to give is a day a week in office, and maybe temporarily longer in rare circumstances where the benefit in performance is clear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m trying to hire for a position right now and it has dragged on for months for two reasons:1) WFH is now limited to 1 day per week, and a 3 month probationary period where new hires don&#39;t even get that.2) Salary. It&#39;s still a job seeker&#39;s market and my workplace is not keeping pace. It&#39;s spec&#39;ed for 3 years of experience but salary is about the median for a new graduate w/o professional experience. I&#39;m happy to train someone but if I rework the job class to allow for new grads then HR will lower the starting salary. So, I&#39;m hoping to find someone who&#39;s a new grad but had a part time job or internship or any other non-coursework experience the could be even the least bit argued as adding up to the required experience. (the position is basically a data wrangler / sql jockey / light analysis position, but it directly supports the main revenue-generating operations of the organization so there is real $$$ lost by having this position empty. ::Grrrrr:: end rant.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appreciate the writing style, but this article is shockingly naive to me.Convenient consumer products tend to sell better than less convenient ones, even if the product is worse. That&#39;s the entire story. People have finite time, so when they receive more income they will tend to spend it to reduce the time they spend doing things that they don&#39;t care about.I for one hate spending time doing all the things that the products in the article make more convenient, and happily pay more so I can spend my time on other things.  * I don&#39;t like shaving, so I optimize for razors that get the job done faster (more blades, easier to swap a new blade)
  * I don&#39;t like cleaning pans, so I buy pans I can clean faster and don&#39;t have to &#34;season&#34;
  * I don&#39;t like filling bags with tea, so I buy tea bags that are pre-filled
  * (nespresso) I actually enjoy the ritual of making espresso, so I use a real espresso machine
  * I bike every day to and from work, so I take it a step further and buy an E-bike with no shifter
  * I don&#39;t want to fiddle with chromecast or fire stick, so I just use my TV&#39;s built in smart features
  * (inner city shops don&#39;t sell individual pieces of fruit) I live in SF, it&#39;s very easy to find individual fruits here
  * I don&#39;t like going to grocery stores, so I pay to have groceries delivered to me

My time is precious to me, so instead of spending money on luxury items I spend money to save time. Evidently so do most other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I believe that many things stated in this post are correct, this still has that hard &#39;old man yelling at the internet&#39; odor.If you are to compare stuff, stuff like modern razor cartridges and double-edged razors, you ought to mention the convenience side of the things. I hate being the devil&#39;s advocate, but shaving with 4-blade cartridge designed for easy shaving is still &#39;miles&#39; ahead compared to shaving with double-edged razor. Miiiles ahead. And I use a double-edged razor 9 out of 10 times, so I would know a thing or two about it.And that&#39;s not to say that are overly pricey. They are. Plus, if you account for different prices in different regions, the price difference is even more concerning.The same is also true for some other appliances/services mentioned - tea bags and coffee machines are not just &#39;superficially convenient&#39; they are wildly more convenient.EDIT: As one person said in the comments down below, &#34;What this article completely misses, is that there are more than two options.&#34;. That was my whole point, and I&#39;m sorry if it came out the wrong way. Shaving is a personal preference, and you are free to do it however you like; but saying &#39;Shaving is too expensive and is a demonstrative example of how most consumer products are designed to extract more money from you rather than to improve your life, or the world, or to be in any way remotely good.&#39; is just incorrect and insane."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Other examples of products that seem to exhibit a similar trend, where purported convenience leads to higher prices&gt;Cooking equipment: essentially indestructible Cast Iron skillets transition into teflon pans. The newer pans perform worse, and must be replaced on a shockingly regular basis. They also seem to be poisonous.They have their uses. I wouldn&#39;t try frying eggs in a cast iron, for instance (technically you can, but it requires an absurd amount of oil). Also, claiming that they &#34;seem to be poisonous&#34; without any qualifiers is a little misleading. To my knowledge they&#39;re only poisonous during manufacturing (ie. the precursor chemicals) and when they get too hot.&gt;Nespresso machines, and other coffee pod brands, replace many styles of coffee brewing. Provide much worse coffee, at a higher price but are superficially convenient.Why are they only superficially convenient? They seem pretty convenient to me.&gt;Televisions moving from being screens which accept input, to self contained &#39;smart&#39; devices that require software updates and thus have a shortened useful lifespan.I thought it was the other way around? ie. smart TVs are cheaper than dumb TVs because they&#39;re subsidized by ad revenue. Also, the claim itself doesn&#39;t really make any sense. Even if you stop getting software updates, that doesn&#39;t prevent you from using it as a dumb display."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was at Bell during the options “debate.” I think something that this otherwise wonderful article misses is that some believed that commands were never intended to be the only way to use the system as the shell was intended to be just one of the many user interfaces that Research Unix would provide. From that perspective, it was entirely reasonable to believe that if a command was so complex that it needed options than it was likely more appropriate for one of the other user interfaces. I believe this is unfortunately now understood by some as it shouldn’t exist. However, because of the seemingly instantaneous popularity of the shell and pipelining text it became synonymous with Unix. It’s a shame because McIlroy had a lot of interesting ideas around pipelining audio and graphics that, as far as I know, never materialized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unix history is always fascinating.&gt;None of this explains dd.This one really made me think. I have never thought about dd before. Although I have wondered about other commands. Perhaps the author should also have added some command options not requiring a minus prefix, e.g. tar, ps.The manpage [0] reads:In the first (legacy) form, all option flags except for -C and -I must be contained within the first argument to tar and must not be prefixed by a hyphen (`-&#39;). Option arguments, if any, are processed as subsequent      arguments to tar and are processed in the order in which their corresponding option flags have been presented on the command line.
In the second and preferred form, option flags may be given in any order and are immediately followed by their corresponding option argument values.[0]: http://man.openbsd.org/tar"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I believe the oldest program that uses subcommand is the version control system SCCS, from 1972IIUC, other non-Unix operating systems commonly used the subcommand style for normal interactive use; it was the style used by the normal command shell, and all commands in those operating systems therefore followed this style.  The operating system (or its shell) was responsible for enabling easy use of this style by adding completion support (commonly using the ESC key, IIRC).  This older style can still today be seen in Unix tools like ftp and telnet, which uses this style for its internal command line interface.  Another tool using this style, which many might be familiar with, is the multi-platform Kermit.Unix therefore has been rather late in adopting this style, first in gradually adopting tools which uses the subcommand style (ip, git, etc.), and later with support in shells for programmable completion support where a program can optionally register completion hooks for the user shell to use, making it finally come up to the level of those older operating systems."</p>

Though they are apparently coded differently electrically, so they&#39;re distinct protocols.The tables would benefit from mentioning the coding (8/10 or 128/132) as IMO it&#39;s one of the most confusing bits when you see the effective data rates:* USB 3.2 Gen 1x2 has a nominal data rate of 10G (2 lanes at 5G) with a raw throughput of 1GB/s (effective data rates topping out around 900MB/s)* USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 has the same nominal data rate of 10G (1 lane at 10G) but a raw throughput of 1.2GB/s (and effective data rates topping out around 1.1GB/s)The difference is that Gen 1x uses the &#34;legacy&#34; 8/10 encoding, while Gen 2x uses the newer 128/132 encoding, and thus has a much lower overhead (around 3%, versus 20)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem that GraphQL was trying to resolve is real: reasonably-sized REST projects usually ended up inventing their own awkward, ad-hoc mini query languages on top of REST.But GraphQL as a solution is not great. It looks nice in the first place, but there is too much hassle to deal with.P.S. I&#39;ve seen quite a fraction of GraphQL projects actually using Node.js as the backend. If that&#39;s the case I would recommend TRPC[0] over GraphQL - it&#39;s more seamless and straightforward.[0] https://trpc.io/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my relatively naive opinion, graphql exists to solve a few things (which are mostly benefits for large scale companies):1. Reduce the total number of HTTP connections required to get the data for a specific component or page. Imo this is presumably less important with http3 but the driving force is probably similar for both.2. Give backend-for-frontend style services more autonomy to provide an interface that works for a specific feature on the front end without coupling it to specifics of how the backend organizes resources3. Allow performance issues with frontend query logic to be addressed without changing anything on the front endI think the situations where it would be useful are large teams that want to operate more independently where the overhead of dealing with graphql is worth it.An example being someone trying to render a component for a list of comments. It would be great if the front end could just write some &#34;magic&#34; query that gives them everything they want and they don&#39;t have to worry about batching requests to specific endpoints and the order in which they should make those requests. That doesn&#39;t mean the problem magically goes away, but it&#39;s now someone else&#39;s problem and that&#39;s good: the app development can free itself from things it shouldn&#39;t care about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used GraphQL on several projects now, with small teams (2-5 devs) where we control the front and back end, and for that case, it&#39;s actually been really good. It provides a solid contract that is easy to get wrong with a REST API. (Will the server send IDs as ints or strings? Will it accept either? Which params are optional? What shape does the data come back in, an array of results, or an objects with results nested somewhere? etc.) I&#39;ve even setup CI to fail if it finds queries on the front-end that don&#39;t match the schema. And of course it&#39;s easy to request exactly the data you want on the front -end.A big downside is that the tooling is immature, and all subject to big changes. And I haven&#39;t written a server meant for public consumption, but that does add new layers that you can kind of ignore when you trust the client."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this move by Shopify.  As a merchant (in Canada, where typical shipping prices are extortionate) I&#39;d love to give Shopify more money (but presumably less than we pay 3rd party shippers) for better overall delivery service for my customers.As a buyer, I&#39;d love to spend more with not-Amazon and get comparable service.I&#39;m increasingly disappointed with Amazon. It&#39;s full of knockoff crappy products with unrelated 5 star reviews.  That eroding trust in Amazon is pushing me to smaller brands who have a face and stand behind their product for key purchases.  This move by Shopify will just accelerate that transition away from Amazon.Just waiting for the search bar to shop every Shopify store so I have a viable alternative to Amazon to buy whatever I need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon’s catalog quality and customer service is going downhill very fast. Shopify has a real opportunity to fill that void.Amazon was known for maintaining high quality of their catalogue. But since opening up their store front for third party sellers it’s resembling flee market by the day. For example they had a very strict policy of one product one page I.e Single Detail Page (SDP), indexed by ASIN. But now exact same product has multiple ASINs. You don’t know if it’s a fake or genuine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of us unfamilir with Delivrr:Our Mission:Large online marketplaces like Amazon have trained consumers to expect products delivered to their doorsteps within 1-2 days at no extra cost. As a result, millions of merchants on other marketplaces are falling behind, unable to cost-effectively deliver products to their customers within 1-2 days. Our mission is to enable any merchant, regardless of size, to delight their customers with fast and cost-effective fulfillment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s convenient that GitHub Markdown supports graphs natively, and I&#39;ve used Mermaid there successfully. However, I was fairly disappointed with Mermaid itself; I found the syntax irregular and non-intuitive (the syntax for every different graph type feels like it was designed by different people working independently), the documentation was sparse (though it exists at all, so I&#39;ll give it points for that), and worst of all the error messages were atrociously cryptic and entirely unhelpful.That said, I also found the default styling and layout of the generated graphs to be far more attractive than Graphviz/dot, though I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s attributable to Mermaid or GitHub.Which is to say, altogether probably a step forward, but still lots of room for improvement. Please, start with the error messages!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good thought.My immediate response is &#34;yeah, I really didn&#39;t get the games other people were playing in junior high,&#34; which is the time frame the article evokes for me.I feel like the gotcha is you have to realize - at least sometimes - that there are still games you don&#39;t get. It&#39;s easy to feel like, &#34;at ${year - 1} I was such an idiot, glad that&#39;s over now.&#34; You&#39;d be surprised how many years in a row you can feel that way before the meta realization sinks in.Understanding other people is like learning to play &#34;Have You Got It Yet?&#34;[1]:&gt; When Pink Floyd gathered in January 1968 for one of their first rehearsals as a quintet, Barrett shared a new composition he called “Have You Got It Yet?” The song sounded straightforward, but the band became confused as they tried to join in and learn the number. The melody and structure seemed to shift on each run-through, with Barrett gleefully singing a chorus of “Have you got it yet? Have you got it yet?” at them.&gt; Eventually they realized that Barrett was changing the arrangement each time, deliberately making the song impossible to learn. “We didn’t get it for quite a long time,” says Gilmour in Rob Chapman’s book A Very Irregular Head. “I remember the moment and the song well. It was really just a 12-bar, but the responses were always in the wrong places according to Syd.[1]: https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/syd-barrett-10-things-y..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Science and technology and other nerdy pursuits can be really valuable, and certainly don’t require you to be judgmental of others.The problem, as I’ve seen it is that people who are bad at some of the other ‘games’ that make a meaningful life lean too heavily on  science and technology as a coping mechanism. That coping mechanism could be many things: nerdy pursuits, alcohol, video games, etc.Whatever your pursuit, if you’re being judgmental of most other people, then you’re probably missing something big and should take some time to reflect on what that is for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a comment on HN about a year ago by somebody that grew up in India, and being Pakistani i relate to it a lot as well.Specifically, it mentioned that these &#39;games&#39; and people choosing one or two games out of a great number of games available out there seems like a uniquely North American thing (as far as we can tell from our own limited exposure to other societies).So while you folks had the jock, the nerd, the artist etc. , we had schools, teachers and parents that taught us we should strive to excel at everything, i.e. play every game and try to play it well.Its a little disappointing to be put into a bucket by North American folks because they assume everyone is good at just one or two games. Not trying to be disrespectful, but i personally also think a little less of people that take so long to come to the realization that the author did in the article. A little ironic, if you think about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great technical article as always, and apologies for not responding to the meat of the article, but I tend to look at declarative UI with some degree of skepticism. Raph, do you think this general approach can eventually be scaled up to develop complex and highly interactive applications such as DAWs, video editors, and graphic design software? At least based on my experience with SwiftUI, I find the paradigm easy and satisfying to get started with, and great for prototyping and widgets, but quickly run into roadblocks whenever trying to build creative software that&#39;s not just a view around a database. Or do you see this as just another tool in the UI toolbox, and not necessarily mutually exclusive with imperative and immediate mode UI? Curious to hear your thoughts!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have you thought about backing the persistent widget tree with native widgets as the final layer? Or, at least supporting it as a render target. That is, UI/NSViews on Apple platforms, DOM nodes on web, GTK objects on Linux, etc. Essentially using them as the final “render tree”.SwiftUI takes this approach, as ComponentKit did before it. The framework still does most everything (state updates, layout, animation, etc), but the host compositor handles the actual rendering.This approach has a few advantages in my opinion. These widgets integrate nicely with the host accessibility system, for one. They also can come with built-in styling to make them “fit into” the target platform.There are also performance benefits to leveraging the system compositor – Firefox switched to have platform native layers on macOS and it helped immensely with battery life.It is worth noting that SwiftUI and ComponentKit components don’t have 1:1 mappings with native widgets – they both perform flattening (i.e. for drawing paths and layout only nodes) to optimize their performance.I think most importantly, though, it allows for rewriting code incrementally as that approach naturally supports bidirectional embedding. Having rewritten the Shortcuts app editor from UIKit into ComponentKit into SwiftUI (maybe one of the larger projects written in SwiftUI?), incremental rewriting is crucial for existing software projects.The other concern is mobile – it just is not feasible to rewrite the text input stack on mobile, for example, so being able to use native text editing views would very much be necessary.This all looks fantastic!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool work. My impression after reading the article is that it’s significantly inspired by SwiftUI, but without the magic annotations (@State, @Binding, @EnvironmentObject, @StateObject, etc.). It will be interesting to see how Rust handles the fully-statically-typed view tree, which has been really pushing the limits of the Swift compiler.Question for the author: perhaps I missed it, but how do you plan to handle view trees that change based on state (ie SwiftUI’s IfElseView + viewbuilder)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Loneliness. We don&#39;t have meaningful social connections anymore like our parents or their parents geeration had. We are so scattered, that I am unsure how many of my friends are actually friends and how many are just professional contacts. Everytime I switch job, almost 70% of my friends suddenly fall out of contact. Heck, I don&#39;t even know the people who live in next apartments both left, right, up and down on the same building. Socializing with my friends mean, setting up an appointment weeks ahead to see if we can align on a free-slot and this often involves all of us commuting to somewhere and disbanding by 22:00 hours because family, work next morning, chores to do, doctor appointment and other human things.Interestingly, in this rat race, a lot of people suddenly inherited significant wealth and managed to use those wisely to have enough return to maintain a minimal lifestyle without working a primary 9-5. Some of us also achieved significant wealth by our early youth that we can afford to chase our hobbies for long time without worrying about the rents and bills and other responsibilities. Add social network to this, and these people cumulatively pursue things like world travelling, elaborate vacations, own businesses, YOLO etc.. , an endless stream of &#34;other people doing YOLO&#34; while us being worried what did I achieve so far?So, yeah, we feel lonely, go to social sites(which is appearently the whole &#34;internet&#34; to non tech-savvy groups) to see how others are having it good. Then suddenly we realize we wasted a lot of time on watching others having fun and decide that, we need to get better hobbies and stop this. But the loneliness never goes away as hobbies are extra toppings when we have a complete social life, so we are again pulled back to the cesspool, because at least there we can get some connection in forms of comment, likes and we can post our opinions as well or get into hours of comment-wars(which counts as social connection too)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am addicted to twitter and reddit. Especially reddit. It often takes the place of reading, hobbies, quiet moments, improving my home, talking with my spouse, and playing with my baby.When reddit records a click or an upvote, it thinks it has been a Good Product, and created Engagement. Reddit then takes those feedback loops and tunes the algorithm and feedback loops to create further engagement.But in reality, there&#39;s almost no positive relationship between my engagement with social media and my personal human flourishing. I think these products are mostly poison for my soul."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because we humans have a lot of idle time.We feel like we&#39;re wasting it, and we feel we should instead spend time archiving goals, to better ourselves, to do something more meaningful.  
But that is not how life works. You are just unnecessarily burden yourself with guilt. Thinking you should be doing something else. There are so many things to learn about, so many things to experience, right? We fear on missing out on life, chasing something, but what exactly we don&#39;t really know.But maybe you just don&#39;t need to? Most of us are exactly fine with where we are. Of course you should always strive to improve, but truth is &#34;killing time&#34; is a big part of life. Especially for top of the food chain animals like humans. Watch some livestreams of lions on youtube, what do they do? 99% of the time they just sit under a tree doing absolutely nothing, and I bet they don&#39;t feel guilty about it. People used to walk labyrinths for hours and hours, just to kill time.This whole notion that you need to make the most out of every moment, live life to the fullest, see all the places, chase the uncomfortable! - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily the best advice, the happiest people I&#39;ve met tend to have very simple boring routines."</p>

The precision signals that the bidder is confident pricing and negotiating analytically.The thing I am curious about in [0] is that they report the bid price per share, and not (unless I missed it) the asking price. I don&#39;t know how M&amp;A &#34;works&#34;. If you and I are both estimating the value of a good, if our estimates are close it&#39;s one thing and if they are far apart it&#39;s another. Are rounders losing because their estimates are less accurate, relative their counterparty&#39;s?[0] https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/16-058_27d73983-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another extremely successful tactic I stumbled upon by accident: electing a 3rd party decision maker that the other negotiator can&#39;t communicate with. Without the communication channel, the other negotiator is forced to &#34;sweeten the deal&#34; instead of using conversational skills.I received a job offer while my wife was traveling. The number was right for me and the job/company was right. But I told the hiring manager that I needed to talk it through with my wife first and that I&#39;d need a few days (no context about why I needed the time or which direction I expected it to go).She got home 3 days later. We sat down, talked it through for 10 minutes, and we were ready to accept.In the time between the initial offer and accepting the offer, I received 3 updated offers with increasing compensation. The final offer I accepted was $75k higher than the initial offer.After experiencing that, I&#39;ve noticed companies use this tactic frequently. When you call into a help center, often times the phone operator &#34;will need to talk to their manager&#34; who is authorized to make the actual decision. You aren&#39;t allowed to talk to the manager - all communication goes through the intermediary. I suspect they are aware that this is an effective negotiating tactic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely this has something to do with the anchoring effect:- If you offer £210,000, it&#39;s a signal that you&#39;re looking at increments of £10,000.- If you offer £211,000 it&#39;s a signal that you&#39;re looking at increments of £1,000.- If you offer £211,000.01 then it signals that you&#39;re taking the piss.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something about confidence and accuracy in there too, but I would expect anchoring effects to be stronger in those contexts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sooner we collectively decide that housing shouldn&#39;t be a market, the better. We all need it, and we should figure out mechanisms to make it available to all.Practically that means paying to build and maintain housing stocks, changing tax incentives so developers are incentivized to build more housing and less luxury housing, charging a premium for unused land in desirable areas (parking lots don&#39;t house people), abolish mandatory minimum parking, and upzone neighborhoods (eliminating the &#34;single family home&#34; neighborhoods as a zoning type.)I&#39;m also of the much more radical opinion that we should protect tenants over landlords in nearly every case, that we should protect the rights of people to live where they&#39;ve historically lived (eg, one shouldn&#39;t be &#34;priced out&#34; of the home they&#39;ve lived in for 20 years), and we should offer extensive public housing (built as many geographically distributed small apartment buildings and 5 over 1s, not giant tenements or projects.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t this one of those &#34;If everyone is crazy, you&#39;re crazy&#34; situations? If every house is overvalued by some metric, then maybe the metric is wrong. People&#39;s perceptions of value are a large part of the actual value(meaning what someone would really pay) for things like housing that should depreciate over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Moody&#39;s who quite famously engaged in what should be criminal conspiracy regarding the rating of MBS [1] leading up to 2008 that cost pension funds, mutual funds and investors billions of dollars makes further statements about the housing market.Sorry but I don&#39;t put a lot of stock in what Moody&#39;s says about anything.There&#39;s pretty strong evidence that the rise in house values is structural not speculative. This is essentially the constraint of supply. There are multiple causes of this including:1. The US building very few new homes 2010-2020. There are lots of reasons for this. A big problem is the type of housing being built, particularly in urban center where like NYC where the vast bulk of new housing units are ultra-luxury condos;2. Permissive policies allowing the rich to park money in real estate. This particularly includes foreign nationals from places like China, India and Russia; and3. An increase in people owning multiple properties. These include second homes, vacation homes and short-term rentals (most notably for AirBnB). There&#39;s strong evidence that AirBnB in particular has huge negative impacts on a lot of metropolitan areas.A lot of tempted to blame Blackrock and other instituationl investors as constraining suply. this is completely overblown. These account for less than 1% of US homes.[1]: https://www.ft.com/content/6457f28a-d9fa-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Keycloak nothing made sense to me until I got myself familiar with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.Keycloaks documentation seems vast, but isn&#39;t. There is also no way to search inside their documentation. It&#39;s a pity.A better documentation is contained in the administration web ui itself. There are so many &#34;hints&#34; and tooltips for almost every option there is. It really helped me a lot.Keycloak is good software. It never failed for me. Even upgrading from 7.x.x to 16.x.x somehow just worked.Yes, their docker image is fat, but it&#39;s also very flexible. Now that they are basing Keycloak on Quarkus instead on Wildfly, the docker image should shrink in size.    quay.io/keycloak/keycloak   18.0.0                      a6bd0f949af0   15 hours ago   562MB
    quay.io/keycloak/keycloak   18.0.0-legacy               421e95f49589   46 hours ago   753MB

ok, still big :).Beware: they aren&#39;t using Docker Hub anymore. Newer versions are on Quay only (https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak).I&#39;m happy with Keycloak. Also nice folks around Keycloak."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My company used Keycloak for a long time (I&#39;m not there any more) and I agree with everyone here, it works great, but it&#39;s hard to understand unless you already know oauth/oidc, and it is a huge binary.While Keycloak is a great out-of-the-box solution, my #1 complaint at the time was how heavyweight it was, which was a burden for development, followed closely by its packaging as a J2EE app and bundling with Wildfly (at the time).This meant we needed to know not only about Keycloak itself, but also about Wildfly&#39;s special quirks, the clustering system (Infinispan??), Java and Docker.Now it&#39;s packaged with Quarkus, which is another dependency to learn about, and to be honest despite the quality of the finished product, all those dependencies have become pretty off-putting.So while I can recommend Keycloak&#39;s functionality, if you&#39;re not already deploying Java apps as part of your job, I suspect it will present a pretty serious administrative burden to deploy into serious production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We tried using keycloak in a startup where I worked. It needed a loooooooot of memory and was very slow to start. It probably needed some JVM tuning, but we were just deploying as a stateful set (for the postgres). The docker images were also huge.We had to use another FOSS project called Gatekeeper as an authentication software along with keycloak, which got obsoleted and replaced with a different project (lukedo proxy or some such).The community support was also relatively not that active like other FOSS project that we used (for other areas of the stack). Overall, the experience was not so great that we decided to ditch both keycloak and gatekeeper. This was about a couple of years back. Not sure what the current status is.Some other alternatives that we wanted to try were from the Ory project (Kratos etc.) But we just went with some proprietary AUTH solution in our startup."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sounds like burnout to me. I am in my mid-40s and used to have spells like this, but no more. I needed some kind of large change, back then, to get myself sorted out, but this could be pretty destructive because if I waited too long, the change I&#39;d need wouldn&#39;t really be conducive to staying on whatever project I was on.The key to not having to deal with this problem anymore, for me, was starting to proactively switch things around to break the routine of consecutive work-weeks. One of my tricks was to do some kind of mini-vacation every 6-8 weeks, go somewhere new, leave work behind for 3-4 days. Even smaller things like regular social events can work wonders - anything that breaks the weekly routine.Back when I&#39;d get myself into burnout periods the most effective way to recover enthusiasm was to pick up a new skill, work-related or not. I was in my mid-30s in the late aughts and not entirely sure I wanted to keep coding - so I signed myself up for an 18 month &#34;executive MBA&#34; program to find out if I might want to do something else, and instead came out of that with a whole new outlook on how and why to write code.Then around 5 years later I started writing code on the side, for myself, to gradually improve over the long term, and this can be absolutely therapeutic.Try to switch things around a little bit, do something new, see if that helps?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your problem is very simple: you are working on bullshit.Across your entire description of your situation you never once mentioned what it is you are actually working on but called out the income you hit and frameworks you are playing with. I humbly submit that your problem is that you have lost the plot.Hate to break it to you chief but the libraries and frameworks and techniques you use to work are not the point. Creating stuff that people want to use is all that matters. Doing it with finesse and craftsmanship is how you go from good to great but if nobody gives a shit you will always feel empty.Switching projects and doing something &#34;harder&#34; isn&#39;t going to fill that void.Build something people want. I promise your drive and all the rest will follow behind once you are making them happy and get hooked on solving their problems and improving their lives.That is what this game is all about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll pile on to the burnout suggestion with my own personal solution to how I fixed that problem.I&#39;m early 40s, started coding around 13 or so, so it&#39;s been 30 years of software for me.  About ten years ago after living in the web programming world for a few years I got kind of the same feeling you have.  I missed my forms and windows app development, so I went to another company doing what I remembered enjoying.You can guess what happened next.  I hated it.  I remembered all the things that annoyed me about windows app development, and realized I was just tired of coding every day.  Coding has never been what I like about coding, it&#39;s building things that do things.  I started focusing more on the building side, this time with the team around me, and also just some non coding fun projects like learning auto mechanics, etc.  I drifted into a management role by accident and found a ton of fulfillment in coaching and mentoring.  After a while I started to miss the coding side, so I went into an architecture role where I still got to do coding but it was mostly exploratory POC stuff to decide on new technologies or not.  I took a role after that as a principal engineer, and while these are all mostly just title changes, it gave me enough variety to be exciting again.Today I tell prospective employers that I am someone that drifts between IC and leadership roles.  I believe experience in both helps both.  My drive waxes and wanes but I think that&#39;s totally normal for humans.  I just came to terms with it and stopped worrying about it, and now I&#39;m very satisfied in my career."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Energy densities of various substances and/or reactions is pretty fascinating concept.Some of the most interesting energy analysis I&#39;ve come across (Vaclav Smil and David MacKay especially) describe energy in terms of area:  what are the comparable land areas which would have to be dedicated to specific sources or forms of energy or fuels, and how do those compare?  One of Smil&#39;s descriptions of petroleum wells is &#34;punctiform&#34;, which I love.  A hole in the ground, only about 20 cm in diameter, can provide years to millennia of human energy output, per day.1 litre of oil is equivalent to about 3 days of human energy output (at 3,000 kilocalories/day).1 gallon of oil is eqivalent to about 11 days of human energy.One of the oldest oil wells in production (the First Oil Well of Bahrain) produced 80,000 barrels of oil per day initially.  That&#39;s over 1,000 years of human energy equivalent.By comparison, the yeild of current biomass production is far, far less.  The difference, of course, is that oil is biomass, accumulated, converted, and concentrated over hundreds of millions of years.  We&#39;re consuming it at &gt; 5 million times its rate of formation.  (See Jeffrey S. Dukes, &#34;Burning Buried Sunshine&#34; (2003).)In terms of radioactivity, the net metabolic rate of the Sun&#39;s core is lower than that of a human, measured in energy/mass.  Solar metabolism is closer to that of reptiles, about 1/5 of mamallian metabolic rates.Chemical energy is less productive than the most effective nuclear transitions, but its shear abundance and ease of utilisation tends to weigh in its favour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Potassium-40 decay is also one of the largest sources of geothermal heat [0].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 15 decays per second from one banana work out to a couple of picowatts of power, roughly the power consumption of a single human cell. Even if you captured that decay energy with perfect efficiency, powering a house would require about 300 quadrillion[6] bananas&gt; [6] Fine, I looked it up this time.I think that&#39;s out by a factor of 1000.Potassium-40 decays 89.28% of the time to calcium-40, releasing 1.31 MeV, and 10.72% of the time to argon-40 releasing 1.46 MeV [1].  That&#39;s .8928*1.31+.1072*1.46 = 1.32608 MeV per decay on average, which is about 2.1246e-13 Joules [2] per decay on average.  15 decays per second is 15*2.1246e-13 ≈ 3.1869e-12 Watts = 3.1869 picowatts per banana.  I think Randall is using 1000 Watts as the average power usage of a house.  1000/3.1869e-12 ≈ 3.1378e14 ≈ 300,000,000,000,000 = 300 trillion bananas.  Maybe he looked it up wrong?Can anyone confirm this?I can&#39;t find the packing density of bananas, but if it was 1000 kg/m^3, a medium banana is ~118 g [3], so 1000/.118 ≈ 8475 bananas / cubic metre, so 300e14/8475 ≈ 3.54e12 cubic metres of bananas.  The New York metro area is about 12000 km^2 = 12e9 m^2 [4], so the depth of the banana pile is on average 3.54e12/12e9 ≈ 295 metres, which is indeed taller than most of the buildings, so that bit seems right.It&#39;s half past midnight here, so I&#39;m well into &#34;Someone is wrong on the internet&#34; [5] territory....[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40[2] https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-MeV-to-J.htm...[3] https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bananas-calories-carbs[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area[5] https://xkcd.com/386/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Hasura and TablePlus a lot lately, and actually wished for something that combines them.Hasura is great at understanding relations and making joins feel effortless and TablePlus is so good at making table editing feel as fast as excel.This looks like it&#39;s the thing, with some extra power thrown on top (formulas and nested layouts are nice!).The UI looks drab, but maybe that&#39;s ok? It means the functionality needs to be so strong it doesn&#39;t matter. It also looks super snappy which matters most.Something that Airtable has over relational database GUIs is lightweight enums and arrays of them. Sure you can model all that in SQL, but it&#39;s super useful to have it right inline. I hope this tool can pick up on a pattern like enum tables (like hasura) and provide UI that makes them look like tag list/select fields."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unpopular opinion: Social media is a great scapegoat, but it is not the source of the problem. It is where they go to communicate and cope. My sole qualification to post this: I have four kids that are either teens or in their early 20s, and one who will be a teen next year. Here is what I see out there:1. Kids have little or no slack in their schedule. This means very little freedom, and very little time to work things out mentally. School, practice, volunteer, homework, bed, do it all again. This builds up to a very difficult to unwind ball of stress, anger, fear and despair.2. Everything is conflicted and unclear. Schools teach cultural tolerance while enforcing zero-tolerance policies. Diversity is good, but being ____ is bad. So many areas where what we teach and preach are the opposite of what policies and actions actually do.3. The stakes are too high. View the wrong website on your chromebook and get referred to law enforcement. Have a kid send you the wrong selfie and get charged with a sex crime. Get a bad grade and you are off the volleyball team, and you won&#39;t make the team next year - so done forever. Misbehave and you&#39;ll be arrested by the resource officer and face time at juvi, and potentially a conviction that will be held against you for a very long time (in some states juvi convictions count against three strikes laws).3. Kids are targeted. Sexual predators, gangs, fringe and mainstream ideologues looking to recruit followers, sports agents and talent scouts all have one thing in common: they want to exploit kids or sell them something.It&#39;s really hard to be a kid right now, and that needs to change. We need to lower the stakes, the stress and have something that resembles consistency."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Social media definitely amplifies it, but consider the economic and social environment that teenagers have lived through their entire lives. Multiple major recessions, a global pandemic, rising inflation, housing and education getting more expensive by the day, prospect of a mountain of debt right after graduation, climate that will be unlivable in a few decades, political extremism becoming the norm, and massive government gridlock that has made fixing any of this impossible. Can&#39;t really shield kids from this reality anymore when all of it is one click away. Teens are aware that they are going to inherit a pretty terrible world, and are powerless to do anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ofc it is plummeting. We are letting them install apps that have people behind them with the sole job of making them more addictive. We are handing them drugs, multiple variants if I may say so. I had to fight with my daughter for TikTok and whatnot, she is only allowed with YouTube due to school/tutorials/classes etc and I still find myself pretty often having to snap her out of shorts and other bs with an algorithm behind it designed to keep you on and ...consuming.These are modern drugs my friends and we are not doing anything about it. Our kids are being milked of their time, attention, imagination, focus and money. The majority of them can&#39;t even cross the streets properly any more. They don&#39;t even look if the drivers saw them, they all have a phone in hand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the temperature converter one because it immediately introduces some of the more fuzzy design questions and annoying details that pop up when you implement data binding.Such as: when exactly should the other side update? When the user switches focus (where to?) or on every keystroke? Does it make sense to a user that they temporarily see the Fahrenheit value for 2°C if they really want to type in 20°C? What happens if they type an invalid value (or clear the box, which they often have to do)? What happens if they type an incorrect value and then type something into the other field? 
Etc etc.I think there are a lot of interesting tensions between a &#34;formally correct&#34; system and one that feels usable and intuitive to use. Especially with bidirectional data flow, they show up quickly."</p>

I remember I had used HTML5 skeleton templates for a while before I learned that the &#34;maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no&#34; they came with is not a good idea."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;a Heroku database&#34; was what was known as core-db internally for the longest time. I&#39;m not sure if still the case or not today.But at one point was the source of everything for Heroku.Over time things were moved out, so this isn&#39;t an everything that exists has been leaked, but it is not a guarantee that attacker didn&#39;t move from one area to another.As someone with some apps on Heroku, having worked there, but no knowledge of the details of the incident more than others... I would:1. Rotate all creds2. Ensure logging all connections to the DB (I can&#39;t recall how much you can do this on Heroku)3. Extra heavily audit Github commits and Heroku releases4. Maybe keep rotating all creds?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s going to be a question about the expected probability of this across cloud service providers.I&#39;ve done security work for multiple cloud service providers and know a lot of people in the industry. I&#39;m not really privy to give details.I can say: dev teams face limits on what they can build securely, platform teams face limits on what secure by default and monitoring features they have time to implement, security operations teams have a lot of data points to look at, and in theory even changes in personnel in a couple of teams can have an impact on the threat posture for a given set of a company.People are trying. But if you do the math for introduction of attack surface over time versus risk mitigation effort over time for that attack surface you can derive some estimates for likelihood of attack.If your cloud provider isn&#39;t providing you that data as a customer, it&#39;s not simple to make a determination about likelihood of risk introduction and breach of your cloud provider.This hasn&#39;t really been something people talk about because there was a tacit assumption that the biggest companies are mostly getting this right.I&#39;m not trying to say the cloud is inherently broken, I run a lot of workloads in the cloud and trust sensitive data to the cloud. But I do wish there were better ways for customers to have data points with which they could evaluate platforms besides extrapolating the history of public breach reports."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On April 7, 2022, a threat actor obtained access...GitHub identified the activity on April 12, 2022, and notified Salesforce on April 13, 2022, at which time we began our investigation.Can some experienced security professionals weigh in on the cultural and organizational factors that allow this kind of major breach to go unnoticed for a week, that too in a reputed company like Heroku?I&#39;m not asking this rhetorically or in bad faith. It&#39;s a genuine question I have based on a project I did. I researched cybersec tech like SOAR, XDR, security logging, and SIEM in depth. On paper, the marketing for such tech gives the impression that by using them, such breaches can be detected and prevented in real-time. But there seems to be a mismatch between the claims and ground realities. If so, why?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s breathtaking to see the pendulum swing so obviously and definitively back in favor towards HTML-first and SSG/SSR-first solutions—to the degree that even the JS-framework-hotness-du-jour braintrust is going all-in on SSG/SSR.I&#39;m still a bit steamed from being gaslit all throughout the mid-2010s years when we were told &lt;div id=&#34;root&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; + SPA was The One True Way of building web applications. Even now, I run into this mindset _in the Rails community_ of all places. But thankfully we know now how this story will end, because the advantages of wildly simpler stacks which work better with modern web specs AND offer improved performance in many cases are undeniable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was anti-SPAs until I started living permanently on a 2G connection. Now I love the few that I use.They cache a lot of data, lazy load almost everything, and renders are much faster. Also, best of all, the experience when my internet goes down—which is often—is at least a partially functional page, instead of a total blank screen which is what HN and other sites that deliver full HTML or nothing gives me.I cannot count the number of times I have lost a long well-typed comment on HN, because my internet went down while sending it and my browser apparently considers that to not be situation that it can reload the page on using the data it was going to send.I think SPA&#39;s work better on low-data lines because they are apps and work just like other phone apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For starters: a lot can be done natively nowadaysI learned this recently on my personal site when I was going through and de-javascripting stuff.  I more and more frequently run without scripting enabled, and it felt very wrong that my personal site had some JS requirements.  The worst being that it wouldn&#39;t render without JS due to a slick little fade-in effect in the template...One of the things I do quite like (living on a low bandwidth connection a lot of the time) is lazy loading - and it turns out that you can do that without JS too, now, at least in modern browsers.img loading=&#34;{lazy,eager}&#34; will do this without needing JS.  Combine it with picturesets for smaller images (you let the browser pick an image it supports and a size relevant to the display), and life is good without any JS.At this point, as far as I know, the only things on my site that require JS are the &#34;Make the image bigger when you click on it&#34; feature, and then a JS based search function (which sucks down an awful lot of JSON, but it&#39;s fine, and beats an active server backend for a personal blog).It&#39;s also impressive just how responsive a browser on a gutless wonder ARM SBC is when all it&#39;s having to do is render content, not run a bunch of JS!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way I look at it is: there are more tools in the toolbox than ever before. Which makes our judgement (the thing they really pay us for) even more important. Kubernetes, for example, is a specific solution to a specific problem. The solution is complex but so is the problem. If k8s give you the right trade-offs for your situation, then it’s not busy work.Of course, there are plenty of project where judgement Is thrown out the window in favor of adding a buzzword to everyone’s resume. I’ve heard it called “promotion-based architecture”, as in you pick the technology most likely to get you promoted. (If that works, it says all sorts of not great things about your organization).Regardless, I don’t think the availability of tools is the root problem. It’s and industry-wide lack of emphasis on identifying and understanding the problem first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You are experiencing what I call &#34;The Bisquick Problem&#34;. Bisquick is basically flour with some other stuff, like salt, premixed into it, and sold in a box in the USA. So instead of just buying flour and salt, you buy them together, which makes some things easier (like making pancakes), but it complicates literally everything else. You can&#39;t use it as flour, or as salt.With software, the problem is even greater. You can use react, for example, but you will probably start with create-react-app, which adds a lot of things. Or you could start with Next.js, which adds a lot of things. You could use Java, but you will probably start with Spring Boot, or Dropwizard, which adds a LOT of things. Plus all of these starting points imply the use of new languages, configurations, and programs, in particular, builds.In my view, all of these &#34;Bisquicks&#34; represent experiments-in-progress, with the ultimate goal of the systematic characterization of &#34;software application&#34;, in general. In other words, they are systems of alchemy, pushing toward being a system of chemistry, which we don&#39;t have yet. So it is bound to be a confusing time, just as it was surely confusing to play with chemicals before Lavoisier systematized the practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I generally agree, but two things I&#39;d like to point out.If you&#39;re using python for the web you&#39;re already part of the complexity problem, atleast from the perspective of someone deploying php 15 years ago.  I use python for web development, and I love it, but deploying webpages used to be copy an apache config and  ftp/scp your files to some location.   Now we need app servers and reverse proxies, and static files are served differently, and even though I&#39;ve gotten used to it over the last decade it does&#39;t mean it&#39;s good.The other thing is that MonoRepos are pushing back against complexity for the sake of complexity. Why create a new repo when a directory will work just fine?  I think a ton of people got repo crazy because their coporate jenkins server only allowed one project per repo,  but it is trivial to check the latest git hash for a directory and base your deployment on that. ...I have a project I inherited that has 14 repos for a webpage with maybe 5 forms on it.   I&#39;ve mostly handed it off at this point, but everytime I have to look at it I end up preaching about monorepos for weeks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If Stripe can leverage their banking relationships to leapfrog Plaid by integrating directly with bank&#39;s APIs instead of doing screen scraping... that would be massive! It seems like Plaid&#39;s biggest weakness is the flakiness of their connections, which creates so much frustration/churn downstream.Plaid&#39;s other weakness is their opaque, enterprise-style pricing, which is seems like Stripe is doing away with. Hopefully they can bring the price down, because lots of consumer-facing use cases aren&#39;t viable due to the high monthly price per connection.I hope they add support for investment account holdings—it seems like Plaid is the only one that does this well.—Edit: digging deeper, it looks like Stripe proxies to Plaid-like &#34;service providers&#34; under the covers—at least for institutions without OAuth flows. [1][2][3] Presumably they&#39;ll build in-house connections over time, but it dents my hope that their connectivity will be better than Plaid&#39;s. Either way, transparent pricing and more competition in the space is still welcome![1]: https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-is-the-relationshi...[2]: https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-does-stripe-limit-d...[3]: https://support.stripe.com/questions/who-will-obtain-my-fina..."</p>

I tried, it&#39;s really hard, expensive (I spend close to €1k and that is with b-quality stuff. Good stuff is 5-10x more expensive.) and can be rather frustrating. Finding parts to buy can be complicated depending on your locale, loosing parts is very easy and destroying parts, even when gentle and careful is par for the course.I hat to put my repair hobby on halt after running out of practice pieces.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tailscale has a fantastic product, I’ve been extremely happy from day one. If you’re waiting for a weekend to have a few hours to try out Tailscale, don’t, it takes 15 minutes to get every device you own up and running and talking. This is the lowest friction personal VPN to ever exist, and once you see how easy it is for your own devices, you’ll wish you had it at work.The biggest risk that this company has is that Cloudflare  (in all reality) should just buy them or reimplement it. It’s the type of product cloudflare would make, that’s for sure. Being based on open source wireguard, and being just a STUN/TURN server at its core… I’m sure that Tailscale will be the first but maybe not the best.I’ve been dreaming lately of a tor-like network that’s based loosely on the idea of tailnets. Rather than blockchain bullshit, you’d have a direct ring of trust with friends, and then you could set up access policies to forward packets for people you don’t trust, but who know someone you do trust.Web3 happens when people can host stuff on their phones, and Tailscale is something that lets you host things on your phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With such a huge investment comes the obligation to eventually pay it back. Is this another one of my favourite tools going the way of Dropbox, 1Password and all other companies that were formed around what should be a platform feature, which took on way too large investment sums and were eventually forced to become the everything, losing sight of their core values?I sincerely hope not, but there&#39;s so much bad precedent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone else who wonders wtf tailscale is:&gt; Tailscale is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own accessible anywhere in the world, securely and effortlessly. It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, which means only devices on your private network can communicate with each other.It seems to take care of key distribution, nat-traversal, authentication etc etcNeat! No sure how that is &#39;fixing internet&#39; exactly, but really cool anyway"</p>

He fired up Starglider- and I was simply blown away.My C64 didn&#39;t cut it anymore - I just had to get the Amiga. An involvement in the Norwegian demo scene followed.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former Googler here.  This person has correctly identified that a key reason why google sucks is that people very often...&gt; choose between doing what’s best for users or what’s best for their careerBut the root cause isn&#39;t that people want to get promoted.  It&#39;s that Google promotes people for the wrong reasons.  Put very simply, the problem is that Google promotes people for &#34;solving hard problems&#34; not for solving USEFUL problems.Imagine if people did get promoted for fixing bugs instead of building a new product (to be abandoned)!  Or if maintaining an existing system was somehow on par with building a new system (which is just a bigger more complicated version of something perfectly good).  The googler would say &#34;well those useful problems are too easy to merit a promotion.  Anybody can solve easy problems - we&#39;re google, and we&#39;re too smart to work on those easy problems.&#34;  Grow up.Y&#39;all value the wrong things.  That&#39;s why your culture is broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent over 9 years at Google. Got promoted 3 times. Was a manager.Google is absolutely bonkers when it comes to promotions. At every opportunity to provide feedback towards upper management, I had one consistent refrain:Everyone needs to chill the f### out.The stakes (seem) too high. The amount of time invested is too high. The amount of discussion, rehashing, tinkering, rejiggering, and calibration is just too high. It&#39;s off the charts how obsessed seemingly everyone is about it. It&#39;s off the charts how much company time was blown on it and psychological stress people were subjected to. IMHO, the process at Google doesn&#39;t need to be readjusted or tinkered with, but somehow de-escalated; like it needs to not be such a huge f&#39;ing deal.One positive development ~5 years ago is that promotion to levels L5 and below were mostly moved out of the IC&#39;s hands and into their manager&#39;s. Despite being a manager at the time (and creating more work for me), I thought this was great. It reduced the bias in the system from ICs writing up their own packets, which disadvantaged poor writers and poor self-promoters less. It got employees thinking less about promotion, since there was less they could control or do. There were other biases that crept up, but it helps the psychology of day-to-day life to not be stressing over the frantic ladder climb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It gets worse than promo-driven development.Recently we had a chat with a lead from another team. Their product has a lot of similarities with ours so we sync up every now and then to bounce ideas off each other. They recently release a big change that we thought didn&#39;t provide much value, so we asked him about it.His candid answer was &#34;you know how it works, we have a service running in production, so we need to make changes&#34;. This sounds simple, but the implications are deep. Unlike individual engineers, moving entire teams around is difficult. If you have a team, you need to &#34;justify&#34; their existence. Is not enough to keep the lights on or slowly polish the product, you need grand roadmaps to keep yourself busy the next year or two. Ideally you want to justify that you need extra headcount to keep the product expanding."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Decades ago, in the days before uber, my employer would fly in candidates from college campuses as part of an onsite interview. The candidate would fly in the night before and we relied on a taxi service to bring the candidate to the hotel. Then in the morning the same service would bring them to the onsite and of course bring them back to the airport at the end. It was a whole curated process.Little did the candidate know - we knew the driver quite well and he knew many people in the firm. More than once there would be a candidate who thought they could be rude and disrespectful to the taxi driver because ... you know... its just an immigrant taxi driver with a distinctive accent. Oops! Cost them an offer. But just as well. Avoided some arrogant jerks in the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I interviewed at Google in 2006, one of the interviewers asked me to write code for solving a particular problem.  I replied along the lines of &#34;ok I need to think about this, it&#39;s not obvious how to solve it&#34; and started thinking.  Time ticked away.  Five minutes.  Ten minutes.  Fifteen minutes.  The interviewer started reminding me that he needed me to write some code and if there wasn&#39;t anything for him to copy down into his interview notes I wasn&#39;t going to pass the interview.  (Why interviewers were all transcribing the whiteboard rather than taking photos I have no clue.)Eventually I ran out of time, having written no code on the whiteboard.  I asked my interviewer &#34;ok so what is the algorithm for solving this&#34; and he admitted that he had no idea.At the time, I thought he just meant that he had no idea what the solution was; but in hindsight I wonder if the real test was to see if I would crumble under pressure and write code I knew didn&#39;t work.(I got a job offer, but turned it down to start Tarsnap instead.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I interviewed with AWS, half the loop interviews were with remote staff.  I was shown to a videoconferencing room and asked to wait.  There was a pile of VC equipment but it wasn&#39;t connected.  With five minutes before we were due to start, I decided this was part of the interview and plugged stuff in myself, powered it on, and clicked through some boot-time screens, guessing at the right inputs.  A few minutes later a call came in and the interviews themselves proceeded normally.To this day I still don&#39;t know if it was a test."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny thing is, making cities more green isn&#39;t even _that_ difficult. I see above conversations on living closer to nature, or mountains vs parks - but the vast majority of time spent is walking and driving in the cities. So it seems a no-brainer that before everything else, before thinking about taking a 2 hour drive to hike, or making the time for a weekly visit to the park, we should first make sure the places people actually walk through and live in every day are as green as possible.There is no one solution, of course, since at the very least climates and budgets can be wildly different, but a good start is making sure every street has a green canopy above, starting with the largest. After that, take every space you can and put something living on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the sort of thing I think about when the pro-urban/pro-density/anti-car people talk about their vision for the world. I live in a city now, and the lack of substantial nature is suffocating to the extent that I plan to move. The idea that we should all live this way to conserve space—a resource which is only scarce in these urban places—seems excessive to put it mildly.EDIT: A lot of urban folks are rebutting my “substantial nature” complaint with references to their city’s parks, which is amusingly illustrative of our differing perspectives. I was thinking “mountains and forests”, not just green spaces scattered amid the concrete.EDIT 2: A lot of urban folks are talking like the suburbs are swallowing up the countryside. I’m sure they’ve grown, but it’s still a big world out there people. I can’t recommend a cross-country road trip enough. Y’all need to leave your cities once in a while and see the world that you have such strong opinions about! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the studies in the linked APA article have all the hallmarks of the replication crisis:- Small sample sizes (O(100))- Low correlation coefficients- Everybody is predisposed to believe the conclusion (what kind of monster doesn&#39;t like nature?)- There is zero incentive to report a negative findingAnd even if some of the studies do replicate, the response variable is often either self-reported, or performance on some written test or survey: so it&#39;s not really clear what we are even measuring. What is the unit of &#34;general connectedness&#34; ? How about &#34;eudaimonic well-being&#34; ? These are not legitimate scientific concepts.Nature is great. I find that a long walk in the woods is a good way to clear my head. But I&#39;m not convinced that these studies add anything to my common sense intuitions about the matter. And by using weak methods to justify something we all already believe (or want to believe), we risk degrading trust in science that will be greatly needed when scientists reach a conclusion that isn&#39;t politically convenient."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was surprised to see `$()` missing from this (otherwise quite extensive) list. There are a few commands listed which employ it, but it absolutely deserves its own entry.That and `readlink -f` to get the absolute path of a file. (Doesn&#39;t work on MacOS; the only substitute I&#39;ve found is to install `greadlink`.)And `cp -a`, which is like `cp -r`, but it leaves permissions intact - meaning that you can prepend `sudo` without the hassle of changing the ownership back.I never see `lndir` on these lists either. It makes a copy of a directory, but all of the non-directory files in the target are replaced with symlinks back to the source while directories are preserved as-is. Meaning that when you `cd` into it, you are actually landing in a copied structure of the source directory instead of the source directory itself, as would be the case if you just symlinked the source folder.Once inside, any file you want to modify without affecting the original just needs you to create the symlink into a file, which you can do with `sed -i &#39;&#39; $symlink`. There you have it: effectively a copy of your original directory, with only the modified files actually taking up space (loosely speaking).Looks like I have a few pull requests to submit."</p>

Watch out, that&#39;s a Linux-ism and macOS&#39;s sed will cheerfully use the thing after it as the backup expression; as far as I know, the absolute safest choice is to always specify a backup extension &#34;sed -i~&#34; or &#34;sed -i.bak&#34; to make it portable, although there are plenty of work-arounds trying to detect which is which and &#34;${SED_I} -e whatever&#34; type sillinessMy contribution (and yeah, I know, PR it ...) is that I get a lot of mileage out of setting the terminal title from my scripts:    title() { printf &#39;\033]0;%s\007&#39; &#34;$*&#34;; }

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Easy to accomplish (at least for me). One word: Dog. I walk daily 90 minutes at least. There was a time (and another dog, but thats not the reason) where it was more like 120-200 minutes a day outside. I live in a fairly populated town in east Germany. We have a solid forest and lots of lakes around. Its great and like 20 years+ later I know most of them, but not all.My coworker and I worked like a year together at my place. He came around, we drank a coffee together and started working. Like 3-4 hours later, depending on schedule, we took a good 60 minutes+ walk with my dog. We talked project related things sometimes, but it felt never like &#34;we have to talk about work&#34;, We were kind of friends so we had lots of other topics. Then back at my place we continued for 2,3 or even 5 hours. We had no issues stopping after 2 hours, but did often way more. We were very productive.We were a good match, but those breaks outside enjoying life (forced by my habits to go at least 60minutes outside with the dog) helped a lot not burning out and making room in the brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the anti-backpack mindset interesting, because I started urban walking after getting wilderness backpacking experience. I can&#39;t imagine walking around without a daypack, and I often bring it with me even when it&#39;s empty. On my morning commute today it held a Kindle, a spare set of headphones, and a plastic bag for when I buy more groceries than can fit in the pack. I&#39;m probably not going to use any of those before I get home, though.Backpacks are magic for longer trips. Food, water, coffee, all go in. Unsure about the weather? Layers layers layers, all in the pack. I also use LL Bean&#39;s PrimaLoft Packaway (I own two, one black and one orange), and have a shell for rainy/snowy weather. Unless it&#39;s both cold and rainy, one of the two goes in the backpack.I&#39;ve also never worried much about pocket preferences on my shorts and pants. I instead care about pockets on my packs. My current big pack is an Osprey Exos 58 (but the newer version doesn&#39;t have hip belt pockets or a shoulder strap pocket), and my daypack is an REI Flash 22 (with easily accessible side pockets, and a top pocket that you can reach with an awkward shoulder movement).Edit: The big floppy hat comment was absolutely spot-on"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After walking to and from work for 5 years along the same route, I found that I prefer walking without listening to anything on headphones.Just thinking increases awareness of my surroundings, allows me time to process existing thoughts as opposed to consuming more inputs, and connects me to the people I would inevitably see on a semi-regular basis.Personally, I have found that 1 hour + is a good threshold to aim for for some really quality thinking. After about an hour I&#39;ve already processed normal stuff about family or work and have moved on to deeper topics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The longevity of his employment is likely a result of the company&#39;s willingness to promote him instead of hiring externally, despite his start at the entry level. This is not likely to happen anymore, at least nowadays.From the article: &#34;After getting his first position as a shipping assistant, Walter showed outstanding skills and willingness to learn, always doing more than expected. [...] Shortly after, he was promoted to a position in sales. Then, he became a successful Sales Manager.&#34;I once spoke with a professional baker who started off as a machine operator for a bakery in his late teens, then earned promotion to become a production supervisor and then distribution manager. He then moved companies to become a plant manager, and later an operations director involved in baking formulation, until becoming an account manager (sales) for large baking firms.The commonality between these stories is that loyalty and hard work at a job has historically enabled people to earn a good quality of life. Nowadays, it intuitively seems like internal promotions from the very entry level are harder to come by, as many firms prefer to hire people with degrees for management or hire externally.Instead of promoting internally like in the past, I read and heard from managers they prefer to recruit externally for management positions. They perceive that internal candidates lack &#34;leadership qualities&#34; from past interactions with them, and/or perceive that they produce more value in their current positions. When asked how they account for these people changing jobs for promotions to lead elsewhere, the response was that they would say they understood the former employees&#39; positions and would wish them well (without openly reconsidering whether they were under-weighing the value of internal promotion)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s quite an achievement, and I&#39;m even more impressed he was able to do so in the textile industry that suffered so much in the mid-nineties in the region.Context: I&#39;m from the Itajaí Valley (where Brusque is located), which has a strong textile industry - one of the main drivers of the local economy. It used to be much stronger until the disastrous Collor government caused a number of them to go bankrupt or severely reduce their production due to some serious mismanagement of the Brazilian economy.Edit: His original employment contract can be found here (in Portuguese, a bit difficult to read): https://www.brusquememoria.com.br/acervo-imagem/2057"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dabbled in web-based mapping a couple years ago and found the tech stack to be really quite polished. Starting from a database of features from e.g. OpenStreetMap hosted in a Postgres-based PostGIS map server, and geographical boundaries via special shape files, you can write XML files representing the features you wish to see on each layer of the map (using SQL queries intended for PostGIS), and CSS-like style files representing how the features should look. You then set up a tile server (Apache or nginx or whatever) that generates tiles on demand and performs caching. Finally you use a JavaScript library to provide the &#34;slippy map&#34; that users can drag around.All of these layers of the tech stack have FOSS implementations; indeed most of the most widely used ones are FOSS. And then there&#39;s QGIS (also FOSS) to do most of this in a similar fashion, but offline.As merely a dabbler having a bit of fun, it&#39;s rather excellent I must say. It would be interesting to hear from anyone working in this field professionally as to how the FOSS tools measure up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s crazy to see how much has remained the same, even if so many new things were added. Looks like pretty much all the buildings that existed in 1777 still exist today.Even crazier to think that at the time the original map was made, pretty much all cities in the US didn’t even exist yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to see how segmented Antwerpen was back in 1777, what the author describes as hedges.These were usually the result of inheritance, when the land of one owner got split into pieces and each child then got one piece. They got smaller and smaller.I didn&#39;t think that this was already so extreme in 1777, but comparing it to the other maps, only Antwerpen and Brugge seem to be affected."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always been interested in repair and have done a good bit of mending on my own clothes. I have a few black tee shirts from Target from about six or seven years ago that have just gotten a few small holes that I&#39;ve repaired and you can&#39;t notice. Takes less than 5 minutes after a while from getting the thread out all the way to cutting it at the end.For down jackets, you can get yourself a roll of repair tape for ~$5 that&#39;s as simple as cut and place. I used to work for a large outdoors retailer and we had access to damaged and returned goods at crazy discounts. I got a $200 down jacket for $2.50. Add the $5 roll of repair tape that I still have and we&#39;ve got a great jacket that I&#39;ve worn for about four years now.It&#39;s kind of fun to do as well. Having sentimental value with the things you use is kind of nice, as long as you don&#39;t go overboard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had this beautiful bespoke suit which had just been hanging in the closet, due to me gaining some weight. After slimming down I wanted to wear it again, only to find a couple of large and very noticeable moth holes on one of the lapels.Welp, money down the drain I thought. Local dry-cleaner tipped me about &#34;invisible mending&#34;, so I did some research. Ended up shipping it to the UK, and paid around £120 for getting the jacket repaired - with excellent results. Some might say that&#39;s a steep price, but the alternative was binning a £4000 garment."</p>

125M and 30B parameters, and will provide full
research access to OPT-175B upon request.
Access will be granted to academic researchers; those
affiliated with organizations in government, civil
society, and academia; and those in industry research laboratories.&#34;GPT-3 Davinci (&#34;the&#34; GPT-3) is 175B.The repository will be open &#34;First thing in AM&#34; (https://twitter.com/stephenroller/status/1521302841276645376):https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick summary of the Limitations section:- &#34;OPT-175B does not work well with declarative instructions or point-blank interrogatives.&#34;- &#34;OPT-175B also tends to be repetitive and can easily get stuck in a loop. While sampling can reduce the incidence rate of repetitive behavior (Holtzman et al., 2020), we anecdotally found it did not eliminate it entirely when only one generation is sampled.&#34;- &#34;We also find OPT-175B has a high propensity to generate toxic language and reinforce harmful stereotypes, even when provided with a relatively innocuous prompt (Gehman et al., 2020), and adversarial prompts are trivial to find.&#34;- &#34;In summary, we still believe this technology is
premature for commercial deployment.&#34;With regard to stereotypes:- &#34;When compared with Davinci in Table 4, OPT175B appears to exhibit more stereotypical biases in almost all categories except for religion. Again, this is likely due to differences in training data; Nangia et al. (2020) showed that Pushshift.io Reddit corpus has a higher incidence rate for stereotypes and discriminatory text than other corpora (e.g. Wikipedia).&#34;- When testing with the RealToxicityPrompts data set, &#34;OPT-175B has a higher toxicity rate than either PaLM or Davinci&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you read posts like this, and also the previous, linked one [1], you can clearly see that Ron is a smart and humble guy. I really dislike the fan mob that it&#39;s starting the hate because RTMI is not going to be a throwback and retro-game.&gt; Monkey Island 1 and 2 weren&#39;t pixel art games. They were games using state-of-
the-art tech and art.This is SO true, and as much as I loved those games, as much as I stopped playing modern videogames and as much as I love the style of Thimbleweed Park, going forward for an artist like Ron is what _defines_ an artist. If you like MI1 and Mi2, just play MI1 and MI2 again as I do from time to time. Just like you would watch again a movie from the &#39;70s or listen to the Beatles. But you cannot ask an artist to stay always the same because you loved their first works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this post. I know a decent amount of indie devs, I also have done some hobby game development myself. I see this alarming trend of devs and small studios that are, what I would call, hyper engaging with their players. I get it, the players are important, you want to sell the game, you want people to play it. But, the entitlement and feedback I have seen from some players is just ridiculous. Most players don&#39;t have the fist clue as to what makes a good game, or just how hard it actually is to make games. I feel like this post was very elegant way of basically saying &#34;Shut the hell up, it&#39;s my game, I don&#39;t care what you want, I am making this game primarily for me. This is my art, and my way of expressing myself and sharing it with the world, this is not a collaboration. If you like it great, if you don&#39;t, oh well.&#34;, but in a much more palatable and acceptable manner."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really exciting. I wish we had nuclear power here in Australia. I know I might get downvoted for this comment. But with advancement in technology and large amount nuclear fuel (Uranium deposit) available, it&#39;s a great choice.1. Vast swathes of uninhabited land can absorb some of the risks/fears associated with a nuclear accident. With technology like this, the risks are even lower.
2. It&#39;s lot cleaner than coal and natural gas, which are still the primary sources of our electricity.
3. There will be a huge demand for electric cars in the near future drawing massive amount power from the grid. Nuclear power would be a lot cheaper and enable us to truely go green.Of course the coal companies won&#39;t like that. I can&#39;t see any reason why don&#39;t have nuclear energy. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SMRs are nuclear reactors that typically produce up to 300 megawatts (MW) of electricity, which is enough energy to power 300,000 homes for one year.I suppose anyone who has some knowledge re electricity knows what they&#39;re trying to say here, and for anyone who doesn&#39;t it won&#39;t make much difference, but reading a sentence like this still hurts me a little.MW (megawatts) are a measure of power, not energy.  This means the &#34;per year&#34; part is meaningless.  Also for what it&#39;s worth, 300MW for 300k homes is 1kW/home, which is a pretty old rule of thumb for average household power use.  I believe the current average in Canada (and the US) is considerably higher  But that&#39;s also just the average; the peak is much higher.  300MW is the peak output for the plant, so the true number of homes it could power is lower regardless, absent storage.None of that to say the prospect isn&#39;t exciting! And I suppose the source here is the weather network, so perhaps they&#39;re a bit outside their area of expertise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The background on Canada&#39;s plans for small modular reactors (of which this is just one of three projects) can be found here:https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Canadian-provinc...Supposedly this is promoting clean energy and fighting climate change, but the details don&#39;t always match this rhetoric.  In particular they&#39;re thinking they can use nuclear power to replace piped-in natural gas to mine the Alberta tar sands and make (very dirty) syncrude for export to refineries in the USA, maybe China too.  Yes, that does reduce natural gas use... but you&#39;re still burning dirty tarsand oil.  The better option is to just leave the tar in the ground.Otherwise, SMRs sound kind of interesting, but there&#39;s been a lot of failed innovation in nuclear reactors in the past.  Some of us might remember when safe and reliable and innovative pebble bed reactors were going to be the thing that made nuclear acceptable everywhere, and that ended up going nowhere:https://thebulletin.org/2009/06/the-demise-of-the-pebble-bed...&gt; &#34;For some, helium-cooled, graphite-moderated reactors such as the PBMR have always been the ultimate evolution of fission reactor design. The use of helium and graphite allows the reactor to burn the fuel efficiently and to operate at much higher temperatures than conventional light water reactors. It is hoped the temperatures would be high enough to allow for the reactor’s heat to be used directly for industrial processes such as hydrogen production and tar sands processing. High temperature reactors can also be designed to use thorium-based fuel as well as uranium and can be developed as fast neutron reactors that don’t need moderators.&#34;I was enthusiastic about nuclear 20 years ago... now, not so much, since solar/wind/storage really gives more watts per dollar invested, with less side issues (security, uranium supply, waste storage).  Nuclear has a niche, but it&#39;s going to remain small."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to have a reinsurance company as a client. For those unfamiliar, that’s an insurance company that sells insurance to insurance companies. Example: You buy a $1,000,000 automobile liability insurance policy with a $1,000 deductible.If the insurance company doesn’t sell enough of these kinds of policies to reliably offset payouts with premiums, they might turn around and buy a policy from a reinsurance company with a $10,000,000 limit and a $100,000 deductible against their entire portfolio.Thus, reinsurance companies spend a lot of time thinking about things that don’t happen very often but can be very expensive when they happen.And yes, they had a division that did propositions like hole-in-ones, and also they insured legal betting companies against wild trifectas and that sort of thing.I have a small trove of stories they told me about bizarre accidents that wound up costing enormous amounts of money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually had a chat with a friend about prize indemnity insurance, he&#39;s a Lloyd&#39;s guy.In the end it&#39;s the law of large numbers, pretty much what a casino does: take lots of small positive bets, don&#39;t let one bet dominate. If you do get something too big, syndicate it with some of your competitors to spread the risk. Of course also make sure everyone who comes for insurance is actually what you think, like the guy in the article says it&#39;s not necessarily a hugely detailed check but it is enough to stop the worst frauds.You want a model that&#39;s robust, and you only have so much data about how often some guy hits a hole in one or a half court shot, and there&#39;s only so much you can know about whether they are a pro and the distance to the hole.The big problem seemed to be competition. You only get to write the insurance if you&#39;re the best price but the best price is not necessarily one that makes sense for the business. If some guy is buying market share with a loss leader, what do you do? Every segment of the market could be affected by this at a given time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Among the weirder things he’s insured? Cow patty bingo (video here).“It’s big in the Midwest,” says Gilmartin. “You divide a big field into, say, 100 squares, give each one a number, then let a cow loose. If the cow poops on a preselected number, the person wins a prize.””I burst out laughing at this one. Can any Midwestern HNers confirm? Are people watching the cow with bated breath? Are plots closer to the gate considered better?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember about 20 years ago there was a (IIRC) Java Applet-based multiplayer clone of Zelda: A Link to the Past that was sort of a forerunner the to MMORPGs we see today. It changed names to Graal Online because of the lawyers.Thinking back to it, it was really ahead of its time, not only because it was massively multiplayer, but it had a great level editor and was doing user-created content in the late &#39;90s.--edit--Oldest I could find on the wayback machine is from 1999, but that&#39;s a later version that was a standalone exe. http://web.archive.org/web/19991012175711/http://graalonline...--edit 2--Here&#39;s a nice writeup: https://graal.in/t/graal-zelda-online-historical-thread/1420..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zelda Classic holds a special place in my heart.My older brother downloaded it thinking it was just a Zelda 1 clone. I discovered it had a quest editor. And it was a very magical moment for me.I spent hundreds of hours never completing any of my projects. It was the first online community I ever joined and actively participated in.Eventually I yearned for for power and discovered Dark Basic. Now I’m a software dev.Zelda Classic was a major spark in my life. And it’s a really cool piece of software. 100% original code, (obviously the default assets are lifted… from another project). It’s got to be a 20 year old project at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TIL about Zelda Classic which has apparently been around a long time https://www.zeldaclassic.com/development-history/Very cool port, I like that it tries to integrate it into the browser features instead of calling it a day after compiling. The lack of D-pad support is a bit jarring considering gamepads are supported but it was still very playable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many years ago, I used to work for Vodafone - and had some responsibility for their filtering stuff.One of the main problems was that, at the time, it was all managed by Blue Coat. As they were a US company, many of the &#34;violations&#34; that they picked up just weren&#39;t considered problematic for a UK / EU audience.Similarly, they would use blanked keyword blocking. So sex education resources would frequently get blocked. Although, again, that may have been by puritanical design.Anything which looked like it might be used to bypass their filters (VPN, proxies, etc) were also blocked.Ultimately, the customer isn&#39;t the user. It is the network who are terrified that Johnny&#39;s parent is going to go to the papers screaming about how the evil phone company corrupted their innocent child.  That&#39;s all it is there for - to protect the network."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A number of my personal sites end up blocked by corporate firewalls. It’s slightly infuriating. Even my own company. I got in a literal fight with IT needing to justify the why in why I needed access to my own website. Like I can live without it, but it’s nothing but my blog where I rant about tech. The why should be why is it blocked to begin with. The default state should not be blocked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Vodafone is a mess. I bought a 24Gb pre-paid sim which was supposed to last 2 years but they &#39;lost&#39; my plan after 6months and 2Gb of data use. Spent an hour on chat with them telling me that no such plan had ever existed until I told them I had all the receipts and evidence of how much data I had used and threatened to take them to the small claims court with expenses at £60/hr for my time. They capitulated quickly after that and restored it, then &#39;lost&#39; my plan again the next month.I&#39;ve had problems with billing glitches with four utility companies in the UK now and I am starting to suspect that overcharging people and hoping they don&#39;t notice is actually a common business strategy in the industry and if they get caught they blame bad IT but really their systems are configured to do this on purpose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See the issue here is that this data exists at all and it’s purchasable by any group. I feel like the CDC are the least scary people buying this data. And from the looks of it they used it for medical research, which if similar in style to other medical research is bound by boards and ethics committees.What we aren’t writing about in this article are the groups using this data Cambridge Analytica style to sway political opinion, and other less than stellar purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an excellent use of the data, a proof that it is worthwhile for the data to exist, and a terrifying demonstration that we need to grow the hell up with respect to data privacy.It actually sounds like the anonymization and aggregation was done pretty well for this. There&#39;s no such thing as 100% anonymity, but there are useful levels of anonymity.The fact that we don&#39;t have a standardized way of blessing data with varying known levels of privacy, checked and enforced by law, is kind of ridiculous in 2022.If you want to maximize privacy here, then let&#39;s pass laws to prevent doctors from knowing the gender, age, and weight of any of their patients.I 100% agree that privacy is handled way, way too loosely in general, and this does look like the CDC was a lot more interested in a grab bag of use cases than it was with maintaining anonymity. But surely that&#39;s an indictment of our societal failure to regulate data brokers? It shouldn&#39;t be up to the CDC to act counter to their mission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Headline feels a little misleading, they didn’t track phones per se, they bought data from one of the dozens of cellphone data-brokers that continue to operate despite legislation and congressional action/in-action."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not even about not willing to spend 1$ for a random phone number.Here&#39;s a list of things that are wrong with what Google does:- If you want to read your email, you have to use app specific password. I&#39;m ok with that.- You can&#39;t generate app specific passwords if you don&#39;t have 2FA enabled. That&#39;s some artificial limitation made to force you into adding phone number to your account.- You can&#39;t use authenticator app to enable 2FA. I have no idea why SMS which is the least secure way to send information is a primary method and authenticator app which can be set up by scanning QR from the screen without sending any information at all is «secondary» and can only be used after you give your phone number.- You can use «notification» to confirm it&#39;s you, but you can only do that on the phone. I&#39;m currently logged in in my browser, certainly I could confirm any login attempt from that same browser, wouldn&#39;t that be a second factor?- Nowhere in announcements or help pages or in the Google Account interface they tell you that you can&#39;t generate app passwords if you don&#39;t have 2FA. The button is just missing and you wouldn&#39;t even know it should be there unless you search on the internet.- Nowhere they tell you the only way to enable 2FA is to link your account to your phone number or to your android/iphone device, the options are just not there.All of this is just bizarre and ugly. I have no idea why other people are not complaining, probably most of them just accepted that and added phone numbers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every tech company is losing the war against credential stuffing. I have a friend working at a series B startup with &lt;10k MAU, you wanna know how many login attempts there are each month? 25,000 login attempts. Per user. That&#39;s 250m login attempts each month using stolen credentials.None of the service providers who claim to fix the issue are worth their weight in salt. Shape, Akamai, none of them have a grip on the problem because the attackers are constantly evolving. As you can see, even Google is capitulating despite all the fud that people on HN spread about the company being omniscient.Anyone who thinks this is about advertising/collecting personal data is out of their minds.The worst part is nobody can talk about it because anything you reveal about your problems can give the attackers a massive edge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google is no saint, but there&#39;s absolutely no reason to ascribe ill intent to collecting phone numbers of 2FA setup. The reason is simple: Google has billions of users, and at any given time, a lot of them break their devices and lose access to 2FA credentials. Phone numbers, despite all their flaws, are still the most reliable long-term and mostly-immutable attributes which can service as a proxy for identity which can and does aid account recovery at scale. If you crack your phone screen, you can walk to a brick and mortar cell shop, present your ID and get a new phone that receives security codes without a second thought. If you&#39;re using Aegis and storing MFA seeds locally, you&#39;re on the hook for backups and no one wants that responsibility.Think of it like using social security numbers to authenticate yourself to the bank. Yes, it&#39;s terrible, but it&#39;s kind of the only thing that works when done on a massive scale. Yes, you can do better at managing your 2FA credentials, but most users cannot - they struggle even having strong passwords. Phone numbers bridge that security-usability gap. To be clear, this isn&#39;t an endorsement of the system (I think the user should be allowed to choose), but rather trying to make sense from an engineering perspective."</p>
