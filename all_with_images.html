								<p class="story__comment_others">"This doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.If you&#39;re reading and you&#39;re really determined to overcome corruption, you need to document everything. Getting the other auditor on board would be good too. Make sure you assert that the privilege of holding office is yours, provide the certificate, and show them the laws. If they still deny you the authority and position, then look up a PA law called official oppression. Report this crime to the police. If they decline to cite/arrest, look up the process for filing a private criminal complaint. The DA could still decline to prosecute, but you could appeal that decision to a judge. Good luck (my experience is nobody in the system actually cares and they&#39;ll side with the establishment)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes company legal teams can be the most accessible way to draw attention to something like this, and I don&#39;t mean in a combative way. They&#39;re very risk conscious, they see a &#39;10+ years of building a heavy metal community, gone like a puff of smoke&#39; in terms of risks, both of bad publicity but also if you were to somehow litigate because of the damage to your business or project. Often they have an email address that is manned because they have to respond to legal requests of various types.You can potentially request all your data (and data about the hack) and let them know why, maybe reach out asking how you can get law enforcement involved and who you should contact after you&#39;ve made a police report. It&#39;s not a threat, but it get it on somebodies radar. If you express how devastated you are there is potential for them to help. They also have a lot more latitude than any kind of helpdesk (especially at the scale of Facebook, and the users/customers facebook has).They&#39;re also well connected with-in an organization because they have to sign-off on all kinds of projects and risks.I think `patio11` has amazing advice is a similar vein[1].[1]: https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768?lang=... (I think he has a longer version/reference, but I can&#39;t find it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Probably not the advice you&#39;re looking for, but looks like you have a blog also and am assuming that some/many of your subscribers also look at your blog. So, you may want to use your blog to spread the word about losing your page so that your subscribers know what&#39;s happening and you don&#39;t lose many of them.In addition, while you should keep looking at ways to recover your FB page, but you may want to take this opportunity to create a more traditional forum of your own.You may want to look at AVSForum.com, Home-Barista.com and others for ideas on how to structure very successful traditional review/forum sites and while it may be more effort initially as you&#39;ll have to build it yourself, in the long run it may be more fruitful for you.Either ways, Good Luck!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Universally necessary services like communication, healthcare, and social media (the digital plaza) can never be justly managed by private companies.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty incredible. These aren&#39;t just good practices, they&#39;re the fairly bleeding edge best practices.1. No more SMS and TOTP. FIDO2 tokens only.2. No more unencrypted network traffic - including DNS, which is such a recent development and they&#39;re mandating it. Incredible.3. Context aware authorization. So not just &#34;can this user access this?&#34; but attestation about device state! That&#39;s extremely cutting edge - almost no one does that today.My hope is that this makes things more accessible. We do all of this today at my company, except where we can&#39;t - for example, a lot of our vendors don&#39;t offer FIDO2 2FA or webauthn, so we&#39;re stuck with TOTP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real crux of the issue is the long-tail of applications which were never conceived with anything but network-based trust. I&#39;m certain the DoD is absolutely packed with these, probably for nearly every workflow.The reason this was so &#34;easy&#34; for Google (and some other companies, like GitLab[1]) to realize most of these goals is that they are a web-based technology company - fundamentally the tooling and scalable systems needed to get started were web so the transition were &#34;free&#34;. Meaning, most of the internal apps were HTTP apps, built on internal systems, and the initial investment was just to make an existing proxied internal service, external and behind a context aware proxy [1].The hard part for most other companies (and the DoD) is figuring out what to do with protocols and workflows that aren&#39;t http or otherwise proxyable.[1] https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/cloud-iap-context-aware-ac...[2] https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/10/02/zero-trust-at-gitla..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our corporate IT folks have a Zero Trust Manifesto in which there are enrolled devices (laptops that remote SREs can carry around), there are enterprise applications, and there&#39;s connectivity between these (e.g., tunnel pairs). SREs often need to write scripts that operate on sensitive production data from the enterprise applications, but must do this work directly on an enrolled device.Pre-Zero-Trust days seemed safer. Copying production data to a laptop wasn&#39;t allowed. Instead, each SRE had their own Linux VM in the data center, accessible from home and able to run the scripts (with connectivity to the enterprise application). This prevented a whole class of realistic attacks in which a laptop (while unlocked/decrypted) is taken by an adversary. Admittedly, in return, we&#39;re protected from a possible, but less likely, attack in which a Linux VM is compromised and used for lateral movement within one segment of the enterprise network. (An enrolled device has to be in the user&#39;s possession; it can&#39;t be any machine, Linux or Windows, in the data center or office.)The only people who love this are our enterprise application vendors. Our bosses are paying them a TON more money to implement new requirements where, in theory, all possible types of data analysis can be done directly within the enterprise application. No more scripts, no more copying of data. No more use of Open Source. And, of course, people from these same enterprise application vendors advise the government that Zero Trust must be a top priority mandate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Naomi Wu seems to upset a lot of people. She makes things, and was accused by the publisher of &#34;Make&#34; magazine of being a fake, with some guy doing the actual work. She replied by posting long, detailed videos of her making stuff. An hour of cutting aluminum extrusions with a chop saw and putting together a frame. Soldering PC boards. Eventually, the guy apologized.One of the useful things she&#39;s done is to put up lots of videos of her running around Shenzhen. There aren&#39;t enough ground-level videos of the working parts of Chinese cities. There&#39;s extensive coverage of Tokyo, by comparison. It&#39;s interesting to see the high-density housing blocks and street-level activity. (The &#34;let&#39;s increase housing density&#34; crowd from Strong Towns should watch those videos.) People who&#39;ve met her report that she knows Shenzhen very well, down to the back alley level, where some unmarked door leads to an important factory. She&#39;s toured the electronics markets of Huaqiangbei. (I miss the days when Silicon Valley had electronics parts stores.)She&#39;s done some nice technical work. Her main thing is 3D printing, and she came up with the first angled 3D printer that worked reliably. The print head moves in a plane 45 degrees from vertical, and the base surface is a belt, which advances the workpiece one layer at a time. So it can produce objects continuously, or very long objects if you add support rollers. Others had made prototypes of such machines, but the properties of the belt and print head are touchy to make that work right. She got it all working, and it&#39;s now a product, with her picture on the box.At various times she&#39;s pushed on GPL compliance, mask quality, and other issues of interest to the tech community.She wears skimpy outfits sometimes. So what? That&#39;s most of Instagram. Unlike most Instagrammers, Wu has something original to say. Sometimes with a biting wit. I gather that it&#39;s more biting in Cantonese."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For any Westerners here who seem to have a hard time understanding why this is wrong:Look at an even more women-oppressing culture such as that of Afghanistan under the Taliban. Women are required to cover their faces in public. Why? For &#34;modesty.&#34; What it boils down to is that if women show their faces it could have a negative effect on men (sexual attraction).A lot of people where are shaming her for being essentially immodest in her quest for female empowerment. A face is not immodest. A boob is not immodest. It is not sexualized because it is just a body part. It takes a man to do the sexualization, so the sexualization isn&#39;t the boob, but a man&#39;s who is doing the sexualization. A baby does not sexualize the boob (it&#39;s food). They get conditioned to it by society and culture as they grow older (a culture that sexualizes it).Sub out face in Afghanistan with boob in America and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s the same picture. While we should pat ourselves on the back for being so progressive as to allow women to show their faces in public, we haven&#39;t quite gotten to the point where it&#39;s ok to show boobs in public. And yes, some women prefer to wear burkas, just as some women prefer to hide their boobs in public.The point is that those restrictions on women shouldn&#39;t be dictated by the actions or effects they have on men. Instead, men should either change their viewpoints or control their own sexualization so that women don&#39;t have to accommodate. These immodest views come from those who sexualize women, and because that&#39;s out of the control of women so they should not be forced to accommodate something out of their control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh... while talented, she is constantly pushing the boundaries of taste and the YouTube TOS to gain subscribers.She pretends to be some women&#39;s rights activist when she&#39;s really just a purveyor of some weird type of titillation. Yes the algorithm is capricious, yes its arbitrary, and yes YouTube is evil. But she&#39;s clearly making a bust of herself naked. I&#39;m sure if I put my balls on YouTube they&#39;d be more than demonetized.I have no problem with her personally, I also don&#39;t find her interesting at all... but it is what it is. YouTube probably needs to classify videos more finely grained so that we can distinguish between types of videos and match tolerances for blue content to advertisers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first job out of school was at a dot-com in Vegas in the year 2000 initially as the network administrator. Susan was the Director of Marketing. My first interaction with her was typical assisting someone with some issue or another, but I noticed her book shelf was full of very technical books, and it turned out she was a Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert and I was just a simple MCP (I was new to Windows NT, my background was in Netware). I was about 22 and she was about 40, and it was very intimidating at the time, especially after I learned she was Susan Thunder.While the company was downsizing (dot-com bust) the CTO told me to batten down the hatches while Susan was being laid off. I told him that I&#39;m fairly confident she knows more about NT than I do and that I didn&#39;t think I could do enough to secure things, so we more or less shut things down for the night.I sort of remember the whole company being scared of her in general. I don&#39;t know why though, she was always very nice to me and seemed pleasant in general. It was an overreaction to shut down the network that night, Susan never attempted revenge. In hindsight, she was probably an adult that understood that companies fail and it wasn&#39;t personal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the JWST design started, there&#39;s been a revolution in the &#34;easiness&#34; of launches.I wonder if a future evolution of space telescopes will be some kind of interferometric (obviously extremely hard for IR or visible light, but easier for radio and microwaves) swarm of cheap semi-disposible telescopes than one enormous one.Then you can add to the swarm, upgrade elements, and retire failed elements without having to eat a multi-billion helping of humble pie.And rather than have a fearsomely complex integrated sunshield, you could have a similar swarm of simpler satellites that provide a large cool area at L2, and then the observers just need to handle their own heat.I suppose this could be described as microservices...in spaaaaace.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I say Bah to the entire censorship debate!My critique of Substack is that our lesson from the last ten years is simple: speech should happen primarily on platforms that are prohibited from profit-seeking and run in the public interest. Censorship on these platforms should be prohibited, of course, but so should any form of profit seeking.Our problem isn&#39;t censorship. Our problem is that our political/economic/religious/public health discourse is entirely mediated by corporations that are helmed by clever and well-educated folks and funded by the tippy-top of the elite financier class, who expect exceptional ROI."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;&#34;&#34;
One could imagine a very imperative “cluster operating system,” like the above, which exposed primitives like “allocate 5 CPUs worth of compute” or “create a new virtual network,” which in turn backed onto configuration changes either in the system’s internal abstractions or into calls into the EC2 API (or other underlying cloud provider).
&#34;&#34;&#34;There is a name for this: Single System Image. There is no need to write the operating system layer - Linux works well.I built a SSI. Each grid can host several apps, &#39;gridapps&#39;. As priorities change during the day, an operator can rebalance resources using a bash-like shell. Each gridapp has (1) core nodes, which need to keep running, and (2) scale nodes which can be started and stopped. Nodes can be configured so they are taskset-bound to an individual processor, or sharing a processor between several nodes. There are equivalent primitives for memory and persistent storage. Commercial, 1000 cores.The author contrasts this with K8s by saying that K8s is declarative. This is not the important distinction. My system had declarative configuration, and did a fitting at startup.The key difference is motive. The design above is the natural choice when you build a grid computer from first-principles.K8s is designed to solve a different problem: scaling up the traditional model of programming. Here, a developer writes an algorithm on their workstation. The deployment circumstances and interactions with other systems are an afterthought. Often this developer does not deploy the code themselves, this is done by another team who don&#39;t understand the internals of the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Disclaimer: I have never used k8s, so cannot assess the factual accuracy of this piece.)If Kubernetes hasn’t yet incorporated this article into their documentation somewhere prominent, they should. This is an excellent, and crucial, piece of documentation: providing a mental model and explaining key design decisions. All complex systems should have a document like this one. As a newcomer, this is what I want to read first.Bravo, author. I hope you get rewarded."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The posters here who are commenting on what should be (often largely what Kubernetes already is) would do well to read the paper about the Omega scheduler.https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.c...It is almost the rule that none of us has the breadth of experience to understand all of the problems that need to be solved. In fact, an explicit goal of Kubernetes is that almost all users should not need to understand much of how the system actually works.Frankly, most users have neither the time, inclination or intellectual capacity to understand more than a tiny part of the systems they work on. That includes most people who say they do understand those systems completely ... a few short questions can generally expose how little they know about important aspects.That ignorance is a measure of success, btw, not failure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I generally enjoy my AirPods. They are occasionally quirky, but most of the time they really do “just work” for me. The annoyances are annoying when they happen, though.The strangest part is that the annoyances aren’t getting any better over time. At first I assumed that they were growing pains of an early product launch. Yet now we’re years into the AirPods experience and they continue to be just as quirky as when I first got them.Apple seems so hot or cold on fixing their own bugs. Certain bugs get rapidly patched in the next iOS or Mac software release. Other bugs languish for what feels like forever. Do Apple execs just not use AirPods? Are they using a different configuration or hardware combination that doesn’t have these bugs? Have they just trained themselves to overlook the bugs because the workarounds have become a reflex? I can’t imagine working at any tech company where one of the flagship products had such a high rate of annoyances without having a lot of engineers diverted to replicating, diagnosing, and fixing it ASAP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s weird to me how many people are like &#34;yeah but every other bluetooth is worse&#34;. I have Airpod Pros and experienced every one of these issues and many more on the regular with them, but my several years old now Bose QC 35II never have any of these problems, still last like 5 times as long on battery after years of recharge cycles, interact better with two simultaneously connected devices, have better signal range before dropping out, and I can control the damned volume without trying a dozen times to get Siri to wake the fuck up because airpods have no built-in volume controls and Siri&#39;s voice activation is worse than terrible.The Airpods are set to connect automatically to my macbook when I wear them AND THEY DON&#39;T. EVER. And then calls on my iPhone will stupidly decide to connect and route audio to airpods that I&#39;m not even wearing while they are just sitting on my desk when the phone was literally moments before using the handset speaker for a video. Know what bluetooth device does not have these problems? You guessed it, the one not made by Apple. Like...come on.I really want to like airpods, but they&#39;re just not good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a few more:- Airpods sometimes do not charge when in the case. Usually need to pull it out and put back in again.- Knowing what airpod(s) and case are charging. The UI on the phone, the open the case sliding window, the widgets, and the case light itself are not very useful.- Spatial audio working on some apps but you&#39;re not usually aware if it&#39;s on until you tilt an ear one way to confirm.- Out of ear detection sometimes doesn&#39;t work well and will drain the respective airpod.- No preference list of what devices should have precedence over others. Especially when working on 2+ devices.- Hand-off calls is a weird UX. Why would I answer a phone on my iPhone by default when it&#39;s clear I have airpods connected and being used?- The transparency / noise cancelling dance. Not sure if there&#39;s a preference, but it feels random which one is on by default. Always do a double check at the gym or when running as outside noise sounds loud.Still the best headphones and experience in my opinion and have enabled me to achieve a hell of a lot more because of them. Easily worth the price for how much I use them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It costs $10,000 USD to build one of these&gt; The ten thousandth one costs $15As a software engineer, I&#39;m used to being able to build essentially whatever I want, with the only cost being my time. I&#39;m often unpleasantly reminded that software is an outlier in that regard and as soon as physical items are concerned, especially hardware, it turns out that manufacturing even a simple thing is prohibitively expensive if it&#39;s done at a small scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nice. This is a simple, straightforward design, and a reasonably convenient form factor.Two biggest limitations are RAM and wireless interfaces, or rather lack thereof. This thing has less RAM than my router (admittedly a $70 box), and has neither WiFi nor BT. It does not seem to have many GPIO pins, too.With the amount of RAM installed, it&#39;s mostly a handheld terminal, and maybe a handheld console with emulators for old games.While this is admirable as a proof of concept, I suspect that moving the price point up to, say, $30 could give a much more useful and hacker-friendly device.I greatly appreciate the split keyboard and the replaceable NiMH batteries, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In China we buy second-hand Redmi 2 for 60RMB each (roughly $9.5). Can be bought in quantities. Fully functional with 2GB RAM+16GB eMMC, and battery, touchscreen, WiFi, Bluetooth, camera, and even 4G support. It&#39;s not built from scratch like this one, but if you are just looking for something cheap, then this price is insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have never understood people who mourn the death of the &#34;old&#34; internet because I do not feel I have lost it. Particular communities come and go, as they always have, but I have found that the I can find the same sorts of gathering places for the same kinds of people I always have - in about the same numbers too.The thing that has changed is that a huge swath of new people have come online and, though some of what brought them online is wider access to connectivity, a lot of what brought them online are new kinds of communities. They showed up for social media and most of them just aren&#39;t that interested in the things that made up the &#34;old&#34; internet.I put &#34;old&#34; in quotes because people have kept and maintained the parts they love. You can still play MUDs, you can still visit BBSes, people still run Hotline servers[1]! Many of these communities have changed because the world has changed: lots of people who played MUDs in 1990 have moved on to other online games, but lots have not! Critically - tools have continued to be developed. You can use IRCCloud (and be told it makes you a bad IRC&#39;er), you can play MUDs on your phone, etc. These communities have changed with the times and improved for it.My sense is that the absolute number of people who are involved in these communities has dropped, but not actually by that much? Maybe half as many people play MUDs now as they did at the peak - but it&#39;s a steady half. I think of it like the communities around vinyl or around film photography: less central than they once were, but healthy and vital.I am really glad that people who were not online at all during their peak are discovering these older forms. We have kept them for good reasons. But don&#39;t call it a comeback, they have been here for years.[1] https://hotline.fandom.com/wiki/Clients"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sure hope that&#39;s right. It was the best feeling in the world to stand up an Apache server on my Amiga, and later my little FreeBSD server, and see my friends viewing the website I was hosting on my dialup connection. It wasn&#39;t pretty, it wasn&#39;t elegant, and it certainly wasn&#39;t fast, but it was mine. I made that. From installing the server to writing the HTML, I owned that service from end to end and had completely freedom to do whatever I wanted with it.That&#39;s what I want the Internet to look like for my younger family and friends. It&#39;ll probably never happen exactly this way, but I can picture someone running an IPv6-only service on their phone to impress their friends. I know what their smile would look like because that was once my smile, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this article doesn&#39;t address the reason why people moved away from the &#34;old&#34; Internet --- most people only care about their _content_ not the particular technology that backs it.In the old times, you could only host content if you were really good with the technology. The people who had websites were people who knew how to set up and run a web server, and to compose the HTML content that was being served. Similarly, communities who ran BBS forums, mailing lists, IRC, etc. all needed at least some people who could set up and manage the technology for them.Centralized services (Web 2.0) changed that. Now all of a sudden you didn&#39;t need to run your server --- you could just type some text and click some buttons to put up a blog on a shared service (myspace? blogger? wordpress.com?). You didn&#39;t need to run your own forum or mailing list or chat rooms, you could just put your community on an existing service that provided that (Google groups, FB/Whatsapp/&lt;insert your IM&gt; Chat). Need a forum? You have reddit. What is Twitter if not just a collection of mailing lists that you can openly subscribe to but not post on? Centralization allowed the vast majority of people to do what they wanted to do while &#34;outsourcing&#34; the technology part to somebody else, because most people don&#39;t care about the technology they care about their content.The problem with the modern decentralized web (3.0?) is that we haven&#39;t focused on solving the real problem --- making it easy to manipulate _content_. If anything, setting up a Web 3.0 presence is _harder_ than it was on a centralized service, and as long as it remains harder, the new &#34;old&#34; Internet will always be a niche."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I feel like I&#39;m encountering more and more sites and articles where I can&#39;t seem to find the date.It seems to me that its become standard practice on marketing type blogs for corporate websites to remove the date from their posts. I think its because (from personal experience) the company will go though a burst of &#34;blog productivity&#34; create a load of content but then not touch it for years, they don&#39;t want that content to look out of date or their website to look stagnant.Removing the date from their posts, or any other content, hides how old it is and therefore obscures how active they are at crating new content.Most companies try to use their blogs to attract new customers, a new customer may visit their website once or twice and will never see the blog again, it&#39;s not important that they do. They don&#39;t want it to look stale.As a counter example, an interesting thread from yesterday [0] was about how CloudFlare use their blog not as a marketing tool but for technical content and attracting employees. They very regulally use their blog, and so keep the date on it showing how fresh it is.0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30070422"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: On of the best friends of my oldest daughter moved to a new rented flat recently. When I saw the address for a playdate, I recognised it and said to my daughter &#34;I think you went to a birthday party at this address when you were 3-5 years old when another of your friends must have lived here&#34;. To corroborate this, I looked up the calendar on my phone, where I&#39;m pretty organised about putting dates and locations of events. However, at that point I discovered that Google Calendar only keeps 2 years of history!So modern technology is literally erasing our pasts. Not just calendar entries, but messaging systems (people used to keep handwritten letters for decades), and possibly even photos (if we&#39;re not careful about preserving them).Edit: See my clarification of the 2 years in comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30084620 below. I still think the point remains - we do not own or value our digital data in the same way as physical objects, and there is a much heightened risk of that data disappearing as a result, either by the owners of the platforms the data is stored on archiving the data or by us not valuing it enough to preserve exports and backups through long periods of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s search quality has taken a serious nosedive in the last couple of years - the last 6 months in particular.I think they implemented some new form of search term widening which is far too strong, so the results you want are often buried among pages and pages of results for the general category of things that you searched for rather than close matches for your keywords. Combined with the recency bias that other people have talked about and you end up with a lot less useful search for precise searching.This coincides with a large increase in the number of surveys that my partner has been getting through the Google Rewards program that ask whether or not a recently used search term gave relevant results. Obviously that&#39;s just anecdotal, but it does feel like there are substantial changes in the algorithm, and not necessarily for the better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Many site owners find that the titles they carefully craft almost all get rewritten.Yeah, I&#39;m with Google on this one. I don&#39;t see many reasons why a site owner would spend extraordinary amounts of time to &#34;carefully craft&#34; page titles other than SEO and optimizing for clickbaitness. As a user, I&#39;m fine with Google counteracting this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google has a guide on this :)https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearanc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Takeaway: to dramatically decrease the chance of Google rewriting your title, matching the H1 to the title tag seems to be an effective strategy.Of course it should be mentioned this wont last if it becomes popular. Historically every time an SEO trick gets popular, the rules are adjusted. Even having this article on the front page of HN might be enough to see Google react by rethinking how (or whether) tags in titles affect the title rewrites."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a different conclusion. The article mentions that the car would have cost her 3 months of income. That doesn&#39;t sound too much and is roughly about the same what people pay for cars today, maybe even more.The reason she thought about the car as a luxury and not a necessity is that then the society wasn&#39;t dependent on cars like we do today. They travelled less, worked closer to home, milkman brought milk to home and grocery shopping could be done closer to home as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting that he compares everything that is hard to compare but ignores one thing that would be very easy - rental pricing. You had to pay it then and you have to pay it now.&#34;four bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and a “nice outlook on green.” The rent was £90 for a year.&#34;According to one CPI calculator (https://www.in2013dollars.com) &#34;£90 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £4,951.54 today&#34; and &#34;£700 in 1919 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;.Google search also reveals that average yearly wage in London in 1920 was £205 and average wage in London in 2021 was £53,700 so £700 income in 1919 was 3.5 times the average which in 2021 would be £187,950 (quite a bit more than &#34;equivalent in purchasing power to about £38,511.97 today&#34;).A quick web search for 4 bedroom apartment (not sure about sitting rooms) in London shows that rent is between £2,000 and £8,000 per month - let&#39;s say £5,000 for a nice one like what Christie&#39;s sounds like which is £60,000 per year.
They paid £90/£700 = 13% of their (3.5 the average) annual income for rent and now the equivalent rent would be £60,000/£187,950 = 32% of the 3.5 the average annual income.Even just comparing the plain average income, person in 1919 could rent the same apartment and still have £205 - £90 = £115 to live on for the year (which seems possible considering maid lived on £36 per year but in 2021 the average income leaves you £53,700 - £60,000 = £6,300 short on the rent alone.So ignoring the tvs, computers, holidays, cars, healthcare and all the things that we cannot compare and comparing what we can, it is obvious that just to live in 2021 we need more money that what we are making and so it is easy to see how most people feel that the living standards have gone down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly enough, I&#39;m typing this in Singapore, where in 2022 it&#39;s quite common to have a &#34;maid&#34; (helper/domestic worker, in the current local lingo), but no car.Singapore imports domestic workers for poor neighbouring countries like the Philippines and Myanmar, which keeps wages very low, on the order of US$450/month, not too far off Christie&#39;s inflation-adjusted US$220/month.  Even the fully loaded cost with government levies, insurance, food &amp; board etc is on the order of $1000/month, considerably cheaper than most other childcare options, particularly if like most Singaporeans both parents work longer hours.By comparison, Singapore strictly limits the number of cars on the road, auctioning permits called &#34;Certificates of Entitlement&#34; to the highest bidder and imposing around 100% taxes on the cars themselves.  As a result, a plain vanilla Toyota Corolla costs US$120,000 all in.  What&#39;s more, half of that is the COE cost, which is valid for only 10 years, meaning the value of the car depreciates by around $10,000 every year.  Add in petrol, servicing, parking etc, and having a live-in helper to run errands and drop off kids etc starts to look quite affordable in comparison."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing everyone is getting hung up on is the fact that Amazon isn&#39;t wholesaling the dongle. The contract isn&#39;t a wholesale deal, meaning if your widget doesn&#39;t sell, it&#39;s sitting on your balance sheet, not on Amazon&#39;s balance sheet. It would be like if Costco instead of buying 1000 legos, just stocked legos in it&#39;s warehouse, then paid Lego company everytime a single unit sold. 
Then they figured out how to make their own legos through a different supplier, they fixed the original Lego price $5 more expensive then the store brand legos. Now Legos sell for $30 a box and Kirkland Legos sell for $25 a box, same exact product, just a few bucks cheaper. Oh and lego couldn&#39;t drop the price from 30 to 20 to compete....That&#39;s what Amazon has done. Price fixing and control of the competitors inventory. Damn bastards."</p>

With SBA, Amazon prices your products and owns any transactions that take place. When an item sells, they pass the proceeds on to you for allowing them to sell your product.

    With FBA, you price your products and own the transactions. It is a service where Amazon handles the order fulfillment process for your products.&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the author of esbuild. I think this is a very smart, practical choice and is one of the approaches that has the best chance of succeeding (the other being a semi-automated porting tool instead of a purely manual port). I&#39;m very excited to see someone take this approach. This is how I would do it if I were to do it. Web developers around the world are hoping this works out :)The hard part about this project isn&#39;t doing the port but keeping up with the constant changes from the TypeScript team, especially if the TypeScript team isn&#39;t invested in helping you out. Staying as close as possible to the source language like this will be a big win there.One of the big benefits of a native language like Go aside from lack of a JIT is the ability to easily add shared-memory parallelism. I haven&#39;t studied the TypeScript compiler internals so I&#39;m not sure how easy it is to parallelize their type checker. However, I assume that it would be relatively straightforward to parallelize the parsing of JavaScript files, so I&#39;d hope for at least be a big speedup there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when people try to make a new Ruby implementation. They get the basics down and think &#34;this isn&#39;t so bad! I can do this!&#34;. Fast forward a few months and they&#39;re stuck on some nasty little edge case around eval and method_missing that they need to run Rails. Or some weird aspect of C extensions.TypeScript&#39;s compiler is an unholy, unsound mess, because JavaScript is an unholy, unsound mess. Sure the basics of type checking structs and variables is somewhat easy. But what about conditional types? What about weird generic constraints? What about indexing types? There&#39;s some really confusing stuff going on underneath the hood.It&#39;s also a mess that *does not have a spec*. Even if you somehow manage to  make a type checker that implements most of the features, there&#39;s no way to ensure it has 1 to 1 parity with TypeScript. Plus that parity can be broken at any point.The only way I could see this happening is if the author somehow convinced Anders Hejlsberg or a significant portion of the TypeScript team to work on this new implementation. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s gonna happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; tsc depends on shared mutability and has a cyclical mutable reference.
 Rust is designed to prevent this behavior.
Having two references to the same data (shared mutability)
 is undefined behavior in Rust.This problem has numerous solutions in Rust - (A)Rc, RefCell etc. I don&#39;t understand how this caused the author of the article to stop considering Rust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something from the NYT mailing list yesterday:&gt; The Covid vaccines are remarkably effective at preventing serious illness. If you’re vaccinated, your chances of getting severely sick are extremely low. Even among people 65 and older, the combination of the vaccines’ effectiveness and the Omicron variant’s relative mildness means that Covid now appears to present less danger than a normal flu.&gt; For the unvaccinated, however, Covid is worse than any other common virus. It has killed more than 865,000 Americans, the vast majority unvaccinated. In the weeks before vaccines became widely available, Covid was the country’s No. 1 cause of death, above even cancer and heart disease.At this point if an adult in the US is unvaccinated it is (1) almost certainly by choice (there are some people who cannot get it for medical reasons but they make up only a very tiny fraction of the unvaccinated), and (2) it is very unlikely that any evidence or logical arguments will chance their minds.With COVID becoming endemic everyone is going to get antibodies, with the only choice being whether you get your first antibodies by vaccination or by getting COVID.The only question really then is how fast do we want the unvaccinated to do the getting antibodies by getting COVID thing. The faster they get it, the faster we can be as done with COVID as we are ever going to be.I&#39;d say the answer to that should be determined by the hospital capacity. If a region has sufficient hospital capacity that it would not be overwhelmed by the increase in COVID cases among the unvaccinated go ahead and lift most restrictions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The media&#39;s binary separation of populations into vax and unvax is a false dichotomy. More causal factors would be represented by:  1. Covid-recovered 
  2. Vaccinated
  3. Partly-vaccinated (&lt; 14 days after 2nd shot)
  4. Covid-naive + Unvaccinated

CDC reporting bundles #3 and #4.  UK reports all 4 categories separately.#1 was already a high percentage in 2021 and is now higher due to Omicron.Edit: CDC estimated pre-Omicron #1 as 146 million people (as of Oct 2021), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burd..."</p>

ARM is clearly less valuable as part of NVidia with all the conflicts of interest that entails than as an independent company.  NVidia talked about synergies but they could pursue all of those with an architectural license for far less money.  It&#39;s actually something of a pattern that most mergers fail to provide synergy and destroy value, it&#39;s just that they enlarge the empire of the CEO and so seem attractive from that standpoint."</p>

If the Nvidia deal is dead - which seems likely - then floating clearly seems unlikely to offer the prospect of the return that SoftBank was expecting when it paid a premium for Arm.The key question from an Arm user / customer’s perspective seems to be ‘Can Arm as a stand-alone company finance the investment it meets to stay competitive?’[1] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61d81a458fa8f..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wrote a thread[0] on Pixel 3 (trying to convince Google to extend the support) a few months before it went EoL[3] (Oct &#39;21). Here&#39;s the important bits:- 10M+ Pixel 3 devices that were sold worldwide- 72% of Pixel 3&#39;s estimated lifecycle emissions are from its manufacturing[1]. Using your phone is _not the source of most of the emissions during a phone&#39;s lifecycle_.- It has gotten worse over time, but Google hasn&#39;t offered better guaranttes. Pixel 5&#39;s emissions-over-lifetime are 30% higher than that of Pixel 3.The alleged reason Google can&#39;t offer support beyond 3 years is because of Google&#39;s dependence on Qualcomm for the support[2]. Apparently Qualcomm asks for a ridiculous amount of money to support any chip beyond a measly 2-3 years. Apple gets away with it by building their own chips, and Pixel 6 is guaranteed to be supported for 5 years as a result.However, the fact that Google - one of the world&#39;s richest corporation can&#39;t convince or pay Qualcomm to support a perfectly functional device in 2022 is astonishing.[0]: https://twitter.com/captn3m0/status/1427908406086553601[1]: https://storage.googleapis.com/mannequin/sustainability/repo...[2]: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/the-fairphone-2-hits...[3]: https://endoflife.date/pixel"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, Google needs really needs to do better.  Samsung has raised the bar by supporting its devices with 4 years of patches: https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-d....  And frankly, how hard/expensive would it be to support these devices for far longer? Google is a massive company, and I see little reason why that can&#39;t employ a team of devs backporting patches to older phones. Current versions of Windows and Linux run happily on decades-old hardware, so a phone should at least be able to get patches for known security issues for a decade.  Dev resources would be far better spent on this than yet another hamfisted attempt to build a messenger app that they&#39;ll kill in a couple years anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Destin of the Smarter Every Day YT channel had an interview a couple years ago with Dr. John Mather, the senior project scientist of the JWST, where he asked something like &#34;will you be nervous during the launch and deployments&#34;, and Dr. Mather replied &#34; I don&#39;t get anxious about stuff I can&#39;t deal with&#34;, and that they&#39;ve tested everything they thought of to test.I was super impressed with Dr. Mather, not only that he seemed so wise, but also that this super busy man took the time to do an hour long interview with a random You-Tuber. I think the JWST project is in good hands.Edit:
I guess Destin is not a &#39;random&#39; You-tuber, but someone that was well-placed to connect with Dr. Mather. Still, he&#39;s not CNN or BBC - he&#39;s a guy with a handheld camera that doesn&#39;t ask fluff question, but questions intended to help inform himself and his audience.

I&#39;m a child of the internet and had this view that seeing it on my screen was good enough, but wow is Night Watch incredible up close and in person. Overwhelming, almost. A totally different experience.That said, this image is amazing, and lets you see a lot more detail than you can easily manage at the museum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me and the wife visited the RM in Nov 2019.  The painting is rather large, so 717 Giga pixels doesn&#39;t go as far as you would think but you get quite close to the textures that you would see close up.Whilst you are there, please note there is rather a lot more to see than the one picture.  The architecture is worth noting too.  My overriding impression of the piccies on display is: &#34;sumptuous&#34;.  That&#39;s probably not in the fine arts&#39;s lexicon of superlatives but my personal experience.The model boaty exhibition is not as jarring as it might sound, alongside some very serious artwork exhibitions and is great fun.  It doesn&#39;t seem to really belong there at first blush but I do understand that naval prowess is rather important to the Netherlander psyche, so perhaps that legitimises it.  It does give you a bit of relief after having rather a lot of important art thrown at you.All in all, I cannot recommend the Rijks&#39; highly enough.  If you go anywhere near the Low Countries, then slap it on your itinerary.  The coffee is quite reasonable in the entrance cafe, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The malware is a cherry on top, but the story before that is pretty awful already, and unfortunately seems to be representative of specialized software like that: proprietary (with constant risk of malware, indeed), awkward, poorly (if at all) documented, likely the protocols to speak to the hardware without it are kept in secret, and occasional shipment of Windows machines where just software would do (but probably it&#39;s written to just barely work on a given system, and won&#39;t run on others easily).I think the main and annoying problem is those general practices, not just a single instance of malware.Edit: Apparently some focus on the &#34;Chinese&#34; part, but I suspect that hardware being specialized and software being shipped by the hardware manufacturer are larger factors here: at least all the awkwardness before the malware part I&#39;ve observed to be approximately similar with hardware+software produced by Chinese, European, and US companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given that Windows 7 _Ultimate_ was installed on what is essentially an OEM machine, it&#39;s very likely that it&#39;s a pirated copy with a &#34;home brewed&#34; license key.I think the most reasonable explanation is that either the OS was sourced already infected, or the crack tool they used was infected."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The story here is not the fact of the malware - it is the purpose of the malware: industrial espionage. China is well-known in industry for its sheer volume and brazenness of industrial espionage. A pick-and-place machine is especially well placed for this since it will, by necessity, have access to PCB designs and BOMs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m good at working on a team and looping in others. I also find it to be one of the most exhausting parts of software development. It&#39;s so difficult to constantly need to get feedback and buy-in from other people, and takes away a lot of the creativity and joy in programming (for me).Which isn&#39;t to say you shouldn&#39;t do it, just that it&#39;s one of the things that makes me dislike working on a team. I actually think this may be one of the factors in burnout for a lot of developers. Writing code as a team is almost like writing a novel with a few dozen other people, all of which have differing ideas on how the book should be written, or even what it should be about. It&#39;s hard to feel the joy in creating something when you&#39;re only a small cog in the development machine, and every decision needs a dozen voices of input.It&#39;s disempowering to feel like you&#39;re never able to make a decision yourself, despite supposedly being hired for your expertise in the field.&gt; Always encourage engineers to show their work as quickly as possible – an engineer on a project should never go more than a week without showing something, and usually it should be more like a day.&#34;usually it should be more like a day&#34; is bad advice in my opinion, and a likely source of micro management. Let professionals do their work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;the biggest mistake I see engineers make is doing too much work on their own before looping in others&#34;&gt; &#34;For more senior engineers, it can happen because they like to work on their own and may be overconfident in finding solutions.  It can also happen if the team culture is toxic and engineers fear getting criticism early in the design process.&#34;Not saying the above statement is incorrect but here is an alternative explanation that is also viable: Senior Engineers are often hired into large large projects so that the company has the capability to address emergencies or modify the existing system accurately as it is often more difficult to work on a large complex code base than to build a new one from scratch. Those engineers sometimes never get to work on greenfield projects and &#34;doing too much work on their own before looping in others&#34; is a way to scratch this itch without the opportunity being taken away prematurely. It also offers chance to produce memorable work as nobody remembers the set of 3 point tasks you completed ten sprints ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At least two things happened here:- The pandemic gave most people an unusually-long period of time at home to help them realize all the things they could have been doing (e.g. spending more time with family, not being stuck in a commute), if only their work had not been sucking up all their time and energy.- Income vs. expenses changed to the point where people couldn’t hope to pay off their debts even if they worked.  Work has not been paying anywhere near enough.  At that point, what is there to lose: if you will be swamped and in debt with work, and you will also be swamped and in debt without work, at least the 2nd option means finally not having to put up with the crap from many workplaces.Also, it has just become clearer and clearer where all the lies were told.  Society did not treat “essential” workers that way at all.  There was all kinds of prioritization of bottom line over employee health, especially early on.  We all assumed that governments could/would do a lot more to help.  Heap on all the unfilled promises for promotions, raises, etc. and many workers just have no reason at all to give a crap anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is the central bank inflation target typically 2%?Well if you target 0% and any actual result below 0% happens, that&#39;s deflation which is a disaster for economies.If inflation is say 10%. Maximum employment is near certainly impossible. Debt will be expensive and the economy crawls to a halt. Who wants to pay 10% interest on their student debt?So where in between do you have a good price stability? It tends to be around 2%. It allows for error in measurement, it provides safe cushion.The USA is at 7% inflation. This means the central bank is not doing their job. They by mandate should have drastically increased interest rates. Inflation almost certainly is out of control now. Looking at central bank balance sheets that are very far from balance, and looking at money supply M2. There&#39;s a solid 40% inflation coming. Lets say it sticks to 7%, this inflation will last probably 4 years.When inflation is so high and interest rates are not. The people winning are those in debt. Which is the government and youngins. However, it also means you cant save money. You must spend money as soon as possible. Tourism is dead for many years.Flipside, what does this also do? It pressures salaries. You are making 7% less this year but you&#39;re making 115% less the next year. So anyone in demand will be in demand and be able to buck the inflation curve.The people most hurt by high inflation are those who just retired. They no longer can demand more $ for their productivity. Their &#39;safe&#39; investments are way below inflation. They don&#39;t realize yet they cant afford to be retired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Great Renegotiation is also a byproduct of inflation. Workers are seeking better pay to keep up with the rising cost of living.Keeping in mind small business is collectively the largest employer and contributor to US output... let&#39;s remember the coming rate hikes will greatly reduce available cash to small businesses that operate with credit lines, credit card debt or via home equity lines. That is a LOT of US businesses. Now add to this increased input costs due to inflation. Now add increased tax rates. You can also expect lending requirements will tighten.So, it&#39;s worth considering the odds of worker prosperity (vs) the odds of a wave of business failures and associated unemployment/underemployment in many (but by no means all) sectors.Personally, I think the Fed &amp; Treasury will continue fiscal stimulus and capitulate hard in the face of a deep recession. More of the same can kicking, and we&#39;ll see what seems like prosperity. In reality, it&#39;s a delay of an inevitable downturn unless some magical productivity innovation or goods/services advance emerges to rescue the US economy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes. In the EU product &#34;denatured alcohol&#34; for most purposes is likewise treated with the same agent. This replaces the widespread use of methanol and similar products which are poisonous (yes even if you call the product &#34;meths&#34; it probably isn&#39;t methanol in the EU today). The rationale is that poisoning people is not an appropriate reaction to attempted tax avoidance. Alcohol is only &#34;denatured&#34; because booze is taxed, there&#39;s no technical reason to use poison, and so the EU took the poison out, for the same reason it doesn&#39;t execute or torture criminals."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I had Covid in December, I briefly lost my sense of smell and taste (only for a few days, thankfully). I decided I would see if the Switch cartridges tasted as bad as I remembered - purely in the interests of science, of course.I couldn&#39;t taste it at first, but then the wave of toxic unpleasantness slowly built up, even after I had moved the cartridge away from my tongue. It was different than I remembered it being, but then again it had been a few years since I tried it (probably spurred by this same headline). Really horrible. Good to know that this bitterant it still is a deterrent if you have anosmia!"</p>

With Cloudflare in front of AWS I paid $300 per month to AWS. With Linode in front of AWS and behind Cloudflare I paid $20 per month to Linode and about $12 per month to AWS.A Linode, Hetzner instance... or any other dumb cheap web server that comes with a healthy free tier of bandwidth is all you need to set up a simple nginx reverse proxy and have it cache things to disk https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/content-cache/conte..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah the old cloud provider switcheroo. Yip this is the way they make money. They make it easy to setup some gigantic hugely scalable website then hit you with a gigantic scaled up bill. AWS would do this as well.Team I&#39;m in at the moment is in the early stages of cloud adoption but the company in total has fell hook line and sinker for AWS. When I mentioned the cost there is always an excuse.The main one being that you don&#39;t have to hire sysadmins anymore as that&#39;s taken care now by AWS. Ah yes but they have actually been replaced with a &#34;DevOps&#34; team plus just our department now spend &gt; £1 million per year to AWS in hosting costs. A 20% reduction in those fees could pay for a few sysadmin(s).The next one is that no other vendor would be able to supply the kit. You know StackOverflow is able to run on a single webserver (https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-ar...). Plus many of the other providers have loads of instances available.I mean I&#39;m not against cloud it&#39;s just not the cheapest option if you choose one of the big 3 providers. I use a company called scaleway (https://www.scaleway.com/en/) they have all the essential cloud services you need and everything else you can run yourself in docker or k8s."</p>

I had a large file with sequences of 9 digit numbers specific to our use-case, all tied to names of people (employees). Whelp, at one point the tool I was working on stopped working, and it was flagged as apparently containing social security numbers (which I suppose matched the character length).Whelp, on the admin panel, you can get a report of those files, and then mark it as a false positive. Which I did. But then nothing happened, and nothing changed. It was no use.The hilarious bit: It did, of course, allow me to make a copy of the file in question, and then just point the resource I was building to the new file, which was exactly the same. Weeks later... so far, so good."</p>

Starting around Win8, the designers had full control, and most crucially essentially none of the designers use Windows.I spent far too many years of my career sitting in conference rooms explaining to the newest designer (because they seem to rotate every 6-18 months) with a shiny Macbook why various ideas had been tried and failed in usability studies because our users want X, Y, and Z.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30019307"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How do you deal with Microsoft&#39;s crap on a daily basis? Any similar stories?My advice is that, unless you are developing for Windows is don&#39;t. If you need the Adobe tools, you can get them for Macs and, since M1, Macs offer a lot of bang for the buck while being a perfectly usable Unix machine, they are an excellent choice.If you don&#39;t need tools that aren&#39;t available on Linux, then Linux is a really good option. Hardware support may be an issue, so I always recommend the most boring machines possible - Intel, with integrated graphics - and only get components you know will work well with Linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Nix and NixOS for a while and I&#39;ve seen four core advantages:1. Nix store: what the article covers: multiple versions of the same package, &#34;virtualenv for everything&#34;... etc2. Reproducibility: because package definitions are self-contained, I can pin and reliably reproduce everything for my packages. And I do mean everything.3. Flexibility: Nix works for system packages on NixOS as well as user packages on any Linux or macOS. I&#39;ve been sharing like 70% of my system config between Linux and macOS, and I don&#39;t know of any other tool that can do that.4. Programmability: package definitions and config are extensible and composable. Yes, learning an ad hoc language to do this is a pain, but once I learned it I got a higher-level and better-abstracted way to define and combine packages than any other tool I&#39;ve used. It&#39;s like going from C to OCaml. At this point I&#39;ve started hating Dockerfiles because they can&#39;t easily be composed and don&#39;t provide any real facilities for abstraction.Ultimately, Nix took system management from feeling like an operational activity—maintaining and changing a bunch of mutable state to run the system—to declarative programming. Learning curve aside, making system management a reproducible programming activity with no system state to worry about has been a massive improvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried using NixOS on a laptop for a month and switched back to Arch a couple of months ago. It was an interesting experience - I never used functional programming language before, but nix was pretty ok as a configuration language. It looks like funny version of JSON with functions.Debugging it was a real pain though - I was trying to write (or copy from someone else config) a function to recursively import all modules from a folder and the error messages were hard to understand with stacktraces ending somewhere deep in standard library.The other problem was with nixpkgs, i.e. I haven&#39;t found a clear list of packages that were going to be updated. Jetbrains IDEA was updating very slowly and when I wanted to pin a version of it simply overriding version variable in the overlay was not enough - there were also some other linked variables. Emacs package from custom overlay constantly tried to compile itself, requiring me to check build status on hydra build system.In the end I decided that it&#39;s not really worth it. I don&#39;t have many systems and services to manage and for a raspberry pi and a vps multiple docker-compose.yaml files in git repo is enough. 
I think Henrik Lissner (author of Doom Emacs) wrote a really good piece about why someone should choose to use NixOS - https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles#frequently-asked-questi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;&#34;&#34;The first is relatively simple: they developed their own programming language to do configuration, which is not very good and is extremely difficult to learn. The vast majority of people using NixOS do not understand the language, and simply copy/paste example configurations, which mostly works until you need to do something complicated, at which point you&#39;re completely high and dry.&#34;&#34;&#34;Maybe this is nitpicking, but: the Nix language is about as straightforward as &#34;JSON plus functions&#34;. Maybe that is difficult for people who haven&#39;t had an experience with pure/functional programming?Though, yes, the way Nix is used can be quite complicated/sophisticated. -- Even if all of Nixpkgs were translated to JavaScript, I think it&#39;d still be complicated to understand. (Though I suspect using a more general purpose language would allow for more footguns).+1 to the sentiment that most of the time you can get by just fine, but when you can&#39;t, NixOS is more difficult to make progress with compared to other Linux distributions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like it, it&#39;s readable, unlike some SQL alternatives I&#39;ve seen it doesn&#39;t make me feel like I&#39;m dumb and don&#39;t understand what a query even is.I can&#39;t decide if it would be better or worse if it stuck more closely to SQL keywords. You use &#34;from&#34; and &#34;select&#34;, but not &#34;where&#34;, &#34;order by&#34;, &#34;group by&#34;. There&#39;s some danger of it being in an uncanny valley of SQLish, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d prefer just using those terms verbatim (including the space in &#34;order by&#34;... that style is less common in modern languages but it&#39;s not really that much harder to parse).I&#39;d like to see more examples of joins and composing SQL. Does this language make it easier to make more general SQL queries? Can I take two queries and squash them together in a reliable way? I feel like I end up with a lot of theme and variation in my queries, often involving optional filters.I might even like a notion of encapsulation that could help this query language when it&#39;s embedded in other languages. Like if I could say, in the language itself, that a query has certain unbound variables (and not just ? or other placeholders). This language seems like it would be better for generating than SQL, and sometimes generation is just necessary (like in any application that supports data exploration), but for most common cases I&#39;d hope to avoid that. Defining inputs and then making whole filter sections or other statements conditional on those inputs would help here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the flow direction compared to standard SQL.  SQL is supposed to read like a sentence I suppose but I have many times looked at it and really wanted things to be in a more logical order.My main suggestion would be to be a bit less terse and introduce a bit more firm formatting.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of the term &#34;split&#34; and feel like jazzing that up to &#34;split over&#34; or even just reviving &#34;group by&#34; would improve readability.  Additionally the aliasing could use work, I&#39;d suggest reversing the assignment to be something closer to `use salary + payroll_tax as gross salary`.  In terms of firm formatting, unless I&#39;m missing something there isn&#39;t any reason to allow a filter statement before any aliases - so you can force two fixed positions for filter clauses which would make it always legal to reference aliases in filters.On the brief topic of form vs. flexibility.  SQL is a thing that, when complex, is written by many people over the course of its lifetime - removing the ability to make bad decisions is better than enabling the ability to write simple things even simpler - those silly do nothing queries like &#34;SELECT * FROM customer WHERE deleted=&#39;f&#39;` are written once[1] in a moments time and never inspected again.  The complex queries are what you want to optimize for.1. If they even are - with ORMs available a lot of those dead simple queries just end up being done through an ORM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now this is actually nice, unlike the other suggestion posted today[1].Maybe I&#39;m just too used to non-standard extensions of our database but the SQL example could, at least for our db, be rewritten as    SELECT TOP 20
        title,
        country,
        AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
        SUM(salary) AS sum_salary,
        AVG(gross_salary) AS average_gross_salary,
        SUM(gross_salary) AS sum_gross_salary,
        AVG(gross_cost) AS average_gross_cost,
        SUM(gross_cost) AS sum_gross_cost,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM (
        SELECT
            title,
            country,
            salary,
            (salary + payroll_tax) AS gross_salary,
            (salary + payroll_tax + healthcare_cost) AS gross_cost
        FROM employees
        WHERE country = &#39;USA&#39;
    ) emp
    WHERE gross_cost &gt; 0
    GROUP BY title, country
    ORDER BY sum_gross_cost
    HAVING count &gt; 200

This cuts down the repetition a lot, and can also help the optimizer in certain cases. Could do another nesting to get rid of the HAVING if needed.Still, think the PRQL looks very nice, especially with a &#34;let&#34; keyword as mentioned in another thread here.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30053860"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"His claims about HN are false. Short version: his post was 2+ hours later than Stripe&#39;s, not an hour earlier, and fell in rank because users flagged it, not because moderators did anything (which I suppose is what his mafia/mob language was intended to imply).The longer version is going to involve a tedious barrage of links, but I want this to be something that people can check for themselves if they care to.Quoting from https://twitter.com/theryanking/status/1485784877060349953 and https://twitter.com/theryanking/status/1485784882173255680:&gt; Both had organically made it up to #1 on Hacker News with 100s of upvotesTheir first post, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16215092, made it to #2 (http://hnrankings.info/16215092/) and got 171 upvotes. The second, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16870692, made it to #4 (http://hnrankings.info/16870692/) and got 70 upvotes.&gt; On April 18, 2018, we posted this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16870692 [...] An ~hour later, this showed up: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16869290. Ours disappeared.Stripe&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16869290) was submitted at 17:41 UTC, and Bolt&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16870692) was submitted over 2 hours later, at 20:08 UTC. If you want external evidence for that, look at the hnrankings.info pages for the two posts (Stripe: http://hnrankings.info/16869290/, Bolt: http://hnrankings.info/16870692/). You&#39;ll see that they first pick up Stripe&#39;s post on the front page at 17:45 and Bolt&#39;s at 20:30. You&#39;ll also see that Stripe&#39;s post made it to #2, not #1 as he claims.Here&#39;s the HN front page at 19:09 that day: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418190904/https://news.ycom.... Stripe&#39;s post is already at #2. Bolt&#39;s hasn&#39;t been submitted yet. The first snapshot with Bolt on the front page is at 20:35: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418203508/https://news.ycom.... By 21:21, Bolt&#39;s briefly makes it higher than Stripe&#39;s: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418212112/https://news.ycom....&gt; Ours disappearedBolt&#39;s post fell in rank because it was flagged by users—that is the drop you can see in http://hnrankings.info/16870692/ and in this snapshot by 21:21: https://web.archive.org/web/20180418222105/https://news.ycom....I don&#39;t know why users flagged it. (Edit: generally, though, if you want to figure this out, the best place to look is in the comments. The top subthread in the Bolt thread is users complaining about non-transparent, enterprise-style pricing, which is a classic HN complaint. The same complaints had appeared in their earlier thread, for example https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16215604 and
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16215578. We actually downweighted both of those complaints. That&#39;s standard HN moderation when a repetitive-indignant comment is stuck at the top of a thread.)None of the flags came from YC founders or staff. (Edit: I looked into whether it might have been Stripe people doing the flagging here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30070445.) HN moderators did not make the post fall in rank, or moderate the post at all. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever heard of Bolt before today.The article no longer exists on bolt.com, but if you want to compare it to
the stripe.com article, the articles are here:https://web.archive.org/web/20180418201841/https://blog.bolt...https://web.archive.org/web/20180418171628/https://stripe.co...His insinuations about HN are false too. He&#39;s clearly insinuating that we use insider powers to favor stripe.com submissions with special treatment on HN. That&#39;s precisely what we don&#39;t do.Stripe succeeded on HN because they were favored by the community for many years. They are one of a small number of startups who have reached what you could call &#39;community darling&#39; status on HN. It&#39;s true that this is incredibly hard to do. Another startup that managed it, around the same time, was Cloudflare (not a YC startup). Startups achieve this by doing three things: producing products that the community considers good, producing articles that the community finds interesting, and mastering the art of interacting with the community. You need all three.I wish more startups would achieve this, YC or not. Whenever I run across one that&#39;s trying to succeed on HN, I try to help them do so (YC or not)—why? because it makes HN better if the community finds things it loves here. Among the startups of today, I can think of only two offhand who are showing signs of maybe reaching darling status—fly.io (YC), and Tailscale (not YC).All 4 of the startups I&#39;ve mentioned have the advantage that they were|are targeting programmers, which gives them a cultural fast track to developing rapport with this community—sort of a ladder in the snakes-and-ladders game. However, that&#39;s not a sufficient condition for getting a satisfying click with the community, and it isn&#39;t a necessary one either. The real problem is that so much of the content that startups produce to try to interest this community just isn&#39;t interesting enough (to this community), and often it gives off inadvertent signals of being uninteresting—things like seeming too enterprisey, or too slick in the marketing department.If the bolt.com people had asked us for help, I would have been just as happy to help them as anybody else. I would have told them that the opening of their article (https://web.archive.org/web/20180418201841/https://blog.bolt...) was too enterprisey to appeal to HN. The language is drawn from ecommerce retailing, which makes sense given the little bit we&#39;ve all learned about Bolt today, but is the kind of thing that comes across as boring on HN. The references to Gartner and Experian feel like reading an enterprise whitepaper, which actually detracts from credibility with the HN audience.This is the sort of thing I&#39;ve told countless startups over the years. It&#39;s dismayingly difficult to express this information in a way that people can actually absorb, but I have a set of notes that I&#39;ve sent to many startups in this position, which I plan to turn into an essay about how to write for HN. if anyone wants a copy, email hn@ycombinator.com and I&#39;ll be happy to send it to you.I had a bunch of other things I wanted to say here, but mercifully, I&#39;ve forgotten them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think if you get over the drama here and implied &#34;dirtiness&#34;, the main result is still a bit interesting.Even if you exclude the implied carteling and take everything he said with a grain of salt, the outcomes of this incentive structure are clear: once SV (i.e. the YC centered VC machine) gets into a space and has a main horse, SV can no longer incubate new innovation/competition in the space. It can also very likely become predatory to the potential innovators that SV is supposed to support.At a more macro scale, this means that YC will fade in the same way as everything else does because it won&#39;t be able to entertain a wave of innovators, and they will, as he did, seek and build the next SV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had never heard of Bolt before today that I can remember but since I&#39;m woking on a project that needs CC processing (it has Stripe currently, I&#39;m moving to another provider) I was interested. I looked at their website and immediately felt like it wasn&#39;t aimed at me. I don&#39;t care about 1-click anything, I want to know about how to use this, api calls, how to capture an auth, etc. I see the developer menu item and I click on &#34;Get Started&#34;. Immediately I&#39;m shown a list of plugins for CRM/e-commerce-type tools which, and maybe this is elitist, but that&#39;s turn off for me. Don&#39;t get me wrong I cut my chops on WP/Drupal and the like but it been a long time and I want docs with an API call to charge a card or similar. I see the &#34;API&#34; and &#34;SDK&#34; in the sidebar and check both out. API docs are swagger, that&#39;s fine, but it&#39;s not clear at all and the &#34;workflow&#34; to charge a card is. I go look at &#34;SDK&#34; and they only have an iOS SDK, is this a joke? Not to mention that it looks like you need to bring your own payment processor [0] and &#34;The processor implementation timelines average 2-4 weeks.&#34;, at this point you are better off talking directly to someone like First Data. Let&#39;s not get started on the apparent &#34;contact us for pricing&#34;.Bottom line: Bolt is completely uninteresting to me as a developer and the creator sounds like sour grapes in his twitter tirade. I&#39;m glad to be moving off Stripe for way cheaper processing but I love their docs, dashboard, etc and I&#39;ll miss it. Bolt would have been discarded as not a serious competitor almost immediately had I seen it back when I first integrated with Stripe. In fact, they seem to provide something 100% different to Stripe and even have Stripe as a payment processor.[0] https://help.bolt.com/developers/guides/processor-guides/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny enough, I decided to play with FreeBSD for personal projects in 2020. I gave up and I am reverting all my servers to Linux in 2022, for the opposite of the reasons mentioned in this article.* Lack of systemd. Managing services through shell scripts is outdated to me. It feels very hacky, there is no way to specify dependencies, and auto-restarts in case of crashes. Many FreeBSD devs praise launchd, well... systemd is a clone of launchd.* FreeBSD jail are sub-optimal compared to systemd-nspawn. There are tons of tools to create freebsd jails (manually, ezjail, bastillebsd, etc…) half of them are deprecated. At the end all of your jails end up on the same loopback interface, making it hard to firewall. I couldn&#39;t find a way to have one network interface per jail. With Linux, debootstrap + machinectl and you&#39;re good to go.* Lack of security modules (such as SELinux) -- Edit: I should have written &#34;Lack of good security module&#34;* nftables is way easier to grasp than pf, and as fast as pf, and has atomic reloads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reasons are, for a large part, not on the technical side. I was surprised, because this this a lot of work for little visible gain. Here are the reasons, slightly abbreviated:&gt; The whole system is managed by the same teamMostly philosophical.&gt; FreeBSD development is less driven by commercial interests.Mostly philosophical.&gt; Linux has Docker but FreeBSD has jails!IMO, this comparison is a mistake. In the Linux world, systemd&#39;s nspawn is very similar to Jails. It&#39;s a glorified chroot, with security and resource management. All the systemd tools work seemlessly with nspawn machines (e.g. `systemctl status`). Containers à la Docker are a different thing.BTW, I thought the last sentence about security issues with Docker images was strange. If you care about unmaintained images, build them yourself. On the other side, the FreeBSD official documentation about Jails has a big warning that starts with &#34;Important: the official Jails are a powerful tool, but they are not a security panacea.&#34;&gt; Linux has no official support for zfs and suchFair point, though I&#39;ve heard about production systems with zfs on Linux.&gt; The FreeBSD boot procedure is better than grub.YMMV&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s network is more performant.Is there some conclusive recent benchmark about this. The post uses a 2014 post about ipv6 at Facebook, which I think is far from definitive today. Especially more since it &#34;forgot&#34; to mention that Facebook intended to enhance the &#34;Linux kernel network stack to rival or exceed that of FreeBSD.&#34; Did they succeed over these 8 years ?&gt; Straightforward system performance analysisThe point is not about the quality of the tools, but the way each distribution packages them. Seems very very low impact to me.&gt; FreeBSD&#39;s Bhyve against Linux&#39;s KVMThe author reluctantly admits that KVM is more mature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Some time ago we started a complex, continuous and not always linear operation, that is to migrate, where possible, most of the servers (ours and of our customers) from Linux to FreeBSD.&#34;I don&#39;t really disagree with any of the stated reasons, but I also didn&#39;t see a reason that would make me even consider making the move with our servers, or even bother with some small number of servers. At least for me, I&#39;d need a bunch of REALLY GOOD reasons to consider a move like that. A huge cost savings AND some huge time savings in the future might do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GitHub Actions with act to test stuff locally is actually pretty usable. We use on-prem k8s-hosted runners to get access to servers/clusters with limited internet access, works great.But as always with “”gitops”” themed tools I think it’s pretty awkward to handle rollbacks. Either you take the stance that master is the source of truth and let the CI/CD tooling revert commits if deployment fails, or you store that state elsewhere and allow e.g manifests to diverge from git.I would be curious to hear how other people do it"</p>

To be a superset, all, that&#39;s A L L valid JSON strings must also be valid YAML to be a superset. A single failure makes it not a superset.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Are people not even reading about what they are using?Always read documentation or you will get burned by something completely innocuous. For example, that’s how you get Norway missing in your config file with YAML:  NI: Nicaragua

  NO: Norway

Oops, “NO” evaluates to false like 10 other reserve words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a love-hate relationship with YAML.Hate:- human-wise ambiguity of its syntax (If I understand correctly, you &#34;can&#34; indent array items, but you don&#39;t have to. And than one guys says &#34;OK, I&#39;m gonna indent&#34;, and another guy says &#34;Nah. I&#39;m not gonna indent&#34;)- still no support for datetime as a first class citizen- strings usually don&#39;t need quotes, until they do (I prefer to always quote)Note that two of the above points are about allowing inconsistent styles, which is a thing I hate.Love:- it supports comments whereas JSON does not. If the IETF ever officially updated JSON to support C-style inline (and maybe block) comments, I would absolutely ditch YAML."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once upon a time I worked at Google.I returned to Austin to visit old friends and took the opportunity to visit the Google office there. The Googlers sitting around me were primarily corporate sales.They weren&#39;t getting any corporate sales calls at all as far as I could tell, but there was one extremely irate user who was locked out of their GMail account and was repeatedly calling them because they were the only human beings at Google the user was able to get in touch with, via something like &#34;Press 3 for Corporate Sales.&#34; Of course these poor Google corporate sales people had absolutely no way to help this user even if they wanted to. Google literally did not have any GMail account phone support (at least at the time).I could hear the poor guy screaming through their headsets about how he paid Google something for some service and was entitled to phone support and he demanded someone help him, but they just kept saying, &#34;This is corporate sales. We do not offer consumer account support. If you want support, please visit the Google Support Forums at www dot...&#34;After they hung up on him 3 or 4 times, eventually a manager got on the phone and told him (between his screams), &#34;Look, you&#39;re not getting any phone support because it doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s nowhere for us to transfer you. There&#39;s nobody who can call you back about this. Your only option is to search the forums for an answer to your problem. I am going to terminate this call now. Sir, I&#39;m going to terminate this call. No, we can&#39;t help you. Nobody at Google can help you. I am terminating this call now. We asked you to stop calling this number. Do not call us again. &lt;click&gt;&#34;I&#39;d frequently tell my co-workers, &#34;If you&#39;re not paying for it, you&#39;re the product.&#34; That experience underscored that notion for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They also do this thing now where they block [1] smaller browsers (even ones using the latest version of chromium) under the guise of security. According to their docs they&#39;re fighting MITMs by generally disallowing any browser they can&#39;t identify (so the big few).If you&#39;re not on a whitelisted browser by Google, you can&#39;t log in (effectively, use) any of their properties.This feels very anti-competitive to me. Notably all the whitelisted browsers are either theirs (Chrome) or sell them their search traffic. I&#39;m building a browser for research [2]  and have to frequently find workarounds. I&#39;m not quite sure who I&#39;d contact to get on said whitelist either...[1] https://imgur.com/a/DASVkhl (here is the issue in the Vim browser and Min browser)[2] https://synth.app"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had this. It was telling me to try again &#39;later&#39;. Ok, i did &#39;try later&#39; every day for three weeks, and they didn&#39;t let me in. Using the very same IP address as I used to always access it, no less.Then, I gave up, moved all my services to another email account, and after 2 or 3 months tried logging in, and it suddenly allowed me to log in.Needless to say, I will never again use gmail for critically important things."</p>

They also have usable solutions for auth and storage, which like, if you&#39;re thinking of writing something like this are the first things you&#39;d start reaching for. They also work hard to enable you to run all your own services, so you don&#39;t rely on the Charm cloud for everything. Definitely a good model for future punk projects IMO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"TUIs over ssh/telnet can be a lot of fun. Especially in cases where multiple people can interact with each other on the server. It simplifies the programming model as you only have one state on the backend that you render to multiple connections. Syncing up everyone becomes trivial. You can also use some React concepts, like rendering a virtual TUI and sending just the right set of minimal escape sequences back to the user to bring their display up to date.A few months ago I implemented a telnet chat server[0] for fun and it was surprisingly easy to do so. Even by using a wasm vm that I was still working on at the same time.[0]: https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/chat"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked for a large e-commerce company.  I wanted to investigate putting all our support data into Watson and see what sort of recommendations it could provide, maybe a sort of auto-suggestion to help our customers.  Three really funny points stand out from the experience:1) To apply for Watson access you needed to show C-level approval, so our CEO put his name and phone number on the application (trying Watson was somewhat his idea).  A few months later, an IBM marketing team called HIS CELL and asked for ME.  Imagine how it felt to have the CEO walk up to me, deadpan hand me his personal iphone and say &#34;It&#39;s for you.&#34;..2) They told me they&#39;d help me with the support data idea, and every meeting we set up they tried to pitch &#34;what if we put Watson on all of your customer&#39;s storefronts, we could add a &#39;powered by watson&#39; banner on every page, and you give us a cut of GMV?&#34;.  I pivoted them to our plugin framework and told them to build it themselves.3) To demo the technology, the first step was to buy a $250k server from IBM.  To demo it.Big LOLs all around, never trust big blue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at IBM Watson as one of the early engineers when they first started commercializing the product. It was a fucking joke - Ginni Rometty would go up on stage and said that Watson can help diagnose cancer from CT scans and we would just look at each other and be like &#34;Dude, Watson is just a glorified Lucene index, wtf is she talking about.&#34; They started selling Watson as the end-all for everything from cancer diagnosis to customer service chat - they even had a stupid Watson Chef thing at SXSW one year - but none of that used the original Watson codebase - it was all built from the ground up and lots of it was just simple logistic regression"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone doing a CS degree now, I seem to be the only one who doesn&#39;t want to have anything on my resume to do with &#34;AI&#34;, blockchain, ML, NFT, chatbots, etc... all I see is overhyped product after product, one-size-fits all solutions that frustrate customers and create problems for humans to clean up, hugely valued companies that have very little real improvement over conventional technology, etc.An &#34;AI chatbot&#34; is far inferior to a real user interface. A real user interface allows discoverability (looking through menus to notice functions that may be useful later), experimentation, and puts the user in control of the program.For example, my bank apparently only supports viewing the reason for card declines through the chatbot--something I never knew, because I took the time to go through the menus when I first got the app and learn what functions existed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m more interested how he managed to master the knowledge of chip manufacturing plus a ton of electronics repairs (see his microscope and other equipment) at such an early age. Very admirable.Look at what he did:&gt; Photolithography machines are expensive—up to $150 million—and so Zeloof made his own by bolting a modified conference room projector bought on Amazon onto a microscope. It projects his designs at tiny scale onto silicon wafers that Zeloof coats in material sensitive to ultraviolet light.&gt; One of Zeloof’s best finds was a broken electron microscope that cost $250,000 in the early ’90s; he bought it for $1,000 and repaired it. He uses it to inspect his chips for flaws, as well as the nanostructures on butterfly wings.Damn this guy is good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since most people don&#39;t seem to be aware: you can use Wordpress as a mostly-static website generator.Use WP Super Cache, and most of your pages are static anyway. A small PHP stub will be hit still, but if you don&#39;t even want that, you can just serve the generated static pages without it.It&#39;s well documented, you just edit your httpd.conf/.htaccess or your nginx config to serve the static files generated by the plugins.Only logged-in users (in most personal Wordpress installations: &#34;just me&#34;) or recent commenters, depending on configuration, hit any PHP code at all.Oh, and commenting works, unless with SSGs out of the box.Keep the number of plugins small, use a static plugin and security is mostly a non-issue for a personal weblog (it&#39;s different for a &#34;real&#34; media operation with all kinds of complicated workflows, of course)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s clear that the fewer plugins one installs (ideally none) the better, though it&#39;s difficult to follow this rule in practice. I recently had to set up a WP website from scratch, and plugins are a very common way for people to solve their problems (especially non-technical users). Plugins are even used for basic ops work like rewrite rules, backups, log parsing, caching—and I get it, for most people if they didn&#39;t exist they wouldn&#39;t have done the ops stuff, or solve many of the other types of problems, so it&#39;s kind of a blessing and a curse given your attack surface increases with each plugin and WP feature. I&#39;ve learned that Wordpress really is what you make of it, directly proportional to the engineering effort you put in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This idea really resonates with me. I started out life pretty poor, and am fortunate enough now to be able to purchase most anything I want. What I no longer have however, is time. I found myself purchasing things I want to have time for, but in all reality don&#39;t. Thinking about the second cost before hitting that buy button may be a good way for me to stop cluttering my life up with stuff I don&#39;t need, and the associated stress of knowing it&#39;s sitting there waiting to eat up time I don&#39;t have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually tend to see anything I buy as a black hole that will suck more money into it.A good example is when you get a bicycle, you do the equation and realize that within two years you will have saved in on the cost of public transportation. But it&#39;s when you start using it you realize that suddenly you always end up sweaty arriving to work so you need to buy good ventilated outdoor clothes and then a little bit later the winter arrives and you realize you need the same type of winter clothes, and then your first tier brakes and you realize you don&#39;t have any tools, so not only do you need to buy a new tier but also the tools. And here the initial smart calculation has fallen apart long time ago.Don&#39;t get me wrong. There&#39;s a lot of benefits riding a bike to work so it may still be very much worth it. But once you have this realization you can apply the same logic to anything you buy or thinking of buying which may helps prioritizing because there&#39;s just so many black holes you can have in your life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes sense for some things, but the examples the author uses don&#39;t make sense to me.Take the Moby Dick example... the author says you don&#39;t get the return on it until you have paid the 16 hour price of reading it... but isn&#39;t those sixteen hours the actual reward? You don&#39;t read a book to be finished with it, you read it because you like the reading process. The reward starts the first minute you start reading the book.Not only that, but you don&#39;t have to finish the book to get something out of reading it. If you enjoyed the time you spent reading, that is enough.This attitude seems very &#34;completionist&#34;, where you only get value after you finish something. That isn&#39;t how I view things.Also, why does he think mindless apps and games are the same as doing nothing? The idea is you enjoy the time spent playing the game. Sure, you don&#39;t end up with anything after, but you enjoyed the time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"John Deere will just claim they never sold him a tractor, but rather signed a custom contract with him that gives him access and custody of one in return of some constraints he agreed upon.If the government intervenes, it would undermine the free market. But you could argue it&#39;s already undermined, both by the government itself and the fact that somehow John Deere managed to achieve a monopoly in a sector critical to national security."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I being overly cynical in concluding that a growing % of companies will screw over their customers for their own gain. Doesn&#39;t this myopic &#34;screw the customer&#34; mentality damage brand reputation? Sure does for me. The growing discontent amongst a companies customer base is creating a new market opportunity for a competitor. When I feel screwed by a company like this, I find a good alternative, then jump ship and NEVER go back (even if they course correct some years later). From that point on I&#39;m a vocal detractor of the brand. If no quality alternative exists it&#39;s even worse because you know the company is screwing you knowing you have no good alternatives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont understand why people keep buying JD tractors.They have a reputation for reliability, so do many other brands. Kubota, Deutz, Fent, Massy, Case, New Holland... a bunch more.It&#39;s amazing the brand loyalty hold JD have on farmers."</p>

But maybe &#34;bootstrapped&#34; is not a 100% correct.&gt; MAY 2020 - Joining Tinyseed&gt; And this is precisely why we never decided to raise money. However, a few years ago, [...] An accelerator designed precisely to help people grow their business [...] The money and the support we got from the program helped us grow ScrapingBee into what it is now"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When people ask me why I like being the founder of a company, I often reply with a small story: when we built our first saas for SMB, we billed .50€ per API call and we plugged those calls to a Slack bot. Man how great it felt in the firsts weeks when this bot would send a message around 20 times a day: the sound of finally having built something valuable that would generate value even if I&#39;d be out of my computer, running or anything else really.Long live scrappingbee!"</p>

ScrapingBee seems to be in the sweet spot where you don&#39;t have to work as hard to keep things running so it can be ran `forever` with a small team. This is no small feat and should be celebrated.All the best!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the best definition of engineering is that it&#39;s a process of optimization within a solution space bounded by constraints. If you pile up some mud and let it dry, you have made a dwelling but you are not an engineer. If you calculate the load requirements for a series of I-beams given a certain budget and build a skyscraper, you are an engineer.As the author correctly notes, there aren&#39;t necessarily hard boundaries on what qualifies as engineering, but I think there clearly are axes on which something is &#34;more engineer-y&#34; vs &#34;less engineer-y&#34;, and as the constraints of the solution space go from physical (tension, voltage, pressure) to non-physical (interpersonal relations, public perception, aesthetic judgment), the activity goes from more engineer-y to less engineer-y.In software, we&#39;re always optimizing on cost / developer time, but that&#39;s closer to the non-physical side of the constraint physicality axis. As you optimize for things like memory usage, execution time, binary size, then you get closer to the physical end of the constraint-type axis, and are thus more engineer-y."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I come from an aerospace engineering background (did structural engineering on commercial aircraft that were in the design and approval stages) and am in software now (games). I&#39;ve had two different takes on this. Neither is perfect. Would appreciate comments on them.(a) If it&#39;s regularly expected that you ship bugs, you might be in a discipline that is distinct from engineering.[0](b) If you can usually reach for an abstraction to save you, you might be working in something that isn&#39;t engineering.[1][0] If software is engineering, then it&#39;s the only engineering discipline I&#39;m aware of in which the participants are regularly expected to produce deliverables they don&#39;t fully understand. What do I mean by that? Well, if we software peeps fully understood our deliverables, we wouldn&#39;t have bugs, or at least, we&#39;d always know what bugs are there. If as a structural engineer I had delivered a final draft of an analysis document which showed that I didn&#39;t fully understand the part and how it would perform, my boss would not have been pleased. Most software bugs are treated more casually than that, so we clearly have a tolerance for delivering work that we don&#39;t fully understand.You might take issue with the idea that I &#34;fully understood&#34; a structural part. Fair. When I calculated the strength of a beam in a thrust reverser I didn&#39;t understand the individual molecular interactions, I didn&#39;t need to know if the metal was of a body-centered cubic crystal structure, etc. But this is because I was able to apply well-understood and rigorously accepted simplifying assumptions that were conservative (from the point of view of a factor of safety), and fully encapsulated all the understanding I needed to produce a part fit for use.[1] This feels like the more flawed of the two proposals, because I expect EEs can do this. Control systems folks can definitely do this, and I would absolutely call them engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, I am a real engineer, and designing gearboxes for airplanes is quite real. So are programmers engineers or not?Consider real engineering at Boeing. There are engineers and technicians (aka draftsmen) working side by side. They are often doing the same work. The difference, as far as Boeing is concerned, is the engineers have a degree in engineering and the technicians do not.But if they are often doing exactly the same thing, what&#39;s the real difference?Think of it another way. Think of an auto mechanic. He can fix your car. He can take your car apart and put it back together. He can customize it. But is he an auto engineer (who often does those tasks, too)?Nope.A programmer, technician, mechanic plugs numbers into formulas, follows instructions and procedures and practices laid out by an engineer.An engineer derives the formulas, writes the instructions, develops the procedures, and refines the practices.For example, a technician builds a band pass filter by using a circuit he&#39;s already used before and knows works. Maybe he&#39;ll tweak the RC values. An engineer will drive the RC values needed by understanding the calculation. The technician may use calculation (though they rarely do), but they don&#39;t understand where the formula comes from. An engineer does.In software, a programmer calls a sort function from the supplied library. An engineer writes the sort function, and can tell you its complexity and why the algorithm he chose (or invented) is the most appropriate one for the particular sorting task, and what the cases are where the sort will perform poorly, and why."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"American here&#34;perhaps better known as the online identity verification service that many states now use to help staunch the loss of billions of dollars in unemployment insurance and pandemic assistance stolen each year by identity thieves&#34;In the great State of California, billions in unemployment benefits were sent to the wrong people.. because their internal systems were designed to delay, deny and deprive, I say. Actual people with real jobs were repeatedly refused, while insiders who knew how to fill out paperwork, and apparently knew where the blind spots were, filed hundreds of claims in the early pandemic days. A newly appointed Director (young, tech savvy woman) soon stopped making public statements, and the situation nearly two years later, is not resolved.  This is at a time when California has record income to the State.Now, some people may jump on this and say &#34;well, you see how photo ID would have helped that&#34; and, with incomplete knowledge and personal opinion, I say no, it would not solve it. You see, people with real jobs, with every real paper filed, were denied benefits, while insiders were pulling checks with both hands, using certain kinds of identities that would slip through. How would ever more restriction, requirement and verification, have helped here?I am deeply against the collective government making ever more demands on citizens for &#34;papers, please&#34; enrollment to massive money social services (edit e.g. govt unemployment benefits). It is not going to have the desired effect, despite superficial evidence otherwise. Additionally this represents a slippery slope where the ability to interact as an individual will be eroded, and opportunity for insider graft will increase."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can anyone with context speak to as why ID.me was chosen instead of Login.gov?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To everyone saying that Kubernetes is unnecessary, try implementing autoscaling, service discovery, secrets management, and autohealing in a vendor independent way without it.Of course none of that is necessary for a self hosted home lab, but neither is gitops.This is a very nice example of how to set stuff up properly.OP, I would love to see Robusta (https://robusta.dev) as part of this too.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;A common question I get is about work/life balance. And I view it a little different too now. At Facebook I could get by barely working a few hours a day. But the job was so unsatisfying that it spilled the frustration in the “life” part&#34;This is the golden piece for me. I too recently left a big corp to a smaller place, expecting to sacrifice WLB and my free time - yet I ended up feeling happier and spending less time consuming short-form online contents, to the point that I even have more free time now! It never occurred to me that my self-indulging online addiction is actually a coping mechanism towards the unsatisfying and meaningless daily job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At Facebook I could get by barely working a few hours a day.A note of caution that this is not the common Facebook experience. I joined being fully aware of their reputation for poor work life balance, but even then it was soul-crushing. The pressure to perform is near constant, consequences of not performing are real, and the bar for meeting expectations is very high to start with, such that externally hired senior engineers are frequently overwhelmed by the sheer amount of expectations.I was a manager there and got the distinct impression that the expectations bar was also rising over time. FB/Meta tends to hire the overperforming types, who put extra pressure on themselves to get those Exceeds and Greatly Exceeds ratings that come with real monetary rewards. The problem is you can&#39;t have everyone exceeding, not at the macro level anyways. So there&#39;s a real pressure on the managers with too many of those Exceeds ratings. The goal is to prevent a manager that misunderstands the expectations from giving everyone Exceeds, but the side effect is that over time there is a drift of expectations from Exceeds to Meets side. Having been with the company for so many years, the author likely did not notice this drift and was able to adjust over time naturally. Newer hires (which, given FB&#39;s rate of growth, is the large majority) aren&#39;t so lucky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It always blows my mind how most interview in our field. When I first started in tech I was afraid to talk about not knowing leetcode to my peers. 15 years in and I now can confidently say I’ve yet to meet someone who thinks these are a valid metric.Why do we make this the gate keeper to our industry when we know (except for the very specific roles) we will rarely need leet code type problems. When we do we just google them.So silly to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the utility of generic search engines is coming to an end. Services like Google, Bing and DDG are numbered in usefulness.Instead, I am guessing (maybe hoping) that we see a return of the moderated directories, like Yahoo or DMOZ of old. A 2.0 spin on these directories, with lessons learned from all the years.Imagine that you just go to StackOverflow and search there directly for your answer. Want a funny laugh, go to your favorite comedy website (like facebook.com) and search directly. Want some news, go to CNN or Fox (depending on your persuasion) and fill your echo chamber.Not kidding. I think search as we know it is dead. And there is a new paradigm just sitting out there ready for the next generation to make.A directory of well known lists of websites with specialty search engines available on each."</p>

There is a finite amount of people, of money to be made. Ever-increasing income is fundamentally impossible. When you can&#39;t increase revenue by further improving your product, you increase revenue by making the same product more profitable, which generally means a worse product. In the eyes of the business major, the ideal business is one in which all of your customers hate you not quite enough to stop using you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 2FA tokens for all users worldwide were subsequently revoked to ensure the new infrastructure was in effect. We have mandatory 2FA policies on both the frontend and backend to protect users during this revocation phase, as outflows such as withdrawals have a requirement to setup and use 2FA in order to withdraw.How is this supposed to work? They revoked all of their 2FA for all accounts? Doesn&#39;t this just open them up to credential stuffing attacks? This is a really, really odd response to me. I can understand migrating to a new 2FA system, but they&#39;d have to re-establish the chain-of-trust somehow.

In the majority of cases we prevented the unauthorized withdrawal, and in all other cases customers were fully reimbursed.so which is it? no one lost funds or everyone that lost funds got paid back? where did that money come from?&gt; transactions were being approved without the 2FA authentication control being inputted by the user.the withdrawal system allows for non-2fa when its enabled, but informs the risk system when it happens? what kind of feature is that?&gt; While Crypto.com already performs internal and external penetration tests, Crypto.com has immediately engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checksah yes. the &#34;we already had 7 double checkers, better add an 8th&#34; solution. sounds like maybe the problem is not with the testing and auditing suite.&gt; releasing additional end-user security features as we move away from 2-Factor Authentication and to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)2fa isnt true MFA? did we evolve some new jargon im not aware of?&gt; WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user’s permission. WAPP restores fundswait i thought they said they already did this? are they gonna start charging for it now because they lost money?&gt; To qualify for the WAPP program, users must: Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transactionwtf is that? a PSK? a TOTP?&gt; File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; andhello, local police department? i need to file a report - my cryptocurrency wallet just had an unauthorized funds withdrawal. no, i dont have a suspect, or evidence, or any action for you to take. just come down here and write down that i said this happened please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Worldwide Account Protection Program seems to be a way for Crypto.com to limit their exposure, while marketing it as &#34;protection&#34; for the customers.Around $34million stolen, 483 users affected. If the funds were spread evenly, then each user would have lost about $71k. But the funds won&#39;t be evenly spread (average). It&#39;s likely some users will have lost much more, and some much less.From the announcement, it looks like Crypto.com is making the users whole again;&gt; No customers experienced a loss of funds.This means that (in some cases) Crypto.com was on the hook for much more than $71k / user. The WAPP appears to put a series of conditions on the user, and introduce an upper limit to the amount that Crypto.com will return in the future.&gt; WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms &amp; conditions apply.&gt;     Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available,&gt;    Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,&gt;    Not be using jailbroken devices,&gt;    File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and&gt;    Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.This looks more like a mechanism to limit Crypto.com&#39;s exposure to future events than it does a policy to protect users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dislike Google and their products pretty much universally, but having this sort of thing done by a competitor is not just distasteful, I see it as verging on corporatism.Make a better product and beat them, don&#39;t use the fact that a government is banning them to upsell your own tracking software.All tracking is bad, from Google or not. I understand the &#34;companies need to make informed decisions&#34; argument but I disagree with it, mainly because tracking software is involuntary and it&#39;s in the interest of the tracking software maker and the company using it to make it as stealthy as possible.PS: What adds salt to injury is that you&#39;re using Google Fonts on this website.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This message is brought to you by&gt; PostHog is the only open source product analytics platform where customer data never leaves your infrastructure.Hosting my own Matomo installation I beg to differ. Matomo is open source and my visitors data never leaves my own server.Except they only do backend tracking and see https traffic from website frontend tracking reaching my analytics server as it &#34;leaves your infrastructure&#34;.But they at least made one thing obviously clear to me. I would never consider using them in the future.Also they are wrong factually. Google Analytics is not illegal in Austria. The court made this clear. Transmitting the IP without anonymizeIp is. Also transmitting PII data unencrypted to GA us (but GA does forbid that in their TOS as well).So not caring about the law when implementing GA and doing it just wrong is forbidden in Austria. Who would have thought. Using it correctly and adhering to data privacy best practices is just fine with GA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WASM being the “new k8s” is only one small fragment of where it is going to go. I think there is a good chance it’s going to become the defacto deployment target for a lot of software, so in addition to browser and server:- Plugins for desktop/mobile apps, wasm provides a nicely sandboxed environment for them.- Gaming, the combination of WASM and WebGPU will be the perfect platform for cross platform game development. I could see Steam, for example, creating their own runtime.- Embedded electronics, simplifying the development and deployment of IoT devices.When it comes to wasm on the server, it’s often talked about as targeting the “edge”. I believe this the next area of massive growth, however the part that I don’t think is fully solved yet is on the database side. If your server app is making multiple database calls from the edge to a central db there is a good chance that it will slower than a traditional (single location) deployment.What’s needed is a edge first database, we need at least read replicas to be at the edge with your app. Fly.io have something like this with their Postgres’s product. The alternative is to use an eventually consistent db such as CouchBD, but that causes other problems. I’m interested to see if CloudFlare do anything in this area as it’s the part of their stack that’s missing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think he understands what K8s is. WASM is the new Docker, but you still need something to manage/orchestrate/schedule all those WASM instances. What if your WASM process goes down, who will restart it? What if you need 10 extra instances to handle a traffic burst? How do you isolate associated WASM instances from the rest of the environment, and manage their access to/from the outside world? How do you provide them with configuration or credentials?You still need something like K8s, even if you&#39;re not using docker underneath . Indeed you can already use other runtimes under K8s, so what he is proposing is nothing new anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So be it!Until XyZ is the new WebAssembly and @!# is the new XyZ!As long as my Django backend works and browsers support my HTML/CSS/JS frontend, I am fine.I have the same LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, Python) SAAS project running for decades now, paying all my bills, letting me live a free life.As long as nobody touches that, you can do all you want. Invent new fancy stacks every other year, make courses for it, migrations to it, a religion of it - I don&#39;t mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m making Windows/.Net based app for managing queues - QueueExplorer.
Started with MSMQ support back in 2005, now it supports Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ. It&#39;s old fashioned perpetual licensing, so revenue is a rollercoaster. Because of that, it&#39;s emotional rollercoaster as well. Good thing is you get paid for full license at the time of purchase instead of collecting it in 10-20 months. Bad thing is every month starts at zero.Although .Net went multiplatform years ago, my app relies on WinForms a lot so it&#39;s Win only, except through Wine. I would love to support Mac as well but the only realistic option looks to be Electron based, and it would be a significant step back for my Windows users. Maintaining two different GUIs looks like a problem for micro company.The best thing about desktop software is it can&#39;t break for all the users at once like server-based app can. That gives some piece of mind when you&#39;re micropreneur. Sure, there are bugs, but they affect only users who downloaded buggy version. You can&#39;t crash all installed instances just like that.The worst thing is, it&#39;s hard to ask for a subscription. Yes, I hate it as a user, but would love it as a business owner :)https://www.cogin.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our company sells HW and SW for the dental sector.We have a desktop app that processes DICOM data to do implant treatment planning (where to place an implant in the patient jaw). Output is a STL file to print a drill guide for the oral surgeon to perform a guided surgery.Our desktop scanners for dental labs and our intra-oral scanners for dentists generate 3D meshes of the patients oral situation.Those meshes are the input data for the CAD/CAM Software my team builds. It is a desktop app for the digital design of dental restorations. The GUI is in javaFX and 3D visualization is done with OpenGL 4.5.Once the restorative Design is done, that app can generate many different output formats. Labs will feed the design files their local milling machine or 3D printer. Dentists can send it to centralized milling facilities of their choice to produce the crown or bridge or what have you.Some impressions can be seen here:https://youtu.be/5THQMr5SAH0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my 3rd (or is it 4th?) year of developing and selling Label LIVE, an electron app for designing and printing labels. Originally it only worked with USB thermal printers, but over the last few years it&#39;s grown into a multi-function image-rendering pipeline that integrates data import (via spreadsheet, CSV or API) with barcodes, text, image output. My app revenue eclipsed my iOS/NodeJS consulting in 2021 and I hope to double revenue in 2022. Read more at https://label.live/features.The tech stack for this app is really interesting (to me at least, natch). Lots of native node modules that need finesse on both macOS and Windows. I don&#39;t yet support Linux because out of thousands of users, only 2 people have emailed about Linux support (probably both from HN!).I really love building Electron apps. It&#39;s a total joy bringing something (albeit &#34;inefficiently&#34; wrt memory and &#34;native&#34; qualities) like this to market for a niche that&#39;s otherwise a dumpster fire of old and clunky 1980s-era Windows-only software.As for licensing, Label LIVE is licensed per computer. I wrote a custom license implementation leveraging JWT. The JWT is signed by my license server and the app verifies the signature and that the contents match the &#34;fingerprint&#34; of the computer being licensed, expiration, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the Subaru BRAT in the early &#39;80s. There was a 25% tarrif on imported pickups. So Subaru added two plastic jump seats in the back of the BRAT, even making them face backwards. No seat belts as I recall just handles. They weren&#39;t even really intended to be used. They were just cheap plastic.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I checked the keyboard debouncing logic [0] and it was fine. Some keyboards from other manufacturers, notably Lenovo Thinkpads, have absurd debouncing algorithms that scramble keys or add delays, so it&#39;s good to see Framework has a correct solution.[0]: https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/EmbeddedController/blob..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been so happy to see what Framework has been doing lately, and really want to support them, but I already have a desktop as my primary computer and two Thinkpads that are already set up nicely, but that I rarely use. I moved from 15&#34; laptops to 14&#34; when Lenovo added the numpad on the larger variant, and 14&#34; is about as small as I want to go.I kind of want to buy a framework though, just to support them? But I have no use for another laptop, let alone a small 12&#34; one! Should I get one anyway because, what the hell, why not? Should I wait and then jump on one if/when they release a larger model?Anybody else have similar feelings?Edit to add:I also have one of the last Thinkpad models that support S3 sleep (T480 -- within a model or two, I think?), which is currently super critical for Linux... I need to be able to close the lid and come back after a week.It&#39;s easy to blame the manufacturers for this, but the consistent answer seems to be &#34;Intel&#39;s Tiger Lake platform does not support S3 sleep,&#34; and all of the system builders base their work on what Intel&#39;s reference platform does. So short of going to extreme effort to hack it together themselves (something that is likely not their specialty), reasonable sleep behavior is not going to be an option unless Intel brings S3 back, or does work to improve the S0ix states.I absolutely do not want to support the no-more-S3 clusterfuck right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so glad Fly exists. Every other edge focused thing out there I&#39;m aware of are &#34;serverless&#34; which these days basically means they charge per request.That&#39;s fine for a lot of use cases, but the unit economics of the per request pricing model means it&#39;s really hard to operate a predictably sustainable (i.e. profitable) business without also charging our customers on a usage basis, or enforcing limits on usage, neither of which is ideal for maximizing engagement as incentives are no longer aligned.Fly just gives us compute at the edge for a predictable price per unit of actual compute resources as opposed to requests, and gives us freedom to serve as much traffic as we can min-max onto those resources, like we could with traditional cloud compute.This provides much better unit economics for many kinds of applications, at the cost of having to manage the scaling ourselves. But because the option exists, we can make this tradeoff on a case-by-case basis, which is so much better than if all we had was &#34;serverless&#34; stuff at the edge and had to choose between just low latency across the globe vs good unit economics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fly is great.They’ve got Chris McCord there, who has already improved their Elixir deployment story. I tweeted a few weeks ago about improving the default Rails deployment experience to not require DB provisioning and configuration of env vars like SECRET_BASE_KEY and they said it would likely ship within the next 3 months.My hot take is they’re setting themselves up to ride the server-side rendered HTML renaissance we are experiencing with LiveView and Hotwire. It will become much more important to deploy applications geographically closer to customers to lower latency, which Fly makes sane for the rest of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We&#39;ve had a free tier since we launched ten years ago (in 2020).I’m not a Fly.io customer (although more and more I am thinking I should be), but I eagerly read every new blog post because I’m so entertained by their tone. These people are clearly having fun at work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually a brilliant location for them. One of those places that has much more going for it than people not from the region would realize.International airport, large rail depot, extremely low cost of living and a city/region that has more good restaurants and activities than might be expected. Ohio State University is in the city and is a huge school that is rapidly growing in academic standing. Road transit in the area is also very good allowing access to any part of the city from any other part in rapid fashion. Good schools, relatively low crime, etc. Probably the only drawback, from a lifestyle point of view, would be the winter and that&#39;s not even that bad, compared to other winter regions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This same street has a Facebook data center, an AWS data center, and a Google data center (within a couple of miles).  There is a biotech research campus, Bath &amp; Bodyworks main research lab, and the main operations center for AEP (a midwest electric company).  If you travel about 2-3 miles orthogonal to that street we have a big data center for Nationwide Insurance, a campus for Discover (credit cards), and a State Farm insurance facility.It is literally across street from one of the Ohio East-2 availability zones.  If they were making rack-mounted server boards, they could just walk them across the street and plug them into the cloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, cool! The model is specified as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem for which a solution is found using high-quality proprietary numerical solvers.[a] All partial differential equations specifying the model have a basis in economic theory or in heuristics and approximations shown to be consistent with reality. Parameters come directly from (what I assume is a large amount of) economic data collected by the Danish government.The authors working for the Danish government deserve an A+ for making their code and assumptions public, along with comprehensive high-quality documentation.[b] It was a delightful surprise to click on the link and find... a carefully curated repo.I have only one nitpicking: This looks like the kind of project that should have been -- and in fact probably should be -- implemented in Julia, instead of in a proprietary language. I suspect many heuristics and approximations could be more accurately modeled by ML components, interspersed between equations, as has long been proposed by Julia folks like Chris Rackauckas.--[a] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30028188[b] https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/DREAM-DK/MAKRO/mai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Economics is not a science like physics. We can&#39;t do controlled experiments, we can&#39;t falsify hypothesis. This leads to very muddy waters and what you are left with are two kinds of economists: Those who tell people what they want to hear and those nobody listens to.Econometrics gives people everything they want to hear, and with a scientific veneer as a bonus. The HN crowd should however appreciate how susceptible this is to the tyranny of metrics. Claude-Frédéric Bastiat warned of this over a century ago with his parable of the broken window: Think not only of what you can see (the glazier who is employed to repair the window), but also of what you cannot see (the alternative purchase of a suit) had the window not been broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that the model is implemented in GAMS[1], a proprietary language focused at constrained optimization problems (think Matlab, but more niche). This makes it a non-starter for most interested outsiders.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Algebraic_Modeling_Sys..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the article and the study are light on the details of &#34;persistent&#34; Here&#39;s the supporting data&#39;s in a bit more detail[0].Overall this makes sense to me as an individually who personally enjoys it. The whole point of getting high is to be impaired (for me). So it&#39;s not really telling me anything new. Like drinking, I can&#39;t expect myself to be 100% functioning the next day so plan accordingly.The question is how long is that persistence and how much does it affect? Permanent? Doesn&#39;t really seem to be answered in a way that I was hoping.[0] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?do..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve known many people in silicon valley who smoke cannabis regularly (several times a week if not daily). They all seemed to be cognitively normal. Some of them function on a level I only wish I could attain.I think regular cannabis use attracts a certain type of person. That type of person can vary in their ability and intelligence, just like any type of person. This is also true of say, hardcore fans of fantasy fiction. They all have certain things in common, but you couldn&#39;t paint all of them as &#34;creative&#34; or any other trait.I&#39;m hesitant when hearing about long term effects, even on developing brains. Both Barack Obama and Carl Sagan smoked a ton of cannabis when they were younger. And they and others really turned out fine.This paper seems to be a meta study that combines the results from other studies. Since there were multiple methodologies it&#39;s hard to get a sense of exactly what questions they were answering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before anyone freaks out too much:&#34;Persistent&#34; means up to one week. From the actual paper: &#34;However, results were not significant for an abstinence period of more than 7 days.&#34;Basically, science has proved that stoners behave like stoners. And if you stop it takes a few days for everything to wear off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The strange trend of &#34;authoritarian minimalism&#34; design that seems to be working its way through the majority of newer software is very strange. I wonder who actually wants this stuff, and is not content to merely make it a default, but instead forces it to be the one and only way.Monitors are bigger than ever with huge resolutions, and yet UIs are being dumbed down to uselessness and alienating an increasing number of users.A recent related article https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29954266 seems to indicate that not even people inside Microsoft --- who are being forced to use Win11, because MS --- have any say in the matter. It&#39;s almost like some tiny extremist faction has gained control of Windows and is determined to show everyone else how much power they have by making these changes and gloating sadistically at seeing everyone object, but still end up using Windows.I wonder how much damage they will inflict before people start turning to WINE and a saner Linux distro, just to run their Windows applications."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My #1 issue with Windows 11 is not being able to un-group my taskbar items.I found having multiple instances of apps open across multiple monitors was extremely painful after using it ungrouped for so many years. And the little dot provided to indicate an open app is worthless. I resorted to StartAllBack to fix it. Everything else has been generally fine for me. So disappointed.There are several highly voted feedback posts and comments about the taskbar but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anyone at MS acknowledge any of it.(Main suggestion is currently at 11k votes. https://aka.ms/AAeyt69)And as if that wasn&#39;t enough, sometimes just clicking the taskbar item does nothing. It can sometimes take several clicks to get it to re-open an app.https://twitter.com/vyrotek/status/1461748895906553856"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am mad about how slow the search is now. I used to press window button, start typing first few letters of app of choice hit enter and it would open. Now it takes like 3 seconds for the search to start and by muscle memory I&#39;ve hit enter now before its even warmed up and for whatever reason ends up doing a web search..That alone Makes me want to quit Windows."</p>

I felt completely disoriented at the time, uncovering the many delusions of money, tech and fame as the final life answers, alongside broken relationships and friendships and nowhere to turn. The monks and nuns took me in in a way that I will be forever grateful for and Thich Nhat Hanh&#39;s teaching was the beginning on a long journey of self-discovery, healing, relaxation and coming to terms with reality as it is, right now.Thich Nhat Hanh taught me something very ordinary: That it is important to pause often, to reflect, to sit still or walk in silence and to observe and acknowledge what is happening around you, inside and out. And to then act from that place of stillness and quiet with calm and kindness to the people around you. And to keep practicing this over and over again, without fail or getting tired from it.I feel tremendous gratitude to him and his teaching, as well as the monks and nuns that dedicate themselves to his many practices and insights.May he rest in peace and may his intentions and practices live on for a long time!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. I used to go to the mindfulness retreats at his affiliated monastery in San Diego. You left your phone in your car, and had 3-5 days (or more sometimes) of meditation, fresh cooked meals, and nature. It was really peaceful, and so different from what I had expected (something like a cult, being plied for donations etc. there was none of that). I stopped going when I left California, but it&#39;s hard to feel much more free than that these days. You&#39;re on a schedule for sleep, meals and events, basically making no decisions, and without internet pulling your attention, you feel like your mind is coming back to yourself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thich Nhat Hanh taught that just like a cloud seems to disappear from the sky, it&#39;s not really, it has simply changed form. The appearance of vanishing is just that: an appearance. Really nothing is created or destroyed. In this way, there is no loss here, Thầy has transitioned into another phase of life. A beauty worth celebrating"</p>

It seems like Camera here might be treating QR code URLs as manually entered URLs or OCRed URLs and applying autocorrection logic."</p>

e.g. exampleac.uk -&gt; example.ac.ukMy guess, as someone else further down the comments mentioned, is that some URL handling library is doing more than expected to its input. I filed an internal bug report referencing some of the public reports from a dev build of Android 12, so hopefully this will get triaged soon if someone hasn&#39;t already done a similar reproduction.(I work at Google, but on nothing remotely related to Android.)"</p>

This seems like yet another shoe-horning in of &#34;cleverness&#34; when it wasn&#39;t invited and in this case appears to be outright broken.After disabling every single assistant or enrichment option I could find, Android is still putting auto-reply prompts into any notification that has a reply button.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Terrific story. Personal, authentic, and very relatable. Interest in and an aptitude for computers also saved me. (I even had a job in a computer store.)&gt; I made the cold calculation that as painful as my life was, it was probably better than rolling the dice with the child protection services.Yup. I too decided at age 11, choosing to live with the less bad parent.And shortly thereafter, those decisions were made for me, resulting in the state putting me into foster care. Somehow I avoided the worst; while the 1st family was pretty much what you&#39;d expect, I later lucked into a good family.--I wonder how many of us there are. I&#39;ve known so many runaways, beaten kids, sexually abused kids, kids with broken parents. And that&#39;s just in my wealthy, prosperous city. I can&#39;t imagine how much worse it is every where else.I also marvel that somehow some of us find a way out, while seemingly most others get sucked into the abyss. So much human potential lost due to poor circumstances and stupid luck. It fills me with deep sadness.And I wonder what the difference is. How are some able to escape their fate? If we can identify those success factors, maybe we can maximize chances for success. Could even be small measures, like how we now have suicide prevention hotlines, and resources for victims of human trafficking.--I had many, many people help me over the years. People who had no reason to help, but did nonetheless. I call them my angels. People like a little league coach (who&#39;d drive me to practice), a youth pastor (who mentored me), the foster family that raised me, etc, etc.As society becomes harsher, more coarse, more dog-eat-dog, I worry that other lost kids won&#39;t have their own angels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The internet to me was a blessing and a curse. In economic terms, it has granted me lots of opportunities I might have not otherwise had; in social terms, it has taken a big toll, significantly isolating me from the world, which I didn&#39;t admit until very recently. I remember a smart classmate at university who, one day, just stopped attending and sold his computers, saying something like &#34;these little colored lights have turned me into something I don&#39;t like&#34;. Some days I wish I had done the same."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often wonder how I would have made a living and a good life without the internet. I finished high school in 1994 with little career inspiration, landed in a generic business degree that held little interest for me, but it was at that uni campus I discovered the internet in early 95.I immediately found it exciting and grasped how transformative it would be, and quickly got to work learning web development and finding material and communities related to my interests (mostly obscure Australian rock bands). It&#39;s been the platform for my career ever since, and has also enabled me to go deep learning about some unusual health and emotional challenges that had afflicted me since early life, and enabled me to make profound changes to my health and wellbeing, leading to the place I&#39;m at now, with a solid career, great relationship and a wonderful young son.When I think about the person I was and the path I was on when I finished high school, it&#39;s hard to imagine how it would have turned out well had I come of age in a different era.Which is not to say life has been easy or simple; quite the opposite, and the internet has no doubt made life more complicated and challenging in many ways, My life has had several major ups and downs that probably wouldn&#39;t have been as pronounced without the internet. But I still have no doubt at all I&#39;m in a much better place than I&#39;d have been without it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This culture of radical openness must be quite refreshing for people inside the company.A lot of companies would never want this sort of thing to be out in the open. But really, why not? I imagine it helps to keep things sensible if you know that a thousand eyes could be trawling over your employee policies. You&#39;re certainly not going to be promoting astroturfing or other undesirable activities.At the same time, you aren&#39;t burdened with deciding what to share. Many (most?) companies tie themselves in knots trying to decide what to share, and end up sharing nothing.Sharing everything means less time spent deciding what to share and more time developing the stuff in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey there, I’m a member of the GitLab Community Relations team. My team is responsible for this page. I shared the page today at a DevRel meetup where OP was presenting on Hacker News. I’m grateful he chose to share it with all of you. Thanks, Dan.If there are ways we can improve how we engage with the HN community, myself and our team would love your feedback."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Never submit GitLab content to Hacker News. Submission gets more credibility if a non-GitLab Hacker News community member posts it, we should focus on making our posts interesting instead of on submitting it.I appreciate this policy, it makes it clear that HN is a place to engage with the community, rather than a free advertising channel. Looking at the CEO&#39;s profile, the last time he made a submission about Gitlab was in 2018, so I&#39;d say the policy appears to be followed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am fine with abstinence as a general recommendation, but critical thinking pointed out two issues with the WHF Policy Brief, which I suppose I have read in sufficient depth:1. There is no citation on the sentence, &#34;Recent evidence has found that no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health.&#34; This is really the only line we are interested in.2. There is no comparison on the effects of alcohol on the body by dosage (and frequency), which is, again, what is required from the brief to make that claim.Again, while I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with what&#39;s in the report, and that it is already established that drinking too much is not good for the heart, considering many otherwise toxic substances have a hormetic zone, it is critical that a study like this rules out the its existence for ethanol."</p>

This makes it easy to learn and use, without any compromise on power or features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I downloaded this and tried to follow the documentation [0]. `pijul add` doesn&#39;t accept wildcards, instead returning a pretty unhelpful error message:&gt; λ pijul add *.*&gt; Error: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. (o error 123)The documentation for add [1] gives no information on the format, however I put 2 and 2 together and managed to do `pijul add . -r`. The next step is `pijul record` [2] which returns another error:&gt; Error: No identity configured yet. Please use `pijul key` to create oneOk great. I ran `pijul key` [3] (which isn&#39;t documented) which returns 0, with no output. `pijul record` still says the above, so I tried `pijul key --help` which tells me I need to run a _different_ command (`pijul key generate &lt;LOGIN&gt;`) but doens&#39;t tell me what `login` is supposed to be. I ran `pijul key generate &lt;my_email&gt;` which appears to have worked, and then `pijul record`.I actually killed it after an hour and 15 minutes, rather than waiting to see how long it would take. For reference, git add * takes about 3 minutes on the same project. Between the documentation, error messages and performance I can&#39;t see myself taking another go at this for a while.[0] https://pijul.com/manual/getting_started.html[1] https://pijul.com/manual/reference/add.html[2] https://pijul.com/manual/reference/record.html[3] https://pijul.com/manual/reference/key.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People thinking this is an absurd amount of money are sleeping on how 1Password is quietly positioning itself to become the ground truth storage solution for corporate secret management, across devops and non-technical groups alike.Given Hashicorp&#39;s market cap of 11B, and 1Password&#39;s narrative on how to become even more central to corporate use cases by being the storage layer for Vault deployments, it&#39;s a very reasonable leap for them to make!https://1password.com/secrets/https://1password.com/secrets/integrations/https://1password.com/enterprise-password-manager/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wish they weren&#39;t doing away with 1password classic and the native mac app. I like the fact I bought a license, that I can store the data on dropbox or icloud, and it works just fine.Yes, this is old news and sour grapes on my part. I just don&#39;t yet feel like migrating to bitwarden.I&#39;ve been using 1password for 12 years since I saw it on a tutorial on peepcode.com. I actually taught my mother how to use it, she&#39;s been using it for 9 years, and last weekend she was upgrading all her passwords to use 2fa with the QR code capturing facility.We had to go find the 1password classic browser extension (something stopped working, needed to reinstall it) and that took a bit of doing. 1password is not making it easy to find anymore, and when she contacted customer support (before talking to me), their response was to upgrade to a paid account and store your passwords on a server.Ugh.Honestly, now that they&#39;ve raised this much cash, would it really be that big of an inconvenience or lift for them to give mac users a native app instead of the electron one and keep allowing legacy users like me to use 1password with our existing licenses and dropbox?I think they&#39;d be able to hire some additional developers and product/project people to make it happen. Not continuing to work on the classic project just feels like a kick in the shins.Now, I&#39;m building out my kubernetes cluster at home, and bitwarden is something I&#39;m going to experiment with as a backup, but 1password 7 works fine and I just don&#39;t want to migrate to a paid account.C&#39;mon 1password, make your legacy customers happy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of announcement tends to ring all kinds of alarm bells for me.  What kinds of changes should we expect to make those huge investments worthwhile for the investors?My 1Password installation is grandfathered from a time when it was just a standalone app, without subscription.  Will it just stop working one day to bully me into subscribing?  Can you even start using 1Password these days without buying a subscription?  I&#39;ll have to start looking for alternatives today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once almost completely automated my job, and didn&#39;t hide it.  The job was to load data files into the backend system. The problem was there there were almost as many formats (~80) as there were partners sending data (~120), not just in structure but in content (deltas, full replace, etc.).  This job was burning people out every 6 months, and I was the hapless next victim who was just looking to break into a tech position.I started scripting and automating parts of it, which eventually got pieced together to be completely hands off unless a new partner came on board or there was some new error.  Since some of these steps used keyboard macros on VT100 terminals, I couldn&#39;t even use my computer while it was running, so I requested another, with the explicit intent that I could use it to surf the web while my main computer was doing it&#39;s thing.  Data load lag times went from weeks, to days, to hours.When it came time for performance review, I was told I had &#34;completely redefined the position&#34;.  I would therefore be assessed against the new definition, and was therefore deemed average, and got a 3% cost of living raise (pro-rated to 2% since I&#39;d only been there 8 months) with no merit increase.  A few weeks later, my manager was somehow surprised to the point of tears that I had a new job elsewhere.A few months later, I got a call from my ex-manager, asking if I had any backups of the programs I wrote (this was long before the days of offsite source control).  I said no, I had no need for them and that would probably be illegal.  My replacement had somehow lost everything, and was now trying to keep up the old burnout way and they were weeks behind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Early in my career I was the only engineer in a company with a dedicated office building full of people selling my work to Fortune 500 companies as that of a large team. Slept under my desk a lot as the 80 hour weeks made me choose between commuting and sleeping.It got worse when they hired someone to manage me that demanded I use Basecamp to log every action I take in my day .I wrote a script to fill it out with technical sounding nonsense. After a few weeks the manager came to compliment me on hearing his demands out and being so detailed in my reporting without productivity going down as I suggested in my early reservations.I explained that I automated it. He was fascinated and asked how it knows what I am doing, smelling a startup opportunity. I explained that it just makes stuff up to appease non technical managers.&#34;Did you just do this as an elaborate way to give me the middle finger?&#34;&#34;Pretty much.&#34;He never tried to manage me again, realizing I had automated his job reporting to his managers too.Said script for fun: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lrvick/5ecabfc4bb5a2f5578..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story is a pretty accurate fable for the pointlessness of the modern economy and its inability to provide real value to anyone. Man spends all day playing video games, because he automated his largely superfluous job at a law firm which itself likely only exists to deal with bureaucratic or unnecessary cases (assuming this is true, as they have a single absent IT person who handles their entire infrastructure.)On top of all that, this story itself is probably made up, created to get attention from other people in pointless jobs. It’s a meta-exercise in pointlessness."</p>

I&#39;ve had this streak going for about nine months now.- I focus particularly on features that solve my customer&#39;s pain (and I ask my customers what that pain is)- I&#39;m ruthlessly iterative. If I can&#39;t get a feature done in two hours, I figure out how to cut scope down to a two hour block, and ship that. Then iterate on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m definitely getting screwed over by this. I&#39;ve hosted close friend&#39;s and family&#39;s email for a decade now on an old G Apps instance. We only ever used it for email on a custom domain. It was most useful because I could reset passwords for them if they forgot it. Now I&#39;m going to have to figure out what to do.Microsoft&#39;s Family offering is way better (not saying much considering Google doesn&#39;t have one). Right now I&#39;m really considering moving over to them. But I have no idea what the migration of a decade of email across 5 inboxes will look like; not to mention Calendar and contacts. I used this as my primary email on at least 7 android phones (the original Pixel up through the Pixel 6 I preordered). The loss of Youtube purchases; android play purchases, etc. is going to hurt. I&#39;m sad it isn&#39;t illegal to turn a free account into a paid one when it means losing purchased content like this.I&#39;m not 100% sure what to do, I don&#39;t have dozens of hours to walk everyone through a migration; and Google provides absolutely no migration tools to help with this. This is the last time I&#39;ll be burned by Google though. I used to be a huge fan; but at this point I&#39;m done. I&#39;m really looking forward to cutting them out completely. As an added bonus; I no longer have to worry about them deciding to ban my account one day and lose everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a Google employee who just found out about this.
I&#39;m not annoyed that I have to pay, it&#39;s been ~13 years of free service and I don&#39;t think Google is obligated to continue providing this to me.The annoying part is that Google doesn&#39;t provide any migration tool, but there are migration tools for Google Edu accounts so that graduating students can migrate their data to personal Google accounts. The software is evidently mostly written and tested, but for whatever reason it hasn&#39;t been brought over the finish line for other workspace users.Obviously our use case isn&#39;t that common (it&#39;s been &#34;legacy&#34; for years) but still annoying to know that there&#39;s probably some script I could run to do this, but nobody has built the web UI for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I am altering the deal. Pray I don&#39;t alter it any further&#34;.The problem here is there&#39;s no way out now. If 15 years ago you made the mistake of wanting gasp a domain for your email, you&#39;re basically roped into paying now.Almost everything a free G Suite user wants is identical to the free @gmail account, which is remaining free. Except the custom domain. Fine - but there&#39;s no way to just lose the custom domain at this point.Over the years, the Google account has grown in importance and things tied to it. It&#39;s fairly un-viable to migrate it to an @gmail account. Especially for your whole family.So, the options are nuke all your Google accounts and suffer the consequences, or pay up.Not like we didn&#39;t see this coming of course, but still sucks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love Bitwarden, I personally onboarded dozen … but they must heavily invest in UI/UX and fix their apps (+ extensions) It’s not easy and intuitive for non-techies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Biwarden extensively, in self-hosted mode (vaultwarden), for a few years now.It is truly excellent, especially the fact that you can &#34;move&#34; an entry to an organization, where everyone has the same ownership and rights (and not merely &#34;share&#34; it). Plus a ton of wonderful things.There are two minor points I am missing:- the ability to control someone&#39;s passwords. Typical usage: the 24/7/365 support for my parents, where I would like to be able to access their passwords (they also would like that, obviously). There would be a simple solution: the ability to force someone to file entries only in an organization. But it is not possible (and new entries will go to the personal vault by default).- the ability to discard the Android pop-up, sometimes it completely blocks the ability to manually fill in something. An &#34;escape&#34; kind of gesture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related talk by Dan Liebgold from Naughty Dog, at RacketCon 2013:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c&amp;t=55sStarting at around 10m into the talk, Liebgold says their DC language for TLOU (to get what they most needed from a DSL even if using C++ instead of GOAL) was implemented in Racket.For anyone not familiar with TLOU, it was a critically-acclaimed game, and my personal all-time favorite game for storytelling that somehow grabbed me.  (I dislike all zombie franchises, but at a key point towards the end of the nonlinear narrative and playing in the game, I was surprised how much I really wanted to protect the kid.  Which I&#39;ll partly attribute to a Lispy DSL that helped them execute immersive storytelling in a zombie stealth shooter.)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us#Critical_respon...This is one of the Racket success stories.  They seem to happen because someone already knows they want a Lisp, they end up picking Racket without needing anyone else&#39;s permission, and the people using it are capable of designing and building whatever missing pieces they need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GOAL / games written in Lisp have been a lifelong obsession. I used to search for hours for any scrap of information about the language. I would have traded a lot for this repo when I was 19.Thank you to the authors for fulfilling a teenage dream. Please consider doing Last Of Us next —- I once downloaded it and tore it apart for any signs of lisp, but it was all compiled bytecode. That’s where I gave up, but it looks like you took it one millennium further by reverse engineering the bytecode from Jak and Dexter to make your own port that compiles to the same bytecode. If you have infinite time, you could theoretically do this for last of us too, and also last of us 2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Abuse was mostly written in Lisp. 2d side scrolling action game from the 90s that was unusual in being commercial with a brick and mortar release but also supporting Linux. It uses keyboard for direction mouse for aiming at the same time, which was also kind of unique at the time. The code is open source, complete with modernization, but you have to dig around for it nowdays.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_(video_game)"</p>

Two rogue bones in my neck. Plaque on my beloved’s brain. Great love stories begin with such heady promise and end with such sadness and grief—but, at least in my case, also with memories of immense joy throughout a muscular marriage of two strong, supportive partners with challenges aplenty.So poignantly expressed. I am usually skeptical of &#39;true love&#39;, but these kind of stories remind me I could be so utterly wrong. It is rare to find people as committed to each other as Judy &amp; Steve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a lovely story, but quite honestly, Alzheimer&#39;s/dementia is a shitshow. I wouldn&#39;t wish it on my worst enemy and there are many people I despise. There is nothing crueler than dementia.My mom is suffering through dementia right now. We did something similar. We made photo albums, and went through them every day, until my mom stopped responding to them. Within a couple of years, she forgot who we were, or she would mix up my sister for her sister.After 7 years from her diagnosis, she no longer talks and she no longer responds to me. My sister is taking full time care of her, and she is cleaning her several times a day because she&#39;s incontinent. My mom recently has stopped swallowing. She also seems to have contracted a mild case of COVID, and my sister has been self-flagellating herself because she felt guilty about it. I of course told my sister there&#39;s no reason to feel guilty, everyone is getting it and it&#39;s something everyone will deal with, especially my mom. I secretly wish it would take my mom&#39;s life to end her misery.The worst part in the first few years were her lucid moments. During one of those moments she wrote a letter to God, asking to die, because she knew something was wrong but she didn&#39;t know what. We found the letter hidden in her dresser. Every time I think about it, I burst out in tears, even now. It&#39;s disgustingly cruel for someone who spend her entire life sacrificing her life for her kids and family, and asking nothing else.So when articles like this come out, it is extremely difficult to contain my contempt at any stories that don&#39;t paint the picture exactly how it is: a complete and utter shitshow. It&#39;s unfair for the victim and it&#39;s unfair for the caretakers. And it&#39;s extremely expensive and almost impossible to keep your loved one living in a modicum of dignity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of you who are younger and perhaps haven&#39;t experienced it, forget the movie version of true love.  This story is a much better example - it&#39;s imperfect, illogical, sometimes downright gritty and yet it persists (with bouquets of flowers spread throughout)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve also built a simple and small (99sqm) PassivHaus in Romania, 5 years ago. Everybody, and I mean everybody from family to friends called me nuts, but I&#39;ve got my payback this winter when the energy prices went trough the roof and I&#39;m just slightly affected.The house is elevated from the ground on 12 concrete columns so that I can insulate under the foundation beams using glass foam, insulation on walls is 30 cm of EPS graphite, underfloor 45 cm EPS and on the roof, 50 cm and the orientation is full on south. For heating it consumes about 1500-2000 kWh per year (December, January, February and a maybe a small part of March)What is the big difference between houses built in North America and Europe is that the European houses are built using concrete and masonry which give them a lot of thermal mass which is crucial to this kind of builds.Have a look here [0], this is the first PassivHaus in my area and is nicely documented.
The cost of building a PassivHaus in my country typically goes about 20-25% more than a traditional one.[0]: http://www.sdac.ro/site/archives/category/passivehouse"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is at the extreme end of the spectrum, there is a much easier way to save lots of energy: just build modern well-insulated homes.I lived in California and I was appalled at the monstrous energy waste: houses are generally made pretty much from cardboard. You need to cool them in summertime and heat them in wintertime, and the energy expenditure is enormous.I now live in Poland and have recently built small homes that are similar in structure to the ones in CA: wooden frame, drywall inside. But the ones here have walls that are 25cm thick because of insulation (mineral wool) and use advanced modern membranes as well. Together, these things do wonders, and maintaining warmth in wintertime using a heat pump (AC) is easy and doesn&#39;t cost an arm and a leg.In other words, you can get 80% of the benefits with 20% of the effort — just design thicker walls with insulation and use modern materials."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People fail to appreciate how much leveraged financing affects the design of houses. If you pay 100% for a house and you decide to build something only you appreciate using 10% of your budget, you will lose 10% of your investment when selling the house. If you put down 20% and have the bank finance 80%, then the same decision will wipe out 50% of your investment. This means for financed houses, &#34;resale value&#34; becomes the preeminent decision affecting the design of a house.In Economics, this is known as a &#34;Keynesian Beauty Contest&#34; [1] where your job is to predict what everyone else predicts will be the most popular option and Keynesian Beauty Contests can get weird.eg: It&#39;s quite possible that you might personally hate granite countertops but still feel the need to put a granite countertop in your home because you believe it will help the resale value of your home. It&#39;s quite possible for everyone in a community to all hate granite countertops but for everyone to still put granite countertops in their home because they believe everyone else loves granite countertops. It&#39;s quite possible for everyone in a community to hate granite countertops and to know that everyone else hates granite countertops and still make the economically rational decision to put a granite countertop in their house to help with the resale value.A lot of &#34;economically irrational&#34; housing decisions are driven by this core transformation via Mortgage Backed Securities of a house from a consumption based purchase of a place to enjoy living into an investment asset that dominates most people&#39;s finances.It&#39;s only in houses built for the independently wealthy that don&#39;t really care about the future resale value of their houses that a lot of the good building science expertise still lies. That&#39;s why, paradoxically, in countries much poorer than the US/UK/Aus/NZ, you see much better building quality because their finance systems are also less developed.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Naturally, large range uncertainty increases the ambiguity of position, but the relative position of the satellites also matters. If they aren’t well spread, the exactness of calculated location also suffers.(see the excellent example in OP)Fun tidbit, the resulting error is known for the system in closed form as Geometric Dilution of Precision, and is a 3x3 (edit: or 4+x4+ if you are estimating bias or quantities like time, thx brandmeyer) matrix that depends on all the locations of the visible sats, and your position relative to them.GDOP is a general relationship for any estimator based only on the equations used to derive something from sensor remote sensor measurements. It&#39;s possible to derive GDOP for any sensing system using the Fisher Information Matrix (which is the inverse of GDOP). Some minor caveats apply, but in general this is a useful trick.FIM is worth learning if you want to get into sensing &amp; estimation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_informationAnother fun thing: FIM can be derived a number of ways, and appears if you simply ask (mathematically) &#34;What is the most likely position of the gps sensor given sat locations&#34; as the hessian matrix of the system that you use while answering that question using e.g., convex minimization.All of sensing &amp; estimation is just mostly convex optimization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very nice. Very clear, and the 3D interactives are excellent at guiding the explanation.One thing that I thought was a little confusing was right at the beginning, when we were estimating the position of the figurine and there was an area of uncertainty shown by the yellow circle.It isn&#39;t clear how you&#39;re estimating position, and why we have an area of uncertainty. At first I figured it was going to explain it using triangulation (measurement of angles) but there&#39;s no reason triangulation wouldn&#39;t be exactly as accurate as the tape measure method on a 2D surface, so wouldn&#39;t explain the area of uncertainty.The description merely says:&gt; Just by using these three reference points we can relate the figurine’s position in the environment to an approximate placement on the map as show with the yellow shape on the right.I worry that having this ambiguity so early on might put some people off from reading the rest, because they figure they don&#39;t understand that and so won&#39;t understand the rest of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s so depressing that – at some point in the future – I&#39;m going to want a really clear and precise explanation of how GPS works and the likelihood that an internet search directs me to this excellent, clean, and ad-free blog is essentially nil."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s wild how Microsoft has been able to vertically integrate gaming.They now own the distribution (Xbox Cloud Gaming, Xbox Game Pass), the games (Call of Duty, WoW, Starcraft + what they owned before), the OS (Windows, Xbox), the hardware (Xbox, many PCs), and the back end compute (Azure). The only thing they&#39;re missing, the network bandwidth, is mostly a commodity anyway.That&#39;s a heck of a moat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With these kind of acquisitions, other companies are going to find it very hard to compete with Game Pass.I think we&#39;ll look back in 10 years and wonder why antitrust regulators did nothing, but it may be too late by then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate to see a monopoly in the gaming industry. Controlling the content will prevent any competition both in gaming consoles and in PC gaming. Forget about gaming on Linux or any new platform. Forget about sony&#39;s PlayStation and Nintendo. We are going to see the real face of Microsoft. What do you think Microsoft will do next? Buy unreal engine and unity and have control over the content and the tools to make them? We NEED open source game engines (Godot, Bevy) more than ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This shows that the articles by those who uncovered the plans were right [e.g. 1] - even though this is a political campaign paid for by the UK public (via the Government), and developed and coordinated by the Government, they have big logos of community groups and charities at the bottom and minimises the Government&#39;s involvement -&gt; &#34;According to the [M&amp;C Saatchi] presentation, the push will appear to be  the result of grassroots action and children’s charities, while downplaying any government role.&#34;The whole thing is just a pile of emotional manipulation, while compeletly ignoring the far, far greater number of legitimate uses of end to end encryption, and the actual dangers to everyday people of personal information being stolen, accessed, leaked, etc. if it&#39;s banned! Extremely dirty tactics.1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29955893"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re framing it as a choice between child safety and encryption. I think everyone on HN knows how utterly stupid that is, so I won&#39;t belabour the point.However, what offends me, and I don&#39;t see mentioned enough, is that the UK government is exploiting the real suffering of children to destroy something that protects us all, children and adults alike. They do not speak for those children or their families. They&#39;re exploiting them and their trauma for political gain.If I was in the U.K., this would be enough to forever turn me off the ruling Conservative party. It&#39;s disgusting. They have no morals. It&#39;s not just that they&#39;re lying -- every political side lies all the time, sometimes out of necessity. It&#39;s that they&#39;re re-victimizing the very kids they claim to be protecting. And they appear to be proud enough of that fact to promote it in this way.I will never vote for a politician or party that&#39;s OK with that, no matter what their other policies may be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should be a bit less naive about what this play really is. There is a talking point I&#39;ve observed in some of my more progressive circles that &#34;nerds aren&#39;t the good guys anymore,&#34; as managerialists see principled people who demand facts, evidence, logic, and reason as an obstacle to their maintaining control of &#34;The Narrative,&#34; which is whatever absurdity authorities and their toadies use to demonstrate their alignment.This campaign has nothing to do with protecting children - especially given the UK establishment&#39;s veritable tradition of both organizing and covering up industrial scale sexual abuse - and it is nothing more than hate speech designed to cast aspersions upon and isolate technologists as part of a broader political effort.The Rolling Stone article from earler this week said, &#34;The Home Office has hired the M&amp;C Saatchi advertising agency — a spin-off of Saatchi and Saatchi, which made the “Labour Isn’t Working” election posters, among the most famous in UK political history — to plan the campaign, using public funds.&#34;I would encourage HN readers to recognize this campaign is only nominally about encryption, and mainly it is about politically attacking the credibility and reputations of civilian technologists, and by conflating your expertise with abusers this M&amp;C Saatchi agency has produced literal hate propaganda against you. (just following orders, surely!) I&#39;d recommend people to not underestimate what this is."</p>

Period.I experienced this myself on the PS4 version of Terraria. I bought a hard-copy of the game. I mastered the controls, and loved them. Terraria was updated one day, and the controls were all changed, completely. Total rip-off. I liked the game I bought, but it was replaced without my consent.My feeling is that this behavior should be illegal for purchased products."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The method to get into &#34;God Mode&#34; is the same, except now it prompts you for a code.  Someone has figured out how to calculate it and actually created a website to generate codes for you.http://getresponsecode.comApparently the algorithm is very simple according to Reddit
https://old.reddit.com/r/nordictrack/comments/ozkp8v/privile...&gt;long responseCode = new Random((long) Integer.parseInt(iFitCode)).nextInt(999999);It&#39;s not a perfect workaround, as it resets on the next boot, but I&#39;ve seen that people are installing apps such as Taskbar which float overtop the iFit app and start on boot, allowing you to still launch your apps like Netflix etc even without God Mode enabled.It&#39;s only a matter of time before Nordic decides to block this method as well. We should also be looking into how to block updates to these devices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jeeze, I will stick with my modular solution: an ipad on a music stand. This is compatible not only with any commodity treadmill, but also bike trainers, ellipticals, and making vroomvroom noises on the motorcycle when it&#39;s too icy to actually ride. I could also swap out the ipad for a laptop, non-ipad tablet, or a collection of cute succulents should I desire it.snark aside, I&#39;m a bicycle guy and I really like that we have an ecosystem of bluetooth trainers and apps that all work pretty well with each other. Simulating hilly courses is actually really useful and has made me a better rider, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m advocating being a total luddite. While I prefer to ride outdoors in the sun, my area in Iowa is extremely flat and the only difficulty comes from the wind, and I find the new toys are a lot more fun than a dumb trainer with a sufferfest DVD. I don&#39;t really know much about the treadmill scene but I hope you guys have access to similar stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would be more fun in a blog post. Twitter is a fucking horrible format for a complex analysis of special relativity.That aside, my favourite quirk from relativity is this:  &#34;The more you move in space, the less you move in time.&#34;

Like relativity in general, it sounds simple enough, but it&#39;s consequences are profoundly shocking. (That is, if you take the time to understand it, and don&#39;t leap to the conclusion that you know relativity better than Einstein or Penrose ;)Take the case of two people on Earth, one stationary and one travelling past in a car. They each have a different reference frame, and a different set events which make up their present. Now imagine that there is an alien government in Andromeda debating a possible invasion of Earth. In the reference frame of the person on Earth who is moving, the debate is still going on. But, in the reference frame of the stationary person, it is a day or so later in Andromeda, and the invasion fleet is already on it&#39;s way! In nature there is no absolute reference frame we can call base reality, and both observers reference frames are equally valid. Then the outcome of the invasion debate is a foregone conclusion. How can there be any room for free will in the deliberations of the alien government? This is the crux of the Andromeda Paradox and the Reitdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument.BTW:  &#34;Notice that neither observer can actually &#34;see&#34; what is happening in Andromeda, because light from Andromeda (and the hypothetical alien fleet) will take 2.5 million years to reach Earth. The argument is not about what can be &#34;seen&#34;; it is purely about what events different observers consider to occur in the present moment.&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the topic of special relativity, I wholeheartedly recommend recently published &#34;Unusually Special Relativity| by Andrzej Dragan (https://www.amazon.com/Unusually-Special-Relativity-Andrzej-...). It starts from basic high-school mathematics but covers many paradoxes and puzzles. Some might challenge ordinary students, who know the formula but didn&#39;t stretch their minds on &#34;what if&#34; questions. It includes cases where velocity is higher than the speed of light - as there are a few caveats on &#34;nothing can travel faster than light&#34;.Also, this &#34;velocity addition for v&lt;&lt;c&#34; is covered in the first chapter.I read its draft almost 20 years ago (back then, it was a collection of notes in Polish) and didn&#39;t find anything remotely close to it in English. Later, I had the pleasure of attending his course.Also, Andrzej Dragan is a notorious individual, primarily known in photography (https://andrzejdragan.com/). To the point that there are posts on &#34;how to Draganize a picture&#34;."</p>
