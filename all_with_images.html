								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I may believe almost all of this is overblown and silly, as like a matter of cryptographic research, but I&#39;ll say that Matt Topic and Merrick Wayne are the real deal, legit the lawyers you want working on something like this, and if they&#39;re involved, presumably some good will come out of the whole thing.Matt Topic is probably best known as the FOIA attorney who got the Laquan McDonald videos released in Chicago; I&#39;ve been peripherally involved in some work he and Merrick Wayne did for a friend, in a pretty technical case that got fierce resistance from CPD, and those two were on point. Whatever else you&#39;d say about Bernstein here, he knows how to pick a FOIA lawyer.A maybe more useful way to say the same thing is: if Matt Topic and Merrick Wayne are filing this complaint, you should probably put your money on them having NIST dead-to-rights with the FOIA process stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is curious, the courtlistener link for the lawsuit is here: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/64872195/bernstein-v-na...(And somebody has already kindly uploaded the documents to RECAP, so it costs you nothing to access.)Aside: I really wish people would link to court documents whenever they talk about an ongoing lawsuit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The same people tend to have trouble grasping that most of the vulnerabilities exploited and encouraged by NSA are also exploitable by the Chinese government. These people start with the assumption that Americans are the best at everything; ergo, we&#39;re also the best at espionage. If the Chinese government stole millions of personnel records from the U.S. government, records easily usable as a springboard for further attacks, this can&#39;t possibly be because the U.S. government made a policy decision to keep our computer systems &#34;weak enough to still permit an attack of some nature using very sophisticated (and expensive) techniques&#34;.I&#39;m not sure if I understand this part. I was under the impression that the OPM hack was a result of poor authn and authz controls, unrelated to cryptography. Was there a cryptography component sourced somewhere?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please now also improve search results without quotes. When I query a b c (without quotes) I want results exclusively containing all 3 words, not just one or two of them. There&#39;s a reason I typed it.Next, remove content thieves like Pinterest entirely from the index.Next, invest in recency + relevancy over just page reputation. A huge amount of high value recent content is written but it keeps losing against much worse old content which only ranks because it&#39;s old. As the typical example: the 15 year old Stackoverflow jQuery answer.Invest in location awareness. Including location in your query gives laughable results.Find a way to down rank sites gaming particular categories with shady tactics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating. Not because of the content of this article, but because it&#39;s the first glimpse behind the Google Search curtain that I&#39;ve ever seen in an official Google post. You rarely see details about search explained. Or maybe I&#39;m just ignorant.Even that bit about &#34;don&#39;t&#34; being turned into &#34;don t&#34; was interesting. Again, not because I was amazed in any way. More so because Search has been so mysterious for many years."</p>

I’m working from a hotel right now, so I can easily imagine it. Folding flat would offer protection from scratches in a bag/backpack and take less space. Would be hard pressed to fit a 17” portable monitor in my bag, but if it folds in half that’s more tenable!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Musk&#39;s counterclaims are more interesting than Twitter&#39;s response. Here&#39;s the summary of the five counterclaims:* Twitter committed fraud by lying to the SEC about the mDAU numbers with the intent of inducing Musk to buy Twitter at an inflated price. No, really, this is the allegation (see paragraphs 202-206).* Count 2 is that Twitter committed [Texas fraud statute] by lying when it offered its shares. It&#39;s shotgun-pled, so I don&#39;t know which specific statements are supposed to be wrong, but I&#39;m imagining it&#39;s basically the previous count recast under a different statute.* Count 3 says that Twitter broke the contract by failing to provide information.* Count 4 says that Twitter broke the contract by instituting a hiring freeze. [not gonna fly, especially when Musk admitted that Twitter gave him warning of what it was doing and Musk didn&#39;t respond. Did I mention that Musk&#39;s answer admits far more than I would have expected?]* Count 5 is pretty please declare that Twitter lying about mDAUs is a materially adverse event that is cause to break the contract.I still can&#39;t get over the banana-pants insanity of the first count... arguing that Twitter lied about its numbers for years specifically so that someone would buy it at an inflated price?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;To the contrary, Musk forwent all due diligence—giving Twitter twenty-four hours to accept his take-it-or-leave-it offer before he would present it directly to Twitter&#39;s stockholders,&#34; Twitter wrote.Bot/spam account analysis is just trying to do PR spin. Musk has no legal standing to use any of that to back out of the merger.&gt; The five-day trial is now scheduled to begin on October 17So we will see about 2 more months of PR campaigns from Musk and Twitter about the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it rather ridiculous and in bad faith that Musk is harping on the bot issue for 2 reasons.First, it wouldn&#39;t matter anyway. He signed away any and all rights to due diligence in the agreement.And secondly, it&#39;s completely impossible for any outside analysis to determine the number of active users on Twitter because most active Twitter users don&#39;t tweet or interact in anyway. They just read tweets and those users see ads, which makes them monetizable users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not terribly surprised. In my experience the calls for more housing from the wealthy and business class are disingenuous; more often really a call for more apartments to be built exclusively in neighbourhoods dominated by the poor and working class and a continued ban of apartments in the low density single family home areas that the wealthy business owning class live in.Often this is called the &#34;Grand Bargain,&#34; that new housing can be allowed, but only if it is constrained to a tiny area (which becomes increasingly dense), while the bulk of single family homes are left untouched.The challenge for voters is to discern between those that are calling for more housing that are genuine YIMBYs, that want to build more housing for everyone more equitably, everywhere in all neighbourhoods, and those like Andreessen, which merely want to continue on with Grand Bargain thinking, and want to continue the status quo by which the poors live as far as possible away from him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun fact: the town of Atherton is also singlehandedly responsible for delaying and almost derailing Caltrain&#39;s electrification project, because the electric poles needed would, and I quote, &#34;compromise the quaint character of our neighborhood&#34; (shock horror).https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2017/12/21/atherton-battlin...And of course: &#34;Other speakers protested the aesthetic and safety impacts of the taller, and heavier, poles, saying they would also reduce property values.&#34;The town also voted to close their own Caltrain station, because they clearly don&#39;t want the kind of riff-raff who use public transport there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve served on a city Planning Commission, and I can say categorically that you never truly know who someone is until the city tries to re-zone the property around their house.Being fair to Andreessen and his family, they likely bought their house knowing that the property was zoned single-family residential, as was the entire neighborhood, and that it&#39;s relatively difficult to change land use policy. That is, until the Legislature of the State of California decided it knew better than every incorporated city, and wrote a housing density law that superseded local zoning regulations.I&#39;ve always been surprised that tech billionaires don&#39;t spend money influencing State Senate/Assembly races. Maybe that will change."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roomba / iRobot is years behind the Chinese companies. We just got an Ecovacs X1 Omni - a mopping vacuum bot with actual rotating mop scrubbers, AI vision obstacle avoidance, LIDAR mapping, and most importantly fully automated water fill &amp; mop pad cleaning at the base station. We fill a clean water tank &amp; empty the dirty one about once a week. Floors are spotless - huge difference from static cloth mopping bots.Meanwhile, iRobot still hadn’t figured out how to make an effective stand-alone mop bot, much less an auto fill station or combined bot that actually works. Roborock and Ecovacs products launch in China 6-12 months before their US launch. By the time Roomba has a decent mop bot, the X2 or X3 will probably be out offering integration with home plumbing to avoid any manual intervention for months at a time.EDIT: commenters are asking what works offline from Roborock / Ecovacs. For the self-cleaning-mop generation like the X1 Omni:- Roborock obstacle avoidance is local, but works better with cloud.- Roborock can be controlled by a local home automation server without internet access.- Ecovacs obstacle avoidance requires cloud.- Ecovacs control requires cloud.I remembered these stats from a Youtube video that I can&#39;t find; probably in my partner&#39;s history since we watched reviews on the TV together.I picked the X1 Omni over the Roborock because it has superior mopping performance on tile floors, but I think both would be good options. It seems like Roborock is more privacy compatible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean not trying to start a flame war, but everyone is
praising how great roborock is but the reality is, most of  Xiaomi/Roborock technology is stolen/reversed engineered from Neato. Chinese robot vacuum would not even be close to their current capabilities if it wasn’t for the LiDAR on the XV11. If you look at the tear down from the first couple gen, the PCB and components were exactly the same compared to Neatos. (I owned both Neato and Roborock vacuums)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if Amazon actually cares about cleaning robots, or if they&#39;re after the data roomba collects? https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16055590/roomba-wont-sell..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a feeling this was gonna be about 3D Touch just from seeing the title.It was definitely one of my favorite features, and Force Touch isn&#39;t a drop-in replacement.With 3D Touch anywhere on the keyboard, you could apply pressure to start moving the caret (text cursor) around, but what was even more useful was being able to apply a little bit more pressure to start selecting text with incredible precision.With Force Touch, you can long press on the space bar till you get haptic feedback, then you can move the caret around freely. However, if you want to select text, you need to use a second finger on the keyboard after you start moving the caret around, but honestly it&#39;s an absolute mess to use; try it out, I can guarantee you won&#39;t be able to select what you were planning on.However, as much as I miss it every time I fail to accurately select text on iOS, I don&#39;t mourn its loss. Force Touch is adequate. It&#39;s just not a replacement, and seems a shame it was probably removed to reduce costs and hardware complexity, all at the cost of regression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, missing this 3D Touch.The input experience (or AI supported typing) is getting worse and worse for me on the iPhone. Especially, if your are using different languages in parallel. For me it is my mother tongue German and my most second language English and sometimes using Spanish. In an (for me) unpredictable way, there are words replaced to &#34;correct&#34; typos. But, independent of the used keyboard language, which is completely ignored for this auto-correct, it replaces it with German word, when I write English and sometimes with English words when I type German. Then this forced touch was helpful to select the letters/word to re-write it correctly to make the sentence meaningful. But now, this whole selection process is completely broken (for me). Since the removal of force touch, when I try to go to a specific spot, it selects parts of the sentence in a completely (for me) unpredictable way. Then I have no chance to un-select anymore, so I have to replace the whole. The experience is getting worse and worse.I think peak iOS was in the past."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe I’m in the minority here but I really did not like the feature and many people I tried to explain the feature to were confused that it existed.. “no no don’t tap the screen, you need to PUSH on the screen to make it do the action”.. and I would get a look like “huh?? Push on the screen? Why what’s that gonna do..” people saying pushing hard on the screen is intuitive seemed to live in a different bubble of people than I interacted with.."</p>

I&#39;m particularly excited for the HeatMap render pass, seems like a really practical way to identify what&#39;s bogging your scene down. Not to mention the gorgeous volumetric rendering this engine is capable of (see How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden Realm[2]).Really impressed that Dreamworks is making this move. They&#39;ve made some of my favorite films of all time (the Dragons franchise genuinely changed my life and is a major part of why I love filmmaking, film scores, and 3D rendering) and I&#39;m glad to see they&#39;re doing this.

Calling one of the officials, they asked for a solution. They told them to ship everything first to the UK. There, they should unpack every single object, and package them again with different country labels. Once the box has passed custom, nobody will raise the topic about the equipment origin.And so this is what they do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Trade is really a matter for the government, and the US (sadly) adheres to the One China Policy. This just reflects the official policy, and having the companies pick this fight instead of the country is hypocritical."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the idea of this, and I disagree with others about the price being too high. If you&#39;re in the US/Canada/UK and planning to spend even a couple of hours per month using this to further your skills and career, then the value of your time investment will exceed your cash outlay on the subscription.That being said, I wonder whether you&#39;ve considered offering a student discount for bona fide students? You could do this via sites like Unidays or StudentBeans. You can rely on their process for verifying students, instead of just accepting anyone with an edu email address (which are sometimes available to alumni).I&#39;m sure some of the folks doing online CS degrees at WGU and Georgia Tech would be interested in this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Price point I feel is too high for specifically what it is offering.A general point I would make.In education: cost is a barrier of entry - a smaller ask might yield far more results from people in disadvantaged situations able to scrabble up ladder. A rising tide raises all ships.You are doing work creating the material and course work - I&#39;m not saying release stuff for free. but $80/mo is something to bat an eye at for a lot of people that would otherwise be interested in this.I would price it at $40-60, with maybe an intro month at $20. the $60 price point is a video game: which fits in my mind as roughly the value you seem to be offering per month. but I don&#39;t actually know how much time each course takes - thus the range from $40-60.that&#39;s just my two cents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks very promising, I think it could be a great resource for companies that want to invest in training their developers, but don&#39;t have the resources to build a curriculum themselves.&gt; What new courses should we add?The courses you have already are good, but are quite low-level. To broaden the applicability perhaps you could also try something like &#34;build a REST API that matches this OpenAPI schema&#34; (getting persistence working properly could be an interesting challenge). Going further, I wonder if it&#39;s possible to do a course like &#34;build a web app that does X&#34; (Realworld or TODOMVC are possible values of X), using browser automation to test. This is probably very hard without manual review. (Scoped broadly enough, this could be solved with a server-rendered framework or a client-side framework.) Common engineering/craftsmanship problems here are authentication, persistence, navigation, performance tuning, perhaps log-wiring, etc.More generally, I&#39;m wondering if there is a good open-source option as a competitor / baseline comparison? As others have noted, Leetcode is one common source of study exercises, but it&#39;s quite annoying to work with as you need to submit code in the browser rather than using your IDE. I&#39;d love to see a repo with exhaustive test cases for the things you&#39;re building; for example low-level algorithmic exercises like &#34;exhaustive tests for binary search tree&#34; or higher-level &#34;build a git client&#34; like CodeCrafters offers. Being able to step-debug through failing test cases is always going to be more realistic training than the Leetcode workflow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s annoying for sure. I deal with abuse at a large scale.I&#39;d recommend:- Rate-limit everything, absolutely everything. Set sane limits.- Rate-limit POST requests harder. Preferably dynamically based on geoip.- Rate-limit login and comment POST requests even harder. Ban IPs that exceed the amount.- Require TLS. Drop TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1. Bots certainly break.- Require SNI. Do not reply without SNI (nginx has 444 return code for that). Ban IP&#39;s on first hit that connect without. There&#39;s no legitimate use and you&#39;ll also disappear from places like Shodan.- If you can, require HTTP/2.0. Bots break.- Ban IP&#39;s listed on StopForumSpam, ban destination e-mail addresses listed there. If possible also contribute back to SFS and AbuseIPDB.- Collect JA3 hashes, figure out malicious ones, ban IPs that use those hashes. This blocks a lot of shit trivially because targeting tools instead of behaviour is accurate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really glad to see someone finally talking about this.Does anyone know what&#39;s going on with that &#34;Duke de Montosier&#34; spam botnet? It accounts for more than half of the botspam attacks on my sites, and I can&#39;t find anyone talking about it online anywhere, except one tweet dating back to mid-2021. It&#39;s identifiable by several short phrases that it posts:Duke de Montosierfor Countess Louise of SavoyTestaru. Best knownAnd cryptic short posts that can assemble into creepy sequences:Europe, and in Ancient RussiaCentury to a kind of destruction:Western Europe also formedand was erased, and on cleanedonly a few survivednumber of surviving European55 thousand Greek, 30 thousand ArmenianMany of the IPs involved seemed to be in Russia, China and Hong Kong, though they&#39;re coming from all over (eg European &amp; US VPNs, Tor exit nodes). From tracking the IPs on AbuseIPDB, the weird spam posts seem to be just one layer, while behind the scenes it also attempts SMTP Auth and IMAP attacks on the server.I&#39;m eager to know more if anyone knows, and especially if anyone is trying to shut this thing down. But I can&#39;t find anyone even talking about it. (Maybe there&#39;s a reason for that?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  They&#39;re a major part in killing off web forums, and a significant wet blanket on any sort of fun internet creativity or experimentation.&gt; The only ones that can survive the robot apocalypse is large web services. Your reddits, and facebooks, and twitters, and SaaS-comment fields, and discords. They have the economies of scale to develop viable countermeasures, to hire teams of people to work on the problem full time and maybe at least keep up with the ever evolving bots.This is not true at all.  There are web forums that are not &#34;web-scale&#34; and don&#39;t spend all day fighting bot spam.  The solution is real simple: it costs 10 bux to register an account, if you&#39;re a nuisance your account is banned and you pay 10bux to get back on.Even the sites that don&#39;t require payment for explicit registration - often succeed by gating functionality or content behind paywalls.  Requiring a &#34;premium membership&#34; to post in the classifieds forum is an extremely extremely common thing on small interest-based web-boards (photrio, pentaxforums, homebrewtalk, etc).  That income supports the site and supports the anti-bot efforts as a whole.  The customer isn&#39;t advertisers - it&#39;s the community itself, and you&#39;re providing the service of high-quality content and access to people with similar interests.You need to bootstrap a community first, of course, but it doesn&#39;t need to be a large community, just a high-value one.The twitters and facebooks of the world just don&#39;t like that solution because they value growth above all other considerations.  They&#39;d rather be kings of a billion user website with 200 million bots than a 1k-100k user forum with 100% organic membership and content.  And they value engagement over content quality, which is the entire reason comment-tree/vote-based systems have been pushed heavily over web-1.0 threaded forum discussions as well.This botpocalypse is the inevitable outcome of the systems that social-media giants have created, not inherent outcomes of the internet as a whole."</p>

Your tab just crashed.&#34;  https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/i...I really hate the way the &#34;Gah&#34; wording feigns shock, as if Mozilla are also inconvenienced alongside me. Then the meat of the error implies I am at fault. It&#39;s my tab that crashed, and I caused it to happen by doing whatever I did on whatever page I was choosing to visit. Any blame is deflected away from Firefox itself.Then it makes me feel doubly bad because I immediately realize I&#39;m getting upset at something incredibly trivial, but man it annoys me!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also stop treating your users like idiots. The &#34;Something went wrong&#34; of Microsoft products is just offensive when it doesn&#39;t even show you the error code - it&#39;s basically saying that you&#39;re too stupid to understand, so we&#39;re not going to show you exactly what happened. I&#39;d maybe understand if it was just MS Word doing this, but when an Xbox Devkit does that, which you know - by definition - only professionals can have and use, then it&#39;s worse then useless, it&#39;s actively condescending."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a fairly ubiquitous pattern, these days, with mega-corporations, using &#34;folksy&#34; or humorous, language (Slack/Salesforce comes to mind).I think that it has its place, but, like so many cultural artifacts, needs to be done very, very carefully.Humor and colloquialism doesn&#39;t usually translate. That&#39;s not just between languages, but also between cultures. Canadian humor may be lost on Americans, and vice-versa.The users of a product are often of a drastically different culture from the creators. It&#39;s quite possible that &#34;folksy&#34; stuff from the creators, meant to be comforting and approachable, is perceived as &#34;condescending,&#34; or &#34;patronizing,&#34; to the end-user.Also, error reporting is an extremely sensitive area. Often. the user is under a lot of stress, and can feel intimidated by the product (and, by extension, its creators).Some developers may feel that &#34;puts the user in their place,&#34; but I&#39;d argue that may not be a desirable outcome. I like the users of my stuff to feel comfortable, and in control of their user experience.I have noticed that there&#39;s a pervasive disrespect for users, in our industry. In some cases, it comes down to naked hatred.I guess, if we look at the users of our products as cattle, to be fattened, sold, and slaughtered, it&#39;s inevitable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry for your loss and everyone else who is sharing.About 10 years ago, my mom came down with cancer and was in hospice care for some time. I had the opportunity to sit with her and hold hands and talk. She was a person of faith, I am not. She asked me to light the yahrzeit for her which I of course agreed to do, and did, although I had to consult the internet to figure out how.She asked me if I would reconsider my rejection of faith, I had to be honest with her and said that I was sorry that I could not do that. She said if she got up there, into heaven, and could get me a message, would I change my mind. I said sure Ma. We came up with a goofy pass phrase, that only her and I knew, and pinky swore never to tell anyone. No, I have not received the message, but I do the candle. It is coming up on the 10th the web site says."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for your loss.The thing I noticed is that I have my own life - my grandparents passed some stories to me as well as my parents and they are part of my life. I have photos from like 1900&#39;s passed to me as family heirloom.But I came to realization that I am unable to understand even 15% of any other persons life. Even my SO life will be maybe tops 40% that I can grasp or share as we spend really a lot of time together.Maybe that is me but I feel that we are really isolated and our communications with words is really limited. Even being together in the same moment - each person feels/reacts a bit different.I paint it as tragic in a sense but it is also beautiful that we really are unique snowflakes in the end.So in the end I don&#39;t feel like it is even important for me to make some kind of interview - important part is to remember that they were alive and their life was their own and only their own as I cannot touch it I cannot grasp it - hence all life being special and to be celebrated, because there is not going to be second one that is identical with its struggles and with its dreams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of a project from long ago. When I was growing up, I was not particularly good about expressing gratitude to my family. I recognized this in myself and in college and wanted to make up for lost time.I went around and interviewed my extended family and some of my mom&#39;s friends over the course of about 6 months. I asked each person for any fun or touching stories they had. There were a lot. I edited down many hours of footage into a 45 minute video that basically said, &#34;thanks for the last 22 years&#34;.Days before I moved across country to start my job after graduation, I got the family together and had a viewing party. Unbeknownst to my mom this wasn&#39;t a going away party for me, it was an appreciation party for her. It was a wonderful moment.Two people who I interviewed as part of this project have since passed away. So I dug up and digitized all of the unedited footage so that I can easily pull it up on my computer. There are some wonderful memories from my grandma and my father at a happier/healthier time in their lives. In their final years they were not really able to speak at all, so this footage really captures them at their relative best. It has been a helpful way for me and my family to deal with grief.OP: Thank you for sharing your story. Sorry for your loss."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For our dating site, which of course has to deal with many prinses, Nigerian or otherwise, when we manually verified an account to be a scammer, we reject logins with a message stating that the IP address has been blocked. Scammers will usually go through all of their VPNs/bots in order to try to login, allowing our system to flag them all.We&#39;ll manually review all accounts that use (more than one of) those ip addresses. Works like a charm! :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, I have no issue with tactics like these when they&#39;re wasting spammers&#39; time. But sometimes it seems like real users get caught up in these honeypots for scammers and hackers.A lot of the crap real sites make people go through e.g. when they lose access to their account or login to a VPN or the site just &#34;can&#39;t verify their identity&#34; for some reason.  Where you go through a bunch of hoops and captchas, only to have some step fail or reach a dead end. They really seem like they&#39;re just set up to intentionally waste people&#39;s time.For example, Steam has a system where if you enter too many invalid passwords, it will present you with a captcha which you can never actually solve. It&#39;s a lot more annoying than just saying &#34;you have been locked out of trying to log in for X hours&#34;.But this, this is fine. It&#39;s pretty clear that the person you&#39;re targeting is a spammer, and it&#39;s pretty clear to the user after about 60 seconds that you&#39;re password system is a joke."</p>

You may want to configure some things, so check out the options[2].:If you want a &#34;native&#34; install, after you have elixir installed you can use     mix escript.install hex livebook

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a theory - tree based models require minimal feature engineering. They are capable of handling categorical data in principled ways, they can handle the most skewed/multimodal/heteroskedastic continuous numeric data just as easily as a 0-1 scaled normal distribution, and they are easy to regularize compared to a DL model (which could have untold millions of possible parameter combinations, let alone getting the thing to train to a global optimum).I think if you spent months getting your data and model structure to a good place, you could certainly get a DL model to out-perform a gradient boosted tree. But why do that, when the GBT will be done today?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (∼10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed.Is that really &#34;medium&#34;? That seems very small to me. MNIST has 60,000 samples and ImageNet has millions.I think the title overstates the findings. I&#39;d be interested to hear how these methods compare on much larger datasets. Is there a threshold at which deep learning outperforms tree-based models?Edit: They touch on this in the appendix:&gt; A.2.2 Large-sized datasets&gt; We extend our benchmark to large-scale datasets: in Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12, we compare the results
of our models on the same set of datasets, in large-size (train set truncated to 50,000 samples) and
medium-size (train set truncated to 10,000 samples) settings.&gt; We only keep datasets with more than 50,000 samples and restrict the train set size to 50,000 samples
(vs 10,000 samples for the medium-sized benchmark). Unfortunately, this excludes a lot of datasets,
which makes the comparison less clear. However, it seems that, in most cases, increasing the train set
size reduces the gap between neural networks and tree-based models. We leave a rigorous study of
this trend to future work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s baffling to me how little research attention there has been to improving tree-based methods, considering their effectiveness.For example, LightGBM and XGBoost allow some regularization terms, but the variance/bias is still mostly controlled by globally setting the max depth and max node count (and then parameter searching to find good settings).Surely there must be more powerful and sophisticated ways of deciding when to stop building each tree than counting the number of nodes?  If this was neural nets there would be a hundred competing papers proposing different methods and arguing over their strengths and weaknesses.I&#39;m not sure whether the problem is that neural nets are just fundamentally more sexy, or that in order to make SOTA improvements in GBMs you need to dive into some gnarly C++.  Probably both."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Re: the age of &#34;That&#39;s what she said&#34;:I thumbed through The Frogs (Aristophanes) at a used book store once.  This play was written circa 400 BC.  In the prologue, one character is offering to entertain the audience with a few jokes, and another character says, &#34;Yes, but not &#39;That&#39;s what she said.&#39;&#34;  The joke was too over-used.I was astounded to think that the joke was that old!  But it&#39;s actually not.  The old jokes of ancient Athenians were a little too obscure, I guess, so the translator picked a modern example.  Still, that translation of The Frogs is from the 1950s, so the joke was old at least that far back.  (Here is the translation: https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.65406/2015.6540...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These remind me of a category of &#34;joke&#34; that some of my middle-school peers and I engaged in: the non-joke. The only one I can remember went something like: a man walks into a bakery and asks for two baguettes. The baker looks at him, thinks for a moment and says &#34;It&#39;s OK, you can leave your bike outside&#34;.Looking back, I think this idea was somehow rooted in the idea that jokes have delivery and that if you use that delivery (rythmn, emphasis, body language) maybe you could say anything and be funny. There was also the peer effect - if you had an audience &#34;plant&#34; in the school yard that would start the laughter, sometimes it would catch even for these non-jokes.Decades later, the idea I described above seems both obviously false, but also true, in the sense that a lot of modern stand up is based on &#34;say anything the right way and people laugh&#34;. However, &#34;the right way&#34; for standup is very different than the &#34;telling a joke&#34; structure.On the other hand, it does feel to me at this point that this is the crux of the contemporary poetry slam: read an arbitrary text in the right way, and while it may not win any prizes, it will feel like poetry, because that&#39;s what make it poetry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m surprised noone has brought up what I recall being told was the oldest known joke. Not sure about the specifics, but IIRC it’s from a mesopotamian cuneiform tablet and goes something like “Name something that never happened — A wife has never farted in her husband’s lap”. Supposedly a reference to the common knowledge at the time that everyone involved (or maybe just the wife) would vehemently deny it if it did happen, or perhaps awkwardly pretend it didn’t happen, knowing well that everyone noticed and politely joins in the pretense.I don’t like it when people act as if these were objectively bad jokes. Many jokes are very dependent on a specific cultural moment as well as carefully crafted wording. Lots of current jokes fall can flat if you slightly change the phrasing, even if they aren’t word play. And then there’s delivery, pacing, knowing your audience…Surely widespread literacy and technology allow modern people to develop comparably sophisticated tastes just by the sheer wealth of entertainment we consume, but people 5000 years ago were still people and I’m sure they found humour in similar places as we do.edit: here’s a source: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-joke-odd-idUSKUA147851200... Again, I would take issue with the reduction to “toilet humour”. Clearly the comedy of manners aspect plays the larger role, even if farts are somehow eternally funny."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote this summary of what emissions sources matter if you want to move the needle, and how reputable sources argue for resolving them: https://climate.davis-hansson.com/p/big-picture-2020/I used that as a basis to look for roles that - I imagined - actually would help make a dent. In the end, I took a job in the smart electric grid space, writing code to help the EU grid take on more cheap renewable generators at Tibber.There’s a lot of software in many of these spaces! Decarbonising the grid, electrifying transport, building heat and industry, reducing agricultural emissions and so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a variant of the question that I had when I left Stripe in 2019. After hearing someone say “We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.”, I became fixated on the question of what can I, with my software skillset, do to have a meaningful impact on climate?.  The answer (in hindsight), is a ton.My particular approach was to start a company (Watershed[0]), but today there are lots of great options as a software engineer. There are already plenty of great examples in the thread of places to look for companies (MyClimateJourney community, climate job boards, etc). I think the most important thing is not to feel like you need to learn a ton before jumping into the fray. Most engineers that joined us had zero climate experience beforehand. All you need is to be curious, be an effective engineer and you can learn what you need on the job.My email is in my profile if you want to chat![0] We’re hiring (https://watershed.com/jobs)
 and engineering is absolutely our rate limiter in helping companies decarbonize. We’ve built a climate platform that’s powering the climate programs of some of the world’s leading companies (Block, Shopify, Doordash as a few examples). Our goal is to be responsible for reducing the world’s yearly carbon emissions by 500 megatonnes of carbon by 2030 (1% of global emissions)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once took a critical thinking course and bought the textbook 2nd hand from the college bookstore.  A week or two in, I noticed half of a sentence written in the margin.  As the professor started teaching the topic from that page, he rhetorically asked a question, did not get an answer, and then answered himself with the sentence from the book.  I filliped ahead and found that the entire book was annotated with all of his answers, anecdotes, and various other helpful notes.  There was even a table that accurately listed his wardrobe choices!  The notes were in several different handwritings, and the book had been resold over a dozen times, so that professor must have been teaching the same class the exact same way for a decade or more.  I quickly became a star pupil as I always had an answer ready.  I added a few notes along the way and then sold it back to the bookstore at the end of the year.  I really wanted to keep it for posterity, but It just seemed wrong to take it out of circulation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my middle school German textbook, I found the following note (translation my own):Hi Katie, we should meet up over tea over these images. The first image should be a simple sketch of two dudes playing football, tell the guys in graphics that the one they gave me is waaa too complex. The second image should be a chick playing tennis.The note went on in this manner for a couple more sentences, describing all the images on the page. Because I was a blind student who used a screen reader, I had to get the PDF version from the publishing company, which I then put in a specialized ebook reading app for the blind. I strongly suspect that the editors of that book used some PDF tricks for hiding information to post notes to each other. Whether they were alt descriptions, white fonts on white background, regions shrunk to be 1px tall by 1px wide or something else entirely, I do not know. That file was intended for printing, not digital distribution, so I guess that they decided the notes didn&#39;t need removing as long as they weren&#39;t visible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He looked around at the faces in the crowd and said, “I’m opening the bidding at one dollar.” I about shit myself. I bid the $1 immediately to get things rolling. Well, after I bid, he looked around and said, “Once, twice, sold that man there for $1.” I just laughed… and wondered how the Hell I was going to get this pallet home and what I was going to do with all those books.&gt; When I asked the auctioneer afterwards why he’d let it go so cheaply, he said, “Did you see anyone trampling you to get in a bid?” I said no, I didn’t. His reply, with a smirk on his face, was, “Gotta’ know your audience in this job.”&gt; Well, needless to say, I got the books home and spent a few years going through them and selling some, giving some away, etc. However, that’s not the point of this story. The point was finding things in books. So, with that in mind…Dude goes to an auction and finds books. Nobody bids on the books. Dude is amazed that the auctioneer is willing to sell him something nobody wants for a low price. Dude spends years going through those books.I&#39;m happy for this guy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Jewish people have their Sabbath, as a hispanic person myself, we have our Siesta. I spent over a decade in the tech industry and I&#39;d literally be scoffed at for actually napping in a nap room or pod for 20min. Finally just started doing it in my car. But that&#39;s one of my practices that anchors me not only to my culture, but my Creator. It humbles me. And brings me joy. I hope everyone could find what their practice could be that would bring them this.Take some time, at least once a year, to sit down with yourself and have a vision for your life not based on work or status (ie vacations or the acquisition of things). If that isn&#39;t enough to snap you out, go to a small village in Latin America or maybe like Matthew McConaughey discovered and talked about in his book, a quaint monastery in New Mexico. Stay there until it makes sense.Most people want to be productive because they want to feel valued by others. But if you have to look to your own value from others, you&#39;ve already lost, and will continue to lose forever.Be. You. Slowly. and you&#39;ll find you&#39;re more valuable than you ever thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don&#39;t get any of those &#34;be more productive&#34;, book, video, course and so on.Every single person I know just wastes their time with that. 
Usualy they work long hours and still don&#39;t get much done.But hey, they have Zettelkasten with things the never read. 
A to do list with stuff they never do.
And they go out in the morning at 5 for jogging, while gulping down a liter of coffe or energy drinks which results in them being groggy the whole day.If you ever think you need to adhere to what is preached in any self improvement thing, just don&#39;t.Habe your shit in order, avoid working mor than 7 hours day and take your weekends and vacations seriously.Especially in IT nothing will get you further than being smartly lazy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the original, and most effective, competition hacks is to convince people that you sleep less than they do.When someone tells you they sleep 5 hours a night then run two miles and take a 15-minute cold shower then start their work day, 85% of the time they are lying, 10% of the time you will have already noticed the effects of chronic sleep deprivation, and 5% of the time it&#39;s drugs.But this has been a surefire way to put your competitors on the back foot for hundreds, probably thousands of years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just got access to the DALL-E 2 beta, and it&#39;s a ton of fun to make pictures out of everyday occurrences as prompts.Someone else here on HN observed that everyday people don&#39;t &#34;get&#34; how huge this all is. I experimented with asking random acquaintances at a local cafe for prompts and showed them the generated pictures. All but one person was totally unimpressed.If everything feels like magic, then what&#39;s one more piece of magic?This scared me more than the implications of DALL•E 2 itself specifically. People think of the technology in the world as mysterious black boxes that do inexplicable things, and they hence no longer understand relative complexity, progress, or change.My impression is that to most people DALL•E 2 is not &#34;substantially&#34; different to, say, Google Image search. Text in... image out. What&#39;s the big deal?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve spent just over 1 week with DALL•E 2.Over the past 7 days I’ve generated ~1000 images, 150 of which were good enough to save. I only saved images which made me audibly gasp.Witnessing your own novel idea spring to life is a magical experience. DALL•E provides an artistic tool on a comparable level to digital photography, and by extension Photoshop.At this stage it’s 100% clear to me that DALL•E has heralded in a revolutionary new age of design. Every day I worked with it, I grew more confident in my outlook.It might not necessarily be an OpenAI product which truly “integrates” with humanity — but DALL•E has shown me that it’s possible… and just a matter of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompt crafting is quickly becoming an art. I just found out yesterday that there&#39;s actually market places for buying and selling prompts [0]. It can really make a big difference if you can tune the image by adding the right words. Midjourney [1] even allows things such as adjusting the weight of each keyword or how &#34;literal&#34; the AI should take your prompt.[0] https://promptbase.com/[1] https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/user-manual"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PHP has so many hidden benefits:- it&#39;s stateless by design (much easier to scale)- it was &#34;serverless&#34; before Serverless- surprisingly performant- no &#34;unknown unknowns&#34;. it&#39;s so tried-and-true, there&#39;s no surprises- deployment is so simple, just drop a file on a web server. No middleware needed.- No long compile times because there is no compiling needed.EDIT: why the downvotes? If you don&#39;t agree, just reply so we can have a healthy dialogue.EDIT2: I also think there is something unique about PHP documentation. It has plenty of real life examples, and the ability for users to leave comments allows you to hear directly from others &#34;gotchas&#34; that people have experienced. I feel like PHP documentation is very undervalued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I love legacy codebases.&gt; A legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.Wow. This person must have worked on very different legacy codebases than me.Legacy Javascript code, to me, is something that I do not want to touch with a 10 foot pole, because every little piece of it can be intertwined with and used by many other hidden places. Plus, I&#39;ve never found a legacy JS codebase that has a robust test suite, so any refactoring I do can be hard to test and verify.From a practicality perspective, I get that the best programming language is the one you can use to build your product, but I tend to long for languages like C# or even Go when I&#39;m trying to deliver a product on a team with 10+ people. Static typing really helps when you&#39;re interfacing with someone elses code, and Typescript only aids this point.Maybe if your target audience is genuinely 10 year olds learning to code, fine. But also if you&#39;re building a serious product for a company, please don&#39;t choose a &#34;Janky programming language&#34; because I really don&#39;t want to have to debug it after you left before really thinking about sanitizing user input.I feel like, in the hands of a really talented programmer, they can be super productive in PHP or Javascript or really anything. But I&#39;ve just had a lot of bad experiences with quickly written, undocumented code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really speaks to my heart. I learned programming as a young kid when my uncle taught my pascal. But I just couldn&#39;t see the point of console programs and never really got into it. Eventually I picked up late 90s HTML (hello geocities!) and php was a natural next step. I still remember going to the library to borrow the book PHP and MySQL web development. It was so empowering. I could make any kind of application I wanted and see the result in my browser, GUI and all (Win32 API was way beyond me at that age). I made my own forums, ebay clone, and a few web apps for an old Korean MMO.Fast forward a few decades, and things look very different. Tons of web app backends being written in go, nodeJS/TS, and I recently learned people write them in rust+webasm. It&#39;s just crazy to me. I&#39;ve worked on FOSS projects that are massively over-complicated because of their platform/language choice, when they would&#39;ve been very straightforward php choices. But php still has this weird stigma about it despite most of the old concerns having been addressed.I do have to say, though, that front end web development is way better than before with the advent of React and co, webpack, css libraries etc. Doing all that html/js/css by hand was always painful."</p>

Does Copilot have access to private repos that CodeGen cannot access?Also, it would be really cool if I can personalize FauxPilot by feeding it with all my repos on GitHub. Sometimes I just need to reimplement a function I&#39;ve written before but it&#39;s really hard to find where my old code is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangential, maybe someone here knows; how complicated would be to implement an autocompleter that just understands syntax + patterns and can offer me suggestions but based on my own stuff? Like what is the simplest version of Copilot that doesn&#39;t require huge amounts of training but just does a decent job at recognizing tokens and trying to fill in the structure based on some input code. e.g: `app.get(&#39;/&#39;,|`  &lt;- at this point I should get an express.js handler autocomplete like `(req, res, next) =&gt; {}`, maybe with multiple choices grepped from my own data ranked by occurences. Is this too extreme it needs a multibillion parameter AI model to achieve? Does anything like this exist? Like an auto-snippet thing but contextual and token replacing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is plenty of room for all of Chess.com, Chess24 and Lichess to exist.Lichess has the best platform to play on and is free to use.Chess.com is a business. As such they want to earn money.
However, without a large, online chess community there will be no subscribers.
The amount of effort chess.com has made to sponsor events, streamers etc.
is tremendous.Making a living as a chess professional is tough. 
Streaming/YouTube has opened the field somewhat: it is no longer
required to be in the world top 20 to make a living in the field of chess.The Chess24 initiative is without doubt inspired by Chess.com.
Chess24 gives yet another way for chess players to earn money.
Via Chessable (owneed by Chess24) players can sell chess online book/booklets.If Hikaru has a clause in his contract with Chess.com, that he can&#39;t play on Lichess - then the just can&#39;t play on Lichess. That&#39;s simple.Would Nike be happy if Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo suddenly appeared in Adidas shoes?It works the other way too: Wen did you last see Magnus play on Chess.com?
[I am aware that Magnus as owner/investor in Chess24 makes his own rules - and plays on Lichess]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paying off Chess streamers is pretty much the only way Chess.com can keep people using their site. Their product is simply inferior in every way, except for their library of master lessons, and all these GMs exclusively streaming through Chess.com.I figure all this spending on sponsorship and GM content is why the rest of their site is so inferior to Lichess. Lichess can spend all their time perfecting the platform, and it really shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chess has always had this dichotomy over free/paid services. (a bit not unlike programming tools).I love lichess.org but make no mistake: without the dedication of one talented Scala programmer willing to underpay themselves that site would not exist.Commercial sites can provide more services and offer more opportunities to chess professionals simply due to the funding model.Disclaimer: I&#39;ve played over 100k online chess games since 1992. Starting with original ICS (client was on Xwindows) before ICS/FICS split drama, then chessbase.com, then chess.com and now lichess.org. I slightly prefer lichess but play on chess.com as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this trend of &#34;making the terminal great again&#34;. Between rich/textual in python and lipgloss/bubble tea for golang, this turns cmd from &#34;the default ugly stuff that is easy to produce&#34; into &#34;something fun and pretty&#34;.Also note that those projects have the (not anymore) secret goal to also produce a web app from the same code base automatically.I imagine native will follow, or wasm, or something. Nevertheless, having the terminal as the smallest denominator for UI makes a lot of sense for small utilities. You won&#39;t build the next Figma with it but a lot of scripts could benefit from that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The advice to use lru_cache is good.But there is an issue if lru_cache is used on methods, like in the example given in the article:1. When lru_cache is used on a method, `self` is used as a part of cache key. That&#39;s good, because there is a single cache for all instances, and using self as a part of the key allows not to share data between instances (it&#39;d be incorrect in most cases).2. But: because `self` is a part of a key, a reference to `self` is stored in the cache.3. If there is a reference to Python object, it can&#39;t be deallocated. So, an instance can&#39;t be deallocated until the cache is deallocated (or the entry is expired) - if a lru_cache&#39;d method is called at least once.4. Cache itself is never deallocated (well, at least until the class is destroyed, probably at Python shutdown). So, instances are kept in memory, unless the cache is over the size limit, and all entries for this instance are purged.I think there is a similar problem in the source code as well, e.g. https://github.com/Textualize/textual/blob/4d94df81e44b27fff... - a DirectoryTree instance won&#39;t be deallocated if its render_tree_label method is called, at least until new cache records push out all the references to this particular instance.It may be important or not, depending on a situation, but it&#39;s good to be aware of this caveat. lru_cache is not a good fit for methods unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my proudest moments during the development of &#34;Linux on the Web&#34; had to be the creation of a Terminal application (try it at https://lotw.site/shell) that can render its output with near-native efficiency. My initial attempt was based on placing character images, one-by-one, onto a canvas element, but it was horribly sluggish. Then I started playing around with a &#34;Virtual Dom&#34; (React-like) approach, wherein I convert the underlying data structure into an html string, and then set the innerHTML property of a div element, for every time the screen has to be redrawn. (Source code: https://github.com/linuxontheweb/LOTW/blob/main/root/code/ap..., the relevant code is the &#34;render&#34; function starting on line 569, and the innerHTML is set on line 940).I don&#39;t know how many years its been that I started working on the Terminal application, but it was only within the past week or so that I &#34;bit the bullet&#34; and figured out how to do finger pad/mouse wheel scrolling of the output buffer (See the &#39;main.onwheel&#39; function in the source code for that little tidbit!). Since I required fine-grained control over the rendering process, I could not rely on the &#34;naive&#34; way of doing scrolling on the web (which is to simply let the browser take care of the entire process)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have worked at both startups and tech companies 40+ years old, and the conclusion I&#39;ve come to from my anecdata is that every engineer at every company is swamped all the time.Feature requests and bug reports are easy. Writing features and fixing bugs is hard. Your todo list will always grow faster than you can tackle items. Once a senior engineer retired, and I inherited about a hundred of his bugs out of the 600 or so he left behind.It&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. Working at a consistent pace is better than burning yourself out. The work is omnipresent. It will never stop growing. It will consume all if you let it.Unless you&#39;re at an early-stage startup, let your manager deal with your giant and ever-growing todo list. Let someone more plugged-in to the business side deal with prioritizing, and focus on technical excellence. Unless you aspire to management yourself, that&#39;s already plenty to do.Anyone who tells you every engineer needs to be in touch with every business concern either only works on early-stage projects or is part of a hustle culture that I don&#39;t ascribe to. I don&#39;t have the energy for technical excellence and knowing everything about the business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just talked about this with my wife just yesterday about her peer. If you&#39;re always the hero to take on too much work and you never keep up, you invite various significant structural problems.You&#39;re too useful to remove, you may not get attention for corrective measures because of fear of the person leaving.You are often too swamped to effectively get work done smoothly and in an expedient manner.You become a single point of failure (bus factor 1) so that when you take a vacation / hit by a bus, the company suffers significantly.A common personality trait of these types of people seem to be self reliance / control seekers. When they own that authority of work, they are less likely to accept delegation to get them out of their woes.In general, these types of employees may end up being labeled super stars, but they&#39;re also potential albatrosses that could significantly wound a company if not properly managed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been on both sides. A lot of people say people who want to be swamped is a control problem but I&#39;ve found its more delicate than that. My circumstances require me to have decent insurance so my life will forever be tied to an employer. I don&#39;t really get an &#34;escape&#34; at least until obamacare becomes cheaper than $2800/mo. for what I need in order to try out the entrepreneur life.As a result I work very hard. I end up getting a lot of work done, and thus more work on my plate. This is often manageable and I use this as a gauge of my probability of being fired for any given reason. Someone knocking on the door of a PIP likely won&#39;t be getting as much work especially if it&#39;s reasonably complicated. It&#39;s been my experience as work starts to die down to a less-than-consistent level I&#39;m usually out the door (never fired, but often laid off in this industry).However, this burned me when I became staff-level because I&#39;d get so much work that despite trying to reduce the bus factor back to &#34;manageable chaos&#34; I was unable to and ended up leaving the job for another one because I became the smart guy in the room.But overall I aim to walk the razors edge between swamped and normal at all times because it&#39;s the only form of security I have. When I am in this condition I am now useful enough I have plenty of power over my employer and my position and for an employee this is an ideal situation to have. Especially when the alternative is extremely expensive &#34;between jobs&#34; insurance, or a less than ideal insurance package from another company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep, there&#39;s a premium on making your architecture more cloudy. However, the best point for Use One Big Server is not necessarily running your big monolithic API server, but your database.Use One Big Database.Seriously. If you are a backend engineer, nothing is worse than breaking up your data into self contained service databases, where everything is passed over Rest/RPC. Your product asks will consistently want to combine these data sources (they don&#39;t know how your distributed databases look, and oftentimes they really do not care).It is so much easier to do these joins efficiently in a single database than fanning out RPC calls to multiple different databases, not to mention dealing with inconsistencies, lack of atomicity, etc. etc. Spin up a specific reader of that database if there needs to be OLAP queries, or use a message bus. But keep your OLTP data within one database for as long as possible.You can break apart a stateless microservice, but there are few things as stagnant in the world of software than data. It will keep you nimble for new product features. The boxes that they offer on cloud vendors today for managed databases are giant!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our industry summarized:Hardware engineers are pushing the absolute physical limits of getting state (memory/storage) as close as possible to compute. A monumental accomplishment as impactful as the invention of agriculture and the industrial revolution.Software engineers: let&#39;s completely undo all that engineering by moving everything apart as far as possible. Hmmm, still too fast. Let&#39;s next add virtualization and software stacks with shitty abstractions.Fast and powerful browser? Let&#39;s completely ignore 20 years of performance engineering and reinvent...rendering. Hmm, sucks a bit. Let&#39;s add back server rendering. Wait, now we have to render twice. Ah well, let&#39;s just call it a &#34;best practice&#34;.The mouse that I&#39;m using right now (an expensive one) has a 2GB desktop Electron app that seems to want to update itself twice a week.The state of us, the absolute garbage that we put out, and the creative ways in which we try to justify it. It&#39;s like a mind virus.I want my downvotes now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; However, cloud providers have often had global outages in the past, and there is no reason to assume that cloud datacenters will be down any less often than your individual servers.A nice thing about being in a big provider is when they go down a massive portion of the internet goes down, and it makes news headlines. Users are much less likely to complain about your service being down when it&#39;s clear you&#39;re just caught up in the global outage that&#39;s affecting 10 other things they use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find this stuff fascinating, and this article is way above average for online posts about proprietary/algorithmic/quantitative/low-latency trading (very leaky Venn diagram there). I have a few nitpicks but overall it&#39;s informative and it&#39;s an interesting format: viewing an industry through the lens of a particular firm, especially one as fascinating as Jane. Anything that develops literacy in modern finance amongst the lay public is a good thing in my book.If this stuff floats your boat I&#39;d also recommend any of Carl Cook&#39;s talks, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH1Tta7purM. Optiver is AFAIK in a somewhat different business than Jane, but they&#39;re also players (or were last I had any inside baseball).Too many people got their worldview on this industry from &#34;Flash Boys&#34;, and I say this as a Lewis fan, is criminally stupid at best and in bad faith at worst (if you want a well-researched, accessible alternative: https://www.amazon.com/Trading-Speed-Light-Algorithms-Transf... is about a zillion times better).It&#39;s a pretty short list of places I&#39;d ever go through some grueling and semi-arbitrary gauntlet to work for, but Jane is on it for sure.I hope the author(s) do Medallion next."</p>

Firstly, Yes, working at Jane Street is a well paying job and you&#39;ll do well out of it. No. People aren&#39;t routinely retiring in their 30s.

People who are driven and smart don&#39;t suddenly earn their first $5m go off and buy an annuity. They&#39;re more likely to go off and found their own trading shop at 30 than they are to retire.Secondly, you know what happens to people who don&#39;t get hired after their internship at Jane Street? They go to HRT, to G Research, to Jump, to Citadel, to Optiver, to IMC, to XTX, if they&#39;re really unsuccessful they&#39;ll go to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta. These are not people desperate for a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Generally good article that delves into how a market maker functions. Couple points:Re EA: quoting my boss, EA isn&#39;t really a dominant thing in the market maker space, it&#39;s pretty much only espoused by a couple high profile individuals (mainly, SBF).Re strategy: point about how there&#39;s little strategy involved in being a market maker is off-base. Everything is ultimately strategy: do I continue to pour resources into a strategy that is losing money in the hopes of eventually seeing pnl? What markets should I focus on? What is the best use of time for each employee that maximizes pnl/head? etc etcOne thing that I thought article got right is that most work involved in market making is about avoiding trades, not making them. Capturing the bid ask spread is conceptually easy. The hard part is avoiding trading with toxic counterparties.Part about put options is especially apt. Market making during a crash / recession (like right now) is especially difficult because all the non-toxic counterparties have stopped trading as much (people like to trade a lot more during a bull market than a bear one). By setting up a structure such that you profit during a crash (either by buying puts, leaning net short, or through some other method), you introduce an uncorrelated return stream that can really help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The truth is that a majority of tech companies don&#39;t need 50%+ of their employees.Google could lay off vast swathes tomorrow and be immensely more profitable without any loss in revenue.The 2010s will be remembered as the golden era for tech employment. The second we start getting industry wide layoffs, the insanely high wage inflation we&#39;ve seen will kick into reverse much faster than you probably believe possible.Further, tech employees will be the first to suffer in a high inflation environment due to rising discount rate. Yet tech is such a small portion of the labor force that layoffs here basically mean zilch when it comes to the unemployment rate/inflation, and thus there&#39;s a long way for it to fall before the Fed adjusts policy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s brutal.  We just laid off a couple hundred people last week, only five from our department (which is 190 people) but two of them were from one of my teams.  Demoralizing, and in the case of that team, absolutely devastating to productivity in the short term.Cutting almost 1 in 4 employees is beyond anything I can imagine.  I think I&#39;d feel like I was rearranging deck chairs if I survived the cut and stuck around.  I&#39;d be putting out my resume right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The people I know who are still inside (Google) seem optimistic that maybe the company is taking a pause to deal with some of its bureaucracy and internal politics issues and with people&#39;s complaints about perf. I suppose that&#39;s good.From my perspective: They&#39;ve got way too many people doing a lot of meh work and feeling really ... important about it. And it&#39;s on the whole asphyxiating the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As several of these statements blatantly contradict one another, I went back to the data and ran the same sanity check that I did with Facebook above. In other words, what if Google is using the hiring freeze as a smoke screen and only continuing with the strongest candidates, while keeping the rest on the bench?An actual hiring freeze sends a very strong negative signal to employees and investors. To employees it says &#34;the ship is sinking.&#34; Layoffs are right around the corner and that is absolute poison to morale. To investors it says &#34;technical or not, we&#39;ve hit a recession.&#34; Brace yourselves for impact. Google and Facebook are both advertising companies, so they are tightly coupled to the business cycle. When business spending starts to falter, they&#39;ll feel it first. And they have.So it&#39;s not surprising that the companies themselves are far from clear about this, sending mixed messages. I expect them to continue to do so for as long as they possibly can.The bubble has inflated so far for so long, I get the sense that even among cynical young employees and &#34;investors&#34; there&#39;s a sense of permanence in the positions of both companies. The thing is, those with fewer than 10 years experience have never seen the ferocity of the other side of the business cycle. When it turns, that mofo turns. Those in top management positions have seen it, and they&#39;re going to do everything in their ability to deny and evade it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google has always recruited and interviewed independently of whether they actually have roles open that make sense for you. Earlier this year, I passed the interview and spent six weeks in &#34;team match&#34; before I gave up and took a role with another company. Had a friend who did the same for months for a PM role.Just bc you&#39;re getting contacted by Google recruiters this week or interviewing doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll ever find a team or get a real offer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to see that they also adopted the current industry standard of automatically banning people at random, not telling them why and not giving them any way to rectify it. But then, well, I mean, it&#39;s Oracle. What did you expect?Normally something like this would put them on my &#34;will never use any of their products nor work with them&#34; shitlist, but it&#39;s Oracle, so they were already there since, like, ever.Also, obligatory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=33m"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar experience. Recently my account got suspended for no reason. I have been logging in and reading up on the tutorials / documentation to see how to use Oracle Cloud and I hadn&#39;t even started using any of the free resources yet, but my recently created account got suspended nonetheless. Unless my account was hacked (which I would like to be notified of) I cannot have violated any ToS. I got the same non-response when I asked why my account was removed.To me it looks like Oracle isn&#39;t being honest about their &#34;always free&#34; tier and they just shut down non-paying accounts to cut costs if they don&#39;t foresee them converting into paying customers any time soon. If it were a bug / mistake, then I would have expected better support (restoring the account or providing a new account if that&#39;s not possible), but being ghosted by a big corporation when you know for a fact that you did nothing wrong is pretty frustrating.I have not had such a bad experience with any cloud company ever. I sincerely hope Oracle changes, but as it stands I will never spend a dime with Oracle and I will dissuade anyone from using their services, because of how unreliable they have demonstrated themselves to be."</p>

If I had to guess, though, it won&#39;t be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading this I can&#39;t help feeling that Python puts the &#34;simplicity&#34; in all the places that don&#39;t matter. Simplicity is the reason given for not having useful language features like pattern matches as expressions, or lambdas with multiple expressions, but I&#39;ve never seen these features[1] cause problems in other languages. And then we have this... Surely semantic simplicity is the simplicity that actually matters, but the way the simplicity argument is used in Python is often to enforce arbitrary syntactic and semantic complexity.[1] It&#39;s almost ridiculous to call these features as they&#39;re just a consequence of the underlying language model. E.g. if you have expression blocks you have lambdas with multiple expressions with no extra work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; But surely Python clamps down on this chicanery, right?
  &gt; 
  &gt; $ py10 abc.py

  &gt; [1, 2, 3] is iterable

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a 50+ greybeard (literally) and here&#39;s my story: I once figured I could improve my chances of getting a job if I shave my beard. I knew I looked much younger without it, people would get my age wrong by some 10-15 years. And so my 6 months-long search for a job that time ended in success on the first interview after I shaved it. The first one! I remember the faces of the guys who hired me when they saw my personal data on some tax form that I filled later, after the contract was signed.Ageism in this industry is real. I think the root cause of it is investors, it&#39;s where the origins of this phenomenon are. They prefer younger entrepreneurs who in turn hire people like themselves, and so it propagates down the hierarchy as the company grows. It&#39;s transitive. In fact this is true for all types of discrimination.I switched to entrepreneurship and feel the same effects here. Good luck raising money or even finding a co-founder. It&#39;s tough. Not going to shave my beard though.I have no idea what could be done here other than for the aging tech people to unite and form their own companies, investment funds. Just like the other discriminated groups do - women, then racial and other minorities.Edit: I should add, I was talking about a hands-on engineering job, not management. I love coding and not going to quit it because of ageism or pay or other circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know agism is rampant in this industry, but it still shocks me. I&#39;m 23 and relatively junior at ~1YOE. The &#34;grey beards&#34; I&#39;ve worked with have all been incredibly technically proficient and a joy to work with.The skill and ability and depth of experience held by my older coworkers makes me grateful to have the opportunity to work with and learn from them.To any older individuals here still working in tech, please don&#39;t feel unwanted. Your experience is needed and appreciated, especially by the juniors who get to work with you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thoughts: It keeps getting better and better.You stop reinventing wheels. You know where most of the holes are and
can laugh when the kids fall in them. You know the hype cycles and can
spot the fads and fashions. With 10 or 20 languages behind you, code
becomes separate and &#39;above&#39; languages, so you can think in structures
and abstract algorithms. Enjoy standing up for principles, you&#39;re the
man now, and there&#39;s not much left to &#34;look up to&#34; (especially in this
morally declining business). Not having something to prove means you
can know your limits, like when to quit trying to fix someone&#39;s &#34;poor
little thing with a broken wing&#34; that ain&#39;t ever gonna fly. You&#39;ve
time to read all four volumes of Knuth and really (almost)
understand. Also, you&#39;re not going to win that Turing award now, so
enjoy not having to try.Things to watch out for.Look after your eyesight and posture. Spend more time thinking about
code while out walking. Shout at clouds less because you realise that
dumb ideas will die of their own accord in good time. Enjoy the new
toys the kids make, even if they aren&#39;t &#34;production ready serious&#34; -
they will mature in time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of why it is so difficult is that these C-level executives have mastered the art of sounding good with minimal set of accomplishments. Sometimes I listen to these presentations and it feels like a solid story and presentation, but there is nothing behind their rodeo when you sit back and dig deeper. A fucking mirage.It&#39;s not the person who does excellent work that gets promoted or climb up the corporate ladder, but the person who knows how to sell their work, as sad as this is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a large, late stage, Softbank backed company. They brought in some C-suite execs while I was there. A CTO paid several million annually with large, public company experience. They were totally clueless, and the engineering org was almost revolting within 6 months, trying to stage a coup to the CEO. No technical experience, no leadership, installing cronies, speaking in opaque platitudes.I&#39;m not angry about it, though they did oversee us being on the cusp of a promising IPO to a pretty bad outcome that cost me a lot of money, but I&#39;ll say that any illusion that you have to be competent to be a C-suite exec, and any imposter syndrome I ever had, went out the window after that. Ironically it increased my personal confidence, if these idiots can do it I certainly can.I think the old saying &#34;nobody gets fired for buying IBM&#34; kinda applies to some execs maybe, like nobody gets fired for hiring some stellar resume exec with lots of experience, but they may get fired for taking a chance on an upstart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s because you shouldn&#39;t hire them but you should grow them internally. Outside hires for executive positions are usually a great way to de-stabilize your company, early hires tend to be loyal to the founders and if you then hire some &#39;suit&#39; to sit between them and you you risk them breaking off.So the solution to this problem is to ensure that your early hires are all top notch with the potential to eventually build out to become your C-suite, and to treat them as generously as you can when it comes to equity.And if you&#39;re really smart you stick to that mantra: hire quality over quantity, it will allow you to push back the typical organizational struggles until you&#39;ve achieved an order of magnitude or more in revenues (assuming product market fit)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About a decade ago, a broken iPhone caused me to experience how bad Google&#39;s MFA reset process was — there were multiple _years_ where the “hard landing” form triggered a flow which sent an email to an internal mailbox which didn&#39;t exist! — and while I was able to use printed backup codes after I returned home the experience left me concerned enough that I went to one of their identity group&#39;s public meetings here in DC.One of the things which I was struck by was how unseriously they appeared to view their role in modern life. People were generally very casual about the need and were especially uninterested in anything which required them to work with outside parties.My suggestion was that they consider a protocol where trusted civic authorities could be allowed to confirm someone&#39;s identity, which sounds like it would be useful for this case: let the person initiate a mediated reset flow where someone like a librarian, police officer, etc. could authenticate in their official capacity and check a box saying that they&#39;ve confirmed the photo ID for the person standing in front of them. Most of the benefits from MFA are preventing things like phishing attacks which are also stymied by limiting it to people in your geographic area, although you might want to disable this for high-risk people enrolled in Google&#39;s Advanced Protection Program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the solution is for libraries or local authorities to setup their own email providers. An email address “for life” with your library card, with the necessary support and in-person reset verification that their patrons need. I’m not suggesting this would be an easy or inexpensive undertaking, but maybe that’s just the next step in service evolution for a public information service like a library group."</p>

Anything you can do to break the dopamine loop helps, however small it may be. I&#39;ve had success with:- setting long passwords to social media that aren&#39;t autofilled (saved in bitwarden) and logging out after each session- nerfing addicting parts of webapps (plugins which block the facebook news feed but allow messaging/groups helped a TON)- forbidding dedicated social media apps and only using &#34;worse&#34; internet sites- router DNS blockers, even if I can get around them, the act of having to bypass it raises my awareness I&#39;m doing something subpar for myself"</p>

Reading his post had a major impact on me—since then I have always thought differently about the time I spend online.It’s interesting how people, including myself, try to justify various addictions. How am I supposed to stay informed about important topics without the news? How do I know how to help people in need without knowing what’s going on? There are much, much better ways than reading CNN/NYTimes every day. Also, there really is nothing new about the human condition today compared to a hundred years ago.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews"</p>

Giving everyone who has your contact information access to your attention is poison to the ability to concentrate. Another big thing for me was cutting down on infinite scrolling, blogs and videos and spending a lot more time with long form content (mainly books). Attention is our most precious resource and we should guard fiercely against attempts to monetize it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well this is... eerie. I just released Stictionary[1] on Friday.It is an offline, ad free, dictionary that remembers words you look up. It gives a word of the day and provides (admittedly underfeatured atm) flashcards to review your word lists. It includes optional syncing to keep your word lists across devices. I&#39;ve been holding off posting about it while i complete the website[2].Love to see someone else had such a similar idea. Great confirmation of the unmet need in the space. Really awesome execution as well. Congrats on the launch!On a personal note, i built Stictionary after tracking all the words i looked up manually for years. Now i have an app that does it for me (and was a blast to build).1: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stictionary/id1613214660?platf...2: https://www.stictionary.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, iOS already has built-in support for dictionary and thesaurus. In any native text input field, select a word and choose Define or Look Up. The choice of dictionary is customizable; I usually choose New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English (not to be confused with the venerable Oxford English Dictionary). They are high quality dictionaries. They are basically the same except that the pronunciation for the latter is in IPA which I&#39;m more used to.When I need to look up a word, I create a new note from control center, type in the word, double tap to bring up the contextual menu and then the dictionary.It pretty much checks all the boxes. For distraction-free reading, turn off &#34;Content from Apple&#34; in the Siri settings to avoid those obnoxious Siri knowledge panels."</p>

Possibly. But I don&#39;t think a knee-jerk assumption that it is any of those things is appropriate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a (thankfully mild) inherited retina disorder. If you read the part about lasers and eye damage it’s basically that, but the “lasers” are faulty genes rather than anything external causing the eye damage. And I can verify that at first my brain did an incredibly good job at error-correcting over it, but in the last couple years it’s finally been able to “peek through”. One day I was hiking and suddenly had black spots in my vision. Then after that I woke up one morning and noticed large black halos in my vision that went away after a couple seconds of being awake. A couple weeks later and I started getting flashing visual artifacts in the edge of my vision.Which is/was terrifying because I didn’t know this was a multi-decade process I was just becoming aware of and instead assumed that if I just noticed this much visual degradation in a couple weeks then surely I’ll be completely blind in a couple more?  Thankfully that’s not how it works, the damage has been increasing at a slow steady constant, it’s just that the processes in place to correct for said damage do a _really_ good job at hiding it, until they don’t, so the rate of degradation seems much worse than it actually is.That said, please if you notice any new visual artifacts get them checked up on _immediately_, while my case is a slow genetic issue sometimes it’s a detached retina, which can happen for any number of reasons and can usually be reversed quite easily with surgery if caught early.  I was “lucky” mine was genetic rather than physical trauma, since I didn’t go see someone until things got noticeably worse."</p>

The Asahi team don’t have support for everything yet (notably no GPU) but what they do have support for seems to be high quality, well integrated with Linux’s conventions, and upstreamed into the mainline kernel! How much other hardware can claim that?The Asahi developers have also stated that Apple tends to keep hardware peripheral interfaces stable across generations (they speculate that this is to keep things easy for their own OS dev teams), and that this has so far proven to be true for M2 (and several iPhone generations before that), and thus once support is available , it should stay relevant for some time.Given this, it seems like MacBooks could easily end up becoming the laptop of choice for Linux developers in the years to come."</p>

I&#39;d be surprised if 10 years from now the majority of their revenue comes from selling processors rather than fabricating them for AMD, NVIDIA, etc. Why compete when there&#39;s plenty of steak for everyone?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had invested in AMD when Lisa Su took over as CEO. I had been keeping tabs on the company for some time. Unfortunately I needed money to cover my basic living expenses and had to sell all my shares about a year later. Even at the time, it was painful because I had spent a lot of time researching AMD and I was very optimistic about Lisa Su based on her background and her tenacity.I could have made maybe 20x on my investment... Still, I don&#39;t feel regret. You can only regret things if you had a choice and I know that there&#39;s no way I could have avoided selling those shares."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I&#39;m very much in camp AMD.  But, market cap has proven over and over again to be kind of bogus. E.g. do we really think Tesla is actually worth more than the rest of the top 10 or so automakers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, Bing had a bunch of tools for developers: base64/HTML/URL codec, ASCII table, QR code generator, color picker, formatters, even the ability to run code in the browser on the servers of an online judge (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11450385)One day they all just disappeared. I actually wasn&#39;t the only one who noticed (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-bing/what-h...)I think I know why: the Bing blog implies that most of it was the passion project of a couple of summer interns in 2015. Probably it simply broke at some point, and no one was around to even notice.https://blogs.bing.com/search/2015/09/02/bing-rocks-two-new-...https://blogs.bing.com/search/2015/10/08/bing-adds-more-tool...Here&#39;s a larger list of Bing&#39;s search features in various domains from 2018. Most are now inactive. There apparently was a timer as well. https://old.reddit.com/r/bing/comments/9oct9o/psa_search_for..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is almost certainly an accident. I remember when the Search SRE team got paged because some simple math formula wasn&#39;t giving am answer box. Something like 42+7 giving 49. Turns out that this was getting classified as &#34;porn seeking&#34; and giving an empty results page if Safe Search was on. This probably would have never been noticed if there wasn&#39;t a end-to-end prober test because this particular formula was an example in the Google Home instruction pamphlet.Search is very a complex system and quite possibly there is a poor SRE looking into this right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great job!I can sort of relate. I worked on an infrastructure system, almost entirely alone, for ten years, before it was finally taken over by a capable team, and I was able to step away, and it took on a life of its own. It is now a worldwide standard, used daily, by thousands.I say “sort of,” because it was never something I planned to make money on. It filled a need. Also, and it’s a long story, I had to weather a fairly hefty level of abuse during that time. The demographics of the target user base were … challenging.It’s all good, now.One thing all that time brought me, was a really high-Quality product. Lots of time to squash bugs, and iterate the UX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice project. I can relate in that I have my own personal hobby project that I have been working on for years and I would like to get many more users trying it out.Mine is a new kind of data management system that can manage unstructured, structured, and semi-structured data. Think of it as a file system, database, and NoSql system all rolled into one. It is currently in open beta at https://didgets.com/You say you have &#39;finished it&#39;. Software is never finished, but if you have checked off all the feature items from your design, then close enough for now. With my project, the TODO list is still extremely long. It can do many things already, but I seem to put two more items on the list every time I cross one off.It seems that every solo, multi-year project goes through the phases you describe (burn out, depression, questioning your sanity, etc.) and mine is no exception. It still feels very self-fulfilling every time I get a major piece working or I blow away the alternative in a speed test."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OP, I&#39;ve been working on a very similar thing for some years now, too.  I could write a book about this at this point, but I will avoid gushing here.Please let me share some pain.Many developers/companies make this thing and none of them really know how to (or can) share.  I&#39;m happy to share my list.The end result, as I see it, is a fragmented mess of either partially completed or fully completed and walled (and/or poorly modularized) software.Take for example VS Code&#39;s tree view.  Can a developer with a need for an explorer view just use VS Code&#39;s tree module?  Not hardly.  Go reinvent.Contrast that with CodeMirror.  If you look, you will see CodeMirror everywhere.  This software truly  empowers devs and it has resulted in pure awesomeness.There&#39;s no shame in not open sourcing what you&#39;ve created, I&#39;m assuming you haven&#39;t.  And I can&#39;t say anything about how you have modularized your components.But it pains me that the next dev who gets an idea like yours will either give up or spend 6 years struggling to create the same thing (except the CodeMirror part).Worse, Microsoft can afford to struggle and or throw people/money at this.  They can pay people to work full time.  They can give away their editor(and more) for free.  That&#39;s a win from user&#39;s POV.Are you aware that VS Code runs on GitHub and does the majority of this kind of thing?  I think they could completely shut down all sandboxes or similar kinds of software from a financial perspective.I said I wouldn&#39;t write a book.Anyways, I strongly appreciate what you have done.  It looks great.I wish we lived in a world where we could work on the same team building this kind of thing.My best wishes to you on getting paid to do it full time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been thinking it&#39;s time to start moving away from that damn site.- If I actually want to start conversations, I get a lot more comments on HN or Reddit- When I was a job searcher, the idea of just being able to apply from my profile was really cool. Except every job just re-directed you to some form that wanted you to upload a resume anyway.- Of the handful of potential clients who have found me there, none have ended up signing a contract. Better odds just talking on random slack channels.- It&#39;s getting more and more cringe. Call me a prude but it&#39;s really tacky when people post photos of stuff like their wife and their baby asleep on the couch. Do you really want to post your families intimate moments to get likes on a &#34;professional&#34; social network?- If I&#39;m honest with myself I realise that I just replaced my addiction to one blue site (FB) with another.Anyway add me on LinkedIn!! https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewisandrewcampbell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit of tangent, but it reminds me of a funny story:I discovered one day that I am getting recommended &#34;Long distance truck driver&#34; jobs through email and some of the re-targeted ads. First, I ignored them, but in a week or two, it became apparent that it was not just a coincidence.  After some research, I realized that I had listed &#34;Device Driver&#34; programming as a skill on my LinkedIn and personal website. I suspect it must have been crawled, and the word &#34;Driver&#34; was matched to send me those recommendations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It appears that LinkedIn is automatically importing job postings from other places on LinkedIn and other sites such as angel.co if the company name of the job posting matches your company name on LinkedIn.The irony when LinkedIn get so upset about people scraping their website."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have a car and absolutely hate the car-centric culture of American cities (I live in SF).That being said, this article is completely wrong and draws the wrong conclusions. People were anti-car early on because most people didn&#39;t have cars. Later, people stopped being anti-car because most people had cars. The article would have you believe that at no point in time did the majority of people want car-centric city streets and that it was forced on them by a small minority of people interested in selling cars. That simply isn&#39;t the case. Vocal opposition to cars faded away as more people owned them.It&#39;s important to understand the status quo correctly if we ever want to change things. The sad reality is that most people want cars, even in dense cities. As I look out my apartment window on a Sunday morning, with pleasant weather and a walkable green neighborhood, I still count far more cars going by than people on foot or bicycle. Hopefully that would change if we made it easier and safer for people to walk, but it&#39;s not productive to pretend most people secretly hate cars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch, so US towns and cities didn&#39;t always be hostile towards walking.  My assumption that it&#39;s always been this way, was wrong.But in a way that&#39;s worse because it means they used to have this privilege and it has been taken away, and cars-first has become the norm.But the roads would have been used for something, at a guess, was it trams and horse carriages, and that these didn&#39;t pose much of a problem?  I&#39;ve been to towns with trams in the middle of roads and it&#39;s normal for people to just walk around it or near the tracks without problem.  But I am a stupid tourist so I kept my distance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember in Sixth Grade (in Maryland), our teacher telling us that there was still a law on the state books, that said (I can’t remember what he said, precisely, but this is the gist):If a car is going in one direction on a road, and there is a horse (I don’t think he specified whether or not it was harnessed, but I’ll bet it needed to be in harness) coming the opposite direction, the car needed to pull over, and yield to the horse.If the horse refused to pass the car, then it was incumbent upon the car owner to (in escalating order):1) Turn off the engine.2) Cover the car in a blanket.3) Dismantle the car, piece by piece, until the horse passes.I could see a cranky old farmer having fun with that law."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article perfectly exemplifies the arguments in discussions. Lets just concentrate on the waste discussion. The article says heavy metals in solar panels are a problem (I kind of agree, although the way it is described makes it out like we are talking about huge amounts, in reality the lead in solar panels is largely from soldering so very small amounts. Orders of magnitude more are being used for other applications (like car batteries)). They then say that recycling is currently still a problem (sort of true, although there are companies who say they can 100% recycling solar panels already). Similarly for wind they say we still don&#39;t know how to recycle the carbon blades, again sort of correct (but there are many other applications of carbon fibre which produce much more waste).Then when it comes to nuclear waste however, the argument is we can ignore pretty much all long lasting waste, because of some development in the future will make recycling of spend fuel rods feasible. So essentially he is comparing the current state of solar panel recycling to some future potential nuclear waste recycling. That&#39;s a dishonest comparison. Moreover ignoring the amount of waste from dismantling the nuclear power plant (which needs to go into nuclear storage because it is radioactive due to irradiation), while talking about the carbon fibre from wind turbines is also disingenuous.We see the same argumentive structure when talking about the economics; the current state of renewables is compared to some potential future state of nuclear. While in reality renewables are on an exponential cost reduction trajectory and all the nuclear potential is completely unproven."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is this idea that nuclear is not being deployed because people have a wrong perception of risks.However, the main reason is the economy. The costs of solar, wind and batteries are dropping exponentially but the costs of nuclear are not improving. We can blame regulation and the hypothetically wrong public perception about safety, but the reality is that costs cannot go down easily because of the innovation dynamics:1. It takes several years to build a nuclear reactor. Hence, innovations take a decade to reach the market. Learning curve has to be slow.2. A nuclear reactor cannot be shipped, it has to be build on site. This makes manufacturing automation, economies of scale and competition hard. In other words: you cannot have factories in China, or elsewhere, shipping cheap nuclear reactors all over the planet.A change in regulation might lower the costs, but it&#39;s not going to improve much the innovation dynamics.In conclusion, all this talking is mostly irrelevant: nuclear reactors are simply not going to be built because they are not competitive. And things are getting worse by the day because the alternatives have a better innovation cycle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We saw another downside of nuclear power in Ukraine: When Russian troops attacked towards Enerhodar and there was shelling in the area the safety of the  reactor could not be guaranteed. In the end, containment can be guaranteed w.r.t to internal accidents but no facility can ever be safe from outside issues like war, natural disaster or politics.Solar has less single points of failure and if it fails not much happens, like in the case of the stolen solar power plant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokmak_Solar_Energy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Russian here. Roskomnadzor&#39;s capabilities for blocking TOR are quite sufficient to cripple TOR&#39;s capabilities to the point of making it unusable as a VPN service, unless you set up your own private TOR ramp, which in this case is essentially the same as personal VPN, but much more slow.The algorithm is quite simple:1. Attempt to connect to TOR2. If it connects, blacklist the IP, goto 1.3. TOR is unavailable(If an anonymous TOR user can obtain bridge address, shared by any means, email, Signal, messenger pigeons or whatever, RKN operative can obtain it as well)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been really fascinating to watch. A patch just landed in Pion DTLS[0] yesterday to make the fingerprinting harder. I don&#39;t remember all the commits, but the Tor devs are absolutely amazing to work with and submit patches that are pretty much perfect :)If you haven&#39;t had a chance to investigate WebRTC I really think it is worth it. WebRTC gives up P2P Data/Media everywhere and it is really hard to block (because so many companies depend on it). To me it really feels like the best path forward to circumventing control. It also is a great career move. You can help people build conferencing tools during the day, and Censorship Circumvention at night.[0] https://github.com/pion/dtls/commit/de299f573c3e44fece16f09c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can help by running a Snowflake proxy (which merely functions as a gateway to the Tor Network, so you don&#39;t need to worry as no traffic exits from your IP) if you&#39;re in a country that doesn&#39;t censor Tor. You can either run the standalone Snowflake proxy:https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/snowflake/stand...Or by installing the browser addon: https://snowflake.torproject.org"</p>

In every universe where you survive (which, for sake of argument, are the only ones you care about) you find a factor on the first try."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember during my undergraduate physics years at the University of Otago, we had a visiting guest speaker - I think it was Dale Bridenbaugh around 1976 when he had resigned as a manager in GE&#39;s nuclear division worried that their plants were not safe [0].  He had just also toured Australia as a guest speaker toward the anti-uranium effort [1].At the time, Robert Muldoon was Prime Minister of New Zealand and was pursuing &#34;think big&#34; projects for NZ including a planned nuclear power station.  As one of the &#34;GE Three&#34; [2], Bridenbaugh blew the whistle that the quoted price tag of the
power plant did not include necessary safety precautions which he eloquently explained would cost at least an order of magnitude more (greater than the GDP of NZ).  Of course the whole idea made no sense in a country blessed with hydro and geothermal resources.  In the end the project was abandoned for total cost of ownership budget reasons rather than nuclear issues.I wonder what has changed since then?[0] https://www.times.org/nuclear-power-back/2018/3/8/the-long-t...[1] https://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82alternatives.html[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Three"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The SMR’s 12 modules, each producing 50 megawatts&#34;So each module is a little smaller than the reactor of the 1960&#39;s era submarine I served on and is based on the same pressurized water technology. I was a &#34;nuke&#34; so had to go in the reactor compartment several times. As far as I can remember, the reactor was about 10 feet in diameter. We went in the shipyard for refueling after the lifetime of the rods, which was 15 years. I could never understand why we didn&#39;t build these for civilian use (cost I figured) but now we will. Cool.https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2022/22-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is an overall good development, and I wish the company luck. Its really not the solution.While scale is what killed nuclear, the people who initially decided on scale, did so for good reason. You lose a huge amount if you scale down, specially with PWRs.These small PWRs try to get some of that efficiency back with factory production, but at best it just evens out. The advantage is the added flexibility. So I don&#39;t think that putting traditional PWR in a tube is really any kind of series solution to transform our energy system.However there are good things coming out of this. For example, NuScale went threw a process managing multiple reactors from the same control room. That is the same thing that essentially all GenIV reactors want to do as well. Having managed to get that concept threw the regulator will make it massively easier for anybody that follows.Its a damn shame that we don&#39;t have GenIV reactors since the 80s. We had the technology and every reason to use it. We could be living in a nuclear age right now, and I consider it the largest failure of humanity that we failed to do so. People in 100 years will look back and think we were insane that we did not use the technology we discovered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Its important to be reminded regularly that there are perfectly legal ways for people with lots of money to endlessly bully people that annoy them. These people/companies have lawyers on retainer that they&#39;re already paying so its essentially free for them to file bogus suits and motions to cause havoc in your life. What are you going to do? Sue them back? Thats the world they live in, and its a world that as a small time person or corporation you can not win in (long term).Look at Gawker and Peter Thiel--no matter how you feel personally about what they did, what they published about him was absolutely legal. As a background task his lawyers destroyed that company by keeping them tied up in court cases and funding any one with an axe to grind against them until they were gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I opened up the article mildly curious about which internet personality was about to make the outlandish claim to the biggest victim crown for internet clicks.I&#39;m heartbroken it was Steven Danziger, they guy that took on big oil, gave them a black eye, and went to (house) jail for it.Even though his case is one I&#39;ve followed for years, it even escaped my own memory.Also, someone mentioned Snowden and Arrange.  for comparison. Although they can be thought as same, remember these two, unlike Danziger, took on the govt, the intelligence apparatus, and its guns.  They should have known full well that when you play high stakes poker you are risking a ton.Danziger OTOH, was taking on a private corporation. His case is big, but no too different in scope than say Erin Brokovich&#39;s case against PG&amp;E &amp; Hinkley(2), or Jan Schlittchmanns case vs WR Grace and Beatrice Foods(1). The plaintiff counsels won in both cases, without consequences to their life or careers.Arrange and Snowden were morally righteous however they probably knew the size of the sacrifice they were about to make and made the decision to proceed anyway. I doubt Danziger had any idea that what he was getting into would cost him his career.(1)   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Cryovac,_Inc.(2) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_groundwater_contamin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth noting that there is another side to the story. As Wikipedia notes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Donziger), significant evidence of Donziger&#39;s fraud ended up being captured by a friendly documentary crew that had been following him around.The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague found that the evidence placed before the Court was &#34;the most thorough documentary, video, and testimonial proof of fraud ever put before an arbitral tribunal&#34;, and that [Donziger] did engage in blackmail and bribery of Ecuadorian judges.The situation is complex, and I certainly don&#39;t have any insight into the true rights and wrongs of the case. And there&#39;s certainly evidence that points towards Donziger&#39;s innocence too. But Esquire&#39;s take is, I think, entirely unbalanced, and discounts out of hand the idea that any of the many, many court cases Donziger has lost (in multiple legal systems and in front of multiple judges) may have been at all correct."</p>

The loss of power is affecting part of a single data center within the affected Availability Zone. Power has been restored to the affected facility and at this stage the majority of the affected EC2 instances have recovered. We expect to recover the vast majority of EC2 instances within the next hour. For customers that need immediate recovery, we recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone as other Availability Zones are not affected by this issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The dog has a lot of false positives from the cameras being triggered by car headlights or small animals.My real dog has the same feature, so you’re at least doing a good job mimicking nature, heh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I bought a house I picked up a dog dish and put it by my walkout basement sliding door.  Also the pond next to my house has old tennis balls show up in it now and then so I put them next to the dish.According to the local cops break ins in my area are mostly just kids going into open garage / garage side doors / back doors that are left open and stuff to steal is out and obvious and so on.I figure just the sense of hassle / unknown of &#34;who knows how this dog is&#34; might be enough of a deterrent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add credence to this post, I once heard an interview with an incarcerated burglar who claimed that dogs where the one deterrent that scared him off. He said that an alarm as only as good as the response times of the police and he&#39;s usually in and out of there in five minutes anyway. But who wants to risk it with a dog? Better to just move on to the next house.A few more tips:- Best place to hide valuables is in the kitchen pantry. Master bedroom is the most common place, but who is gonna think to go through your snack food.- A lot of burglaries happen in the winter in the late afternoon or early evening when it is starting to get dark out, but before the homeowners get home from work.- Your house is only as strong as the weakest link. Fancy locks can be bypassed by breaking a window. Design your security system to handle low level burglars (who probably don&#39;t know how to pick a lock), not foreign spies. For most people, this also holds true for online security."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem isn&#39;t the capability of remote attestation.  The problem is who&#39;s using it, i.e. who&#39;s defining what &#34;security&#34; means.  As noted above, for a company, &#34;security&#34; often means intentionally inhibiting my freedom, not actually securing anything I care about.We would benefit from a better public discussion of what &#34;security&#34; encompasses.  Else, we risk conflating &#34;what MS wants me to do with my computer&#34; with &#34;preventing hackers from stealing my credit card number&#34;.Imagine a world where you could submit personal information to a company, with the technological assurance that this information would not leave that company... and you could verify this with remote attestation of the software running on that company&#39;s servers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any way we can make Remote Attestation providers liable for any losses incurred while using their services? Can we make it so that banks, record companies, and individuals can sue Microsoft or Google if their system doesn&#39;t deliver on the promise? If we still see cheating in on-line gaming even though all machines are attested, can we we get our money back?I feel like part of the problem is that Remote Attestation providers get to have their cake and eat it too: they make a theme park, set up boundaries, and charge admission under the premise that it&#39;s safer to play in their walled garden than in a public park.But if a bad actor slips through their gate and picks a few pockets or kidnaps a couple children, the operators get to say &#34;not our problem, our services have no warranty -- read the EULA&#34;.I feel like in the real world, if a park operator explicitly bills itself as &#34;a safe place to play&#34; it&#39;s their problem if someone goes on a crime spree on their property -- there is some duty to deliver on the advertised safety promise.But somehow, in the software world people can control admission, control what you do and somehow have no liability if things still go off the rails. It&#39;s just a sucker&#39;s game.Of course, I&#39;d rather not see remote attestation happen, but maybe part of the reason it keeps creeping back is exactly because there is zero legal downside to making security promises that can&#39;t be kept, but incredible market advantages if they can sucker enough people to believe in the scheme."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion:Hardware-based attestation of the running software is an important security feature, especially in a world where data leaks and identity theft are rampant. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a healthcare provider, and I&#39;m about to send sensitive medical data to a third party vendor. Wouldn&#39;t you prefer that this data only be able to be decrypted by a computer that can prove to the world it booted a clean OS image with all the latest security patches installed?If the vendor wants to install some self-built OS that they trust on their computer and not update it for 5 years, that&#39;s their business, but I may not want to trust their computer to have access to my personal data.Remote attestation gives more control to the owners of data to dictate how that data is processed on third-party machines (or even their own machines that may have been compromised). This is useful for more than just DRM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made this site.Copying a comment I made on HN a few weeks ago:The ADS-B signals that many aircraft broadcast include not just the aircraft&#39;s GPS positions, but also a measure of GPS accuracy (strictly speaking, ADS-B doesn&#39;t talk about GPS specifically and can handle any sort of navigation technology; I&#39;m sure there are some planes out there reporting positions based on inertial navigation systems, with correspondingly low accuracy, or GLONASS-derived positions, or whatever, but my understanding is that right now something on the order of 99% of aircraft with ADS-B are using good old GPS so I&#39;ll just keep using the term GPS in this description). If you go to https://globe.adsbexchange.com and click on just about any aircraft, you&#39;ll see an info sidebar on the left of the screen. Scroll down until you see the ACCURACY section, and you&#39;ll see values labeled NACp, SIL, NACv, NICbaro, and Rc. Those are all self-reported measures of the accuracy of the data being sent by the aircraft[1]. NACp is &#34;Navigation Accuracy Category for position&#34;, and is a good measure of whether the aircraft&#39;s GPS is working well. (A somewhat obscure feature of ADS-B Exchange lets you see a map of all aircraft that are currently reporting poor navigation accuracy for their GPS: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?badgps)To make the maps, I process a day&#39;s worth of data from ADS-B Exchange to find all the aircraft reporting poor navigation accuracy and then I color map hexes (using H3 hexes) according to the proportion of aircraft passing through that hex that reported bad GPS accuracy. Specifically, I&#39;m counting an aircraft as experiencing &#34;interference&#34; if it at some point reported good navigation accuracy and then reported low accuracy. Doing this helps filter out aircraft that just have an ongoing issue with their GPS equipment, or don&#39;t even have GPS.When I do that, areas where there is systematic interference—almost always jamming by military systems—become obvious. There are a few conflict zones (Syria, Cyprus, Israel) that have been experiencing jamming for years, and the U.S. often has smaller scale military testing, especially in the West and Southwest. You can also see the jammers that are apparently setup around Moscow to prevent drones from flying near Oligarch dachas[2].I started making these maps in February before Russia invaded Ukraine because I thought it might provide an early warning of an invasion. I didn&#39;t see that, and in fact this technique doesn&#39;t do a very good job of mapping GPS jamming around the actual war zones because civil aviation stopped over Ukraine, so there are zero or few aircraft with ADS-B reporting their GPS accuracy[3]. Without that data, I can&#39;t make a map.Sometimes I do see changes, like when Russia suddenly started jamming around Kaliningrad in March 2022, causing interference in many Baltic states and leading to Finland to cancel some flights[4]. Then a few days later, they just stopped.I don&#39;t think too many people have realized yet what an amazing source of GPS interference data is available using ADS-B! It&#39;s like having thousands of sensors roaming the planet, broadcasting GPS accuracy data every few seconds. I sometimes wonder if I would disrupt someone&#39;s nascent business model if I started publishing my maps regularly.1. https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1493789598077440000

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick update on some of the infrastructure behind the map: One day of being on the front page of HN has used up half of the Mapbox free quota of map loads. To sustain this level of traffic would cost me something like $2000/month just for Mapbox. Since this is a non-profit project that I do in my spare time, something is going to have to give."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating. Really cool to see a map of GPS signals on Earth and the site looks really good, too. Love the colors and interface! Awesome :)Can anyone narrate any of the jammed signals? Like for instance what would be jamming in the ocean between Tripoli and Benghazi? Or what would be jamming around San Antonio, TX?"</p>

These dimensions are:1. the number of Wikipedia editions of each individual; [i.e. number of languages in which this person has a Wikipedia article]2. the length, i.e total number of words found in all available biographies. […]3. the average number of biography views (hits) for each individual between 2015 and 2018 in all available language editions […]4. the number of non-missing items retrieved from Wikipedia or Wikidata for birth date, gender and domain of influence. The intuition here is that the more notable the individual, the more documented his/her biographies will be; [!]5. the total number of external links (sources, references, etc.) from Wikidata.We then determine the quantile values from each dimension and add them all to define our notability measureThey also have a table of what this metric throws up as the most &#34;notable&#34; from each time period: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4/tables/3 and how the &#34;domain&#34; varies over time: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4/figures/2 (note Nobility and Religious in 500–1000, to Sports and Culture post 1950)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made an interactive art installation on this question once: A black box with a knob where you could adjust how much time you have, then it would offer you (Google streetview) panoramas of the locations it found within your distance, and in the end even print a paper slip with your travel itinerary to take with you.The installation used realtime data (Google directions API): I somehow figured out, that if I would run this from a local machine and reset the browser frequently, Google would let me do this even without an API key… they certainly sensed something was awry and I did get API warnings and captchas because of &#39;suspicious traffic on my network&#39;, but they were nice enough not to block me completely.

Maybe I wouldn&#39;t be so confused about it if I understood what use people have for their phones to hold so much compute.

It turns out that the world has moved on. Web pages are getting harder to read on small screens. I had to squint a lot. The phone&#39;s short height means that it often doesn&#39;t charge &#34;vertically&#34; in Qi chargers. It doesn&#39;t fit in my car&#39;s integrated phone holder, it just rattles around.And I really missed the zoom lens.So I&#39;m OK with the Pro, and I will get used to slightly larger phones.(The &#34;Max&#34; is still stupid.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Tabler and have used it for a few projects with great success.The title of the OP is not really accurate though. It&#39;s not so much a framework but a bunch of customization on top of Bootstrap and some pre-built templates for stuff _like_ dashboards, galleries, forms, etc. The site is more like a kitchen sink demo and documentation site for stuff you can pick apart and use in your own application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Tabler. I&#39;ve used it for a few Rails projects and since Rails 7 it&#39;s even easier to integrate thanks to Import Maps. I can get a project off the ground even faster with this UI kit. I&#39;m already used to the Bootstrap classes and tags so this is just the final component for maximum productivity.I get some people don&#39;t dig the design but I think it look serious, and in general that&#39;s what dashboard are for, serious business. They need to be readable and simple to understand and use. Tabler gives that vibe.Edit: As an afterthought, I would really appreciate if anyone knows any similar projects. It&#39;d nice to compare and have more options. So far I havent found anything so compelling in this space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"it looks like tabler uses jekyll underneath for docs and demo (which i personally like and am comfortable with). the demo is really nice, ahd while i&#39;m not big on js any more, the js driving tabler looks fairly straightforward and appropriate to my eyes.the underlying html and css, however, give me pause about how easy it would be to integrate into a larger project. &lt;div&gt; soup is how i&#39;d describe the demo html, and its css uses custom properties (css variables) in a way that, on first glance, seems to make it more verbose without adding power, flexibility, or maintainability (or accessibility, but that seems a really big challenge for data-heavy frontends like this).i&#39;d probably try this out if i needed a dashboard on a project, but perhaps would want to test drive it on a small/test project to see where the gotchas are first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You would really hope there would be some far reaching repercussions for senior leadership at Google on this one. There are lots of projects that Google has tried and failed on, and sure, that happens. But this one is probably the clearest, obvious failure of execution. There is an absolutely crystal clear playbook of a Tech company forcing its way into the Gaming business. So how Google has managed to enter, completely fuck up, screw around partners, screw around customers and then leave all within the span of 3 years is just fantastic.And it&#39;s not just that, because Google&#39;s reputation for giving up on anything remotely difficult, no one bought into it in the first place. I would wager there are entire market segments that Google can just never enter now since they have done such a good job at branding themselves unreliable. It reminds me of a Petrostate where a country has huge wealth because of what they&#39;re sitting on, but that same wealth destroys their ability to develop anything meaningfully different."</p>

Stadia removes all fraction and means I don&#39;t need to install/update or have gaming hardware.The service is great. Despite it not being popular.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really appreciate when people use technical facts to criticize something, like with this. It is a well written take-down of the implementation of the Windows Registry as of both today and 2010.I suspect if the concept of the registry was created today it would look more like a database (e.g. Sqlite), although organizing it like a virtual FileSystem does have a certain appeal, and unfortunately I don&#39;t know of a database engine that supports such a layout. The Registry&#39;s Key-Value pairs are 1:1 with a database table&#39;s column-values pairs, it is just the multiple tiers of organizing &#34;folders&#34; above that that are a difficult implementation detail.The UNIX way is undeniably more flexible since it isn&#39;t a virtual filesystem, it is just a filesystem. The problem is that everyone invented their own configuration format to store configuration data in /etc and there&#39;s no format agnostic API to access that information (you can open it, but can you understand it?).Both UNIX and Windows suffer from the same orphan issue wherein information can be written, the application removed, and it is unsafe to ever remove it since you may not know the author and or all consumers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t feel like this article is good enough to be worth resharing 12 years later.It missed some of the key reasons why the Registry is bad and other criticisms (&#34;We have to write exactly the bytes Windows expects.&#34; yeah of course you do. It&#39;s only meant to be changed using APIs.) are not very well thought out.The criticism that the Registry is a janky filesystem in a single file is dismissed because you can do the same thing with ext3. That&#39;s not a good reason to dismiss it. Just because you can do a similar thing doesn&#39;t mean it is a good thing to do for the Registry. The Registry being a single file is a cause of a ton of problems, and is IMHO the root of all the other problems. If this were a better technical article it would go into that instead of hand waving it away. (E.g. it being a single file leads to the all or nothing nature of it. It necessitates the bad filesystem implementation instead of using the actual underlying filesystem, etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A point being overlooked by article and commenters: the records in the registry probably use in the order of 10-100 bytes each, while every actual file takes up at least around 1024 (EDIT: maybe more like 4096?) bytes. Putting tiny &#39;files&#39; into a special format is a no-brainer on the older computers that existed when the Registry was first created. I am assuming this was one of the motivations to create the Registry in the first place, to save space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just took a look at the quickstart guide. The way the code snippets are implemented is gorgeous. They are syntax highlighted, are formatted/indented exactly as they would be in the terminal, line breaks are indented correctly but css is used to make them easily copy/pastable without including any line numbers/indentation characters. Such a delight. Such focus on details. Makes me really confident in the rest of the project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulation on the 2.0 release. EdgeDB looks awesome. However, I will not advocate using it for any of my clients unless there&#39;s a clear path to derisking its adoption. Like all new software products/services there&#39;s a significant risk of it becoming abandonware. I&#39;d obviously want EdgeDB to succeed but how can one de-risk adopting it?
Would it be possible to somehow &#34;transpile&#34;  both queries and modeling scripts to readable SQL? That way, worste case scenario one may fall back on Postgresql without loosing most of previous work.
Let me be clear. I really like EdgeDB  and obviously want the best for and you guys but I do not think I&#39;m alone in thinking that we need a clear, easy and verifiable way to fallback to Posgresql if/when needed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to build local first software backed by EdgeDB. Similar to these tools:- https://replicache.dev- https://github.com/tantaman/conflict-free-sqlite- https://aphrodite.shI wonder if EdgeDB provides any utilities to make this already perhaps? Or community has to build some kind of CRDT software that builds on top of EdgeDB that will do local syncing? Maybe that&#39;s planned to be tackled for 3.0?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before my comment gets dismissed, I will disclaim I am a professional structural biologist that works in this field every day.These threads are always the same: lots of comments about protein folding, how amazing DeepMind is, how AlphaFold is a success story, how it has flipped an entire field on it&#39;s head, etc. The language from Google is so deceptive about what they&#39;ve actually done, I think it&#39;s actually intentionally disingenuous.At the end of the day, AlphaFold is amazing homology modeling. I love it, I think it&#39;s an awesome application of machine learning, and I use it frequently. But it&#39;s doing the same thing we&#39;ve been doing for 2 decades: pattern matching sequences of proteins with unknown structure to sequences of proteins with known structure, and about 2x as well as we used to be able to.That&#39;s extremely useful, but it&#39;s not knowledge of protein folding. It can&#39;t predict a fold de novo, it can&#39;t predict folds that haven&#39;t been seen (EDIT: this is maybe not strictly true, depending on how you slice it), it fails in a number of edge cases (remember, in biology, edge cases are everything) and again, I can&#39;t stress this enough, we have no new information on how proteins fold. We know all the information (most of at least) for a proteins final fold is in the sequence. But we don&#39;t know much about the in-between.I like AlphaFold, it&#39;s convenient and I use it (although for anything serious or anything interacting with anything else, I still need a real structure), but I feel as though it has been intentionally and deceptively oversold. There are 3-4 other deep learning projects I think have had a much greater impact on my field.EDIT: 
See below: 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32265662 for information on predicting new folds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a 5th grader question about how proteins are used/represented graphically that I&#39;ve never been able to find a satisfying answer for.Basically, you see these 3D representations of specific proteins as a crumple of ribbons-- literally like someone ran multi-colored ribbons though scissors to make curls and dumped it on the floor (like a grade school craft project).So... I understand that proteins are huge organic molecules composed of thousands of atoms, right? Their special capabilities arise from their structure/shape. So basically the molecule contorts itself to a low energy state which could be very complex but which enables it to &#34;bind?&#34; to other molecules expressly because of this special shape and do the special things that proteins do-- that form the basis of living things. Hence the efforts, like Alphafold, to compute what these shapes are for any given protein molecule.But what does one &#34;do&#34; with such 3D shapes?They seem intractably complex. Are people just browsing these shapes and seeing patterns in them? What do the &#34;ribbons&#34; signify? Are they just some specific arrangement of C,H,O? Why are some ribbons different colors? Why are there also thread-like things instead of all ribbons?Also, is that what proteins would really look like if you could see at sub-optical wavelength resolutions? Are they really like that? I recall from school the equipartition theorem-- 1/2 KT of kinetic energy for each degree of freedom. These things obviously have many degrees of freedom. So wouldn&#39;t they be &#34;thrashing around&#34; like rag doll in a blender at room temperature? It seems strange to me that something like that could be so central to life, but it is.Just trying to get myself a cartoonish mental model of how these shapes are used! Anyone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lawrence Lessig (Harvard law professor famous for fighting for sane copyright law) does a great presentation on the root cause of Americas problems. He also ran for president in 2016.It can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tEThe short version is that to win primaries you need money. Money mainly comes from corporations and rich people. Taking money from corporations and rich people creates a relationship where you have some loyalty to them or they can punish you if you don&#39;t act how they want. Thus the primary corrupting force in America is pro-corruption campaign finance laws.The test for democracy is whether elected politicians pass legislation that the public at large wishes to be passed. Our very own Princeton did a study to answer this question.The key finding: “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a miniscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.”[1]In a very real, non hyperbolic sense we are in a plutocracy where money rules. We are not a democracy due chiefly to our campaign finance laws.Here is a campaign that aims to work on this:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hear me out...  few people want to run for federal office already.  The pay isn&#39;t great and it&#39;s hard work.If the US was a company, there&#39;d be no question that we&#39;d need to pay our leadership much better to attract top talent.  We pay senators $170k a year to manage our country with a $20 trillion economy.So what we end up with is activists who crave power and elites from rich families for whom $170k a year is a rounding error.  Those families then use the power from being in office to enrich their families even more.One solution could be to double or triple pay for US representatives along with banning stock trading and things like &#34;speaking fees.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been collecting and sharing (@QuiverCongress on Twitter) data on stock trading by U.S. congressmen for the past couple years.While there is currently legislation that requires congressmen to disclose their financial dealings, enforcement around it is incredibly weak.Congressmen are supposed to disclose stock transactions within 45 days of when they are made, but in practice there are dozens of violations of this rule which result in hardly a slap on the wrist. I&#39;ve seen a couple cases of politicians conveniently waiting till after election cycles to disclose controversial trades.While I&#39;m generally pessimistic about the odds of congress voting to regulate itself, I&#39;m still hopeful that something comes from this push. There&#39;s certainly a lot of room for improvement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please, please, please,  avoid status cuisines. It&#39;s going to be hard to do, because they make good PR. But you will be helping your users a lot more of you hold them off with a ten foot pole. What do I mean by a status cuisine? They are meals that are intended to show that the cook is a worthy person, rather than that the meal is practical, healthy, and good to eat. Here are some examples:The endurance cuisine: designed to show that the cook has time to spare, the endurance cuisine requires that no ingredient is pre-processed in any way. Grind your own grain, bake your own breadcrumbs, chop your own veg. Using grapes? You should have peeled them!The hair-shirt cuisine: you have to endure some discomfort if it&#39;s good for you, right? This cuisine specialises in sour tastes and unpleasant mouthfeel -  often using grains that our stone-age ancestors sensibly gave up for nicer ones.The gold plated cuisine: this one&#39;s obvious. Pricier ingredients must be better - or at least show how much the cook can spendThe obscurantist/connoisseur&#39;s cuisine: it can&#39;t be good if it&#39;s easy to find. The cook can only be good if they know exactly how many &#39;extras&#39; you need in your virgin olive oil, and what classification of wine you should put in your coq&#39;au&#39;vin.(Okay this is a bit tongue in cheek - but only a bit. I really do think a lot of recipes are unnecessarily onerous in some way)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done a few quizzes on the app now, and I don&#39;t get it. The questions feel very contrived, like someone had a quota to fill so just put whatever looked plausible together. They are also _very_ culturally specific.Questions about eggs barely made sense to me being from the UK, with incorrect pack sizes, animal welfare terms, and completely missed our great standards body that makes it easy to know which eggs have met a reasonable quality bar. It&#39;s not that the info is globally applicable, it&#39;s that it&#39;s an awkward combination of wrong and useless depending on where you live. Starting another quiz about kitchen equipment it seems this is a pattern throughout.Cooking is deeply embedded into culture, tradition, region, climate, regulatory environment, retail infrastructure, and more. I don&#39;t think these quizzes will be able to overcome this without being fully localised per country.The recipes? Maybe they&#39;re better. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m still 7 levels away from being able to know how to make scrambled eggs.Edit: when I opened the app the first time it asked me how experienced I am and I answered the 3rd out of 4 options, I know my way around a kitchen. The app just asked me to match pictures of eggs to how they have been cooked: fried, scrambled, etc. I&#39;m not sure I can survive this level of patronisation, it&#39;s honestly a bit insulting.Edit: &#34;what sort of pan should you cook eggs in&#34;... &#34;no not a wok, people don&#39;t have those at home&#34;. Ouch. At best that&#39;s incredibly sheltered for a food writer, and at worst it&#39;s practically racist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish you good luck but I don&#39;t get it either.The thing that makes Duolingo great is that right away you learn words in a new language.  It hooks you.  Within 1 lesson you know several words or a phrase with a few variations.This is more just random trivia about food that no one cares about.  I started with the cheeseburger recipe (apparently an advanced lesson or something).  Right away it&#39;s asking me a bunch of questions about ground meat but teaching me nothing.  Where&#39;s the hook?  I want to see a recipe and learn to make it, not feel like I&#39;m taking a test about a bunch of stuff I was never taught with no obvious path to simply making the thing I want to make.  In the 5 minutes I spent on it I feel like I was just getting grilled (metaphorically).  The first 5 minutes of Duolingo I actually learned something.Anyhow, suggestion would be to start right away with the thing people actually want...  How to cook the food and make the recipe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think that MS here is being used as a convenient scapegoat. This worry was never expressed at the time in significant terms. The FAT and SMB patents were much more of a worry than anything related to the desktop interface - only outright clones were being pursued.At the time, KDE, GNOME and Ubuntu developers alike, were simply drunk on popularity. Linux usage was in ascendancy, money was being thrown around, and the FOSS world was starting to attract young designers who saw it as a cheap way to build professional credibility. And then the iPhone happened and the whole UX world just went apeshit. The core teams really thought they had a shot at redesigning how people interact with computers, &#34;like Apple did with phones&#34;. Interaction targets moved from keyboard+mouse to touch screens, because &#34;convergence&#34; and the fact that the mobile sector was suddenly awash with cash.It&#39;s sad that people try to justify their missteps in this way. Microsoft was (and is) a terrible company and a constant threat to the FOSS ecosystem, but defining some of the biggest design choices of the Linux desktop only in antagonistic or reflective terms does a real disservice to those projects and the people who worked in them.If experience is the name we give our errors, refusing to accept errors were made means stating you&#39;ve learnt nothing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was the lead designer of Unity. Unity was not a response to patent concerns, but rather the manifestation of a convoluted OEM strategy involving exclusive distribution of distinct design features, and a write-once-run-anywhere dream of running Ubuntu on any device from netbooks to big screens to automobiles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is news to me.  I remember that the Linux desktop seemed to be on the ascendancy back in 2006.  GNOME 2 and KDE 3 were very nice desktops; while they weren’t Mac OS X Tiger (which still holds up as an amazing desktop), they were solid contenders to Windows XP.  But then came GNOME 3 and KDE 4, which were major fumbles that set back the Linux desktop for years.If it’s true that GNOME’s radical direction beginning with version 3 is the result of threats from Microsoft to change its desktop to avoid influences from Windows, then that definitely changes my assessment of the era, and my distaste for Microsoft’s anti-competitive behavior only deepens (this is the same Microsoft that complained about Apple’s look-and-feel lawsuits)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really nicely written; kudos to the author for compiling a great deal of information in a readable format.If I can be forgiven one nitpick: Poetry does not use a PEP 518-style[1] build configuration by default, which means that its use of `pyproject.toml` is slightly out of pace with the rest of the Python packaging ecosystem. That isn&#39;t to say that it isn&#39;t excellent, because it is! But you the standards have come a long way, and you can now use `pyproject.toml` with any build backend as long as you use the standard metadata.By way of example, here&#39;s a project that&#39;s completely PEP 517 and PEP 518 compatible without needing a setup.py or setup.cfg[2]. Everything goes through pyproject.toml.[1]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/[2]: https://github.com/trailofbits/pip-audit/blob/main/pyproject..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a great article.We start with learning that we absolutely need this Poetry thing because… it&#39;s what everyone else uses. It&#39;s refreshing to see author who can skip usual badly argued justifications and just plain admin that he does not know shit and is just following rest of the herd.
Then we continue by &#34;solving&#34;  depependencies by usual way of ignoring them and just freezing whatever happens to be present.Then there is inevitable firing up of virtualenv, because that&#39;s just what you have to do when dealing  with messed up dependencies.Next one is new to me. Apparently, one does not just set up git hooks nowadays but use separate tool with declarative config. Because if you ever happen upon something not covered by the Tool, that would mean you are no longer part of the herd.Then we push our stuff straight to pypi, because of course our stuff can&#39;t possibly have any dependencies outside of python herd ecosystem. It&#39;s not like we knew our dependencies anyway.Then comes the fun part, pulling in tox, because when you have special tool to handle dependencies, what you just need is another tool with different environment and dependency model.Code quality section I will just skip over, seeing what pass for code quality these days makes me too sad.
What follows is setup of several proprietary projects that modern opensource seemingly can&#39;t exist without.
What is more interresting is &#34;tyding up&#34; by moving code from git root to subdir. Now, this is of course perfectly sensible thing to, but I wonder why is it called &#39;src&#39;? Maybe some herd memeber saw compiled language somewhere and picked it up without understanding difference between compiled binary and source code?Now don&#39;t take this as if I have problem with the article content in itself. No, as a primer to modern python packaging it&#39;s great. It&#39;s not authors fault that his work is so comprehensive it lays out bare all the idiosyncrasies, herd mentality, cargocultism and general laziness of python ecosystem these days. Or is it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish people would just forget about pre-commit, this thing is especially useless in a setting where a CI/CD pipeline exists. It&#39;s not that hard to write a simple Makefile or shellscript to run linters on push.Pre-commit is one of the most annoying tools that have come into existence in recent years that everyone seems to be cargo-culting. It doesn&#39;t play well with editors since in order to find the actual binary path, you&#39;d have to open up a sqlite database to fish out the virtualenv pre-commit created. Pre-commit also increases maintenance burden, since its configuration is completely separate from your usual requirements-dev.txt/pyproject.toml/setup.cfg etc. If you have dev dependencies in one of these files because making your editors to find the pre-commit created binaries are hard, now you have to keep both versions in sync.I really don&#39;t see the point of any pre-commit hooks unless you are the one guy that doesn&#39;t use a modern CI/CD platform."</p>

Medium has something similar they called Snowflake - https://github.com/Medium/snowflake ... but note the disclaimer...&gt; Heads up: Medium isn’t using this tool anymore, but you’re welcome to!The problem with things like this is the typical engineering mindset, when shown a graphical or numerical analysis of their performance will zoom into analyse every detail and in the end it&#39;s just backed by the managers impressions and judgement.For similar reasons I have a strong opinion that engineers shouldn&#39;t be paid performance related bonuses, because no matter what happens, it&#39;s just going to upset them - the best case - maximum bonus - just equates to a &#34;meh&#34;. Better to pay a good base salary upfront ...Anyway use tools like this with caution IMO."</p>

Most things can be guided by merely understanding the principals of it.This very old doc (from Sun Microsystems engineers IIRC) remains excellent https://web.archive.org/web/20090420152505/http://mark.kampe...It speaks to the spirit, the principals, behind progression... and that makes it extremely applicable to lots of fields, personal paths, and environments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tolkien on Tom in Letter 144:I might put it this way. The story is cast in terms of a good side, and a bad side, beauty against ruthless ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. but if you have, as it were taken &#39;a vow of poverty&#39;, renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the question of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless. It is a natural pacifist view, which always arises in the mind when there is a war.The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien 144: To Naomi Mitchison. April 1954"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, Tom Bombadil is the introduction of natural magic. He is nature, indicating to the reader that there is a source of magic beyond the elves, Wizards, and Sauron.There are many magical creatures in Middle-Earth without a described source, which to me makes the whole story feel more magic. The Ents probably being the chief example.Another important role of Tom’s is his introduction of magic and power outside of the “good vs evil” struggle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Possibly the least liked character in The Lord of the Rings. A childish figure so disliked by fans of the book that few object to his absence from all adaptations of the story.I&#39;ve been a fan of Tolkien for decades, and this doesn&#39;t match up with my experience at all...Tolkien fans seem to generally love Tom, and many were deeply disappointed that he wasn&#39;t in the movies (even though his exclusion makes perfect sense). Did I just run in different Tolkien circles than the author?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel some of the OP points. I was working on a profiling agent lately, and one of the issues was running it on multiple platforms (just the four big ones linux/mac-x86/arm) on FFI (because it&#39;ll be run directly from python/ruby/etc...) and preferably having the thing just work without having to install or configure any dependencies.Like OP I hit two walls: libunwind, and linking. For libunwind, I ended up downloading/compiling manually; and for linking there is auditwheel[1]. Although it is a Python tool, I did actually end up using it for Ruby (by creating a &#34;fake python package&#34;, and then copying the linked dependencies).It was at that time that I learned about linking for dynamic libraries, patchelf and there is really no single/established tool to do this. I thought there should be something but most people seem to install the dependencies with any certain software. I also found, the hard way, that you still have to deal with gcc/c when working with Rust. It does isolate you from many stuff, but for many things there is no work around.There is a performance hit to this strategy, however, since shared dynamic libraries will be used by all the running programs that need them; whereas my solution will run its own instance. It made me wonder if wasm will come up with something similar without affecting portability.Finally, the project is open source and you can browse the code here: https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope-rs[1]: https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is compiling once and running on 6 platforms really that compelling? One of Rust’s super powers is that it’s really easy to write code once that can be compiled N times for N platforms without making any changes.I’m all about writing code once. But compiling a few times doesn’t seem like that big of a deal to me?The article says it runs on “six operating systems” but I can’t find them listed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nobody hates Facebook users more than Facebook, I guess. :-/I&#39;ve tried to type out several pithy comments, but the bottom line (to me) is that Facebook just doesn&#39;t respect its users or care about their needs.Can you imagine if brick-and-mortar businesses tried to do this? You go out for a Big Mac, but it&#39;s not on the menu anymore because Taco Bell had a few really good quarters, so McDonald&#39;s decided to pivot to tacos. Maybe you can still order the Big Mac if you know to ask for it, but most people won&#39;t, and they&#39;ll leave disappointed instead of getting what they wanted.Edit: To clarify, this example is contrived and the details are not the point. The point is that Facebook offered something to their users, spent years and billions of dollars making sure that as many people as possible got it from Facebook, and then decided to just yank the rug out from under all those people to chase the fairy tale of endless growth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s crazy to think the social media era may finally be ending. There’s really no viable platform anymore where you can just go passively keep up with what friends and acquaintances are doing. Everything is about feeding you content you didn’t ask for but may be targeted enough to catch your attention.And for what? To show you some ads here and there? To collect data that can be used to… sell more ads and products?Instagram was once my favorite app. There was a golden age before stories came a long where people just posted random pictures of what they were up to or what they were seeing. Things weren’t too memefied or political, unlike Facebook. Then photos got more and more glamorized and more about flexing and showing how much cooler and more awesome your life was. People started following themes and niches for their profile content rather than just posting random unorganized series of photos. Businesses and brands started getting built on the platform.Building an Instagram clone the way it used to be is fairly trivial these days. I could probably throw one together in a few months, but growing its popularity is practically impossible these days with such entrenched incumbents and no niches left to start a user base with.…unless perhaps… we build a social network on the blockchain"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it sounds dumb but its hard to say we haven&#39;t moved closer to what only ~10 years ago we considered a &#34;playful exaggeration&#34; on the worst of humans and social media.In WallE, everyone is floating around in chairs having their content spoon-fed to them with a generous amount of ads mixed in.  If you&#39;ve ever scrolled or seen someone scroll, its kinda close.  Just mindlessly moving their thumb up and down, taking in content that will be forgotten within minutes.  Ask a tik tok user to tell you even 10% of the videos they saw within the last hour.  I&#39;d be surprised if they could.I hope its not too &#34;old man yelling at cloud&#34; because I do my 15 minutes of mindless instagram scrolling but I have a timer that locks the app and I usually only need 15 minutes, more just feels bleh.  Some of my family/friends &#34;brag&#34; about having 7+ hrs of &#34;tik tok time&#34; on their iphone stats.  Just crazy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this.I have been a fan of SQLite for years, and it makes me genuinely happy to see other people have the same enthusiasm for the software.A couple of years ago, during a job search, I came across a couple of companies that I thought were a good match. I went through the interview process with all of them and, due to similarities in the interview process, we ended up talking about the same thing: databases. Oh the horror in the interviewers’ eyes whenever I mentioned SQLite. Experienced software engineers from The New York Times, for example, went as far as to mock my engineering choices in 3 out of 5 interviews, despite the success of the products my team built on top of SQLite.The experience made me feel awful and I stopped talking about SQLite for a couple of years. Instead, whenever someone asked a question about databases, I would answer with the PostgreSQL equivalent, knowing that the basic features are all the same.That is why, whenever I see projects like Litestream [1][2] used by excellent products like Tailscale [3], it brings me joy.A friend of SQLite is a friend of mine :-)[1] https://litestream.io[2] https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/[3] https://tailscale.com/blog/database-for-2022/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For people who enjoy this article I recommend reading the two-parter “How does SQLite work?” [1] [2] by Julia Evans. It too is an exploration into the inner workings but diving deeper into code. 
And for those interested in more details on b-trees, there’s “The Ubiquitous B-Tree” by Douglas Cramer which I enjoyed a lot.[1] https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/27/how-does-sqlite-work-part-1-...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dream of a SQLite-like embeddable database engine based on Datomic’s data model and queryable with Datalog. Written in something like C, Rust, or Zig. I’m toying around with the idea of hacking something up, but it’ll likely stay in the dream realm until I have Heaps of Free Time on My Hands (tm).Looking into SQLite’s innards is a great source of inspiration.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12951917DonHopkins on Nov 14, 2016 | parent | context | favorite | on: The NHS&#39;s 1.2M employees are trapped in a &#39;reply-a...Back in the days of ARPANET mailing lists, there used to be an &#34;educational&#34; mailing list called &#34;please-remove-me&#34;, that was for people who asked an entire mailing list to remove them, instead of removing themselves, or sending email to the administrative &#34;-request&#34; address.So when somebody asked an entire mailing list to remove them, somebody else would add them to the &#34;please-remove-me&#34; mailing list, and they would start getting hundreds of &#34;please remove me&#34; requests from other people, so they could discuss the topic of being removed from mailing lists with people with similar interests, without bothering people on mailing lists whose topics weren&#39;t about being removed from mailing lists.It worked so well that it was a victim of its own success: Eventually the &#34;please-remove-me&#34; mailing list was so popular that it got too big and had to be shut down......Then there was Jordan Hubbard&#39;s infamous &#34;rwall incident&#34; in 1987:http://everything2.com/title/Jordan+K.+Hubbard"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run marketing email databases. This is cute, but it doesn&#39;t actually do anything in most systems - either the employees all already get the marketing emails or there is a system-wide rule to suppress against the email domain.If you actually want to (potentially) break something, try submitting some obscure characters or malformed html into some fields. Blank spaces in emails can particularly be a nuisance.And if you want some real fun, some systems only enforce validation rules via client-side javascript. If you block them, you might be able to submit some real chaotic entries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to get spam from a Chinese exporter who conveniently included their actual address in the emails. One day I happened to be visiting their city and went to their office and asked them to unsubscribe me in person. The lady was very confused and first thought I wanted to buy something. I showed her the spam on my phone and she agreed but didn&#39;t bother actually removing me. Just seemed to think I was a bit stupid for travelling so far (I was also a foreigner) to complain about a spam. It was interesting to see what those companies look like in real life though - an office filled with piles of widgets and cartons of deliveries everywhere. These Chinese exporter spammers do tend to be legitimate businesses and they can actually provide good cheap access to manufacturers but they harvest emails from everywhere if there&#39;s any hint you might work in a related industry."</p>

We absolutely need to fund more semiconductor manufacturing. Losing that ability to China/Taiwan was just a terrible strategic mistake.The US hasn’t lost this battle (over semiconductors) just yet. While current manufacturing is indeed dominated by East Asian countries, the vast majority of research still happens in US universities. This legislation allocates more funding for that research, fantastic.Theres some political gamesmanship over some silly stock options of congresspeople… my response is, who gives a single shit. The country needs this bill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fairly cynical comments on this thread, many trying to uphold American values like &#34;free market&#34;, &#34;protectionism is bad&#34;, &#34;what about the consumer&#34;, &#34;not from my tax money&#34;.I find those remarks pretty naive. Every major power block heavily subsidizes strategic industries, now and forever. It&#39;s in no way new or remarkable, nor does it violate some principle. Most of the above concepts are pure fiction.Semiconductors are not a &#34;free market&#34; in any ordinary sense. It costs tens of billions to enter the market and you&#39;ll buy an ASML machine, speaking of dependencies.It&#39;s pretty obvious that this is in response to geopolitical instability. Being geo locked and this not really being a free market at all justify the &#34;unusual&#34; decision.As is stands, food, energy, and yes...also semiconductors are foundational to a modern digital society. And they&#39;re interconnected, without semiconductors you won&#39;t have food either.If you want to know what happens when semiconductors dry up, watch modern Russia. Arguably it&#39;s hard to do because of all the propaganda, but pretty much every domestic industry is falling apart, and therefore society falls apart.Bottom line, don&#39;t be naive. Sure it sucks to give rich companies even more money but if that&#39;s what it takes, so be it. Also, rich is just one side of the coin, the other is that they spear-headed the information revolution."</p>

From signal having it came whatsapp asking the signal devs to &#34;do that for whatsapp&#34; and a billion more got it.That is no small thing. Bitch all you want but make sure when you do you compare it to the success of literally ever other attempt to bring e2e to the masses and then if I&#39;m gonna be snarky maybe compare it to your own achievements.It would have been fantastic if signal also achieved other things on top of what they did. Maybe. Knocking what they did? Forget it. Signal is an outstanding achievement and nothing else comes close. I will cheer you so, so hard if you beat it."</p>

It Knows Better what you&#39;re allowed to do with your messages, what kind of client you&#39;re allowed to use, what kind of multidevice experience you need and when it should destroy messages you care about.The arrogance of the owner directly transfers to the arrogance and lack of control in the software which is fundamentally limiting its usefulness for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author notes:
&#34;Finally, we need to talk federation. Does it make moving fast and breaking things more difficult? Yes, yes it does, and that can be a good thing.&#34;The other, super-underrated feature of federated systems is that antagonistic parties are willing to use them together. For example, the US military, Russian government, major international banks, Google, Facebook, etc ALL use email and happily exchange messages over SMTP. There&#39;s no centralized service you could get all these parties to agree to use (not even Signal).The result of this is that everyone has an email address, and that makes it the universal standard for business-to-business communication. I can loop in any number of parties on a single thread from all over the world and it just works.My startup Shortwave is trying to build a messaging future that is email. We&#39;re trying to evolve and upgrade email to have the look and feel and features of a product like Signal, but with all the universal, federated goodness of the global SMTP network. It&#39;s a long project -- federated systems evolve slowly! -- but it&#39;s the bright open future I think we need. I go into some detail here: https://www.shortwave.com/blog/future-of-messaging/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context, for non-Nethack players:Nethack is one of the original &#34;roguelikes,&#34; back when that meant a text-console game based on `rogue`. It&#39;s an RPG where your character kills monsters, picks up loot, and descends into the dungeon. If you die, that&#39;s it -- you can&#39;t just load a save; you have to start all over. It&#39;s legendarily unforgiving.In Nethack, most (all?) roles start with a pet, e.g. a puppy or a kitten. In the early game, your pet is often stronger than you; it follows you, fights monsters, etc. It&#39;s useful in many ways beyond fighting: it won&#39;t walk over a cursed item, it can &#34;fetch&#34; items from stores without angering the proprietor, and so on. Your pet gains experience and levels up (puppy -&gt; dog -&gt; large dog), and after a certain point you&#39;re prompted to give your pet a name.The message &#34;You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passes&#34; is displayed when your pet dies while out of sight. It&#39;s pretty difficult to keep your pet alive all through the endgame, so much like any real-life pet owner, there will come a time where you have to say goodbye, one way or the other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hidden gems like this were one of the great things about Everything2. For those who aren&#39;t familiar with it, E2 is structured vaguely like an encyclopedia, only instead of being a shared Wiki any user can write a whole separate article. Sometimes this was helpful for learning -- having three different explanations of what a tensor[1] is, for example. Sometimes it gave a mix of informational and personal content, such as the page on Mother&#39;s Day[2], which has one article on the history of the holiday and two about the authors&#39; attempts to cope with it despite losing or never having had a good relationship with their mothers. (Plus a summary of a Futurama episode by that name, because E2 was like that.)It also had an accidentally-fun feature in its hyperlinking system. Hyperlinks were intended to be used to be used for words that had their own articles, but you could link to any article, and when you hovered your mouse over the link the name of the target article would pop up. This could be used to make the closest thing I&#39;ve seen to an English equivalent of Japanese furigana puns. I&#39;m having trouble finding a good example right now, sadly.[1] https://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=tensor[2] https://everything2.com/title/Mother%2527s+day"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My own death, of course, which I learnt will come when I least expect it, when everything is going right for once - that when no threats are apparent and I feel I can relax a little, it will be then that I choke over a tin of spinach, or mistake a blue e for a blue o, or a pink h for a pink h.Just recently my wife developed a sudden and very aggressive infection. She&#39;s healthy and it totally came out of left field. Then it spread to me. It was definitely humbling. I don&#39;t believe in living in fear, but it&#39;s funny how everything can change in an instant.I have to commend the title though:&gt; You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passesComing to understand the ephemeral nature of emotions is what finally allowed me deal with them. They&#39;re still real, but they always pass, no matter how strong they seem in the moment."</p>

It’s amazing how early we knew fossil fuels were destabilizing our biosphere.This man knew we were heading towards an uninhabitable world and screamed at the top of his lungs, but corporate growth was more important.  Persephone, indeed.He may have walked back his prediction of earth being largely uninhabitable by 2050,  but I have a feeling he was only slightly off.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can provide both anecdotal and academic data:Because companies have imperfect reading on worker productivity, and are also trying to balance other priorities when determining pay, high output workers are consistently underpaid, called Wage Compression (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_compression)After getting a 2% raise in the last cycle, and knowing that my granted options were going to be worthless (a factor which is under-discussed in popular news articles), I decided that it was a particularly opportune time to jump. Like many, I was not particularly unhappy, so I had not been motivated to go through the effort for search process before.When I got an offer, my employer quickly matched it (suggesting that I really was worth that much to them) but burning a bridge with the contact you got me the new job was not worth  simply reaching parity in my current one, so they lost me. If they had preemptively gotten a few percentage points closer before I sunk effort into interviewing, I probably would not have started looking."</p>

For those who feel they need to make more I tell them congratulations that is awesome for you. But for now I am happy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like reading about linguistic origins like that one. Makes me reflect on my irrational hatred towards reading &#34;could of&#34;, &#34;would of&#34; and the likes. I mean, I still get a seizure reading it, but I can only imagine some old dude yelling at the youngsters in the late 1800&#39;s like &#34;it&#39;s called &#39;and per se, and&#39;! Not ampersand! Jeez you all are the reason the english language is degrading!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The letter I, for example, would be referred to with the phrase I per se, I, which means in Latin &#34;I by itself (is the word) I.&#34; When the 27th quasi-letter &amp; was referred to it was called &amp; per se, and, meaning &#34;&amp; by itself (is the word) and.&#34; That read as &#34;and per se and.&#34;This explanation is mixed up and confusing. It isn&#39;t &#34;I per se, I&#34; that is somehow &#34;by itself I&#34;, it is merely &#34;per se I&#34;. The reason you get another &#34;and&#34; in front was because it was at the end of the alphabet song: &#34;[and] [per se &amp;]&#34;.https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/ampersand&gt; Thus the end of the recitation would be: “X, Y, Z and per se and”. This last phrase eventually became ampersand, and the term was in common English usage by around 1837."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One summer I had a job in the Penn library improving the catalog data for their medieval Latin manuscripts. The abbreviations were wild. Here is a handbook of them (which includes &amp; = et and &amp;-bar = etiam): https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/213385262.pdf (pdf). I can see how being &#34;literate&#34; was tougher then than now.There were different handwriting styles, depending on the writing speed (inversely proportional to the quality and thus expense). For example the Codex Sinaiticus is gorgeous: https://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/manuscript.aspx?book=26&amp;c... (That&#39;s a Greek example, not Latin---sorry, I&#39;m not much of a Latinist anymore.) I guess if you don&#39;t have mechanical type, you are very motivated to speed up writing. The books I looked at were pretty hasty.Almost everything I saw was a treatise on medicine and biology. They were all &#34;commentaries on Aristotle&#34;. I guess that&#39;s what you had to do to publish in those days.Besides the paleography, I had to trace the origin &amp; date of the paper used, which was possible from watermarks. We had two huge reference volumes giving known watermarks so you could narrow things down a lot---but often you didn&#39;t get an exact match. There was a whole symbology there too."</p>
