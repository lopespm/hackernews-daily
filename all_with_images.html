								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey congrats on making it 10 months!&#34;Urgent to not block progress, but also ironic that they are asking a person who has no clue what they are doing to deliver critical work&#34;Friend of mine started a role there (this was 4-5 years ago) and was fired (sorry... more or less asked to leave, being told he could keep his signing bonus if he just left) within about six weeks because he wasn&#39;t immediately delivering on some insane amounts of work. Truly, he recapped it for me, the expectations were absolutely incredible and I&#39;d consider him a hard worker who has found a ton of success in his current role.I bag on Amazon a lot on here (which if I were to review with my therapist is likely because I had an absolutely HORRENDOUS experience in an interview loop with them my first step out of college that still makes me nervous in interviews, even 15 years later). But living in Seattle, a notable chunk of my social circle works there. I&#39;d say a few enjoy the scale of things they get to work on or perhaps the brand name, but overall none of them ever talk about liking the work environment/balance/culture.One friend, at a director level, just quit on a whim because he came back from parental leave and his direct reports had all been put on a PIP while he was out. He told his VP to fuck off, left, and is now on sabbatical. I&#39;ve never seen him so happy."</p>

As is (light-gray-on-lighter-gray) I cannot read it as it literally hurts my eyes trying to focus on it.EDIT: It seems this is not intentional, some of the stylesheets are returning 404 for me but not other people... weird.EDIT: Amazingly, it turns out this site is hosted on the platform of which I&#39;m the lead engineer (Cloudflare Workers / Pages) and the problem is in fact our own fault, not Ben&#39;s. Wow. We&#39;ll... get on that. Sorry.FINAL EDIT (hopefully): Not necessarily a bug so much as classic cache skew... explanation here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29814868"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of these comments have taken to a kind of Amazon-bashing and venting their own experiences, where the author actually... didn&#39;t?I thought the author was incredibly fair/objective, and at least the way I read it, it wasn&#39;t so much that he had such a miserable experience or could only stomach 10 months of pain/abuse (in fact if you actually read to the end, he praises his manager, his teammates, etc.), and more so that it only took him 10 months to realize that the company culture and way-of-working was not aligned with his personal preferences. He does have legitimate complaints about parts of his experience, and makes some keen observations about the consequences and tradeoffs of Amazon choosing to adopt the culture that it does (though I also think he&#39;s wrong about a few things too), but overall it&#39;s less of a &#34;Amazon == bad&#34; piece and more of a &#34;this is why it wasn&#39;t to my taste&#34; reflection.Frankly, I would congratulate the author, and think of this as a success-story. Paraphrasing his own words, he learned a lot, met some good people, found some good practices that he&#39;s going to carry forward with him... isn&#39;t that a successful outcome (minus the annoyance of another round of job hunting, but hey in this market, another job hop is probably just an opportunity to level up comp, rather than an existential threat that you might be unemployed and starve)? Obviously the team/org he was in is suffering major attribution problems, and that&#39;s obviously a bad thing, but that&#39;s not his problem either.Note: in case it wasn&#39;t clear, I do work within Amazon, but these opinions are my own, not representing my employer, blah blah"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a very odd design document and it makes me think this author has thought a lot about materials and buildings but not actually built anything.The steel moment frame, to someone with shallow knowledge, sounds so strong and resilient.  But in fact, a rigid steel structure is more vulnerable to seismic (and even wind) loads than wooden framing which can flex and move and dampen those loads naturally.The stainless spec for the frame is just pure silliness.  Looking at my notes now, for steel beams buried in the ground:  200 microns of rust per year in very aggressive soils, but it rusts on both sides, so make that 400 microns.

... which means that it takes ~25 years to rust through naked 3/8 steel buried in the most aggressive soils.... which also means that unburied steel, protected from elements, up in the air, is going to last more than 1000 years.Oh, and also, the SS is more brittle so you&#39;ve made your seismic issues even worse....If I had an unlimited budget and was aiming for &gt;1000 years I would pour the piles to bedrock with stainless rebar inside fly-ash concrete and top those pilings with plate connectors into which you could socket large wooden columns (perhaps 8x8) and build the structure with large wooden members connected with steel connectors and column caps, etc.I would only use steel members if the span called for wood that was too big (like a 24&#39; span needing a 8x14 or whatever)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected something much simpler : bricks, stones, and wood. It&#39;s not like we are running low on examples of 1000+ years buildings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_century_in_architecture). These castles, cathedrals, farms, were built to last, so it&#39;s appropriate to use them as examples.We can, however, apply modern technics and materials when they make sense : insulation, windows, waterways... Prefer wood, wool and steel over plastics or composite materials and you&#39;re good to go.On a side note, I&#39;m currently buying a house (old farm) with over 200 years old plain oak carpentry. The thing is absolutely massive and would be unimaginably expensive to build today. With the proper care, it might last another 200 years without issue. Remember, Notre-Dame de Paris used 300 years old trees cut in ~1150 for its roof -before the 2019 fire-. With the proper care it would have still be standing today. I find that to be deeply humbling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I were to design a house with the idea that it should serve future generations, I&#39;d design it to be reconfigured, recycled, or torn down easily.After reading some of Stewart Brand&#39;s writing, I&#39;ve learned to love ugly buildings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has anyone been able to use darling for iOS CI jobs yet? Admittedly I haven&#39;t researched this in a while, but one of the biggest hurdles in large scale iOS development is sane DevOps infrastructure. I know due to Apple&#39;s TOS that you will never be able to build, sign, and distribute your app on non-Apple hardware. But i&#39;d love to use darling to run unit tests/CI jobs on commodity cloud infrastructure.Even if you do get dedicated mac instances, managing them is a bit of a nightmare since MacOS isn&#39;t designed to be headless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just thought it may be worth mentioning if there are devs from the project here, but Darling is one of the efforts that I would sponsor/donate to (just small amounts for now as I haven&#39;t made my millions yet ;-) if there were a more defined road map with milestones/goals.This is an amazing and important goal!  Thank you so much for dedicating your time and efforts to this!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am absolutely flummoxed by this review. Mine is configured with nearly identical specs (except that I have 64GB RAM) and is one of the worst purchases I&#39;ve ever made.Enabling deep sleep works fine; waking from it is impossible. WiFi stops working. The touch pad becomes hypersensitive. I&#39;ve resorted to turning the whole thing completely off after every use. But the battery still loses power even when the machine is completely powered down.The machine also freezes if I try to open a jpg or a PDF from the file explorer. Just completely freezes. Fan spins up like crazy, but as I mentioned, I have 64GB of RAM in this thing. It should be able to open a single one-page scanned document from my own scanner. If there&#39;s anything wrong with the file, this is the computer that&#39;s making the file poorly.The internet connection also just turns off after about half an hour of use. I have a Belkin dock with Ethernet plugged into it, which is then plugged into my Framework&#39;s USB-C port. This dock supports my work Mac all work day every day with no issues at all, so it&#39;s not the dock&#39;s problem. But the Framework? Internet just stops working after half an hour. And it manages to kill both wired and WiFi when it dies. I can turn them back on, but this is a ridiculous problem to have.This last point is pretty minor, but the hinges are floppy. The whole screen shakes around when I type on it.I have no idea how this author&#39;s experience is so much better than mine unless they just haven&#39;t used it much yet, but I regret absolutely everything about the purchase of this machine and feel like I was sold a bill of goods by all the glowing positive reviews all over the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author does not address the screen resolution (and just says the screen is nice) but I&#39;m hearing that the screen res is a bit to high to work with without scaling and a tad to low to do 2x scaling. And people don&#39;t like fractional scaling, at least in Gnome (it seems to look weird). Is this still an issue?I tend to prefer 1080p for this reason on 12-14&#34; screens. My Thinkpad X13 gen 2 has a 13.3&#34;, 1920x1200 screen, windows sets it to 150%, which seems ok, although Ubuntu works well for me without scaling still. The Frame work laptop has an even higher res (2256x1504). I do hear people scaling the fonts and that seems to be a nice solution... I remember from back in the old days that I never really liked the look of this.What do people think of this? I&#39;m hoping that in the future you can choose the screen (and easily get replacements as well, I hear they are working on that).Edit: I hope these issues are being addressed by established DE&#39;s, I&#39;m assuming they won&#39;t be an issue on Canonical&#39;s (hypothetical ;)) Flutter based DE that&#39;s (obviously ;)) coming and on System76&#39;s Rust based new DE for Pop OS [0].[0]: https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/08/system76_developing_n..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been at it intensively for a couple months and my mind simply refuses to cooperate. If anything, after having done 400+ problems I seem to be worse at them than when I started.Yup -- brain fog, paralysis and negative performance are the sure-fire signs of burnout (as least as pertains to your capacity for grinding LC).  Excellent preparation for the daily grind of actually working for companies that rely on these tests.Leetcode isn&#39;t about fun and challenging things, it&#39;s about thinking in one particular way, spitting out solutions using the same exact data structures and jumping through hoops on command without philosophizing or creating anything that can be reused/extended.Exactly.  And these are apparently precisely the &#34;skills&#34; these companies are &#34;desperately&#34; seeking to find among the engineers they invite for an on-site interview.And don&#39;t forget the strong &#34;culture fit&#34; signal indicated by the sheer willingness to grind, grind, grind.You memorize, regurgitate and participate in the agile masquerade. Creativity is shunned. Tried architectures/patterns are what is expected.That&#39;s ticket.  This is exactly the mindset these companies are after.  That&#39;s why they swear up and down on the efficacy of these tests.On the bright side: at least you&#39;ve been freed of any illusions, by this point, about the intrinsic value of your advanced hard science degree."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a 20+ year Senior Software Architect, Team Lead, Senior Developer and a PM (all at the same time at the moment!).  I&#39;ve done everything from C++ to 20 years of .Net to now TypeScript and Angular 13 with .Net Core REST APIs against an Oracle SQL database.I am self-taught and I can&#39;t do these leetcode problems if my life depended on it.I still deliver high quality software on time, and on budget, and have a solid grasp on my career.I wouldn&#39;t worry about this too much.  It depends on what you are going for.Sure, if you want to pass a FAANG interview where you are going to get these types of questions, go for it.  To solve day to day business problems, you rarely need this stuff.  You just need to learn how to write quality, performant, correct code that results in solutions.The best way to do this is develop experience in the industry over the years.My 2 cents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see this mentioned by other commenters so let me provide another perspective. Namely, I think OP is doing it wrong.OP claims to have done 400+ LC problems over a couple of months. Let me say it out loud here: this is simply crazy. It strikes me as an attempt to not learn how to tackle these challenges, but to actually brute-force through them. To anyone preparing for an interview: don&#39;t do this! Grab a book like Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI), maybe follow some online courses on programming puzzle patterns, and then start grinding LC. Maybe interleave grinding with learning? Your end goal should be to develop deep understanding of what you are doing, not memorise the solutions.Also, while going through LeetCode, it is very important to realise that the problem classification there is a bit wild at times. Don&#39;t stress that you cannot solve a medium sometimes as they are mislabeled. I did mediums that could be hards, hards that could be mediums, and hards that were just impossibly hard. Typically a very hard problem is not something you should expect in an interview setting as most interviers* don&#39;t expect you to implement KMP on the spot. Doesn&#39;t hurt to know it and impress the interviewer with knowledge, but if you think memorising KMP is the way, you&#39;re mistaken.* - there is still luck involved and you can have a crazy interviewer. It can happen, so just accept it and move on. Don&#39;t treat it as a personal defeat.Source: I grinded and I had offers from most of FAANG letters."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are worried about getting your blog post to the top of Reddit or Hacker News (I&#39;ve never been there myself); you can have a very modest web server or even a pay per request  serverless sort of thing and pay $20 real quick to Cloudflare if you happen to get popular. It&#39;s the Bart Simpson method of highly scalability[0], for static content you can have global datacenter coverage in a couple minutes or so if you use them for DNS to start with. It even works if the origin server goes down.[0]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKU3hMvD31w"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thought is why don&#39;t the authors use github pages to host their static site with their links to a dedicated server with an unmetered link since their whole project is CC0. Downloading assets doesn&#39;t need to be low latency, thus I don&#39;t think the caching spatially near the user is important. Having a user login for patreon is something that would be missing and require some more thought I admit.I think quite a lot of other people have mentioned in the thread that they are getting a lot of other &#34;benefits&#34; from using multiple services, but I don&#39;t see how these help solve the problem of data delivery besides taking advantage of the  Cloudflare + Backblaze alliance which is $31 if their main website is a static one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Compiz was probably the single most impactful event for desktop linux of the mid 2000&#39;s. Not that it itself made much of a difference, but the ripples affect many areas we take for granted today. A few reasons:  - it put linux ahead of windows and mac in terms of appearance;

  - it brought many new users and most were a good mix technical and enthusiasts;

  - it showed the advantages of modular software;

  - many plugins were useful and these useful plugins influenced desktops to this day;

  - it was fast, stable and cool enough;

  - it brought many new developers;

  - it was an incentive for vendors to improve 3d linux drivers;

  - it made X.Org developers improve redirection,

  - it came by default on the most popular distro from 2006 to 2012.

Yes, most of the effects were useless but even they helped developers and designers to decide what not to include or do in the future. It pioneered useful things like selecting an area of the screen and saving it directly to a file, useful zoom and quick visualization of non-visible windows. It also showed how important compositing was on the desktop. Although probably not in direct influence, there is a reason android, wayland and whatever comes with ChromeOS all have compositing features.At the time, there was some interesting developments and experimentation: métisse, sun&#39;s looking glass, bumptop, deskgallery... none of them was as successful as compiz. I&#39;m proud I was myself part of it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X9bcrJ3TjY) and have my name written in some of its source files to this day, even if almost nobody use it anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Compiz was one of those things I could show off to friends to prove that linux was actually way cooler than any of _their_ operating systems, but since then seems to have been completely forgotten about (at least by me). This was a nice blast from the past."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow did this ever take me back. Arguably my first &#34;public code release&#34; was a plugin (&#34;mod&#34; back then I think) for the WWIV BBS system -- a screensaver called &#34;Bubbles&#34; that would draw random circles on the idle screen instead of the dead blinky cursor at top left. BBS owners would basically need to code it as a diff in their own system and recompile the thing.I was maybe 9 or 10 years old. It was probably 50ish lines of C code, and I made some serious assumptions about what video card and modes were present.I really really loved computers and coding back then.Reading the comment below about being elderly and soulless also resonates for me at the moment.I miss the romance of it all. :) I&#39;ve been married to computers for nearly 40 years now, and all of the spice is gone. It&#39;s just comfortable and regular and routine.Oh well, on to another 2-hour interminable sprint planning sesh (sigh) -- &#34;yes dear, I&#39;ll be right there&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Alina Chan, one of the co-authors of Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19.In defense of a natural origin of Omicron, this study describes the remarkable evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma treatment of an immunosuppressed patient for 3-4 months; the mutations also reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03291-yWe know that there is a large immunocompromised population in Africa and that Covid-19 is rampant there. We also know that most hospitals, regardless of country, don&#39;t have the resources to track the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in their immunocompromised patients. So it&#39;s not unexpected that a variant like Omicron could have evolved over an entire year in an immunocompromised individual before finally infecting others.If there is any evidence that a lab in the region was serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in neutralizing antibodies/patient serum, then I&#39;d say there is something to go on for a potential lab origin. But at the moment, there is not even circumstantial evidence pointing to this happening in Africa. Maybe setting up a secure channel for whistleblowers with evidence of the above would be the most productive approach.The above is not to say that I don&#39;t think there needs to be much more transparency and accountability from scientists working with pathogens.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m open minded, but my bullshit detectors started going off around the point where it was casually implied that we all know and it is widely accepted that delta was leaked from a lab.  I tried googling it but could find nothing.  Then I looked at the two sources the author links:&gt; https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4371212&gt; https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4382708Neither of these have nearly enough evidence or support for such a massive claim (the second doesn&#39;t even mention delta), as far as I can tell, and I can find no other reputable sources that make a similar claim.  Heck, I can&#39;t even find un-reputable ones that mention this.Am I missing something?  I&#39;m not going to continue with the article if this is how flimsy the sourcing is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the author actually had some kind of evidence that there was a lab leak source of Omicron, don’t you think it would be mentioned in the opening paragraphs of the blog?  Instead we have a long list of connect-the-dots tweets, out of context quotes, and unsubstantiated speculation going on for 2/3s of the post before we even get to the Omicron stuff.The meat of the speculation is a scary looking graph plotting genetic delta from the origin.  Here’s a more objective plot from the Wikipedia entry: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant#/...Notice anything?  Looks like Gamma and others have similar genetic distances without other mutations.Sensational blogging is pretty sensational.  That’s about it."</p>

So besides SEO, there&#39;s this thing where the recipe itself is basically defenseless against someone stealing it and calling it theirs but the sum of the fluff around it plus the recipe on the other hand can be copyrighted and enjoys all the protections afforded to these kinds of things. So, if say, Jamie Oliver likes your recipe and puts it in a book passing it as his, you can now legally tell him to stop doing that because of said fluff."</p>

Maybe I’ve just picked the wrong ideas, but I can’t even get people to say “this is bad.” Just silence.Seems easier when you’ve already built some clout and have a following.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is probably one of the best write-ups I&#39;ve seen around the basics of automotive control unit reverse engineering.More modern VW control units are the same in broad strokes - they use UDS on ISO-TP instead of KWP on TP2.0, but this is just evolution of the same fundamentals. And instead of the wacky SGO format inside of FRF update files, they use the ASAM MCD-2 D-ODX format to define flashing layers. Most European automakers are similar.One interesting difference and trend in automotive control modules (also mentioned in Willem&#39;s fantastic write-up) is that many EU modules started adding signature checking and encrypted updates in the late 2000s, while most US and Japanese automakers have only done so in the last 2-3 years.These encrypted and signature checked updates are by and large still fairly vulnerable - often due to logic errors in the complex upgrade processes and occasionally due to a strange insistence on using RSA using PKCS#1.5 with e=3 and inadequate padding validation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The electronics seemed to be fabricated using bare dies attached to some substrate, probably to lower cost and improve reliability at higher temperatures. The board is made up of two parts, a low-power part with the CPU and CAN transceivers, and some high-power part with 6 MOSFETs forming a three phase H-Bridge.&gt; https://blog.willemmelching.nl/images/vw/IMG_3181.jpgIt doesn&#39;t really look cheap to me (large machined surfaces on the cast aluminium casing, two ceramic PCBs, everything connected with wire bonding, even the motor windings and the external connector, which means that at least those bonds are carried out on an almost completely assembled product; also look at the sheer size of the motor bonds) but it does look very reliable - everything is bonded or welded, zero connectors, no fasteners, all solid state."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great write up which also illustrates how deep DRM/closed systems are in cars built this century.Until around mid 90&#39;s cars still had lots of relays and barely comprehensible wiring looms if you could get your hands on workshop manuals.The sooner we go back to a BEV with the simplicity of a 1960&#39;s VW Beetle the better imo, not least so that the third world can get a look in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Strange thread here ignoring the very important points about the media Tara is making.&#39;Those of us on the inside know just how swiftly — and how dramatically — the politics of the public broadcaster have shifted.It used to be that I was the one furthest to the left in any newsroom, occasionally causing strain in story meetings with my views on issues like the housing crisis. I am now easily the most conservative, frequently sparking tension by questioning identity politics. This happened in the span of about 18 months. My own politics did not change.To work at the CBC in the current climate is to embrace cognitive dissonance and to abandon journalistic integrity.&#39;I would argue the UK BBC &amp; US NPR are also in dire straits because of similar erosions of impartialness.Neilsen demonstrates that the legacy media are dying fast, fewer and fewer people are tuned in as the broadcasting becomes more and more toxic. This is a good thing imo.https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-busin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Except at political groups to which I belong, I am almost always the left-most person in the room. The Lefts greatest weakness is an enthusiasm for splintering over small matters of doctrine. Identity politics, tribalism over principle, virtue signaling, whatever fad this is, it&#39;s deeply hurting progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To see billionaires amass extraordinary wealth and bureaucrats amass enormous power — with little scrutiny.Not an accident, I believe. Occupy Wall Street made the billionaires and Wall Street take notice. As a consequence, they probably decided people need to be busy with something else, just in case, so they don&#39;t get any more funny ideas. Identity politics is a great one to divide people, fan anger, get more clicks and views, and at the same time get them uninterested what the billionaires and Wall Street firms are doing."</p>

But I&#39;d like to know &#34;Why?&#34; as in &#34;Why even add this supposed eye-candy to a web page in the first place?&#34; I assume the answer is that it makes the page seem luxurious and opulent, which translates into the viewer believing that the page was probably time-consuming (and possibly expensive) to build, which translates into a sense of legitimacy and trustworthiness.That explanation might have made more sense a decade ago before these types of effects were ubiquitous on the web. Now, it&#39;s easier than ever for anyone to drag and drop one of these preset visual effects onto their webpage. There&#39;s nothing to it anymore, people have seen them, the shine has worn off: There&#39;s no longer anything &#39;special&#39; about these special effects.Worse (as another commenter posted about always seeing these effects on &#39;crypto coin&#39; sites) these effects are often used on sites engaging in confidence tricks - relying on dazzling the viewer with visual effects to convince them that their fraudulent scheme is legitimate.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m loving reading through all of the sickening puff pieces that business/tech journalists put out about her and Theranos.It&#39;s funny to think back to 2015 and the hagiographical void still left in tech journo hearts after Steve Jobs died.https://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-i...&gt; How Elizabeth Holmes Became America&#39;s New Entrepreneurial Icon&gt; She represents the part of entrepreneurship that is long-term dedication, when nobody&#39;s watching&gt;... That kind of walk-before-you-talk behavior is refreshing and respectable in today&#39;s hype-strewn entrepreneurial landscape."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironic that her board of directors-- one of the most praised aspects of Theranos-- probably hurt her when it came to going after her with criminal charges. These were some of the most well-connected people in the country, and making them look like fools did her no favors. Once it was clear this wouldn&#39;t go away quietly, I&#39;d bet they pushed hard to ensure criminal prosecution. (which I think she deserved anyway.)Especially because it was those same directors&#39; reputations that likely helped the fraud go on so long. There was probably a fair number of skeptics who thought &#34;Surely they wouldn&#39;t put their name on something like this if there was nothing there&#34;. I doubt Kissinger or the people around him want the last of his legacy to be punctuated by Theranos.I&#39;ll be honest: I kind of thought the same thing. That a breakthrough in science of this magnitude with so much silence around its details was strange, especially in the face of some expert skepticism. But the idea that Henry Kissinger etc. would attach themselves to it without compelling evidence made me more or less shrug my shoulders and move on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Time to kibitz on the likely sentence! You can get the federal sentencing guidelines here:https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manu...They&#39;re long and mostly not relevant except for the sections pertaining to Holmes conduct.Here&#39;s the indictment:https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/page/file/1135066/downloadHolmes was found guilty of one 18 USC 1349 charge, and 3 18 USC 1343 charges; the 1343&#39;s she was found guilty on were in amounts ranging from $100k to $100MM(!).It should be possible to come up with a better guess than the New York Times&#39; &#34;20 years per count, but likely served concurrently&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was in response to mwseibel&#39;s thread, which had a big discussion yesterday:Google no longer producing high quality search results in significant categories - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29772136 - Jan 2022 (1167 comments, spread over multiple pages - note the &#34;X more comments&#34; links at the bottom)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To some extent, I worry that the problem with search engines is that there isn&#39;t any data worth returning.  Yesterday&#39;s thread talked a lot about reviews.  Writing a review is hard work that requires deep domain expertise, experience with similar products, and months of testing.  If you want a review for something that came out today, there is no way that work could have been done, so there simply isn&#39;t anything to find.  Instead you&#39;ll get a list of &#34;Best TVs 2021&#34; or whatever, with some blurb and an affiliate link, not an actual review.  That&#39;s what people can make for free with a day&#39;s notice, so if you write a search engine that discards those sites, that&#39;s fine, you&#39;ll just return &#34;no results&#34; for every interesting query.I guess what I&#39;m saying is that if you want better reviews, you probably want to start writing reviews and figuring out how to sell them for money.  Many have tried, few have succeeded.  But there probably isn&#39;t some Javascript that will fix this problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Why not try writing a search engine specifically for some category dominated by SEO spam?Back in the olden days, there were lots of organizations that collated high quality content from the best writers. They nurtured expert writers and paid them well. They fact-checked the content and employed diligent editors and proofreaders so it was accurate and well-written. Over the years, they&#39;d build a reputation for reliability and trustworthiness that kept people coming back for more. If you wanted to learn about fitness, or cars, or cooking, or science, you&#39;d find a reputable author and publisher and buy their magazines or books.But then, in the early 2000s, the geniuses from SV &#34;disrupted&#34; the publishing industry and its financial model. They brought us a much better way to find content, the search engine. Because they were so much better than the old-fashioned publishers, search engines gobbled up the advertising money and became the dominant gateway to content. Publishers had to abandon expensive high-quality writing because rankings and eyeballs now mattered more than quality and trustworthiness. Instead of investing in writers, they invested in marketers and SEO specialists.The result: worthless content, writers banging out garbage for peanuts, and useless search engines.Two decades later, looking at the barren wasteland they had created, the SV geniuses thought: I know what we need, more search engines, but smaller ones that collate high-quality content from the best writers. There must be money in that, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw only this quote on Twitter the other day&gt; The so-called normal distribution of statistics assumes that there are default humans who serve as the standard that the rest of us can be accurately measured against.Which was, frankly, shocking to see coming from Scientific American, something I had assumed was a respectable scholarly publication, if not an actual academic journal, per se. It&#39;s an absolutely mind-boggling mistake to publish in something that claims itself to be about science. That is not at all what a normal distribution is, and the normal distribution makes no such assumption. Anyone who passed a basic Intro to Statistics course should be able to explain why this is wrong.To open with such a profoundly wrong assertion, and then publish an article built on this flawed assumption just beggars belief. I feel like I&#39;ve wandered into some kind of Twilight Zone that there are apparently serious people, charged with informing the public about science, who are publishing obvious falsehoods and expecting us to go along with them.I cannot understand how an editor of a scientific publication read that sentence and did not immediately send the piece back to the author with a note reading &#34;No thank you. You clearly have no idea what you&#39;re talking about&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When did SA change? In the 1970s-80s, its articles were quite technical, for scientifically literate readers to understand something outside their field. When I looked at SA again after a long absence, around 20 years ago, it had already been dumbed down to about what Popular Science was many years ago.SA had another era, in my dad&#39;s day, when its aim was less academic and more for the home enthusiast and hobbyist. I wonder when it became more of a forum for academic researchers to popularize their work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My own major debilating depression was such that I couldn&#39;t get out of bed other than to use the toilet. Worse than that I could see no reason to get out of bed and didn&#39;t care to get out of bed. Taking a shower and getting dressed was out of the question. I knew the strain I was causing in my family, but since I didn&#39;t feel anything, I couldn&#39;t feel enough empathy for them to do anything about it. I knew I used to love them, but that seemed a long time ago and there was no hope of ever feeling again. I thought about suicide often, but my inability to get motivated prevented me from carrying it out. I once had a bounce of energy so I started planning to kill myself and the weird thing was, that I felt the happiest I had ever felt in my life. It was such a feeling of peace and joy that it would soon be over.Fortunately for me, my family would not tolerate me in this condition and forced to me to get out of bed and dragged me to doctors and checked me into mental health units until we found the right doctor who perscribed the right medication that worked. Turns out typical anti-depressants don&#39;t work on me because I am bipolar and was experiencing bipolar depression.It&#39;s been three years of recovery now and I am very happy. I take my quatiepine every night and get the sleep I need so I don&#39;t relaspe into mania and then depression.My family is not sophisticated about mental illness. They would rather not think about it. But the one thing they did is to refuse to let me remain in that state and forced me to take action."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depression can also manifest in different ways. One way is anger, frustration, and anxiety. My wife’s depression was like this. She would come home from work, find one thing wrong with our apartment - there were dirty dishes in the sink, the clothes hadn’t been folded - and get angry with me for not having taken care of it.The fact that I had cooked dinner and mopped the floors didn’t count.She was angry with me probably 33-50% of the time. For about a year I tried to get out ahead of all the chores. But that’s impossible. Finally I realized that this wasn’t my fault. I wasn’t a bad partner. This was something in her head.I could actually watch in real time as her own brain gaslit her. I’d pay her a compliment — “that dress looks nice” — and see a perceptible lag as her brain figured out how to turn it into an insult — “your other dresses aren’t nice.”Eventually she recognized something was wrong and got help, but it took a couple of years. She is a completely different person now.If you are the partner of a depressed person, your primary responsibility is to yourself. You have to stay sane. THEN, if you can, you can support and help your partner. But if you lose your own mental health you’re pretty much done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the overarching message with this post is right on whenever you are talking to someone who is struggling: listen, love, and don&#39;t judge. A hug is much better than a suggestion on how the family member can &#34;fix&#34; themselves.I also want to put a plug in for dogs. I have struggled with depression on and off in my life, and two years ago I adopted a dog I saw being abused in the street. She was just a little puppy, and I absolutely did not want anything to do with raising a dog at the time, but I felt I had no choice. I picked her up and took her home.Since then I have not been able to sleep past 7am in the morning without these two little eyes staring me down. But it is wonderful. She gives me relentless love every day, and she gave my life a really healthy structure it desperately needed. We go on walks three times a day looking for her doggy friends. I spent a lot more time in nature, because she doesn&#39;t give a damn for computers or video games. I know even some people look down on me for how much I love my dog, but they have no idea what I was like before. This dog saved my ass.Now it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to just lie in bed, and that is a great thing, not a bad thing."</p>

Also wanted to own my habit data (as plain text), so I made sure Flat Habits stored its data locally as an org file.I&#39;m an Emacs nutter and can say the strength of a habit tracker lies in removing daily friction from the tracking process itself. The plain text part is cherry on top (bringing piece of mind around lock-in). In my case, it&#39;s been months since I looked at the plain text file itself.As for forming habits themselves (the actual goal)... it&#39;s been well over a year since I started running. I&#39;ve kept it up since reading Atomic Habits (and started tracking)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this book and I think this sums it up in a Tweet:The laws are:  Make it obvious, Make it attractive, Make it easy, Make it satisfying; Each law maps to one of the four steps of habit formation:  Make it obvious → Cue Make it attractive → Craving Make it easy → Response Make it satisfying → Reward; Make it Obvious To effectively build a new habit, make the cue for that habit blatantly obvious"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Along similar lines, I&#39;ve adopted a hyper-frequent commit pattern in git. I do a bunch of meaningless micro-commits as I&#39;m making progress, and then rewrite them all into one or two meanginful commits once I&#39;ve reached a working state of whatever I was trying to do.I find it&#39;s helpful for not losing work / easily backing up if as I&#39;m going along I realize I want to change approach.(For the micro commit I have a git command &#34;git cam&#34; that just commits all changes with the message &#34;nt&#34;. Then once I&#39;m ready to do a &#34;real commit&#34;, I have &#34;git wip&#34; which rolls back all the nt commits but leaves them in checkout; then I can make one or two &#34;real&#34; commits.)I wonder if dura would be even better, or if the commit frequency would end up being too fine-grained and obscure?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"JetBrains &#34;local history&#34; for InteliJ IDEs has saved me several times. It has all of the diffing tools that are available for git commits. This looks to be a generic implementation of that. We should not live in a world where unsaved data is lost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a similar tool a couple of years ago here: https://github.com/google/git-sync-changesBoth save uncommitted changes in a hidden ref.Based on the README, the differences seem to be:1. dura runs as a daemon while git-sync-changes is a one shot execution.2. dura saves locally, while git-sync-changes syncs with a remote repo.3. dura only does the save and the restore is manual, whereas git-sync-changes does both steps automatically.I’m glad to see more people exploring this space. I think there’s a lot of untapped potential in tracking pending changes similarly to how we track committed changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interviews are really a dumb game these days so if you want to really game it you can go with a statistical approach:* Practice questions by company on LeetCode, sort by frequency of last 6 months and work down the list, do maybe 75-100, the list updates once a week* Search for the company on the LeetCode forums and sort by most recent. If a question is not on LC yet it will likely get posted there, so you can get really fresh intel.I&#39;ve read of people doing this and getting like 6/6 questions they&#39;ve seen before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost all advice online about interviewing is written from the point of view of the candidate. Sometimes this is good advice, but sometimes it devolves into some kind of astrology, where candidate are just guessing how things work.I&#39;ve done +300 interviews at FAANG so I can share bit of advice from the interviewer&#39;s side. The caveat is that this is based on how I conduct interviews, so YMMV with other people.* Always ask clarifying questions. Almost all problems have some level of ambiguity that you need to clarify. This is intended. The more senior you are, the more important this becomes.* Explain your approach before you begin, and even while you code. This gives the interviewer a chance to help you if you are down the wrong path, or even just understand what you are up to.* If you get stuck, ask for help! think of this as a pair programming session rather than an interview. I much prefer a candidate who gets stuck, ask for hints, gets unblocked and writes good code, rather than one that doesn&#39;t ask for help and writes not-so-good code.* Caveat: There is a tension with asking questions. There is such a thing as too much help, e.g. I need to explicitly tell you how to solve the problem. Use judiciously.* Take interviewer&#39;s hints. The interviewer has probably asked this question dozens of times and knows it inside out. If they give you a hint, 99% of times they are on to something.* Personally I don&#39;t like &#34;hard LC&#34; problems. Instead I prefer medium difficulty problems, and spend extra time probing the candidate&#39;s coding skills. This includes:1. Write tests.2. Handle corner cases/incorrect inputs.3. Discuss how to scale the code.4. Discuss how to refactor the code.* If nothing else, write the simplest brute force solution you can think of. As an interviewer I need a coding sample to evaluate the candidate. Trying to and failing to implement an optimal solution is worse than implementing a correct brute force one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After being given the algorithm problem, ask for the specific runtime your solution will need to have. Almost certainly, the interviewer will tell you.In my experience, interviewers will rarely tell you the runtime of the optimal solution.Regardless, very interesting blog post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t even need an SPA. Having the backend + frontend share the same state makes development so much faster and easier it&#39;s shockingly refreshing. When building a SaaS project last year I decided to just ditch React/Angular/Vue and did everything server-side like it was 2005. I was extremely pleased at the result -- everything feels snappy, secure, and native for the browser. I was shocked at how much time and headache I saved: not having to design/deploy an API and all the trimmings (ACLs, CORS, JWTs etc.), not having to spend X hours a day wrestling with Webpack/hot reloading/npm/tree-shaking/state management, having direct access to backend secrets/state/APIs and just spitting out HTML, it&#39;s just so....lovely. It simplifies performance tuning as well, the only thing I need to optimize is the server, which is easy to do because I have 100% control and visibility, compared to debugging/optimizing JavaScript for a million different clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"CORS is such an ugly web standard.  It&#39;s not only a pain in you butt, but it also makes your requests slow through these extra pre-flight round-trips.I have hope that we can remove it, though, in new versions of HTTP.CORS only exists because XMLHTTPRequest broke the assumptions of web 1.0 servers.  Suddenly any web browser loading any page anywhere could make a request to your server without the user&#39;s explicit permission, and a ton of web servers had already been built and were running under the assumption that users would only hit their endpoints by explicitly typing in a URL or clicking on a link.But each time we design a new version of HTTP, we get an opportunity to remove CORS restrictions for it, because there aren&#39;t any servers running the new version yet.And with Braid (https://braid.org), we&#39;re making changes that are big enough that I think it really warrants taking a fresh look at all of this stuff.  So I have hope that we can eliminate CORS and all this ugliness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The irony in this is that with CloudFront at least, it can&#39;t strip the &#34;/api&#34; prefix before sending it to your backend, so you have to have your backend server understand /api/xyz rather than just /xyz calls like when it was on a dedicated api subdomain.But don&#39;t worry! AWS thought of this! They invented Another Cloud Thing, namely Lambda@Edge, to solve this. Now you can run a JS function for every single request that hits your CloudFront Distribution so that you can run logic in there to strip the prefix before it gets passed to your origin. You read that right! Execute code every time a request hits your proxy! But wait, doesn&#39;t executing code for every single request sound insane AND doesn&#39;t it also add latency which this was trying to remove? Yes! Isn&#39;t cloud just lovely?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just researched good/quality crafting printers yesterday. Search results were mostly blogs and crappy websites that offered obviously no insights but were just SEO optimized to direct you to their Amazon affiliate links. Especially sad since those affiliate links to Amazon mostly resulted in &#34;This product is currently not available&#34; sites.Repeated my search on Youtube to find reviews or unboxing. Most video search results were basically &#34;Youtube SEO&#34; again - the most viewed/top-ranked videos did never show a single actual print run or even the printer available. It was mostly marketing websites turned into video (slowly scrolling/moving over product description or pictures clearly taken from the web). And of course, affiliate links in the description.The web has become a crappy place to research products as long as money can be made with those through affiliations. I wonder if outlawing affiliate marketing would make the world a better place.P.S: Whats most ridiculous about my Youtube Printer research experience, the best and most helpful video was a sales video from a home shopping TV station [0], where they actually showed some printing action and handling of one of the models I was interested in.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytMXgjCReO0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just Google---the World Wide Web itself is rapidly becoming a defunct protocol, the culmination of a decades-long shift in the Internet&#39;s center of mass away from browsers and towards centralized and commercialized apps---from personal web pages to LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter handles, from the ubiquitous WordPress blogs to YouTube videos and Medium posts, and from forums to Tweets and subreddits.The useful information on the Web is now concentrated in a few places---Reddit, Quora, Stack Exchange, Wikipedia, etc. When I want reasonable search results, I search there instead of the Web as a whole. (And even many of these services are in the late stages of the Silicon Valley life cycle---desperate monetization and engagement-increasing gimmicks---with uncertain futures.)Wikipedia, bless its heart, lurches on as a cathedral to early Web&#39;s dream of information democratization. It stands as a wonder of the ancient world: incomplete, built from technology few now understand, and reflecting values and priorities that no longer quite align with contemporary culture. But it persists thanks to its inertia and the undeniable sense of awe it invokes even today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google was still useful for things that are non-marketable. But in the last year or so, I have started to realize how awfully bad has gotten even at that.Case in point: Open source mailing list archives. For various reasons, some times I have to search for entire email threads that are available in the web interfaces of some mailing list archives. I have part of a phrase of some email, I put that into google with quotes, and it returns some results, usually with the main archive being in the first results. In the last year or so, Google has started returning no results for some phrases of emails that do exist and are available in one or more public archives.When that started to happen, I tried Bing. And Bing returns results with links to archive. So does duckduckgo most times. But for Google, it&#39;s like if that particular email I&#39;m searching at that moment didn&#39;t exist (for other emails in the same mailing list it works fine). It only happens occasionally, but it&#39;s getting worse. So I have started to rely on DDG and Bing more and more, because they always find what I want.So Google is starting to fail at some of the most basic aspects of a search engine, it&#39;s not just the ordering of the search results - there are some public web pages that it won&#39;t see for whatever reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Some scientists say these worries about attention are a moral panic, comparable to the anxieties in the past about comic books or rap music, and that the evidence is shaky.I agree with them.It&#39;s hard to pay attention to something for long unless it&#39;s entertaining. Reading a book, reading a paper, etc -- these activities take discipline that most people don&#39;t develop or don&#39;t often apply. This isn&#39;t new. The mistake is thinking that the ability to concentrate on something non-entertaining is the baseline. One reason so many people think they have ADHD is because they make that mistake.We had the same anxieties about radio and TV. Those anxieties were right and wrong. Technologies do change how people behave but it&#39;s always the same story. There will be entertainment freely available and you&#39;ll have to choose to concentrate on things that aren&#39;t entertaining that you consider worthwhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a veritable war going on for your attention, and the battlefields are your eyeballs, your ears and ultimately your brain. Psychologists have been enlisted, as they are in every war to try to win it for &#39;their side&#39;, be it one of the big silos or some dying TV or newspaper era behemoth, there is no reasonable way in which you can withstand that kind of frontal onslaught. The only way to really deal with this is to not participate.Beware or you too will be collateral damage on the balance sheets of these media conglomerates. Unmediated reality is still there for you to peruse, but &#39;augmented reality&#39; will be the next big wave for tech and I&#39;m pretty sure that it will end up being used mostly for advertising purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This for me is key, these sorts of problems cannot just be solved on an individual level. They are systemic.&#34;Individual abstinence is “not the solution, for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn’t the answer to pollution. It might, for a short period of time, keep certain effects at bay, but it’s not sustainable, and it doesn’t address the systemic issues.” He said that our attention is being deeply altered by huge invasive forces in wider society. Saying the solution was to just adjust your own habits – to pledge to break up with your phone, say – was just “pushing it back on to the individual” he said, when “it’s really the environmental changes that will really make the difference”.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The CDC weekly death counts, which reflect the information on death certificates and so have a lag of up to eight weeks or longer, show that for the week ending Nov. 6, there were far fewer deaths from COVID-19 in Indiana compared to a year ago – 195 verses 336 – but more deaths from other causes – 1,350 versus 1,319.&#34;So last year more covid deaths (particularly among the elderly), but while those numbers have declined, the numbers from younger &#34;working age&#34; people have increased more than enough to make up for it.&gt; &#34;Just 8.9% of ICU beds are available at hospitals in the state, a low for the year, and lower than at any time during the pandemic. But the majority of ICU beds are not taken up by COVID-19 patients – just 37% are, while 54% of the ICU beds are being occupied by people with other illnesses or conditions.&#34;Well a lot of people were avoiding medical care (precisely because of Covid concerns), so this makes some sense.  Couple that with the increased death rate for younger people and something has happened to worsen the health and outcomes generally for that population.  Cue wild speculation and theories."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many people kept insisting &#34;Not many young people are dying from Covid-19&#34; a statement that over looked the fact that, under normal circumstances, not many young people die at all. But there was an article in the New York Times that offered these facts about people aged 20 to 40.July, 2019: 11,000 deadJuly, 2020: 16,000 deadBoth numbers are small in a country where 3 million people die each year, about 250,000 a month. But it&#39;s still a 45% increase, so that age group was the worst affected, in terms of the increase in death. The increase in the death rate of old people was not as dramatic, as older people make up the vast majority of all deaths, every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zotero is, if you&#39;re not in the market for a closed source silo like EndNote, the only game left in town. Mendeley went full on Evil, and Papers for Mac is Mac only, closed source, and missing dozens of functionalities that are absolutely a must have in academic writing and research.An absolute must have is BetterBibTex (https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), which adds better Citekey management and, my personal highlight, &#34;export on add&#34; functionality. In short, everything I save into a specific folder in my library gets exported as a .bib file right away. That way I can click a button in my browser and have the citation ready in my LaTeX editor, Word, or Obsidian (https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) within seconds.The latest beta also adds full Markdown export for Notes. I tend to keep my notes on papers in Zotero, attached to the paper, but export them for filing in Obsidian (which I then feed into MkDocs for our work group&#39;s large repo).Unless you need Apple Pages support, which Apple keeps to itself and only sells for mighty moolah to a select few, Zotero can do anything EndNote can do, is Open Source, and with that won&#39;t drive your PI up the wall with yet another expense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend going for the beta version which features a (game-changing) built-in pdf reader[1], with annotations (searchable and synced with the beta iPad app) and many more improvements.Zotero is an amazing tool and I could not imagine writing papers without it. For collaborative writing, it syncs the bibliography with overleaf[2] and google docs. The browser add-on allows to build your library with one click while browsing, and it parses wonderfully meta-data from all (most) publishers and pre-print servers. Then my unique bibfile (symlinked in every project) is continuously updated to reflect new items or manual changes.But I use it even for non-publishing side of research: one can save webpages (with snapshots) and write notes with formatting around them. My personal research workflow involves note-taking with the markdown app Zettlr[2], from which I can cite my Zotero library using simply `@[Author:Title:Year]`. I can then build notes from a twitter thread and stats.stackexchange.com answers, then connect it with papers and blog posts that way, and a specific chapter of a book with my annotation on the cloud. It not always straightforward as a workflow but it works wonders.And the team is very responsive on the forum and on twitter. If one of the dev is ready this, thank you so much for making researchers life way easier !EDIT: I just realised I can share my libraries online. A bit ashamed because it is very messy, but in case you are wondering what a Zotero library looks like, here is the link to mine [4] (without the notes and the embedded pdf and data files because I cannot share all of them. Moreover, I don&#39;t use the folder structure anymore so its very messy).[1] https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview[2] I recommend the BetterBibTex extension for anything related to tex, it&#39;ll save you a lot of time[3] https://zettlr.com, another great app.[4] https://www.zotero.org/wosk/library"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a longtime user of Zotero and a paying subscriber too. I use Zotfile extension to manage PDF files in Zotero. The best feature of this extension is bulk renaming filenames using a predefined filename format such as authors-year-article name. Most academic papers pdf files have weird names such as &#34;1-s2.0-S0007681321001221-main.pdf&#34;. Before Zotero and Zotfile I used to manually rename them. Then I found out that Zotero extracts metadata automatically from PDF files and can use them for renaming the files. Zotfile gives you more control. Check it out:  http://zotfile.comI saw dstillman has commented here. Dan, thanks a lot for your tireless work to make Zotero the best reference manager!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The main issue with &#34;Web3&#34; is that it moves records of transactions from many private places to one public place. Sure this one place may not be controlled by a single entity, but it facilitates tracking at an unprecedented level.Cryptocurrencies are the ultimate example of this and are an absolute boon to tax collectors, forensic accountants and fraudsters. In our current economy financial transactions are recorded in millions of individual ledgers that are kept private, or in the case of cash transactions are often not recorded at all, or are not linked to an individual. There is no central ledger.With crypto currencies however you can not only see all transactions but also trace them back to individual users as long as you can link a wallet to a person. This is a massive increase in centralisation yet discussion of whether this is a good idea seems to be entirely missing. The notion that centralising transactions in one place is somehow an example of decentralisation just seems mad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with web3 is not that it&#39;s centralized -- that&#39;s irrelevant.The fundamental problem with all crypto&#34;currencies&#34; is as follows: the world uses real currencies and there is only one way this enters into the world of crypto&#34;currencies&#34;: by someone selling a coin to someone else. Thus, regardless of what crypto&#34;currency&#34; we are talking about, it would be a zero sum game if not for transaction fees. However, with transaction fees it becomes a scam because there&#39;s a set of players who are guaranteed to win and there&#39;s another set of players who, en masse, are guaranteed to lose. It utterly doesn&#39;t matter what you do with your crypto&#34;currency&#34;, this is the underpinning scam of it.And once you entered the game, the only way for you to not lose money is to find a greater fool who will take over your crypto&#34;currency&#34;, everyone who owns some becomes a proponent of it. It&#39;s an ingenious scam.And no, nothing in the real world is like this. In the real world, the amount of currency increases when a bank extends a loan which then creates more value by such things as being using as capital, allowing you to enjoy a home now instead of decades later and so forth. Also, stocks are not a zero sum game -- companies actually create value and so forth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the author makes the mistake of assuming that web3 is a meaningful, tangible term being used in good faith.In reality, web3 is a marketing buzzword that cryptocurrency boosters have started promoting in an attempt to legitimize their resource intensive and otherwise useless financial speculation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"AirDrop is brilliant but it fails silently, no error messages - nothing. At best, it says that it was cancelled.Does anyone knows how to debug it?I also wonder, why this type of file transfer isn&#39;t the industry standart. It&#39;s so straightforward(when it works), why would anyone transfer files in any other way? Okay, maybe a transfer history can also be useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe AirDrop is a a great example of how Apples vertical integration and full ownership of software and hardware really thrives. It may not offer interoperability with other platforms, but that’s because other platforms don’t have the control needed to implement the same level of integration of hardware and software needed.Without the direct low level control of the radio hardware they would not have been able to integrate both Bluetooth and WiFi in the way that AirDrop does.I hope one day standards for this type of functionality appear so that other platforms can implement it. Ideally apple would contribute their tech to create the standard but that’s probably wishful thinking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No book influenced my attitude toward philosophy more than Wittgenstein&#39;s Blue Book. Here are a couple gems:&gt; The questions, &#34;What is length?&#34;, &#34;What is meaning?&#34;, &#34;What is the number one?&#34; etc., produce in us a mental cramp. We feel that we can&#39;t point to anything in reply to them and yet ought to point to something. (We are up against one of the great sources of philosophical bewilderment: we try to find a substance for a substantive.)&gt; The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to find the common element in all its applications, has shackled philosophical investigation; for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him to understand the usage of the general term. When Socrates asks the question, “what is knowledge?” he does not even regard it as a preliminary answer to enumerate cases of knowledge. If I wished to find out what sort of thing arithmetic is, I should be very content indeed to have investigated the case of a finite cardinal arithmetic. For:
(a) this would lead me on to all the more complicated cases,
(b) a finite cardinal arithmetic is not incomplete, it has no gaps which are then filled in by the rest of arithmetic.&gt; Now I don&#39;t say that this is not possible. Only, putting it in this way immediately shows you that it need not happen. This, by the way, illustrates the method of philosophy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not quite all public domain. (in English) [0] (maybe? gray area)I&#39;d highly recommend checking out his work on (and coining of the term) &#34;language games&#34; [1] I&#39;m not sure I agree with all of the thinking behind them, but it&#39;s a fascinating concept that has useful nuggets whether or not you agree with everything Wittgenstein says about them. They are explored pretty fully in his work &#34;Philosophical Investigations&#34; [2] This work pretty much set aside a fair amount of his thinking in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which is still an interesting work in its own right. I think that even a cursory ELI5 treatment of this material in a standard college course would be very useful in arming students with tools needed to dissect language. I&#39;ve used it (in brief) when teaching a course on Informal Logic in relation to propaganda.[0] It seems copyright on the English translation might still be in effect, or at least a gray area of determination. Since it&#39;s a common text use in college courses I&#39;m guessing the copyright owners may fight public domain release. The issue will be whether or not the translation was a work for hire or if it can be considered sufficiently different to constitute an original work. The English translation by Anscombe, Hacker, and Schulte occured posthumously, and so might not be considered work for hire. Hopefully it will resolve in favor of public domain. For a shorter consideration of &#34;language games&#34; check out Blue Book.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)[2] https://www.amazon.com/Philosophical-Investigations-Ludwig-W..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do we know what Wittgenstein himself would have thought of this? Did he have opinions on &#34;intellectual property&#34; regimes?Did the &#34;intellectual property&#34; regime contemporaneous with him writing encourage or discourage his output?I mean, there&#39;s some thought that Giuseppe Verdi reduced his output when copyright was introduced: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1336802"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many eons ago...Around 10 to 15 years ago...Seen a similar serialization and date processing bug with a Java based Enterprise Integration Platform used by some of the largest companies in the world.Several European Central Banks were unable to process transactions ;-). Can&#39;t provide more details, to protect the innocent. Since then, it has been a standard within the Testing group of that vendor to always have a running platform setup with a date 6 months ahead ( clock sync from a different source ). Something I added to my own Software Engineering and Testing standard practices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We shouldn&#39;t blame Microsoft for this; I once worked in the veterinary industry, and one Practice Management System allowed you to register a pet including their real or approximate birth date, or by entering an approximate age.If you entered a birth date, the software would calculate the pet&#39;s age, and we noticed we had the odd quirk, like a 400 year-old cat etc. I couldn&#39;t see an obvious pattern to the anomaly, and it didn&#39;t occur often, so I created a support ticket.After a couple of days, I received a response that &#39;dates were hard&#39; and we should correct the ages manually as needed.So there you have it: Dates are hard.(No, the bug wasn&#39;t ever fixed.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The memo from Emirates about not setting altitude in system to airport altitude is so weird. I really hope that&#39;s not the actual message Emirates is putting out there.It doesn&#39;t matter was in system. You run your checklists and configure for your own flight / your own departure etc. Memo should be to training / recruitment - where did you find these pilots to fly a 777?So they obviously didn&#39;t pre-flight the flight. And they don&#39;t seem to have used their takeoff checklist either? That should get them through flap retract and 2,000 feet or so.Takeoff checklist might have rotate at 160 or so. Then you get to positive climb and V2. You then clean up the plane (flaps / gear etc), maybe hit 2,000 feet / 210kts?This is all checklist stuff. I&#39;ve no idea what&#39;s Emirates has as checklists, but this is like 101 entry level flying stuff. What was pilot monitoring doing during all this?They still on ground at 215 kts? 262 kts at 175 feet?!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pilot (piston engine, with only around 20 hours of light jet dual). As a pax on this flight, I might not have noticed much unless I was looking out the window.This seems like a fault of the crew (obviously), but probably more on the PNF (pilot not flying) than the PF (pilot flying). Article says 4 pilots were on board, but fails to mention that 2 of them (relief pilots) were likely not in the cockpit on the departure.It’s hard for me to imagine that a qualified crew would fly such a non-standard departure with “we were following the flight director” as an excuse. There’s nothing above you to hit on departure; get away from terrain! Fly the calculated airspeeds. Where was the Vr callout?! That rotation to a pitch angle is what takes you off the runway, not the FD command bars.Once they made the mistake and corrected it, I don’t have much concern with the continuation. 262 knots indicated isn’t that big of a deal that I’d worry about shedding parts from departure flaps and leading edge devices or stressing the gear (they likely pulled the gear up well before breaking 250 KIAS anyway). I’d be more concerned with the safety of an overweight landing than continuing. (A 777 can dump fuel, but the crew that just moments ago couldn’t fly an entirely routine departure isn’t the crew that I want to be calling an audible and figuring out how to safely dump fuel at night and return for a max weight landing. How would they program the FD for that?! ;) )My prediction is that almost every pax had no idea how close to dying they came until they read about it later.I catch heat every time I mention that air crew training and certification standards are not uniform across the globe and that I am reluctant to fly on many foreign-flag carriers. (However, Emirates and most EU-flag carriers are ones that I would not hesitate to fly on.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The thing that stands out here the most is the complete lack of control that the crew had over the plane. The crew was managing the computers rather than flying the aircraft.&#34;Perhaps they are &#34;Children of the Magenta&#34;:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ESJH1NLMLs... and I cannot recommend this video enough.I am not a pilot and I have no interest in flying nor any particular interest in aviation, generally ... and I find this talk to be fascinating.EDIT:  you can jump to 3:35 where he gives a specific example of a situation where pilots need to choose between automation dependency and dropping down a level of automation.  He&#39;s a really good speaker and you can tell the audience is very engaged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;How accurate are online polls?&#34;[M]ost online polls that use participants who volunteer to take part do not have a proven record of accuracy. There are at least two reasons for this. One is that not everyone in the U.S. uses the internet, and those who do not are demographically different from the rest of the public. Another reason is that people who volunteer for polls may be different from other people in ways that could make the poll unrepresentative. At worst, online polls can be seriously biased if people who hold a particular point of view are more motivated to participate than those with a different point of view.https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/12/29/how-accurate-are-onli...Rather than serve as accurate assessments of public opinion or beliefs, online polls at best surface sentiments and potential areas of interest.  Some are mere amusements.  Many serve a darker purpose of advocating for a specific cause or ideology (a &#34;push poll&#34; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_poll), fishing for either insights on how audiences might be manipulated through advertising or propaganda, or outright soliciting personal information that is of use in hacking into accounts by guessing passwords or so-called &#34;security questions&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HTTP Basic Auth could be so much better with a little help from browsers. If it was a bit better, most websites wouldn&#39;t need to implement login pages over and over again. Plus it would be more secure since the popup is in its own security context.* Add a button to log out. Logout never really worked across browsers with basic auth.* Allow to inject a logo or a tiny bit of customization for branding. The default popup looks too ugly.* Improve the Digest auth to modern crypto standards. Stop passing plain passwords over the wire.That&#39;s it. It&#39;s not a massive amount of work and it could enable to simplify a lot of the Internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Caddy comes with basic auth support because it&#39;s still useful for a lot of use cases.IMO the biggest weakness of basicauth (when deployed over TLS) is the fact that most server configurations store the passwords in plaintext, usually in a config file. This is like storing passwords in plaintext in a database. Caddy does not allow this. You have to use a secure hash on the password before adding it to your config: https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.authentication.pro...Of course, password hashes are slow, so KDF&#39;ing a plaintext string at every HTTP request can grind even powerful servers to a halt. So Caddy can optionally cache hash results in memory (we do expect memory to be safer than a config file -- and Go is a memory-safe language in this regard). And while this can introduce nuanced timing variances (fast if recently hashed), they do not necessarily correspond to correct passwords.If you think this stuff is interesting and want to help make Caddy&#39;s basic auth even better, feel free to contribute or sponsor: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find HTTP basic auth very useful to &#34;protect&#34; gitlab, wiki, forum, et al. internal resources exposed to the internet. With a simple apache/nginx config it is possible effectively to hide those from the intenet and in addition to their built-in authentications (ldap-based) have a fense reliable enough to prevent zero-day vulnerabilities of these populular web applications. Having them as sub-folders of a single web-domain (with proper rewrites added to apache/nginx) prevents numerous HTTP basic auth requests so authentication is required just once after the browser has been restarted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a few years out of grad school, working at a tech company, and single.  I came from an academic background where talking about interesting ideas and concepts was the norm.  I had a pretty uncommon career path into tech and I&#39;m not some coder.My experience is that when you&#39;re in my position, it&#39;s getting harder and harder (with age) to find people who are interested in talking about ideas, entertaining the curiosities in life without some agenda/getting offended by the controversial ones, talking about possibilities and concepts (rather than objects).  Like having conversations on advanced mode with people who are similar.Often times at parties, when I get bored, I think of a quote, &#34;Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events/things. Small minds discuss wine.&#34;It&#39;s getting more and more common that I find people just wanting to talk about wine.  Or the equivalent.  Stuff that&#39;s completely forgettable after you leave the party.  I mean that stuff is fine, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with talking about good food you&#39;ve had, some articles you&#39;ve read, movies seen, etc. too.   And to be funny and engaging while talking about it.  It just feels like... after you&#39;re done talking about that, what then?Or if I do meet people who are intellectually interesting, how to get more connected or where to take it after a chance meeting and pleasant chat?That said, what do I have to offer at this stage of my life either, to a stranger?  I&#39;m unmarried, so I don&#39;t have kids or the mortgage to talk about.  I&#39;m not a CEO or someone powerful.  Also I&#39;m single -- what are people supposed do with that?   Don&#39;t have a lot of great reasons for anyone to want to go out of their way to spend more time with me after even an interesting 30 min conversation, without some other excuse.We&#39;re not all living close together in shared housing to make intellectually stimulating conversations natural and prolonged.  People have their lives to lead, not sit around talking about theoretical ideas.  To contact the few people I&#39;ve found who are interesting would be... how?  &#34;Would you like to schedule a get-together again for a conversation date?&#34;It&#39;s not going to get easier either.   Probably in a few years I&#39;ll be the really odd guy.  Eh, it&#39;s a life choice I&#39;ve made, I realize that too -- to be more interested in ideas and experiences than say... people.I figure I&#39;d better find some interesting hobbies to make up for the lack of intellectual stimulation.   But deeper, what am I working towards?  For whom?  So, sometimes I think of changing jobs just to see more of the world and gather experiences to be able to have more intellectually stimulating conversations.  Learn about VC?  Hear about more companies?  Where/how?Yeah, it&#39;s a bit of a problem sometimes to ponder."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I took a ten year break from reading books. Instead I programmed, read blog posts, followed the news, and had a few good talks with friends here and there.When I started reading again my world caught on fire. A good book is vastly, unimaginably better than doom scrolling, and the wealth of ideas and history and inspiration that starts to accumulate as you read more is life changing. For example, I learned how to properly build habits, how my childhood in a cult came about and what other people who left have done to come to terms with it, and endless interesting facts about lifelong hobbies and interests. Reading is great."</p>

But some people I know have the skill of finding a subject of conversation with practically everyone they meet at a party. One of them has literally talked to British Royalty, yet seemed to have no difficulty holding a conversation with a man with limited education, some substance abuse issues, and assorted other difficulties in life.It seems to me that this is a valuable skill to aspire to. And if at first glance nobody at the party seems to have anything in common with you — maybe that&#39;s all the more of an opportunity to hear about views and experiences outside one&#39;s usual circles?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key points:&#34;Thus Beijing prefers that the best talent in the country work in manufacturing sectors rather than consumer internet and finance. Personally, I think it has been a tragedy for the US that so many physics PhDs have gone to work in hedge funds and Silicon Valley.&#34;&#34;The US focus on efficiency has revealed the brittleness of its economy, which has neither the manufacturing capability to scale up domestic production of goods nor the logistics capacity to handle greater imports. Decades of American deindustrialization as well as an aversion against idle capacity has eroded domestic manufacturing.&#34;&#34;In the face of this challenge against a new peer competitor, the US has demonstrated a superb capacity for self-harm.&#34;&#34;For someone in the middle class, there has never been a better year to live in China. That comes down to the entrepreneurs, who are creating businesses to please people.&#34;All, absolutely true as I&#39;ve commented previously in other posts. The decline of America is primarily a story about misallocation of talent and the demise of the American middle class as a result."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Manhattan meets MauiI think that is a stretch beyond snapping point for Hong Kong. Most days in Hong Kong I could see the air pollution obscuring buildings in the distance. It&#39;s AQI is terrible https://aqicn.org/city/hongkong/ . There are nice mountain walks and nearby islands but it is extremely dense and urban. It&#39;s one of the places Ghost in the Shell used for reference!Also the narrative here feels mostly from the mainland China point of view; having to go and deal with &#34;problematic&#34; Hong Kong. But problems between Hong Kong and the mainland began when Beijing used its influence to restrict Hong Kong&#39;s traditional democracy, so only &#34;approved&#34; candidates could be voted into office. And since then it&#39;s increasingly clamped down on the freedoms Hong Kong previously enjoyed, most recently doing things such as removing the Tiananmen Square memorials (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-59764029). At this point the writing is on the wall and bit by bit Hong Kong will brought in step with the rest of mainland China.Unlike the author I found the Hong Kong bureaucracy fast and effective. Enforcers &#34;sometimes able to look the other way&#34; sounds like corruption to me and people with better guanxi being able to bend the rules. I&#39;d rather have the laws fair, clear and applied to all equally (though that&#39;s always going to be a gradient).Despite all that, it&#39;s undeniable China is on the rise and that&#39;s going to be the dominant story of this century. There&#39;s potential for that to be a great boon to the world and I hope that&#39;s the reality that comes to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a mechanical engineer - smartbolts are cool but rarely used in my experience. Much more commonly used are DTI washers: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_tension_indicatorDue to the washer style can be used with a wide range of fasteners. The most common type, in my experience, due to the ease of use, has a little bit of colored goo inside the arched cells. The goo squirts out when the specified torque is reached.That being said, there are a lot of approaches to this same problem. Another common technique is breakaway bolts that are driven with a piece that snaps away when a certain torque is reached: https://youtu.be/lrCoi3gaLfU"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At Boeing, I learned that bolts should be lubricated before torquing them in order to ensure an accurate torque. I initially thought wouldn&#39;t the lubrication allow the bolt to unwind itself? Surprisingly, no.Since then, on my car, I always put a bit of grease on a bolt beforehand. It keeps the water out, preventing the bolt from rusting itself together. It makes for an accurate torque. I&#39;ve never had one unscrew itself, and I can always get the lug nuts off!Of course, you still need to use lock washers. For critical bolts, use a cotter pin or a safety wire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the UK (and elsewhere?) Lorry tyres have plastic caps on the bolts, with arrows aligned to each other in pairs, or some regular pattern.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary: the tests were conducted on guinea pigs because they can develop immune reactions to repeated tick bites like humans do. Mice do not seem to be suited for that for once.The vaccine was administered intradermally. It consists of nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles like we know them from Covid vaccines already. The contained mRNA sequences encode 19 different proteins that are usually found in the saliva of a particular kind of tick in the US. These proteins were selected because of prior research it was known that they seemed to cause inflammatory reactions in the host. The inflammatory reaction that occured at the site of the tick bite hampered feeding of the ticks and reduced risk of disease transmission. The vaccine mostly seems to buy more time to remove the ticks before an infection can take place because the disease causing bacteria was not directly targeted by the vaccine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, there was a Lyme vaccine in the late 90s that was pulled from the market:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870557/I think it’s a shame it was withdrawn, with a low effectiveness of 80% and even requiring annual boosters I’d view that as a great option if I lived somewhere with deer ticks.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An aside:&gt; L3 cache is shared by all cores of a CPU.I recently learned this is no longer true! AMD EPYC processors (and maybe other recent AMDs?) divide cores into groups called &#34;core complexes&#34; (CCX), each of which has a separate L3 cache. My particular processor is 32-core where each set of 4 cores is a CCX. I discovered this when trying to figure out why a benchmark was performing wildly differently from one run to the next with a bimodal distribution -- it turned out to depend on whether Linux has scheduled the two processes in my benchmark to run on the same CCX vs. different CCXs.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epyc shows the &#34;core config&#34; of each model, which is (number of CCX) x (cores per CCX)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The culprit was a shared atomic reference counter (Arc). The cache invalidation across cores eliminated any kind of scaling via multiple threads.The solution is to stop sharing.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The notion of &#34;lock-free&#34; is fundamentally misleading.It trips up everybody who hopes &#34;lock-free&#34; will be a magic bullet freeing them from resource contention bottlenecks.When you have explicit locks, aka mutexes (condition variables, semaphores, what-have-you), the interaction between your threads is visible on the surface. Replacing that with &#34;lock-free&#34; interaction, you have essentially the same set of operations as when taking a mutex. On the up side, overhead cost may be lower. On the down side, mistakes show up as subtly wrong results instead of deadlocks. And, you get less control, so when you have a problem, it is at best harder to see why, and harder to fix.Because the lock-free operations involve similar hardware bus interactions under the covers, they cannot fix contention problems. You have no choice but to fix contention problems at a higher, architectural design level, by reducing actual contention. Having solved the problems there, the extra cost of explicit mutex operations often does not matter, and the extra control you get may be worth any extra cost.What is lock-free good for, then? Lock-free components reduce overhead when there is no contention. Given any actual contention, performance is abandoned in favor of correctness. So, if you have mutexes and performance is good, moving to lock-free operations might make performance a little better. If performance is bad, mutexes and lock-free operations will be about equally as bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an egregiously editorialized headline, but this was the easiest way to submit two separate links to LKML in one HN submission --- link to Fillipo&#39;s tweet about those links.The @zx2c4 Filippo is referring to is Jason Donenfeld, of WireGuard fame. It was news to me that he&#39;d taken over the Linux kernel random driver! But it&#39;s welcome news indeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The popularity of the Blake family annoys me, as I feel that it&#39;s overhyped. Sure, they&#39;re fast (on current hardware), but they&#39;re supposed to be cryptographic hash functions. I know that BLAKE received some scrutiny in this regard, as part of the SHA3 competition. But then BLAKE was obsoleted by BLAKE2, which in turn was obsoleted by BLAKE3, making the claims to security less and less sensible.And all this is before the actual winner of SHA3 comes into the picture. With parameters as specified by SHA3 it&#39;s a lot slower than BLAKE3, but it is my understanding (IANAC) that(1) The SHA3 security margin can safely be decreased, as NIST set the security requirements too high. This is one of the reasons for the speed difference.(2) The sponge-based crypto popularized by Keccak (the SHA3 winner) is much more amenable to cryptanalysis than the more traditional crypto such as the functions in the Blake family. This means that Blake&#39;s security would be less sure even had it received the same level of scrutiny. But AFAIK Blake received much less scrutiny than Keccak, or even other sponge-based functions, such as the ones in the NIST Lightweight Crypto competition.https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/lightweight-cryptographyhttps://keccak.team/2017/not_arx.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note for those who only read the headline: the 3x speedup was achieved by removing a call to RDRAND in the extraction path, not the change in hash function."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Three independent, but somewhat related thoughts on this topic:1). On HOWTO articles about infra (1/2): I&#39;d like to see more articles that lead with requirements, rather than setups that then justify the setup with requirements. Like, congrats, you managed to host a bunch of web applications via containers on a dedicated server. It&#39;s really nice for a super personal project and I&#39;m sure it helped OP gain a lot of operational experience across several domains, but I just find this type of article to be &#34;DYI porn&#34; for a highly specific subset of DYI.2). On HOWTO articles about infra (2/2): Is there any sort of comprehensive infra setup guide out there? Even something that just covers &#34;core&#34; AWS services (CloudFront, EC2, ELB, ECS, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and a few others...) feels like it would be incredibly useful for so many people.3). &#34;AWS on Rails&#34; - I feel like we&#39;re getting close to a time when &#34;AWS on Rails&#34; emerges and we see the birth of a new opinionated tool that says &#34;Most people just want to ship their product, not fiddle with cloud infra. Do it our way and you can focus on product instead of infra&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I (my company) use a similar approach: a single dedicated server with docker containers, by using dokku [0], for an heroku-like self-hosted PaaS.Most of our applications are either:- app developped in-house (django/flask): Procfile + deploy with git push- standard app with a docker image available: deploy directlyDokku comes with useful &#34;service&#34; plugins for databases, auto https (letsencrypt), virtual hosts...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like there is wisdom in &#34;Make hay while the sun shines.&#34; When you&#39;re young and unencumbered by responsibility and family, when your cognitive abilities are at their peak, when your energy is endless, when your body is strong and healthy, when your knees work, and your fingers can type without arthritis: that&#39;s the optimal time to work and earn. Min-max that salary and stay healthy. Due to compounding interest, a dollar made in your 20&#39;s is far, far more valuable than a dollar made in your 60&#39;s. Every morsel you make and save early means your retirement comes earlier. There will never be a more efficient time to earn those days of leisure that will come later if you stay healthy.Take that vacation to Bali when you&#39;re young, and you are wasting your prime, strongest days that could be making you financially secure and/or independent. Go windsurfing for a year in Ibiza after college, and you&#39;re adding 5 years to your working life--retiring at 62 instead of 57. It didn&#39;t sound like much time when I was young, but today, as I turn elderly, I&#39;m counting down the years until I can finally retire, and kicking myself for goofing around when I was younger. If I could do it all again, I&#39;d have tried harder to get into big tech early, I&#39;d have taken comp and 401(k)s and advancement more seriously. I&#39;d have played fewer video games, traveled less, and relaxed on the beach less.Life isn&#39;t short--it&#39;s LONG, and you have a brief moment in that life to maximize your preparation for the rest of it. Use it wisely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pithy, but true.It&#39;s only half the story, though. Moderation and balance are the real key. Overwork is not good in the long term. But underwork can also be a problem, even when employers let it slide.Starting in my 30s, my friends who operated in the extremes of overwork or underwork started to diverge from everyone else. Overworked people were burnt out and had few friends and social connections left. Underworking people were often first to be laid off and slowly fell behind in their skills relative to everyone they were competing against for jobs.Most of them found balance and got back on track, but I know a few holdouts who went all-in on the vagabond life of traveling the world and having fun, as well as a few who have just disappeared into their work and have basically lost social skills at this point.Balance and moderation aren&#39;t really that difficult when you make them a priority. Especially in this job market where employers aren&#39;t squeezing employees as hard because everyone has so many alternate opportunities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of one of my favorite poems (which expressed a similar idea far more eloquently imo)Telephone Booth (number 905 1/2)
BY PEDRO PIETRI
woke up this morning
feeling excellent,
picked up the telephone
dialed the number of
my equal opportunity employer
to inform him I will not
be into work today
Are you feeling sick?
the boss asked me
No Sir I replied:
I am feeling too good
to report to work today,
if I feel sick tomorrow
I will come in early"</p>

I&#39;m sure, at this point, someone already explained them.That reporter is a victim of harassment, and that if it wasn&#39;t for &#34;view source&#34;, it could be for some unrelated stuff.

The goal is to deter someone you don&#39;t like from exercising their legal right (journalism, protesting, standing in the street in the wrong neighbourhood), by weaponizing unrelated laws.The only reason &#34;view source&#34; is being talked about is because that looked like the best case when the book was thrown at that journalist.I hope that case remains at threats and doesn&#39;t get to actual charges."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really tried to like macOS for an entire year. I used Yabai[1] as tilling window manager which is much better than Amethyst mentioned in the article. I also wrote my own compose key tool macos-compose[2] and rofi-like clone choosem[3] (eventually bought into Alfred).Yet with all of this effort I still went back to linux after a year (Arch with Qtile and Gnome). What really killed macos for me was the fact that animations could not be disabled entirely and everything felt like it&#39;s behind several ms of a delay. I work on the move so I don&#39;t have the luxury of multi-screen setup so switching between programs, workspaces and windows is the most important part of my workflow - it just drove me nuts.Now I run simple Lenovo yoga laptop with arch+qtile+gnome and honestly, my performance at work at least doubled. That&#39;s my anecdote anyway.1 - https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai2 - https://github.com/Granitosaurus/macos-compose3 - https://github.com/Granitosaurus/choosem"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did the exact opposite. I was on MacOS since 10.2.But lately I felt things have become way too locked down (both hardware and software), too dumbed down (too many apps resemble mobile apps with limited functionality) and too opinionated. Sometimes I just want things differently. Another reason was that many new features are specific to iCloud integration and as I use many OSes (both computer and mobile) I could not take advantage of those anyway. I need cross platform. So a lot of selling points became irrelevant.I moved to FreeBSD with KDE on top and it felt like a breath of fresh air finally being able to set up my system the way I want it. This is so empowering.It became my daily driver about a year ago and I haven&#39;t looked back though I still use Mac and Windows for work, Windows personally for gaming and Linux for some servers.Of course I lost some stuff too like Apple&#39;s excellent multi DPI and great hardware integration. And many apps that were great like pixelmator. But I gained a lot of configurability and the ability to upgrade my hardware again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me Linux is about freedom. Other systems might be better in UI/UX or performance (e.g. give more FPS in games for NVidia cards), but I remember the times when Microsoft dominated the IT world and it looked scary.All corporations strive to fragment the market using non-compatible technologies and then to monopolize the market by consuming other fragments.This strategy failed in the 90s with the arrival of Linux. Although many times I felt like the whole world will become Microsoft/Wintel, I think we barely missed.Now, corporations are trying to do it e.g. via forcing everybody into the cloud and killing open protocols. E.g. I have several email accounts and I can&#39;t gather mail from all of my mailboxes in one application. Situation is even worse with Calendars. I have two jobs and also my own personal calendar server and I can&#39;t collect all my calendars in one app also. I have to routinely check Google Calendar, because even though I can add it to my Thunderbird Calendar, moved or canceled events changes are not propagating to Thunderbird. And I can&#39;t integrate Microsoft Outlook calendar into my Thunderbird at all.I really don&#39;t want to rely on whims of one corporation. Also, regarding MacBooks: I remember when the touchbar had no alternatives and it is really awful. This is what monopoly means: you have to live with bad decisions. You have to pay absurd money for a piece of cloth or a roller for the desktop case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite part of the Nintendo story is that back when it was a playing card company, the heir to the family business took a trip to America that included a meeting at the largest card company in the world.He had expected it to have a luxurious, palatial campus… but its entire headquarters turned out to be like the fourth floor of a single building in a generic office park. He was like, “This is the absolute pinnacle I can ever hope for if I succeed beyond my wildest dreams running the playing-card company. I need a new idea.”You can read all about it in an outstanding book called I Am Error that, beyond extensive interviews with the historic key players, also takes an incredibly deep dive into the technical details."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Netflix had considered offering movies online, but there were speeds and bandwidth problem in mid-2000.One of the more interesting things I learned from the (outstanding) documentary &#34;Enron - The Smartest Guys in The Room&#34; [0] was that Enron planned an online movie streaming service together with Blockbuster in the late 90ies (to start in 2000), but failed for the same reasons.&gt; Enron would store the entertainment and encode and stream the entertainment
over its global broadband network. Pilot projects in Portland, Seattle and Salt Lake
City were created to stream movies to a few dozen apartments from servers set up
in the basement. Based on these pilot projects, Enron went ahead and recognized
estimated profits of more than $110 million from the Blockbuster deal, even
though there were serious questions about technical viability and market demand [1]But of course Enron &#34;pivoted&#34; to outright fraud some years before that.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDyMz1V-GSg[1] https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0895330037658884..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a few of these that don’t really feel like pivots to me. For example Netflix changing from delivering things via DVD to doing it by streaming just feels like evolving to suit the market. Would we consider a publisher as pivoting because they now sell ebooks and run news websites instead of printing books and magazines?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some previous discussion on SciterJS here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24797423The issue is that this isn&#39;t actually an Electron alternative; the author is upfront about this not actually being a browser-compatible rendering engine. It&#39;s just a rendering engine that happens to use some subset / superset of HTML, JS and CSS, but it is not compatible with web libraries and components.As a basic example, SciterJS crashes loading the &#34;hello world&#34; ReactJS project (at least it did last time I tried it - the author recommended I used a custom version of React he publishes). It&#39;s perfectly fine to come up with a lightweight cross-platform UI rendering engine (we know we need more of those), but having it web-adjancent while not really web-compatible is a recipe for frustration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see, in this thread, talks about what Sciter does and does not offer.It&#39;s not the only alternative to Electron, but it might be one that offers predictable and repeatable results.I released a small open source project on HN last week (https://github.com/Fusion/pngsource) and I wrote its backend logic in Go. I built the frontend using Tailwind (https://tailwindcss.com) and DaisyUI (https://daisyui.com) and, using Go compiler flags, I can release the app using both WebView (github.com/webview/webview) (which, yes, does require the host OS&#39; collaboration) and Wails (wails.app) (which also does.)On Linux/AMD64, the binary&#39;s size is 3.7M when building for WebView, and 6.8M when targeting Wails.The way the app works is I drag/drop files to the UI, magic happens, and I use github.com/ncruces/zenity to prompt the user for a save location.I cross-compile the apps using xgo (https://github.com/karalabe/xgo)It&#39;s been working pretty well on Linux, Windows, MacOS. I think WebView&#39;s approach of limiting the feature set is working well as it feels more &#34;native&#34; than Wails (better refreshes and resize operations for instance)However, I already have a few tickets reporting that, for instance, the app is displayed as a blank window in some environments. And it&#39;s hard to debug remotely, obviously. So, this is where Sciter may be a better option."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While depression can certainly be caused by chemical imbalance and not because of how your unconscious mind impacts/limits your experience of life, I took the approach that exploring my subconscious through therapy was the way to get out.For me it worked very well and I think the journey is an amazing one to go on. Building from the ground up and understanding all the foundations within. I always wonder about treatments which don&#39;t have this benefit, although the results in terms of lifestyle change sound extremely positive.One of the hardest parts of therapy is diagnosis of what to work on. Even though an issue will be &#34;presenting&#34; itself clearly, it can often be a bit of a decoy. For example, a lack of self-esteem is often a useful derivative of an unconscious fear of upsetting others. Low self-esteem =&gt; avoid situations/behaviours that upset others.During therapy I found dreams, when analysed outside of the &#34;conventional&#34; Freudian/Jungian frameworks provided a simple and accurate method of reaching the root diagnosis (the fear of upsetting others vs. the decoy issue of low self-esteem).I got a bit obsessed by the topic and wrote a paper on it which can be downloaded here: https://psyarxiv.com/k6trzAnd was discussed on HN here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19143590"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“I don’t procrastinate anymore,” he added. “I’m sleeping better. I completely quit alcohol. I’m walking my dog and playing the guitar again, for nothing more than the sheer joy of it.”  Most importantly, he said, “I’m remaining positive and being respectful of others. These are big changes in my life.”Serious question: are these typical signs of depression?  Now I&#39;m wondering if I have depression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “The treatment, known as Stanford accelerated intelligent neuromodulation therapy (SAINT) or simply Stanford neuromodulation therapy, is an intensive, individualized form of transcranial magnetic stimulation. In the study, remission typically occurred within days and lasted months. The only side effects were temporary fatigue and headaches.”&gt; “Twenty-nine people with treatment-resistant depression participated in the study: About half received SAINT, and the rest underwent a placebo procedure that mimicked the real treatment. After five days of treatment, 78.6% of the participants in the treatment group were no longer depressed, according to several standard methods of evaluation. “It’s quite a dramatic effect, and it’s quite sustained,” said Alan Schatzberg, MD, the Kenneth T. Norris, Jr. Professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, who was a co-author of the study.”Makes me wonder what percentage of the placebo group improved?&gt; The transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration requires six weeks of once-daily sessions. Only about half of patients who undergo the treatment improve, and only about a third experience remission from depression."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a long, thoughtful read. I really enjoyed it and mostly see things as the author does.&gt; So it is with free software. You literally cannot pay for it. If you do, it becomes something else.This is really the crux. Everyone is mad there’s no money in writing free/os software, but if there was money it wouldn’t be free/os software. It would just be like what we do at our day jobs.You can write the code someone else wants and get paid for it (aka a day job). You also have the option to write the code YOU want to write, but in this case you’ll need to figure out a plan for making money on your own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I read a book once which argued that the problem with modern political discourse is it pits the &#34;I don&#39;t want things taken from me&#34; (liberty!) people against the &#34;XYZ is a human right&#34; (entitlement!) people. And that a better way to frame the cultural argument is &#34;XYZ is my responsibility to society.&#34;I don’t know if it’s the book he’s talking about, but Simone Weil makes this argument in the beginning of The Need for Roots[+]—that the correct way to think about our relationship to society isn’t “rights” (someone else’s problem) but obligations (our problem).[+] https://antilogicalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/need-r..."</p>

Why is the responsibility for changing the package anyone but theirs, the people using it; now that they&#39;re decided they have stricter requirements for that need?Even the entertainment industry&#39;s notion of &#34;ownership&#34; isn&#39;t so endless.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Those of us who have been shooting large digital cameras for the past decade and are some times sad that our photos often come out unsharp in poor light compared to smartphones can at least take some joy in this “no free lunch” demonstration.If this is due to stabilization and not some background blur face detection then it’s probably not something you can (or would want to) disable. Taking a telephoto shot with a tiny sensor in something other than great light (even a heavy overcast is often not enough) will require a lot of software processing. I’m
not sure exactly what happened here but I’m pretty sure everyone asking for “unmodified raw photos” to be produced don’t understand what they are asking for. Those “unmodified” photos would be unusable in most cases outside very bright conditions."</p>

Like ML tried to “enhance” mountains or the back of an alligator or some other structure from nature on to the cassette.This has to be a problem in all sorts of technical trouble-shooting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my 1980s version of Empire, all the global variables were kept contiguously in one source file. To save/restore the game, it just took the address of the first one, the address of the last one, and blitted it to a disk file, and blitted it back.Very fast &amp; easy.Of course, it broke when COMDATs were introduced.I did a similar thing with my text editor. The colors were configurable. The usual way was to have a configuration file, which the editor would read upon startup. But floppy disk systems were unbearably slow. So what I did was take the address of the configuration data in the data segment. I&#39;d work backwards to where those bytes were in the EXE file, and patch the EXE file. This worked great!Until the advent of virus scanners, which broke that. Virus scanners hated self-modifying EXE files."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of the old days working in Windows 3.1 and my first professional project was to write a SOCKS client that could be loaded up and intercept all calls to Winsock&#39;s connect() function.  It needed to do this without modifying the other programs and it had to happen at the DLL level and not the VxD layer where our IP stack ran.Turns out there was an undocumented Windows API function along the lines of &#34;AliasCsToDsRegister&#34; or something like that - I&#39;ve tried to find a reference to it but I can&#39;t find it.  It allowed me write into the code segment (the CS was global and read only - as it was shared among all processes)  and replace the first few bytes of the connect function call with a jump to my code which would then put it back, make the call to the socks server, do some other magic, put my jump hook back in and the return to the caller.  Good times!Kind of surprised I remember this and more so that it actually worked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember doing exactly this to get code injection working on GNU/Linux systems!  I made a library injection library in college for some coursework, which involved copying a C function into a code cave on a remote process and getting the remote process to execute it and return.  It only works because its so bare-bones, it doesn&#39;t use try/catch and calls to other functions are possible because the function pointers are passed in through the registers and the compiled code is small enough to fit in a single page.An example function I memcpy and run:https://github.com/skimmilk/liblibinject/blob/master/src/lib..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve been using SQLite in production as our exclusive means for getting bytes to/from disk for going on 6 years now. To this day, not one production incident can be attributed to our choice of database or how we use it.We aren&#39;t using SQLite exactly as intended either. We have databases in the 100-1000 gigabyte range that are concurrently utilized by potentially hundreds or thousands of simultaneous users. Performance is hardly a concern when you have reasonable hardware (NVMe/SSD) and utilize appropriate configuration (PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL).In our testing, our usage of SQLite vastly outperformed an identical schema on top of SQL Server. It is my understanding that something about not having to take a network hop and being able to directly invoke the database methods makes a huge difference. Are you able to execute queries and reliably receive results within microseconds with your current database setup?Sure, there is no way we are going to be able to distribute/cluster our product by way of our database provider alone, but this is a constraint we decided was worth it, especially considering all of the other reduction in complexity you get with single machine business systems. I am aware of things like DQLite/RQLite/et.al., but we simply don&#39;t have a business case that demands that level of resilience (and complexity) yet.Some other tricks we employ - We do not use 1 gigantic SQLite database for the entire product. It&#39;s more like a collection of microservices that live inside 1 executable with each owning an independent SQLite database copy. So, we would have databases like Users.db, UserSessions.db, Settings.db, etc. We don&#39;t have any use cases that would require us to write some complex reporting query across multiple databases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe SQLite is about to explode in usage into areas it’s not been used before.SQL.js[0] and the incredible “Absurd SQL”[1] are making it possible to build PWAs and hybrid mobile apps with a local SQL db. Absurd SQL uses IndexedDB as a block store fs for SQLite so you don’t have to load the whole db into memory and get atomic writes.Also I recently discovered the Session Extension[2] which would potentially enable offline distributed updates with eventual consistency!I can imagine building a SAAS app where each customer has a “workspace” each as a single SQLite db, and a hybrid/PWA app which either uses a local copy of the SQLite db synced with the session extension or uses a serveless backend (like CloudFlare workers) where a lightweight function performs the db operations. I haven’t yet found a nice way to run SQLite on CloudFlare workers, it need some sort of block storage, but it can’t be far off.0: https://sql.js.org/1: https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql2: https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always thought it interesting that there was a time when large(ish) websites were hosted using servers that would struggle to outperform a modern smart toaster or wristwatch, and yet modern web applications tend to demand a dramatic distributed architecture. I like the examples in this article showing what a single modern server can do when you&#39;re not scaling to Google&#39;s level.As an aside, what about distributed derivatives of sqlite, like rqlite, as a response to the criticism that sqlite requires your database server to also be your web server. Could something like rqlite also provide a way for an sqlite database to grow into a distributed cluster at a later point?https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Computer language inventors are torn between a voice whispering “use the language Luke” and and a more gravelly “let your feelings for the compiler grow, embrace the syntax side.”I did a two-day sprint through Zig a month ago and really really liked it. It has some quirks that I would have done differently, but overall I think it’s pretty cool. I just need a good small scale project to try it out on now.My favorite example of the “use the language” ethos is the way Zig does generics. I have hated generics/templates in every language I use them in. They are the gordian knot of confusion that most languages in pursuit of some sort of unified type theory impale themselves on (yes, I’m mashing metaphors here). But Zig just uses its own self to define user types and generics come along for free. It resonates (with me at least) as a realization of what Gilda Bracha has shared about how to reify generics.[1] https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2018/10/reified-generics-search..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Initializing arrays is weird in Zig. Lets say you want to have a 0 initialized array, you declare it like [_]u8{0} * 4 which means I want an array, of type u8, that is initialized to 0 and is 4 elements long. You get used to the syntax, but it’s not intuitive.Alternatively:  var some_array = std.mem.zeroes([4]u8);

Though as mentioned later in the article the standard library documentation is not very good, making this not as obvious as it could be.&gt; Everything in Zig is const x = blah;, so why are functions not const bar = function() {};?Good question, there&#39;s an accepted proposal to fix this: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1717&gt; The builtin compiler macros (that start with @) are a bit confusing. Some of them have a leading uppercase, others a lowercase, and I never did work out any pattern to them.In idiomatic zig, anything that returns a type is uppercased as though it were itself a type. Since only a few builtins return types, the vast majority of builtins will start with a lowercase letter. I think it is only `@Type`, `@TypeOf`, `@This`, and `@Frame` that don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also did AoC 2021 in Zig: https://github.com/avorobey/adventofcode-2021One thing the OP didn&#39;t mention that I really liked was runtime checks on array/slice access and integer under/overflow. Because dealing with heap allocation is a bit of a hassle, I was incentivized to use static buffers a lot. I quickly figured out that I didn&#39;t have to worry about their sizes much, because if they&#39;re overrun by the unexpectedly large input or other behavior in my algorithms, I get a nice runtime error with the right line indicated, rather than corrupt memory or a crash. Same thing about choosing which integer type to use: it&#39;s not a problem if I made the wrong choice, I&#39;ll get a nice error message and fix easily. This made for a lot of peace of mind during coding. Obviously in a real production system I&#39;d be more careful and use dynamic sizes appropriately, but for one-off programs like these it was excellent.Overall, I really enjoyed using Zig while starting out at AoC problem 1 with zero knowledge of the language. To my mind, it&#39;s &#34;C with as much convenience as could be wrung out of it w/o betraying the low-level core behavior&#34;. That is, no code execution hidden behind constructors or overloads, no garbage collection, straight imperative code, but with so much done right (type system, generics, errors, optionals, slices) that it feels much more pleasant and uncomparably safer than C.(you can still get a segmentation fault, and I did a few times - by erroneously holding on to pointers inside a container while it resized. Still, uncomparably safer)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a neat idea - and not without precedent.Installing each package into it&#39;s own directory, and maintaining symlinks into that directory structure, was an approach explored for large system installations in the 90s and 00s.NIST depot, Xheir, CMU, and Nix all did this in varying ways. The advantage of this approach was that packages could be installed once on an NFS, scoped by version/configuration, and mounted into the filesystem of every work station on a campus. The workstations then just needed to maintain references to the files on the NFS for their particular software configurations. There is also some interesting exploration of composable configuration templates that allow workstations to inherit and extend a particular configuration (i.e. the physics department might have a base template).Nix is easily the most successful in this space. It even uses something similar to the NFS approach! It can maintain a remote cache of observed configurations to pull from instead of redoing work.Reading these LISA papers is a lot of fun. If you work in system administration (i.e. maintaining an Artifactory instance for your company) and have a day to spare - I&#39;d very much recommend reading them, starting with the Nix paper!To get you started:Nix - https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa-04/nix-safe-and-polic...Depot Lite - https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa-viii/depot-lite-mecha..."</p>

Historical, for the most part, and irrelevant in the age of rescue systems.One question that is nagging at my mind with this: What if two programs require the same lib, how is this resolved?Because, when I install progA, the lib is symlinked into the index, so when I now install progB, the lib is installed again if I understood correctly. Storage is irrelevant, the pkg manager sees there is a symlink, so it stays in place, all is well.But now I remove progA, so what happens? progB is still present, still requires the lib, it is also still installed, but now the symlink, which refered to /Programs/progA/libs/thelib.so is broken. How is this situation handled?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s the problem with non-deterministic conversations: everyone has an opinion (fair enough), and is willing to state it with the authority of a highly experienced subject matter expert.In deterministic conversations, a naive opinion stated with a lot of authority would be shut down quite quickly (eg: many areas in programming where you can quickly prove something to be right or wrong). You can&#39;t do that in politics, business, and many other areas. As a result, we have about 8 billion politicians and business experts.The author is making the assumption that listing a salary is connected to being a progressive business. A bunch of other people take this a step further and state how not listing the salary is a part of some conspiracy (in YC&#39;s case, apparently this is an attempt to lower the payroll costs of their portfolio companies).The reality is that even the most transparent companies out there (eg: Gitlab) do not disclose individual salaries. No, it has nothing to do with some secret plan to underpay anyone or certain groups. It&#39;s simply a fact that people become incredibly irrational when it comes to compensation, and the minute you lay it out in the open, you open up a huge surface area for conflict. Last year we learned that encouraging political activism at work has a similar dynamic, and many companies have made that a no go zone as well. It&#39;s not because they are racist or don&#39;t care - it&#39;s because it takes a tiny minority of people to get the entire business derailed, and it&#39;s hard enough to keep that from happening in the best of times; once you add a catalyst like salaries or politics, it&#39;s like adding fuel to the fire.But rather than ask ourselves why the leaders at Gitlab and millions of others companies have made the decisions they did, it&#39;s a lot easier to just make assumptions - &#34;it must be coming from a bad place, so let me brainstorm what some of those bad places could be.&#34;I&#39;ll take it a step further - Colorado State Senator Jessie Danielson would make you believe it&#39;s more likely that millions of companies are &#34;bad actors&#34; than that she just doesn&#39;t have the relevant experience in business to predict which way her bill was going to work out. Now that she&#39;s cost so many of her constituents lucrative remote jobs, it&#39;s too late to admit Mea Culpa, and instead it&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault. If she was held a bit more accountable, the next time someone tries to bridge the gender pay gap they will hopefully spend some time interviewing and learning from people who have the relevant experience in hiring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It really still isn&#39;t the norm anywhere to list compensation and I suspect that Y Combinator has the same problems of disparate compensation based on when people joined as any other company. Heck, we are all switching jobs constantly because the new guy got more than we did, despite being the same level and having more experience at the company.Plenty of companies decided to stop hiring from Colorado rather than post compensation in the job postings.If I had to guess, I suspect it provides no competitive advantage to list compensation except if you pay top tier.As an anecdote from a friend, the wage differences can be substantial. The friend just recently got a new job and the senior who mentored him in onboarding also got promoted a level too. That senior was talking about how they finally reached six figures (Canada has much lower pay than the USA, so this isn&#39;t crazy). My friend made six figures starting, with 3-5 fewer years of experience and just about two years overall.There are a lot of absurdly underpaid people out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to start a trend a few months ago on the month Who&#39;s hiring posts to get posters to put the compensation.  I automatically upvote any post with compensation, but few have it.I even posted about it once and got a ton of upvotes but then the mods buried my post.I would love to see more job posts with compensation in fairness to people who aren&#39;t good at negotiating, but it just isn&#39;t the norm these days."</p>

Currently it defaults to 64 bits on most architectures. Although it defaults to 32 bits on some traditional architectures (i686, ARM), this is planned to change and applications should not rely on this.So it sounds like glibc plans to change the default, just like musl has done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fact checking has been laughable from the beginning.  It is inherently biased.  The heavy political leanings of those in direct control of the organizations&#39; verdicts are brought up time and time again, and even memes are being made about sites like Snopes.  My favorite meme goes something like:Did x member of y political organization get arrested for hitting some in the head with a baseball bat?FALSE.[big block of text]X member of y political organization was arrested for hitting someone in the head with a cricket bat.[big block of text]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what many here and the writers of the article are missing is that you can both be truthful and misleading. These are not mutually exclusive. Let&#39;s start with the title: &#34;The Study That Convinced the CDC To Support Mask Mandates in Schools Is Junk Science&#34;. If you just read this (titles are very important and most people only read these) what will you take away? What the authors are trying to say is that this one study has problems.But reading further in the article they rise doubt about masks in general, which is something we know is highly effective (purely from a physics point of view). They don&#39;t say masking is effective, they continually question if it is. This is really problematic. The study being wrong doesn&#39;t question _if_ masking is effective, but _how_ effective. There&#39;s a major difference in these statements and they can have readers, who are not experts and don&#39;t know scientific vernacular, to doubt and distrust more science than the article _technically_ draws into question. The article is suggesting that this is the norm and because this study is bad we get to question all the others.So the problem here really is that while yes, the article only questions the one study they do so in a way that questions more fundamental knowledge that we have. Masking works. How much? Harder to say. There&#39;s a few old sayings such as &#34;the devil never tells a full lie&#34; or &#34;the devil sows doubt&#34; (often with truth). These are the errors that the authors are making here.I would conclude that they aren&#39;t inaccurate, but are misleading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh. Comments in this thread are predictably polarized.I personally think that fact checking is potentially damaging to society but so is the ability of social media to spread misleading claims.It&#39;s difficult to predict which is going to be worse in the long run. As in many things we&#39;ll probably learn to tolerate a degree of both and aim to find a &#34;least worse&#34; outcome.Anyone claiming here either that no fact-checking would be the best outcome or it&#39;s inverse (I can&#39;t quite formulate what that would be right now) is probably wrong and the messy middle is probably correct."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everybody&#39;s got questions and suspicions, but here&#39;s my rather subtle one: If you&#39;re editing dramatic video footage for YouTube, why exclude the exciting moment when the engine suddenly quits? Why edit out the suspense of your repeated attempts to restart the engine? Why omit the drama of your repeated radio calls?I think if you&#39;re a YouTube narcissist, you leave everything in that attracts attention and views. Now of course maybe if your ego is especially fragile, you edit out anything that makes you look bad. (Bad in your own opinion, mind you. There were numerous things left in that make him look bad in my opinion, but I digress.) So maybe he thought he sounded panicky on the radio, and maybe he thought he looked inept trying to restart the engine (or maybe he was too dumb to try either of those), but that still leaves the moment the engine quits - why leave that out?Now you know what they say about assume: it puts U between me and some ass. Which I don&#39;t appreciate. But nonetheless I assume that moment is not shown from the cockpit camera because he killed the engine. And if he killed the engine, he probably never tried to restart it, and never made any radio calls.It&#39;s kind of like when your cell phone is turned off all day, on the same day your spouse happens to get murdered. Nobody can triangulate &amp; prove you were at the crime scene... but........."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a private pilot and I regularly fly aircraft similar to the one in the video. Engines can fail for any number of reasons, but catastrophic engine failure is exceedingly rare, and most of the time an engine stoppage is going to be something that can be corrected easily, such as fuel starvation (maybe failure to switch fuel tanks?), or a misconfigured fuel mixture, or a fried magneto.As student pilots, we train extensively for engine-out scenarios by running through checklists to increase glide distance, diagnose the problem, and hopefully restart the engine. At the very least, we evaluate all options.The first thing you are trained to do in an engine-out is to pitch the aircraft for best glide speed, and you don&#39;t even see him do that in the video. The prop stops spinning and he immediately opens the door.Bailing from the aircraft was the first thing he thought of doing, and that is the complete opposite of what every pilot is trained to do. I can&#39;t emphasize enough how much the engine-out checklist is drilled into you during training. Any qualified pilot is going to exercise some of those options unless their intention is in fact to bail from the aircraft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is well written, and I learned stuff (the trailing spaces and end-of-buffer indicators).Modern Emacs configurations tend to revolve around use-package, which wraps up the package installer logic at the end of this configuration and makes it somewhat declarative. Just going by the standards of r/emacs or places like that, it&#39;d be unusual to see a .emacs that didn&#39;t ultimately boil down to a bunch of use-package clauses configuring stuff like LSP, Magit, company, ivy, and yasnippet.If I was going to add just one thing to this starter configuration, it&#39;d be a single example of use-package, to make it clear how to add and configure a package the user just read about online --- it&#39;s just such a big part of how Emacs is used now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ahh, I finally get to flex. With our powers combined, me and a random unknown dev successfully set up a Python REPL that has access to emacs. I.e. you can program emacs via python:https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1472371143000707075https://github.com/zielmicha/emacspy/issues/1Setup guide: https://gist.github.com/shawwn/64e17ac3f7b272ce0ce16eb6a593b...Maybe this&#39;ll be the boost you lurkers need to get your butts into one of the coolest editors. &#34;Not your dad&#39;s editor&#34; -- new emacs slogan, probably. /sBonus screenshot of compiling emacs on a 96 core TPU: https://i.imgur.com/YtJ8jF7.pngIt launches emacs, then uses the (relatively) new dynamic modules feature to start a Python runtime, which can then import a library that accesses emacs.But to my surprise, Python can also import whatever you already have `pip3 install`&#39;ed. I imported jax and did some high speed calculations in lisp. Just kidding, I really did import jax, but it&#39;ll take a bit more work to be able to pass numpy arrays to emacs. :) But it&#39;s &#34;just&#34; a matter of making some kind of RPC system so that (+ a b) ends up calling back into python to do the addition. Then the circle will be complete -- elisp from python (already done), and python from elisp (&#34;exercise for the reader&#34;).For real though, go throw that fella a star on his github repo. The most surprising thing was that this project has been quietly on github for like two years already. It was sitting at zero stars when it popped up in one of my random google searches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My big eye-openers (some from postdoc) were more about the sociology of science than the day-to-day productivity:- Even the most blatantly wrong and illogical published work can only be displaced by another publication that explains/does the same phenomenon better; i.e., people are going to keep believing in phlogiston until someone shows them oxygen. If you simply point out inconsistencies in phlogiston theory, in person or in writing, they may well make a variety of unwanted psychological deductions about you.- Similarly, nobody actually enjoys being around critics or enduring criticism, and therefore you will observe many senior scientists partially avoiding the major downsides of being a critic by artfully concealing criticisms inside what sounds to the uninitiated like mutual affirmation sessions. You have to listen very closely and learn the lingo to pick this up.- Never question a scientific superior (other than maybe a direct mentor or very close colleague) with any other approach besides &#34;I have a helpful suggestion about how you can maybe reach your intended destination better/faster/more precisely&#34;. Regardless of where that destination might be, such as off a cliff or into a wall.- The opinion/fact ratio you are allowed to have as a scientist is directly and very strongly correlated with seniority, H-index, and so on.- The incentive structure of scientific publication is such that there are big rewards for being right on an important question, bigger the earlier you are to the party, and little to no penalties for being wrong, so long as the error cannot be provably and directly linked to fraud. There are a variety of interesting consequences to this incentive structure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Missing from this actionable survey is the skill of answering questions that haven&#39;t yet been answered in the secondary literature (books, reviews) or even primary literature (journals). This is, of course, what research and a PhD is all about in the end.In my experience, this fact was the #1 reason why some peers dropped out of PhD programs. They joined expecting a continuation of undergraduate education, which consists largely of recapitulating what appears in the secondary literature. Instead, what they got in graduate school was the expectation that they would be producing the primary literature. That&#39;s a very different game.It was a game these peers discovered they hated playing. Nothing in college can prepare you for the isolation of spending your time becoming the world&#39;s expert on a narrow technical topic. Your usual reinforcement mechanisms of approval from family and friends gives way to slight comprehension at best. Then there is all of the alone time doing research requires. But I suspect the hardest part of all is the seemingly endless lineup of dead ends and false hope. Not only is success not assured, you often have no idea whether the result will have any utility even if you succeed.Then, just when you&#39;ve gotten the hang of this finding answers game you discover that the real expectation is to be the one who formulates good questions. The kinds of questions that, although they will certainly involve dead ends, will ultimately pay off in some meaningful way. Very little in a bachelor&#39;s prepares you for doing this. It&#39;s a hard-won skill that comes from a round or two (or three or four) of months (or years) spent answering questions that nobody cares about. A lot hinges on your relationship with your advisor on this one.The PhD isn&#39;t just a bachelors degree but harder. It&#39;s a completely different animal. The skills in this article are very useful toward that end. But there&#39;s a lot more to the story when it comes to skills for finding answers to those unanswered questions, and formulating worthwhile questions without answers.The benefit of all of this work and discomfort is that you come away with the ability to answer worthwhile questions that haven&#39;t yet been answered. And that&#39;s a highly transferrable and applicable skill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two things I would add to this that I learned early on in my PhD:1. Presentations aren’t really about conveying information.I sat though so many dull presentations, they were very informative but I can read a paper quicker than they can badly present the same information.The best presentations were the ones that covered the whys of the work, the applications, the next steps, the specific problem areas - often these aren’t covered in the paper but, armed with that extra insight I am far more likely to read the paper and remember it.Presentations are (as the author says) about telling stories.2. Show up. So many PhDs waft around not doing a whole lot, and so land up being on the program forever. This only benefits the uni and is detrimental to the student. I noticed in the first month of my PhD that most people did a lot more work at the end than the beginning - so I flipped it, worked consistently from day one and got done in just under 3 years.Carry this over to your daily life and it’s almost a super power for getting stuff done. Consistently showing up and plugging away in something reaps rewards."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Ridiculous Option: Apple Pro Display XDRI&#39;ll admit, a monitor that costs more than my first car is beyond affordable for 99% of the population.But saying that, many of the people reading this are pulling truly exotic salaries right now.  After devoting untold hours to reaching the top of their profession.Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a professional earning $300k plus in software.You&#39;re often working 100% remote, using your monitor 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, just for work.  Plus untold hours of HackerNews (strictly after 5pm of course).I just find that&#39;s truly not an unlikely situation to be in.Without reference to the technical merits of the Apple Display, I don&#39;t think dropping $5000 on a monitor is outlandish for any professional in the situation I&#39;ve described.My hairdresser for example has a $4000 pair of scissors.  He uses the damn things every day, and he sharpens them twice a day.Whilst it&#39;s not essential, taking pride and investing in the tools of your trade is not a thing to frown upon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been waiting for good external Retina displays for years. That the situation has not improved after all this time is incredibly frustrating. Why is no display manufacturer [0] interested in setting itself apart by producing and marketing a lineup of reasonably priced external pixel-doubled (~200 ppi) displays? For some reason everything must be 16:9 and 4K with no regards to display size, resulting in some very awkward pixel densities. The fact that Apple is able to mass-manufacture a 5k display with a whole computer in it for just a little bit more than an UltraFine 5k is to me an indication that at least it’s technically feasible.[0] There is LG, but these displays have their issues as the article explains."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is &lt;220 ppi a dealbreaker? 27 inch 4k displays seem fine to me for retina and they are quite abundant. Though I&#39;ve tried 32 inches 4k, and there the resolution is not enough for text work.Dell has a 32 inch 8k display which is ~280 ppi in stock.https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-8k-m..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a suburb of Cape Town called Bishopscourt.
It is high up on the hill, near the botanical garden, and filled with Anglophone old money, trees and mansions. (1)It gets it&#39;s name of course from the &#34;official residence of the Archbishop of Cape Town&#34; (Anglican / Church of England).It was of course a &#34;whites only&#34; area under Apartheid until 1991 (2). Black people there could be assumed to be house or garden servants.When Mr Tutu was installed there as the first black Archbishop of Cape Town in 1986, he moved in without seeking exemption from this law (3). He would put on his jogging outfit and take his exercise on the streets there, smiling and waving to neighbours as if it was the most normal thing in the world.   And in time, it was.That is praxis.he was one of the best of us, always seeking a way to reach out.1) &#34;ranked sixth richest suburb in South Africa&#34; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopscourt,_Cape_Town2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Areas_Act3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu#Archbishop_of_Cap..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Archbishop Tutu told me, a few years ago, that he had received a strange email from someone claiming to be a lawyer from a small English parish in which Tutu had been a curate in the 1970s.The person was asking for Tutu&#39;s assistance in transferring the fabulous wealth of a deceased Nigerian prince to his widow.“Ah, a 419 scam,” I said.“A what now?”I explained what a 419 scam was, and, fearing the worst, asked what he had done about it. It turned out that he still had a number of friends in that area, and had forwarded it on to a friend to investigate.“Never heard of this lawyer chap,” the response came, “DO NOT respond!”So, of course the Archbishop responded.For a moment, I put myself in the shoes of this “Nigerian Prince”, getting an email from “Archbishop Desmond Tutu”, shaming the alleged prince for attempting to scam innocents on the internet. I started giggling.“So what happened next?” I asked.“Oh, he emailed me back, and tried to sell me something else.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they&#39;re falling in.― Desmond TutuMay he rest in peace."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Disclaimer: I acknowledge that I’ve been very privileged, especially in the educational opportunities I’ve had.This might sound reasonable from a US-centric perspective, but to me it reads like utter nonsense. The main privilege here is access to the US labor market and tax policy. There are no stories like this one where I live (in Sweden). Absolutely none."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not understand why articles like these consistently score poorly on HN? Of course it’s all based on luck, but that doesn’t make it an uninteresting read. I admire the diligence of the author, and how well they played the lucky cards they were given.I am frequently in awe when reading technical articles on HN, with people advancing the state of the art in some technology. Those people also are incredibly lucky, because they were born with massive talents that, through sacrifices and education, they transformed into life achievements.As an average software engineer I was not lucky enough to be born with cognitive skills that will ever allow me to reach those technical highs, but that is not a reason to crap on it saying “Just luck! Just genetic/environmental luck!”.Similarly, I don’t typically read from others: “It’s easy for you to rewrite the Linux kernel in JavaScript over a weekend, your work is just luck because you were born a genius in a developed country so all your achievements need to be discounted and you have no merits!”.I suspect when it comes to compensation talk people tend on average to get more bitter than they should otherwise be.Maybe I take this to heart because I made significant sacrifices to immigrate to the US and, while I was immensely lucky to succeed in the endeavor, most people I know would have never taken those uncomfortable steps (leaving family behind in a different country, sacrifice personal space by frugal living in a HCOL area as opposed to a LCOL area with a house and backyard for the kids, …), yet they will happily “complain” that my compensation is much higher than theirs, and that there is no merit to it, rather than simply admitting that they willingly chose a different path in life, but they could have chased my same opportunities with largely the same financial outcome.If I was reading this article and I was not a tech worker in the US but interested in getting those compensations, my first reaction would be “damn, let me research what are the options for legal immigration to the US and let me start down a path that has good odds of me landing a tech job over there within 5-10 years”. It would not be “let me complain on HN how the country I am a forever-prisoner in has a 90% effective tax rate so that I feel good about my situation”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I should really buy something from jet pens. Not sure how how expensive they are for non-US international orders but I’ll have to check. It could potentially add quite a mark-up to a cheaper item such as the sampler packs someone else mentioned. But those packs look GREAT.You should check out the rest of their posts/articles. I’ve ended up on them before when trying to find out the difference in the types of inks and types of pens. I have always been really impressed by the quality of their articles. Really want to give them some cash so will wander over there in a bit.Sadly, my writing has got worse and worse since my life has become more and more digital. I should really have a goal for 2022 to be able to write legibly once again. I can’t even read my own hand writing any more - it must just be the lack of practice and it’s very sad as people used to comment on how beautiful it was (decades ago). Now it looks like a Doctor’s prescription order!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have no affiliation with jetpens - but if you are into pens at all, buy one of their sampler packs.It&#39;s a great way to try out different styles of pens that you won&#39;t find at Staples or Walgreens (or the office supply closet)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a slightly contrarian opinion: I just use printer-paper (for a laser printer). It works fine with ballpoint or fountain pens (some notebook papers don’t work well with fountain pens and people think they need special expensive paper). Obviously it doesn’t come in a neat book. I just used plastic document sleeves for the first level of organisation (one could then view more than two pages at once too) and box files for the second, though it wasn’t very necessary. I don’t have much to write and record these days.I currently use paper for free-form drawings or diagrams for work as photographing a paper drawing is the most efficient process I currently have for getting such diagrams into emails/our wiki."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cray/HPE, presumably, has a contract to provide support to the customer with nuclear weapons. If this fix is necessary to that contract, Cray/HPE should set the bounty needed to get it done as part of the necessary cost of fulfilling their contract (if they didn&#39;t figure it in, and it&#39;s not a cost-plus contract, and it cuts into the profit margin, well, that&#39;s the risk you take with fixed-cost contracting.) Free Software may often tend to be free-as-in-beer as well as free-as-in-speech but, where it is, that is as is. If you have special, and especially time-sensitive, needs that aren&#39;t as is, you pay someone to do it. It&#39;s not a gratis support contract with response time guarantees. As Cray/HPE ought to be well aware, that kind of support is expensive, and doesn&#39;t happen if no one is paying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the customer has nuclear weapons, then the customer has magnitudes more money in their couch cushions than would be required to pay to have this functionality implemented. For that matter, they’re probably paying Bill Long’s employer some significant chunk of change, and it would be easy for them to offer to pay for this functionality. But it’s free/oss software, so let’s just keep bugging the maintainers instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awesome! Takes me back :)My 8 yo son is playing it now, he knows all the modern consoles, but this is challenging him. He is frustrated things are hard from the beginning, jumps don&#39;t work right away and he stopped after a few minutes. I remember my perseverance as a kid.I was thinking about that lately, I see my kids don&#39;t have this strong motivation as I had, not for anything. Everything works for them and is layed out. For example, when I was young I had a lego technic motor, but the wires sometimes got oxidatid or just broke, and I had to fix it. My son has a new lego set, and the motor always works, except when the wireless remote runs out of battery. 
Same with gaming, it always works, while in the past even getting a game to run could be a challenge on its own. And when he gets stuck in a game he watches a YouTube. No hours of frustration and endless searching and figuring for a solution.I see my kids don&#39;t have much of these challenges, everything works for them.Don&#39;t know how this will affect them on the long run. Now it&#39;s only my observation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great job! It&#39;s amazing to be able to feel again the sensations I had 30 years ago while developing the Atari version of this game. Thanks again!"</p>

Eventually I got them all!Because of this I remember level 1 extremely well :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the late 2000s, as a teenager, I was gifted a Runescape account. This account had level 80+ woodcutting, allowing one to chop magic trees - which would produce the most expensive lumber in the game. It took a staggering number of real hours to achieve this skill level, we&#39;re talking several hundred hours minimum.At some point I had realized that there were different sketchy websites that would buy and sell the in-game currency, gold pieces or GP. It was something like $10 to 1M GP. I could chop enough magic logs in about 4-6 hours to make $10.I had a breakthrough. What if I wrote a macro to record my cursor and clicks during my route from the &#39;bank&#39; (where you can deposit any amount of any material) to the nearby respawning magic tree forest?Weeks went by and I had passive income. Runescape eventually introduced the Grand Exchange, a literal in-game stock market that allowed power users like me to sell much larger quantities of certain items instantly, across all Runescape servers (referred to as Worlds) simultaneously. This required a standardized pricing mechanism, like an order book, where prices of any item would fluctuate based on buy and sell orders.Suddenly, I now could see a +-10% change on the value of my digital assets, on which my passive income was built.I could go on; Runescape in fact taught me much about economics. What&#39;s extraordinary is selling Runescape gold led me to Bitcoin, and I&#39;ve watched cryptocurrency for nearly a decade, seeing trends from a MMO propagate throughout the world. It seems human nature to innovate and stagnate, and the more immediate our collective feedback loops, the quicker these cycles are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A thought exercise you should undertake if you&#39;re thinking about / talking about crypto/NFT/web3-related projects:  If the financial instrument that underlies the project were to stop going up in value XX% per month, would you still be interested in the project?I do this a lot because I&#39;ve made the conscious (and perhaps financially foolish) choice to stay away from everything crypto/blockchain related (for now, at least).  So I have some perspective in being able to ask myself &#34;Why is this interesting?&#34; without any emotional-financial attachment.  I do this little exercise every time I read about some new brain-twisting scheme to move money around and capture some of the XX%/month rise.Play-to-earn seems to fit the same mold:  You can talk all you want about how play-to-earn is &#34;the new new&#34; and how it&#39;s helping people out of poverty and changing the dymanics of gaming and yadda yadda yadda.  But just ask yourself:  If the money music stopped tomorrow, would you play the game?Is there a &#34;there&#34; there without an underlying token that&#39;s gone up XX% in the last N months and everyone hopes will still go up XX% in the next N months?It sounds like the answer, at least when it comes to Axie Infinity, is no.  It doesn&#39;t sound fun.  It doesn&#39;t sound compelling.  It DOES sound like an opportunity for people to extract money from the crypto system that&#39;s fundamentally based on the assumption that the crypto system will continue rising in value forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didnt read much of the thread but I will assume that most of the people here is aware of how every single NFT game is just a ponzi.But I&#39;ve lived myself, what the author mentions as a &#34;way to lift people out of poverty.&#34;, from the era before NFT or &#34;play to earn&#34; games existed.I come from Venezuela, a full 3rd world country and I was &#34;lucky&#34; to play an MMO (lineage 2) during my young days and somehow I was good at it, i invested so many hours on it and managed to get into top tier guilds and worlds 1st event, and somehow, my character and my items were worth thousands of dollars in the market, and suddenly i went from being a 14 y.o boy sitting in pc, to bringing more money in 1 week to my family, than my entire family together for 1 year.I could understand that, while all other people on the game were playing for fun, it became my job, a job that actually got me and my family out of poverty...At the time (2007) there were a lot of chinese &#34;farmers&#34;, and people used to make fun of them, not only fun but the rest of the players were blantantly denigrating towards them, at 1st I didnt understand but once that I became a non-chinese farmer, I realized how It was a really good thing to do.Eventually I started botting, I bought more PCs and had a full army of bots, I kept making more and more money, and it helped me and my family leave the country and pretty much bought a house, a car and paid my family expenses for like 4 years out of lineage 2 adena farming.Also, scripting the bots pretty much got me to learn programming and english, so what I am now it&#39;s pretty much the result of some guy from chicago offering me 20$ in paypal for an item i had in my inventory that i got it while killing a monster, it all started there, that litle forbidden transaction in an MMO, changed my life completelySo, even tho it was like a job for me, I never saw it like a job, even tho it gave me a lot of money, i never got into the game as a way to get money, i was just a young kid trying to have some fun..But now, I get really sad everytime I see those ponzi NFT games, that only sell the idea of getting rich, and I get even more sad when I see tons of venezuelan youngsters fall for it, honestly, they are just playing with their desperation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People choose platforms because of their functionality, not because of their code licensing status - see the case of Scala, linked in a different sibling comment.  Matrix and Zulip, even after years of chasing, still sadly haven&#39;t caught up to Discord functionality- and UX-wise; until that happens, people won&#39;t have a good reason to budge.Regarding IRC, Drew is kind of famous with his ascetism, claiming that the impossibility to share GIFs, videos, files, use threads, have internal chat history, are all features rather than limitations[1]. The thing is, people don&#39;t care about it, they&#39;ll simply vote with their own legs. Mail and mailgroups face a similar UX challenge. Not everyone is willing to endure the pain of learning and using mailgroups and IRC just because they&#39;re FOSS.[1] https://drewdevault.com/2019/07/01/Absence-of-features-in-IR..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disregarding closed source issue I find Discord, any chat, unsuitable as a public user-developer interface.Why?1. Asynchrony. User needs time to collect data, write a bug report and so on. Developer needs time to reproduce the issue, work on it. Finally there are a lot of timezones - people ask/answer at different points of time.2. Long lasting. Communication can take days, weeks and even months as new details emerge. Accessing a year old thread should be as easy as accessing a thread created yesterday.3. Publicity. You want everything written to be as public as possible. Read access should be available to everyone without registration. Read access should be available via web browser. So that other users (who often experience the same issues) can easily find existing communication on the topic, and if they can&#39;t find it themselves you can at least send them a link which brings me to permanence.4. Permanence. Each individual communication (message) should be accessible by a URI which never changes. Each individual communication page should have links to thread/parent/children/references.5. Searchability. Follows from (3) and (4) but the easier it is for a user to find past discussions - the less noise you&#39;ll have.Chat systems such as Discord, Slack or Matrix are fundamentally incompatible with these requirements as they are focused on synchronous, ephemeral communication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, I’ve found myself actively seeking alternatives (edit: to the project itself, not just to chat) when an OSS project only has a chat-based community as opposed to forums or mailing-lists, for two (edit: three) reasons:- it’s impossible to search chats meaningfully, whereas forums/DLs let you quickly figure out if you’re facing a common issue (and finding resolutions easily)- asking about something in chat and tracking replies a day or two later (because you will quite likely not get a quick reply to complex issues) is also quite hard unless you just happen to be awake at the same time as a core dev and can actually spend the time together (although that usually devolves into “file an issue with more details and tag me”).- I don’t want to sign up for a dozen different services or private forums to even access that info.Not to mention that (depending on community) you might just get a lot of irrelevant chatter thrown in, or just plain “this is the wrong channel” replies because there are no signposts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"LastPass has had a history of security incidents (no company can completely avoid incidents, but if security is literally a primary part of your value, you shouldn’t be having so many).Even worse, they have a history of doing hand-wavy corporate non-explanations for what actually happened in these incidents. The antithesis of being responsible and respecting users in the modern day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is framed so negatively toward LastPass, which is unfortunate. They stopped all usage of correct passwords they believed were compromised, which is exactly what I&#39;d want them to do in this situation. Them warning users their master passwords are compromised is a good thing! Yet it&#39;s framed as though they&#39;re admitting to something.&#34;However, users receiving these warnings have stated that their passwords are unique to LastPass and not used elsewhere.&#34; That&#39;s really hard to verify. I think most users would say that rather than admit they re-used passwords (or used similar passwords that were easy to reverse engineer). Since there only seems to be 2-3 reports of this, and they&#39;re self-reported and not cited, it doesn&#39;t seem like LastPass was compromised.I&#39;m not saying I like LastPass (I use 1Password and find LastPass to be much worse), but I haven&#39;t seen any indication at this point that LastPass has been compromised at all.(To be clear, it&#39;s very possible I&#39;m wrong and this message won&#39;t age well. But so far, it seems like LastPass is doing its job, and I&#39;d want to see more than this before jumping on the blame-LastPass bandwagon.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Recruiters love phone calls and don’t like doing things over email or text. This means that it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the number of recruiters trying to call you, and we will explore time management a little further down the text.This has been my experience as well, and while I understand the desire for introductory &#34;sales mode&#34; type calls, I think it&#39;s progressed past that point to something nearly pathological.As an example, I recently had a recruiter that I was previously in contact with over email cold-call me while I was skiing, trying to schedule a meeting with a hiring manager (I picked up the call because I thought it might be one of the people in my group that I didn&#39;t have in my contacts). When I requested she please send me an email to schedule the meeting, as I was out of the office, I got an email where she sent an email to schedule the phone call, to then schedule the meeting over the phone. It was 100% the least efficient way to do this, and only happened because of this illogically strong preference for phone calls that recruiters seem to have..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When looking at his LinkedIn, I only see one job with tenure over 4 years almost 10 years back and most other jobs are well below 2 years. It seems like he definitely is able to find new jobs very efficiently so I think his advice here is valuable.However if I were hiring for an engineering leader, I would probably pass him over. I don’t see anyone being an effective leader by only sticking around for less than 2 years. Having tenures less than 2 years especially at senior roles doesn’t give a lot of positive feelings of leadership in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Independent headhunters and recruiters are a valuable resourceI had an experience with an independent recruiter that went so poorly that I haven’t been able to take those kinds of people seriously since.A few years back, I was recruited to an up-and-coming startup in the healthcare space in a senior role. It was a massive pay increase, meaningful equity, and a company name I was proud to put on my resume.An independent firm reached out to me about the role and I was definitely interested. One thing I noticed while doing my independent research was that lots of people had very poor Glassdoor reviews of the company, basically comparing it to Theranos in terms of its culture, constant firings, cult-like CEO, etc. I reached out to several former employees to discuss their experience and could not get one to talk to me about working there. Meanwhile, I was hearing from the recruiters that they hired a new exec team and most complaints were not relevant to the current situation there.I brought the complaints up with the recruiter and the company during my interview process, and they both told me it was just a couple disgruntled former employees trying to make the company look bad. The recruiter offered to put me in touch with others they placed at the company, but I couldn’t view them as objective sources.I started the gig and it took me all of two weeks to realize the company was in fact firing people constantly and I had been completely lied to by the recruiter and the company.As much as I want to believe that there are recruiters out there that look out for devs, the reality is that software talent is the product in that relationship and there aren’t a lot of financial incentives to ensure transparency going into these professional relationships. Recruiters get paid when you sign, which creates an inherent conflict of interest when you’re looking to them as a trusted resource."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thinking aloud here, it does seem like (as we&#39;ve always known), anyone doing eCommerce online is effectively beholden to their payment provider.Given Stripe is pretty popular, it feels like for many it is becoming the &#34;S3&#34; of payments in terms of an API. Would it be viable for others to implement the same API on the basis of compatibility, portability and interoperability?In the past, I recall dealing with systems where you&#39;d have multiple backend processors for major external functions, and you&#39;d load balance which provider was used. Some might have more favourable pricing, and be a preferred partner, while others might be potential future preferred partners being tried out (see how many failures you get from them, compared with the current preferred partner).It seems that, if this was possible to implement (card tokenization obviously being an issue here), you could have multiple independent backend providers implementing the Stripe API as a provider, and you load balance across them.Just like how you could use another S3 API provider for storage if one is giving you hassle, or not offering satisfactory performance or support. Sure, you have migration work to do, but having the same API and underlying properties should speed things up and let you get new transactions onto the new storage ASAP.ACME is like this for SSL - there&#39;s now multiple CAs implementing the one API. Could we get there for payments too?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"100% atheism. Was raised some kind of protestant I forget which one, and derived tremendous spiritual and psychological relief when I realized all of that was absolute nonsense at the age of 9. I knew I was gay at the time and wouldn&#39;t come out until I was 18 or so, but my life just got a lot easier when I removed religion completely. I also recall discovering increased moral agency -- as a Christian I had been taught I could simply confess whatever and it would be forgiven (an idea I found laughable), and that the objective basis for making moral judgements comes directly from god (another idea I found laughable). As an atheist I was suddenly responsible for making my own moral judgements and conclusions (I had to decide upon my own objective basis for making moral judgements), and forgiveness was something I had to work towards myself (as in I had to forgive myself for things, which is not easy, but is incredibly rewarding) versus simply getting it for free from some nonexistent deity. All in all, was an incredibly positive change in my life, and I do believe there can be a weird sort of spirituality to 100% atheism that people don&#39;t really acknowledge."</p>

My normal day consists of feeding them, bathing them, calming tantrums, losing my temper, getting bitter at my lack of time for hobbies, and growing resentful of my lack of time for reading the Bible, praying, etc.But then I remember that this is a true dying to self. Not only a dying to self, but a dying to the world too as each of these sacrifices, failures, and victories occur hidden away from the world. Thus I commend myself to this daily humbling, this emptying, and also trust myself to the daily prayer of the monks, whose prayer and sacrifice are also hidden from the world and whose labors I suspect are also just as arduous, frustrating, and challenging at times.&gt; For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find i"</p>

Part of the personal prayer time includes seeking direction on who I might help that day. Throughout the day I try to take little breaks for a brief prayer, longer if I&#39;m stuck on a programming bug whose solution eludes me and for which I need extra inspiration. Also I try to go on a daily walk to appreciate nature and to recognize blessings in my life. Each meal includes a prayer of thanks. Before bed there&#39;s a brief family scripture study and prayer, then a prayer with my wife, then a personal prayer to round out the day where I try to reflect on how things went and what I hope to do better tomorrow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Employees not succeeding at disconnecting from work is often unintentional, and caused by subtle, pernicious effects of middle managers simply existing and following basic incentives (such as &#34;my boss just sent me an email after dinner, guess I should act/forward it along&#34;).Forcing companies to write down their policy on this seems like a pretty good idea, because it forces HR to actually decide how they want their employees to be treated, and enables middle managers to be held accountable for their actions along this axis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA: In a lot of country, non-competes agreement are illegal, at least in the form they usually take. In many jurisdiction,  non-compete will only apply when specific condition are met. For example, in France[0], all non-compete have to have :- a &#34;reasonable&#34; time limit- a specific geographic region (i.e: only in France, U.E, etc...) -&gt; this is very often omitted, and &#34;the whole world&#34; is not valid.- The non-competition has to be for a specific activity. This is often not understood and instead you find something like &#34;not work for our competitor&#34; or &#34;not work for a company in this field&#34;. This is not specific enough and will be thrown out in court.- There has to be a financial compensation.Despite this, almost all the company that I worked for in France had non-applicable non-competes agreement in their contract. None of them offered a financial compensation and none had a specific region.As far as I know, this is not a France-only thing, and non-competes creeps in almost any employment contract in the world, especially in the tech field. Learn your rights.[0] https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1910"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the text, they didn’t actually create a right to disconnect from work. They only require employers to write down their policy and share it with employees:&gt; The legislation offers no guidance as to what must be included in the policy, and simply provides that the policy must include &#34;such information as may be prescribed.&#34; This was apparently intentional as noted in the legislative summary in an effort to offer employers flexibility to develop a policy appropriate to its operational needs.So unless I’m missing something, a company can write down “Employees must be available as needed” or something equally vague and they comply with the policy.In practice I would expect most employers to write a lot of vague wording about how employees aren’t required to be active online in their off hours, but they’ll leave the door open for emergency communications as needed. No sane company is going to write down a legally binding policy that nobody is going to contact anybody else at certain times. Imagine how easy it would be for a manager to break such a restriction by accidentally tagging an employee name in Slack at the wrong time of day, for example.The “right to disconnect” seems largely symbolic.On the other hand, banning non-competes is a big deal. They are effectively banned in my location (and several other states in the United States) and it’s great to not worry about it at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel a bit disappointed by the number of people suggesting that an NFT would somehow help here.An NFT is just a fancy signed receipt. I can mint an NFT saying the OP owns a bunch of Ubisoft games and give it to him, but his account will still be closed. Ubisoft could mint an NFT saying he owns a bunch of games and give it to him, but his account will still be closed. (He probably still has the receipts from when he bought the games in his inbox somewhere, but of course, his account is still closed.)We can store whatever records we like in a fancy distributed database, but his account will still be closed. The only fix here is Ubisoft needs to not close peoples accounts.Somewhat amusingly Ubisoft is in the process of launching an NFT system (https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/ubisofts-first-nft-pl...) and as anyone paying attention would no doubt expect, it doesn&#39;t solve anything related to this; up to an including the fact that if you get banned you...lose your NFTs.There is no technological problem to solve here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is a great example of why we need legislation around ownership of digital items. I generally hate getting the government involved in things, but if you&#39;re paying money for goods, there needs to be a way to be credited or receive your digital goods in a way that still works without your &#34;account&#34;.Personally I always get kind of nervous around buying things on PSN, Xbox, Stadia, Steam, Oculus, etc. If they ban me, do I lose my thousands of dollars of games? That doesn&#39;t seem right (and no, I don&#39;t really care too much about what the Terms and Services say)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We may also close long-term inactive accounts to maintain our database.How many kilobytes takes too store ownership data? I can just imagine that tracking data is thousands of times bigger.&gt; The crazy thing about this is that it’s perfectly legal for video game companies to delete your account regardless of whether you’ve spend zero or a thousand dollars on their gamesIt&#39;s a shame that we are going to fight for our digital rights because currently we have almost none because  justice does not understand technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, great project - the more competition in this space the better. To be honest, at the moment the algorithm doesn&#39;t return any sensible results for anything (at least that I can find), but I hope that you can find a way past this as it&#39;s a great place to have a project.I&#39;ve included some search terms below that I&#39;ve tried - I&#39;ve not cherrypicked these and believe they are indicative of current performance. Some of these might be the size of the index - however I suspect it&#39;s actually how the search is being parsed/ranked (in particular I think the top two examples show that).&gt; Search &#34;best car brands&#34;Expected: Car ReviewsReturns a page showing the best mobile phone brands.then...&gt; Then searching &#34;Best Mobile Phone&#34;Expected: The article from the search above.Returns a gizmodo page showing the best apps to buy...  &#34;App Deals: Discounted iOS iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone Apps&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;What is a test?&#34;Expected result: Some page describing what a test is, maybe wikipedia?Returns &#34;Test could confirm if Brad Pitt does suffer from face blindness&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;Duck Duck Go&#34;Expected result: DDG.comReturns &#34;There be dragons? Why net neutrality groups won&#39;t go to Congress&#34;&gt; Searching &#34;Google&#34;Expected result: Google.comReturns: An article from the independent, &#34;Google has just created the world’s bluest jeans&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We plan to start work on a distributed crawler, probably implemented as a browser extension that can be installed by volunteers.Is there a concern that volunteers could manipulate results through their crawler?You already mentioned distributed search engines have their own set of issues. I&#39;m wondering if a simple centralised non-profit fund a la wikipedia could work better to fund crawling without these concerns. One anecdote: Personally I would not install a crawler extensions, not because I don&#39;t want to help, but because my internet connection is pitifully slow. I&#39;d rather donate a small sum that would go way further in a datacenter... although I realise the broader community might be the other way around.[edit]Unless, the crawler was clever enough to merely feed off the sites i&#39;m already visiting and use minimal upload bandwidth. The only concern then would be privacy. oh the irony, but trust goes a long way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A laudable effort. Two questions:1. What is the rationale behind choosing Python as a implementation language? Performance and efficiency are paramount in keeping operational costs low and ensuring a good user experience even if the search engine will be used by many users. I guess Python is not the best choice for this, compared to C, Rust or Java.2. What is the rationale behind implementing a search engine from scratch versus using existing Open Source search engine libraries like Apache Lucene, Apache Solr and Apache Nutch (crawler)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few days ago I finally stopped doing something very similar.As fascinating as the data could be (I never managed to transform it like this), the constant recording of every single thing made me stop enjoying things. It made me hyper-conscious of everything going on in my body as the primary goal was to figure out some health issues. Everything I felt or did seemed to have an &#34;event handler&#34; attached to it.I now just stick to one line a day in a spreadsheet as a sort of diary.To anyone attempting it:1. Figure out what you want to do with the data first. Even if you just want some pretty graphs, create some random test data and set everything up so you can see these graphs. Don&#39;t just throw data into a black hole for years.2. Make sure recording the data is as easy and comfortable as possible. That android app from the article looks good, but you have to be absolutely sure it&#39;s okay to use many times a day. Be aware that there&#39;s no good answer to &#34;why do you keep reaching for your phone all the time?&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Daylio [0] for the last 2 years to track my mood and activities. It&#39;s less comprehensive than the system described here but much simpler to implement. It lets you set up a reminder with a mood selector, and you then select the activities you have accomplished. The activities are completely configurable. I&#39;ve started by tracking just a few habits and I&#39;ve added more along the way.I can&#39;t praise this app enough. Main pros:- all your data is stored locally not in the cloud, but you can easily back it up on Google Drive- it lets you export your data anytime- It comes with nice dashboards, weekly, monthly and yearly reviews. It let&#39;s you see the impact of each activity on your mood. It really gave me some interesting insights on my mood patterns.My only complaint really is that the only numeric value you can track is your mood, everything else is yes or no.A year or so ago, I&#39;ve also started using Clockify [1] to track the time I spent on each activity. Again, I don&#39;t track everything, only a few habits I want to improve on. It has a mobile and desktop app. The UI could be improved but all the features I need are free, and most importantly data export.It&#39;s the perfect time of year to set up a tracking system. My recommendation is start small. Track only a couple of activities first and add more as you build the habit.[0]: https://daylio.net/[1]: https://clockify.me/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a list from every year from 1952, which I seem to have lost.Anyways: First experienced memory on that list was when I realized winter was reoccurring thing in spring of 1955. I was sitting on a sleigh on water-covered skating field and imagined I was a boat. I then suddenly remembered that this has happened before, but very long time go, maybe half a life-time ago."</p>

Most of these programs are just using the pywidevine library along with some key that&#39;s been leaked (if you know how to navigate Github search you can find one in a couple of minutes) and then integrating the streaming site&#39;s API.  I wrote mine in Go because I got sick of the pywidevine hegemony and I felt it was unnecessarily complicated.  The annoying thing is that key revocations are happening pretty frequently now.  It&#39;s another one of those pointless cat and mouse games."</p>
