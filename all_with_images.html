								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting how the three separate R/G/B images are taken independently a few ~seconds~ milliseconds apart, with a different color filter placed over the image sensor.I assume this is to maximize resolution, since no Bayer interpolation [0] is needed to  demosaic the output of a traditional image sensor that integrates the color filters onto the sensor pixels themselves. As these satellites are not intended to photograph things in motion, the color channel alignment artifacts seen here are a rare, small price to pay for vastly improved resolution and absence of demosaicing artifacts.[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m impressed more by the comments than the article itself. Some people insist they make progress and listen 3x, but nobody showed any practical measurements of own skills.A personal example: I used to listen to a famous linguist, and everything seemed nice and clear, but then I decided to go in details on one particular question (I think accentuantion), and opened his book. It was like if you showed your programming code to a farmer: incomprehensible stream of linguistic terms. My complacency was shattered in 1 minute.There&#39;s some scientific evidence as well:1. Lectures are proved to be a bad way to learn things. https://www.science.org/content/article/lectures-arent-just-...2. A nice experiment showing that if you enjoy a lesson, it usually means you make no progress, meanwhile hard practice actually does make you progress: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251I suppose, those who insist they learn something, do make progress at memorizing trivia, but not at practical skills or any systematic understanding.This kind of knowledge feels firm only until it&#39;s tested by practical task or by serious questioning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get the point you&#39;re making - but honestly I have to raise the counter argument, which I think is equally valid. Take for example, the average lecture video. The information density is so low, that I&#39;d imagine that a 60 minute video could be compressed into 10-12 minutes without any loss of information. It really depends on what you&#39;re listening to/watching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article isn’t just about playback speed. It’s a well-written piece about the importance of direct experience and not rushing through spoken lectures alone.It’s extra ironic, then, that much of the comment section here only seems to have absorbed the headline but not the content of the article.I have noticed that my most voracious podcast and book consuming friends seem to have developed a lot of surface-level knowledge about a lot of subjects, but it’s difficult to discuss even the content of the books they’ve read. Listening on 1.5X or 2X speed is a common boast for them, as is the number of books or podcasts they’ve consume in a year (which is tracked for some reason). It seems the goal has become quantity, or simply filling time and providing background noise instead of studying a subject."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am glad to see HTTP Toolkit back on HN: The author is an old friend who dedicated a lot of time and resources to make this tool and as someone who fiddled with it, it&#39;s a great alternative to Postman - which I used to love but now it&#39;s a little bit too heavy on pushing their marketing agenda.
Also how on earth is Postman a $5.6 billion dollar company - I am super curious to see how much money Postman actually makes from enterprise sales - it must be a lot from the looks of that valuation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been looking for an alternative to postman that isn’t so insanely geared to monetization. I feel postman compromises it’s entire UX to force a simple offline tool to be cloud based."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s probably a losing battle at this point, but —Would you consider using the more correct terminology &#34;Fake&#34; instead of &#34;Mock&#34;?In software testing, the two terms mean different things.  A &#34;fake&#34; is a thing that takes the place of a service; you call it and it returns a fake result.  A &#34;mock&#34; is a thing that enforces expectations of its caller; you specify a sequence of calls that you expect, then you run the caller and it verifies that the calls occurred in the manner and order expected.  They are used for different purposes, and it&#39;s useful to have the clarity of two different terms for two different things.In particular, it is usually a better testing practice to use fakes instead of mocks.  But now there are some testing libraries that create mocks (and call them mocks) and other testing libraries that create fakes (and also call them mocks), which has confused the issue and made it harder to speak clearly about a fairly important testing strategy decision.What HTTP Toolkit does is produce fake replies to HTTP requests.  So &#34;fake&#34; is the best term for what it does, and thus I make this earnest plea to use that term to distinguish it from mocking, which it doesn&#39;t do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My family used to do this all the time when we were kids. We&#39;d go along the ditches on the side of the road and make a family outing of it on weekends. At the beach my brother and I would drag big plastic garbage bags around and collect as much as we could from people who were happy to help some kids out and also happy to be rid of the bottles and cans. You could make some decent coin at it, but that was also in the 80s when 5c a can and 10-20c a bottle was worth something.It gets into your bones. Even today with 25 years software dev experience under my belt, I still feel the twitch whenever I see a discarded bottle or can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a story of a man who collected cans and bottles for cash and invested the money he got in the stock market, he died a millionaire.&#34;Curt Degerman, known to many as &#34;Tin Can Curt,&#34; Degerman spent nearly 30 years roaming the streets of Skelleftea in northern Sweden collecting tin cans and bottles for cash. Those who passed him by simply assumed he was another ordinary street bum.But to the surpise of many, when Degerman died in 2008, he left more than $1.4 million to his cousin. In between collecting cans, Degerman spent a lot of time in his local library reading business papers and studying the stock market. &#34;He knew stocks inside and out,&#34; said his cousin.By immersing himself in an education of thrift and smart investing, Degerman used his tin-can earnings to purchase mutual funds. He bought 124 gold bars and also expanded his cash with a savings account. By riding a bicycle and not having a mortgage on his house, his savings were made even easier.But in 2008, Degerman died of a heart attack, leaving his entire estate to a cousin who had visited him regularly during his last days. He died a millionaire.&#34;Sources:https://www.nydailynews.com/news/money/tin-collector-dies-mi...https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WHB-2895https://archive.md/kB5F4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not thought about collecting cans in a very long time. Decades ago you could make a decent bit of cash collecting aluminum cans. It was a common past time for poor people and undoubtedly contributed to the very high recycle rate for aluminum since it was a source of income for many people. This was widely known, so people would often go out of their way to make their aluminum trash easily available to be collected. It was kind of low-key charity of sorts.At some point this just kind of dried up. I suspect it coincided with municipalities selling the rights to collect recyclables to waste management companies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am not sure how relevant this is, but I recently published a proof a concept library  that converts SVG documents into simulated machines. See the link below.https://www.getlazarus.org/videos/physics/blueprint/The rendering in my library relies upon OpenGL and the NanoVG library. My library is called Tiny Sim. All of these nano tiny and vg names seem to be colliding adding a bit of confusion in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks nice, i was thinking of adding some vector support in my Little Forms[0] GUI toolkit at some point but everything feels overcomplicated and bloated - however this looks quite nice at a first glance. As i don&#39;t have any advanced vector drawing code at all (aside from the basic &#34;draw line, draw circle&#34; etc needed to draw the GUI itself) it can work as a template for what to put in there.[0] http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lforms/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are many other popular vector graphics formats beyond those mentioned here. Lottie has already displaced SVG for animation/motion graphics, and for static content IconVG exists and is backed by Google. There&#39;s also PDF, PostScript, Flash, the glyf format in OpenType, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to think exa was a good ls replacement, but I found out that it&#39;s significantly slower than ls[0]. Heck, it&#39;s even slower than lf[1]. Quite frankly I didn&#39;t know what to think, but I removed the alias ls=exa.0: https://asciinema.org/a/454216 vs https://asciinema.org/a/4542171: https://asciinema.org/a/454213"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Non-positive opinion ahead.Personally I can’t find a use for it. Colors are so vast that I can’t figure out which means what (and they rarely play nice with a custom bg color). And then, all I have to know is whether a file is “-&gt;”, “*”, “/“ or “”. Tree+git view could be useful, if not node_modules, .git and other tree spammers. Of course there is an option to ignore, but then my .bashrc grows again while all I need in a project dir is covered by git status -s (yes I can read these capital letters since svn).It is modern in a sense of presentation, and I see how it may appeal to someone, but not in a sense of ls being old or something. It feels to me like a strange tool that does everything but nothing specifically, as if someone always wanted a nice gui file explorer, but had no courage to admit this “lameness”.Why spend your time squinting at black and white text?*I usually spend time on colored output trying to read blue/lightgreen/etc on #444, and because my b/w tools are separated by colored PS1, which emphasizes important* things like hostname, user, cwd, exitcode and puts a newline so that each command is lined up and ends with an additional \n. File being a green file or a blue dir is not as important as me patching a wrong instance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always find pitches like this a little obnoxious:&gt; You list files hundreds of times a day. Why spend your time squinting at black and white text?Uh, `ls` has colors, if you know how or some benevolent distro-maintainer did.Now there&#39;s a ton of value in sane defaults and cutting out cruft and targeting specific use-cases, so not here to criticize the tool, at all. Just the marketing. Why not talk about what&#39;s actually special and different about it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is news just because it&#39;s an Apple device being used for something that was already trivially possible.GPS trackers designed to be magnet-attached to a car which report their location via cell signal cost ~$20 on Amazon. You then tend to need to pay for either a SIM card or a subscription to the device maker&#39;s service 
-- bringing you up to about the cost of an AirTag. These are much harder to detect, as you might imagine.The Apple device does try to make itself less useful for abusive purposes. Nearby iPhones will notify you if there&#39;s an AirTag following you. Apple released an Android app to scan for them (manually -- it&#39;d probably be nice if they released something that did the same passive scanning as iPhones get, but there&#39;s battery trade-offs there, and obviously most people won&#39;t have that app). AirTags will also beep if they&#39;re separated from their owner.In fact, this is news we&#39;re hearing about because of the steps Apple took to make it harder to use these devices for bad purposes. The tweet author got a warning about the device following them.It&#39;s tricky to make something that lets you find where you dropped your keys while walking the dog that can&#39;t also be used for nefarious purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it’s theoretically possible that this happened, I think this particular story was made up. For a number of reasons: 1) How did the stalker know that that’s her car? She said she was on a night out. Unless she went back to her car all the time, he must have seen her arrive in it. 2) Sticking an AirTag to the inside of the front wheel well isn’t easy. There is dirt and grime there and the surfaces aren’t flat. The stalker would have had to use a very strong adhesive to make the AirTag stick while the car was moving. 3) While it’d be a smart idea to not drive home while a foreign AirTag tracks you, who is alert enough after a night out AND happens to have friends in the vicinity that you can wake up at what must have been a very late hour? 4) Her friend who found and removed the AirTag took no photo. Really?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting thing is that I have seen multiple reports of this ( think this is is the third), but in every case, they have destroyed it, lost it, or thrown it away before hand - not given it to the police.Apple can&#39;t tell who the devices is from signals in the wild, but they can figure out who it is if someone gives them the physical device. (Apple tracks the serial number of the device, and from what I understand, can provide purchaser/activator information based on the serial number)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Background: I&#39;m a qualified accountant, and have taught courses on accounting and finance.My thoughts on OP:I read through the first two parts of the first course on this site:- Part 1 Introduction to Accounting Basics, A Story for Relating to Accounting Basics- Part 2 Income StatementBased on what I read, I could not recommend this. You could get to the end of the &#39;income statement&#39; part, without encountering any definition of &#39;profit&#39;, which is the very thing that the income statement is meant to show.If you want a solid introduction to accounting, I&#39;d recommend Frank Wood&#39;s book &#34;Business Accounting 1&#34;. You don&#39;t need the latest (15th edition). The principles haven&#39;t changed. I used the 10th edition: Business Accounting Volume 1 https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0273681494/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a software engineer who moved into freelance consulting a few years ago (I do back-ends and front-ends for mobile and web, nothing finance specific other than occasional credit card payment integrations). It&#39;s been a roller-coaster in many regards and one of the highlights is having learned a lot about bookkeeping, taxes, financial planning and everything that comes with running a small business in general. (Aspects which I initially despised but now I&#39;ve accepted as necessary and doing them as routine.)During these years I started playing with the idea of training myself in basic/intermediate accounting and/or finance. The motivation is twofold: run my own business better (and maybe stop paying an accountant to do my taxes) and maybe work on software projects in finance (where I suspect there is good money to be made).I&#39;d be interested hearing stories from fellow software engineers who did similar training!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are other online resources to learn accounting. A lot of them are listed on https://hledger.org/accounting.html#accounting-links .https://www.dwmbeancounter.com/ is often mentioned on similar threads. People also like to link to beancount&#39;s manual http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/double-entry .But I agree with mindslight&#39;s comment. They all kinda suck. Reading an actual textbook like the top comment suggested is probably better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am Lithuanian; Lithuania&lt;-&gt;Taiwan&lt;-&gt;PRC conflict is frequently a topic of discussion these days among my peers.My position, shared by a few others, is that this is the next best thing that happened in Lithuania after leaving USSR: the first being joining NATO and EU in 2004.Everyone in the world can (and almost everyone do) endorse PRC. &#34;You won&#39;t get fired for picking IBM/Oracle/PRC&#34;. While very few countries have the guts and the internal political structure that allows opening a Taiwanese representative office. Lithuania shows that it prefers dealing with a country that takes the human rights into account; being the first one &#34;in the party&#34; to do so bring us significant advantages. Both Taiwanese investments and Lithuanian exports to Taiwan are picking up pace.This will hurt us in the short-term, sure. It already does: packages(/containers) from PRC are delayed or cancelled, invoices are not being paid, we are losing business there. In the long term, if we don&#39;t change our mind (not impossible), I think this is for the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Lithuanian hereMoral questions aside (as everyone here seems to focus on it), the people are split into roughly three camps: 
- Anti-vaxers: hate anything government because Vax-Pass, including the China oriented diplomacy
- Libtards: love anything government and worship the leader of the main party. They celebrate this and openly bash China because their Leader said that it is good 
- Non-involved people - worry about the economic consequences to businesses and people&#39;s lives. Most of them would have a hard time finding Taiwan (probably even China) on a blank map.In my opinion:Our Minister of Foreign Affairs went into this without really understanding what it would mean to the CCP and what possible counter-actions they can take. Lithuania was hit more than the politicians expected and we are, essentially, alone in this fight (save for endorsements and pats on the back). I guess that we will be in a pretty rough spot in short-term, while mid/long term can go either way depending on how the western powers and Taiwan will act."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks great, I love the clean GTK for this user interface. Say what you will about GTK and Gnome... for beginners on an operating system such as Ubuntu, having a consistent application concept is very important.Curious how this compares to Lutris[1]. I can see it has support for it as a runner, however as far as I can tell it achieves the same thing by maintaining separate wineprefixes.[1] https://lutris.net/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m confused...Crossover (a commercial product using Wine as its backend and contributes back to the Wine project[1]) uses the term &#34;bottles&#34; for its container-like method to install Windows apps on Linux and macOS. Is this an offshoot or extension of Crossover, or is it a blatant ripoff of their already existing service and name? Codeweavers (the makers of Crossover) have been using the term &#34;bottle&#34; in this paradigm since at least the late 2000s[2].[1] https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover#linux[2] https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/crossover-and-bottles.5..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a replacement for ye-olde PlayOnLinux, which if I ever move to Linux Desktop[0] was going to be something I would write my own tooling to replace[1].It is not clear from looking over the website, but since bottles appear closely related to Flatpak I am wondering if they support being installed to a different path than the default. Flatpak doesn&#39;t allow you to do this in a piecemeal way[2], but it does allow you to set up more than one entire Flatpak environment to different paths[3]. I&#39;m hoping bottles can at least manage that?[0] There are dozens of tools on my list for this, mostly around application and container management.[1] I am a very vocal critic of the way Linux Desktop does things, but Windows is becoming worse at an alarming rate so it will probably be the least-worst option in a few years.[2] A regression from features we had in desktop OSs since the 80s.[3] Not that any GUI frontend for it pays attention to that. sigh"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are three kinds of web developers:- Those who don&#39;t care about performance, as long as it loads within a few seconds on their own beefed up system on the LAN. This article is for them, and we can only hope they will listen.- Those who care about performance, and work for people who care. They are already doing great work (or are about to), producing those rare low-friction, high-speed, content-is-king sites which we all love.- Those who care about performance, but work for people who don&#39;t. Since the developer doesn&#39;t get to decide what to work on, they can either get cracking on feature #357, work on performance on the sly at the risk of losing their job, or quit. Not much of a choice, really, unless you have some other-worldly lax schedule and minimal oversight. And don&#39;t forget, if you are allowed to work on performance the burden is on you to prove how much faster things are with your changes (which can be really hard to show conclusively) and that your N days is worth more than Bob working N days on that sexy ticket #357.Substitute &#34;security&#34;, &#34;UX&#34;, or anything else you want for &#34;performance&#34;, it works the same way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; British soldiers in World War I were equipped with a Brodie helmet, a steel hat designed to protect its wearer from overhead blasts and shrapnel while conducting trench warfare. After its deployment, field hospitals saw an uptick in soldiers with severe head injuries.&gt; Because of the rise in injuries, British command considered going back to the drawing board with the helmet’s design. Fortunately, a statistician pointed out that the dramatic rise in hospital cases was because people were surviving injuries that previously would have killed them—before the introduction of steel the British Army used felt or leather as headwear material.I&#39;ve seen this same story except with warplanes during the War. Story goes that an allied air force tried to improve the percentage of planes that would return from a bombing raid, so they inspected returning planes, found the places where they had holes in them and added extra layers of steel to those areas for the next bomb run; but this had no improvement on the percentage of planes that returned.That is until a &#34;statistician&#34; realized that all of the places on the plane that they found holes in were actually parts of the plane that could get hit and survive and return. They then started adding extra steel to the parts of the planes they found no holes or damage assuming that if those parts were hit the plane would get shot down and not return. After this change they started seeing a dramatic increase in the amount of planes returning from a raid.Does anyone know the true source of these stories?Regardless, it really opened my eyes to how changing your perspective on the cause of the problem can help find the best solution, and to this day I still think of this story when solving a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just developers, and it&#39;s not just about speed, it&#39;s also designers / UX bods who need to heed this. My decently powered work laptop from job 1 has a fairly rubbish screen, which means that a lot of the subtle hover effects, 1 pixel light grey on lighter grey divisions and skinny fonts either aren&#39;t visible or are incredibly difficult to see. A good trick if you&#39;re working on a large, hi res screen is to have a small and crappy second monitor hooked up if you&#39;re doing any UI work so you can see what it will actually look like to a lot of your users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this sounds more like some sort of fingerprinting attempt. It good to see that random access to these kind of resources fails due to new(er) browser controls. However, this does not mean that the fingerprinting actually failed.There is probably some way to determine if the request was denied automatically by the browser or manually by the user (e.g., time to get &#34;response&#34;), which is definitely something which can be used for fingerprinting.Which reminds me of fingerprinting by tiny differences in the audio API provided by browsers [0]. Super interesting, but also a bit depressing. Also works for things like canvases and WebGL.EFF allows you to check how fingerprintable your browser is [1]. Do note that the results may not be very accurate.[0]: https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/[1]: https://coveryourtracks.eff.org"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not google, but a third party ad network serving ads through google.Google tries to sandbox the creatives in an attempt to prevent issues exactly like this, and develops browser features to prevent issues exactly like this.This is likely a script that somehow avoided google&#39;s malware scanning pipelines.This is definitely not google&#39;s malintent.Disclaimer: Ex googler, worked in ads, dealed with problems like this all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is concerned that an ad might be able to surreptitiously turn on the camera or microphone, but these are not accessible by default. In this case, it isn&#39;t even getting as far as a permissions prompt because the default Feature Policy doesn&#39;t allow camera or mic access in cross-origin iframes. (Ex, for Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-se...)   Instead, I think the most likely thing happening here is that an advertiser is running a script that is trying to do fingerprinting, and which is blocked by the browser protection.(That it&#39;s an iframe running on https://[random].safeframe.googlesyndication.com tells us it&#39;s an ad served through Google Ad Manager, and the contents of the iframe are supplied by the advertiser.)Disclosure: I work for Google, speaking only for myself"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people mocking the author or others for being scared and worried are basically blaming the victim here, and I would like them to stop.The nature of legal practices in the USA is such that the answers to &#34;Are you totally in the clear legally?&#34; and &#34;Will you lose significant amounts of money proving in random courts that you are in the clear legally?&#34; are often both yes.As a result, any researchers who send out thinly veiled legal threats as a &#34;research experiment&#34; are firmly in the wrong ethically, and should be called out by all the people to whom they have issued these veiled threats. Review boards that approved this experiment should be themselves subjected to an audit and potentially dissolved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone help me understand the ethical problem here? If I as an ordinary citizen contacted the webmaster with a similar worded email, the result would have been the same. The fact is that this “experiment” did not create any more or additional stress than is created for normal citizens/businesses simply engaging in normal legal activities. If submitting such a request has the potential to cause such undue stress, shouldn&#39;t society create protections or disallow such requests?Edit: It&#39;s not that hard to see that there are potentially some social problems here e.g. &#34;the message is easily construed as a legal threat&#34; or &#34;the message was mass mailed in a spam-like nature&#34;. However, my comment is in response to the title of the blog post which implies that the webmaster believes there&#39;s an ethical problem that this &#34;experiment&#34; was even run in the first place. For the purpose of this thread, assume the email was worded perfectly and the university was very thoughtful and deliberate in who they contacted. I&#39;m interested in discussing the ethics behind how a perfectly legal and reasonable thing can in one case be ethical and another case be unethical simply by virtue of the context in which the action was carried out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, it is a workers market right now.Professionally there is nothing special about me except that I really enjoy working, but for the last two remote jobs, the offer letter I received was more than what I verbally agreed on with HR. Since I am also 70 years old, I take this as good evidence of how pro-worker the job market is right now.I offer free mentoring (see my web site) and always talk about the importance to having a beginner’s/learner’s mind. I think that what companies want is: prioritizing the company’s interests, being flexible, and being observant looking for opportunities to improve the business. Fairly straightforward strategy.Good luck reaching your financial goals/salary number but also please remember money isn’t everything, and is much less important than our relationships with other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You just need to apply for roles with public companies that offer liquid equity. Very few of us are getting 250k+ on base salary alone. Most of us have the salary bands you’re already in, but have additional equity pay on top. It doesn’t have to be a FAANG either. There are loads of public companies out there hiring engineers at 250k total comp."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Leverage.If your work improves the productivity of 100+ other people, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If your work saves $500k+ in annual costs, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If hiring you cripples key competitors, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If you can enable new revenues streams through knowledge that only you have, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If hiring you does not increase productivity, reduce costs, fend off competition, or bring in more revenue, then you&#39;ll be fighting an uphill battle to justify that salary. But if you do, talk about it. People gossip and those companies who have the biggest multiplier to benefit off your work will be working hard to reach you.In my opinion, remote or not is less important than you think. The key decisions will be based on whether hiring you at that price is a net positive for the company or not.EDIT: And if you&#39;re outside of the US, set up a local LLC so that US-based companies can treat you like an independent contracting business. That&#39;ll make it much easier to hire you across borders. And at that price, you can surely afford the $1000 annually for a tax advisor retainer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has lead a devops team, and still has a devops team reporting to me, I have also struggled with the idea of having a team called devops, since it does go against the devops philosophy of devs owning their software in production.However, in our case (and probably many others), our devops team is responsible for creating and maintaining the tools and processes that allow the dev teams to manage their systems in production. At a larger organization, it doesn’t make since for each individual dev team to have to create and maintain their own deployment and management systems… that would end up with a lot of duplicated effort and a wide variety of systems that would need to be maintained. Devops creates the tools and procedures, and dev teams use them.You might say this is just sysops, but I think the key difference is that the dev teams are the ones who are using the production management tools, not the sysops team. Devops is not the ones who are paged if a system has an issue, the dev team who owns it is paged. Devops is only paged if the tool that the dev team is using to handle the issue has issues itself."</p>

I used to develop in a great IDE with debugging, right click re-run failed tests, I could follow the console right there in a nice, clean window integrated with my IDE, click on stack traces, etc.Now I&#39;m running my app via multiple docker images, trying to get a buggy remote debugger protocol to work (no local variables, wtff?) where I have to coordinate the container and the IDE, command line wrangling / using print debugging in the container to chase down stuff, digging around through multiple log files, copying-and-pasting stack traces into my IDE to analyze, which kinda works in some cases since the file paths are different, and on and on.DevOps came and took my nice dev environment away, and I am mad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to basically give up my full time role as a Data Engineer who is supposed to solve &#34;big data&#34; problems (Storage, Streaming, Machine Learning pipelines) etc, and had to solely focus on DevOps because there was no other expert in the team.We (a colleague and I) basically learned Terraform, then Kubernetes, and then Helm in an extremely stressful environment. I wouldn&#39;t recommend that to most people. (Also, I can hear &#34;you don&#39;t need k8s&#34;, but tbh, it makes the difficult things possible, and that&#39;s what we needed).I&#39;ve done Ops in bare-metal environments before, and at least there, even if there were new skills to learn, the environment just wasn&#39;t so hostile for beginners, and the learning curve was simpler.The YAML (or heaven forbid, jsonnet) does *not* help. TBH, I&#39;m convinced if the IaC bits were done in a regular Java/Go/Rust SDK style instead of mixing and matching YAML glued together via labels and tags, I would have had a much easier time.The positive side of that is that now the IaC bits are mature enough that even the Data Scientists in our team write their own Terraform code, and I&#39;ve upskilled myself quite a lot. I&#39;m slowly going back to solving Storage/Data/ML issues, which I enjoy a lot more.Maybe I&#39;m just becoming a cranky Software Dev as I enter my 30s. I do _not_ enjoy reading YAML."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, the special part is truly viewing any job as just that: a job.I no longer assess my worth as a person as a function of job title, salary, or anything else.I take contracting work primarily and expect absolutely nothing more than a paycheck. Work is a transaction and I deliver what I can and am not a jerk.Almost every disposable penny goes toward physical fitness. My spouse happens to be cut from the same cloth, which is a big plus.We don&#39;t live extravagantly unless you count the money for fitness, but we consider that to be an investment and not a frivolous expense.Satisfaction in life for me comes from every angle EXCEPT my job, and that&#39;s my secret."</p>

Become an artist, author, clown, or build some awesome technical system because you want it to exist. GPL it.Don&#39;t ask for anything, especially not happiness, from your &#34;career&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will just add one point regarding health and sedentarism. Going completely remote saved about 2 hours a day from commute. This is big. This is not just 2 hours, but at the end of those 2 hours you won&#39;t be in a mood to do pretty much anything. I ended up working out for 30 mins and going on a long 90 min walk everyday. People tend to think 2 hours of physical activity is a lot and &#39;too much&#39;, but given how sitting oriented our jobs are - I don&#39;t believe this is the case. I don&#39;t even walk to get a lunch, once you wear a fitbit or some such device this becomes so clear how much of a sitting oriented life we have acquired. Also when I was monitoring weight, bp and other such parameters - nothing other than 2 hours made any dent. So 2 hours it is. Just wanted to add this perspective. Hope it helps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m going to put some of the blame on the Denver government/police for this, but not for a lack of enforcement. If your bike is impounded or stolen and recovered it is nearly impossible to retrieve it. You cannot call to see if it was picked up. You cannot look for it online. You have to show up to their sketchy office during business hours, wait in line, and ask the guy to go look through all the bikes and try to find yours. With hundreds of bikes it almost certainly will not be found.The government auctions off some of the bikes and gives or sells the rest of the bikes to charity.Two years ago my bike was locked in a location it should not have been downtown along with many other bikes. When I came back to find my bike missing the police officer said all of the bikes were impounded. I called around, went to the impound place twice.. but my bike was never found.In short, great investigation work by bike index. But their efforts are hindered by the city."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In early high school, we&#39;d ride bikes to the local coffee shop, lean them against the big windows out front and hangout. Somehow, no one noticed when mine was snatched one evening. I was pretty devastated.My grandfather drove me around the town the next day to see if I could spot it. When we were about to give up, I noticed a bike leaning along side a house near the shop. I could see it from the street. It looked exactly like mine. It had the same replacement seat and even a curly bike lock coiled around the handlebars on the same side I left it. But it had been hastily spray pained.We called the police, they arrived and a kid inside noticed the commotion and came out. They had found the bike at the shop and took it. I went to inspect it. I was very surprised when I found the small yard behind the house was packed with around fifty bikes. To the cop, I said something like, &#34;there&#39;s tons of bikes back here!&#34; I then remembered another friend had theirs stolen as well.He didn&#39;t look for himself, and said I couldn&#39;t just take the bike. There was no proof it was mine. So, I said, &#34;what if I can unlock the bike lock?&#34; I could and was allowed to take it, but it had been ruined. My prized shiny bike had been banged up and spray painted.The following week my mother read me a letter that had arrived. The town would not be prosecuting the kid. I was confused. I did nothing wrong and stayed out of trouble myself. Did their actions not warrant any consequences?My mother ended up going to the police department and insisting the town prosecute, which they ended up doing. I&#39;m not sure what happened. Did the consequences dissuade them from stealing a 51st bike? Their family had failed them, would their community? If not for religion, what hope did they have?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked to see if they have been sentenced, but instead found this about the fence of the group:&#34;Adrian Rocha Chairez is charged with 31 felony counts including racketeering. Police say he headed up an organized crime ring responsible for more than a million dollars in damaged property and stolen cars and bikes. He was indicted in Denver, where a judge set bond at $500,000.A Boulder judge knocked it down to $10,000. He walked out even after prosecutors noted he had weapons and ties to Mexico.&#34;[0] https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/12/08/boulder-pr-bonds-murr..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HN represents a wellspring of deeper reading than is generally afforded by the current entertainment cruft portals of the web - reddit, FB, insta, USA today, financial times, etc etc down to the SEO hellholes of recipe sites, youtube product placement; you get the idea.  Let&#39;s appreciate HN for the quality of reading material and its curb on our drift to the rest of the &#39;popular&#39; web.  And I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in always keeping an eye out for the next serious hub of real reading material!That said I don&#39;t read nearly as many books as I did in high school.  Books are wonderful things and can be a portal to a novel frame of mind.  But then again my life is much busier these days and there are more demands on my time which are not responsibly ignored... So I cherish HN as a flourishing intellectual community, in easily digestible chunks.  A bit like the &#34;periodical&#34; era of newspapers a century or two ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way to cure this is to develop a habit that severely limits undirected online browsing and socializing. Part of it is just an education of your own aesthetic sentiments. I read James Clear&#39;s &#34;Atomic Habits&#34; (not that this is a special book, I was just on another kick in which I really needed to improve my productivity and picked up a suggestion to use a physical counter of some kind to make a habit stick.I bought a bunch of marbles, and for every bloc of time that I avoid undirected browsing or social media use, I move a marble from one container to the other. My goal every day is to get through an arbitrary number of marbles (160 right now), after which I can do whatever. If I slip up and open a social media page, HN, or start browsing newspapers, I dump all the marbles out of the container, which generally makes it impossible to meet the day&#39;s goal unless the slipup is very early in the day.This has been nothing short of amazing for my life. One issue that I had is I had a physical twitch that would start developing after a couple minutes doing one thing, like a work project, at which I would feel the urge to check the news or social media. This twinge would show up and I would type into a browser window to relieve the sensation. Instead I more or less replaced that twinge with moving the marble from one container to the other. It&#39;s made it a lot easier to focus. Over time, I stopped caring as much about the news and became more easily satisfied by very briefly reading summaries every few days.I think a lot of web addiction is less driven by thoughts or brain issues and more by physical habits akin to nail-biting or cuticle-picking. Most of the attempts that I&#39;ve made to stop addictive behavior have not worked: they were based on schedules, timers, articulated goals, and other things like that rather than recognizing the physical trigger for the habit, the result of that trigger, and just redirecting the stimulus with another physical action rather than trying to suppress it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Socrates famously hated the written form, not because it was technologically advanced for its time, but because it was &#34;dead&#34;: you can&#39;t have a conversation with a piece of writing, or ask the author to explain something that&#39;s on the page.I disagree (and agree, indirectly, with the OP): deadness is a feature, not a bug. The problem with Internet writing is not just its addictive nature, it&#39;s groupthink. It is too much alive. You have to either follow popular opinion, or oppose it vehemently; tangential or orthogonal thinking is almost impossible.Books, because they are not part of an immediate, global conversation where people share opinions and judgements and signal their virtue to one another, are something very different and allow for a very different experience than any written text found online.Maybe books will slowly fade; but I think it&#39;s unlikely they would ever completely disappear, as they offer something unique not found anywhere else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the study&#39;s FAQ[0]:&gt; Did an Institutional Review Board consider this study?&gt; We submitted an application detailing our research methods to the Princeton University Institutional Review Board, which determined that our study does not constitute human subjects research.From the social experiment[as reported by OP&#39;s link]:&gt; I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within 45 days of this email, as required by Section 1798.130 of the California Civil Code.I&#39;m pretty sure most people would find that to be a thinly veiled threat of a lawsuit. I&#39;d like to know if the review board considered the text of the email that the &#34;researchers&#34;[1] intended to send and the fact that they were likely to send it to individuals instead of solely publicly traded companies.[0] https://archive.md/cSDGT[1] Seems to fall more under experimental psychology to me https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology?wprov=..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is interesting in the study web page (https://privacystudy.cs.princeton.edu/) that they consistently mention contacting &#34;websites&#34; instead of &#34;people.&#34; As if a website is some autonomous thing that can communicate with a researcher.I wouldn&#39;t be sleeping well if I were involved in this study. There is no way an IRB could determine that this is not human subjects research if you&#39;re emailing people and asking them anything.If I want to ask random people about the weather and publish the results in a journal, that qualifies as human subjects research and IRB protocols must be followed. Emailing people asking about privacy policies is definitely human subjects research. Either they misrepresented the study in their IRB application, or the IRB didn&#39;t do due diligence reviewing the application."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here! A few updates since this was published two years ago:- The service mentioned (now called https://webapp.io ) eventually made it into YC (S20) and still uses postgres as its pub/sub implementation, doing hundreds of thousands of messages per day. The postgres instance now runs on 32 cores and 128gb of memory and has scaled well.- We bolstered Postgres&#39;s PUBLISH with Redis pub/sub for high traffic code paths, but it&#39;s been nice having ACID guarantees as the default for less popular paths (e.g., webhook handling)- This pattern only ever caused one operational incident, where a transaction held a lock which caused the notification queue to start growing, and eventually (silently) stop sending messages, starting postgres with statement_timeout=(a few days) was enough to solve thisPrevious discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21484215Happy to answer any questions!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had thought about using postgres as a job queue before, but I couldn&#39;t figure out in my head how to make sure two processes didn&#39;t both take the same job. The &#34;FOR UPDATE&#34; and &#34;SKIP LOCKED&#34; were the keys to make this work in the article. Essentially, as far as I can tell, &#34;SELECT FOR UPDATE&#34; locks the rows as they&#39;re selected (locks are apparently visible outside the transaction), and &#34;SKIP LOCKED&#34; skips over rows for the select that other transactions have locked. Cool stuff.The below article goes over some downsides to using postgres for a job queue: namely that the data model isn&#39;t optimized to find and send new jobs to large numbers of subscribers. Actual messaging systems like Kafka/NATS are better at this.https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-lock...Also, there are things that the dedicated messaging systems give you that postgres won&#39;t, such as transparent error handling and retry logic. If your worker grabs a job from postgres and fails (in some kind of transient way such that the task should be retried), you&#39;ll have to implement the retry logic yourself. A streaming platform like Kafka or NATS will notice that you haven&#39;t acknowledged the message and deliver it to someone else.This is something you could pretty easily implement yourself with something like a process that just scans over the &#34;processing&#34; jobs and looks for timeouts, resetting them as it goes. But there are probably a few of these little papercuts that Kafka-like (…Kafkaesque?) systems would handle for you.So, I guess if you already have postgres set up in a reliable way, and there&#39;s no one around whose job it is to set up new production systems like Kafka, and you don&#39;t already have something like Kafka, and you only need basic job queue requirements or you&#39;re okay with implementing whatever you need on top of postgres yourself, and your incoming job rate is fewer than maybe a thousand per second, and you have fewer than maybe tens of consumers… postgres is probably a decent job queue.The above paragraph seems snide but it probably does describe many people&#39;s environments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the key concept here is atomicity. If some API is responsible for creating a job, storing it in the database AND publishing it can never be an atomic operation. Both the database and pub/sub servers are separate network connections from the application server. For example, if you save the record first and then publish, It&#39;s quite possibe that you save the record in the database and then lose the connection to the pub/sub server when publishing. If this happens, you can never know if the pub/sub server received the request and published it. In systems where it&#39;s critical to guarantee that a record was saved and guarantee that it was published as well, the only way to do that is by using a single external connection - in this case to a Postgres DB. We&#39;ve used the same setup on an AWS RDS t2.medium machine to process over 600 records/second."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There seem to be two camps here:- Bose is an evil megacorp who recklessly endangered its customers by selling dangerous and poorly designed products.- Accidents happen and when a device explodes on your head you should accept it as a fact of life and move on.  The chemical burns are nothing and OP is a pussy.I think the reality may be different.  My take on it is that Li batteries possess inherent dangers and it is incumbent upon manufacturers to take reasonable steps to mitigate the dangers while informing their consumers of the risk.  Unfortunately, even when presented with the risks, most folks are unable to comprehend the probabilities and consequences and will nearly always choose convenience, features and value over the avoidance of danger.  It seems we, as a society(not as individuals, as some will surely object) have chosen Li technology and deemed it safe enough to deploy ubiquitously.I hope a review of this incident will shed light on the safety practices followed by Bose and will inform future engineers of unforeseen risks, giving us all safer, convenient devices.Overall I find the discussions in this thread unbecoming of the types of folks I thought frequented HN.  I hope we can all strive to elevate the dialogue and treat each other with a moderate amount of respect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be good to see an autopsy, to find out if it&#39;s actually the battery that went into thermal runaway, or something else that shorted and dumped all of its energy.I have no idea how much heavy metals I&#39;ve been exposed to by inhaling the toxic smoke. I don&#39;t know how much smoke my pregnant wife inhaled. I worry how much chemical residue is on my desk, floor, walls, how much is getting recycled by my HVAC system, how much exposure my pets had.That sort of paranoia doesn&#39;t help. In fact it may cause psychosomatic symptoms (nocebo effect). You&#39;ve probably inhaled far worse if you&#39;ve ever been to a barbeque, gas station, or just took a walk in one of the more crowded areas of the city."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re up for it, I suggest:1) Find a lawyer. I&#39;d guess that personal injury lawyer is the right kind, and that you can easily find one who works on contingency.2) File a complaint with the consumer product safety commission, and any other applicable government agencies. The lawyer may be able to help with this.You deserve compensation for this, and I wish you all the best with extracting it. I hope you recover soon.Also: Take photos and document everything. A massive number of photos, of the damage to your house and your body and anything else you can think of. This will help with the lawyer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, I genuinely do not get the &#34;controversy&#34; over the Veritasium video. AFAIU, the entire point of the video was to show that electricity travels not through wires but via electric fields (&#34;through the air&#34; so to speak).To illustrate this, he sets up an experiment with parameters such that the conclusion can only mean that some electricity has traveled to the bulb before any could arrive through/around the wires.He sets up the parameters so that the bulb would turn on by that little electricity; but that is obviously just a visual sign, and his point is valid no matter how much electricity traveled to bulb under whatever different parameters.It kinda feels like most people are missing the actual point of the video."</p>

This is how our cellphones, wifi, GPS, RFID works. So, even if you disconnect the bulb and the switch you can create  a current in the bulb by turning on and off the switch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why wouldn&#39;t a simpler explanation be that the wires produce a radio/electromagnetic wave and that wave gets picked up and induces a current, which is how radio transmitters receivers work?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I picked up a Kinesis a few month ago and it&#39;s been a life changer. I&#39;ve struggled with shoulder pain since as far back as I can remember. I&#39;d done PT, dry needling, massage, etc etc. I&#39;d even sprung for a personal ergonomic assessment. I&#39;m a cyclist and and keyboard jockey, so most of my waking life is spent in positions that seemed to make it worse. At times it prevented me from sleeping, doing things I enjoyed, etc.  I wear a 42 jacket, so I&#39;m not crazy wide or anything.I&#39;d never seen anything that suggested that split keyboards were a good solve for the shoulder pain but I&#39;d reached that point of just throwing shit at a wall because it was that, or find a new career and hobbies. Moving my keyboard so my forearms can sit slightly wider than perpendicular to my chest has almost completely resolved the shoulder pain and the impact was almost immediate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to all the comments from Advantage fans here, I also wanted to add that Kinesis has been an awesome company. I tweeted about some mods I made to my Advantage keyboard a long time ago, and they invited me to their office and donated a bunch of keyboards to the nonprofit I work for, to give as prizes to students (even before they launched the gaming-focused brand)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a Kinesis user for 8 years, starting with an Advantage USB, added a classic PS2(with a usb adapter) as a backup and then was a tester for the Advantage 2 which I ended up buying. A company I worked for gave me a choice for keyboards when I joined so I tried a Ergodox EZ with the RGB backlighting.General observations:1. Overall I prefer the Advantage over the Ergodox. The big reason is the contoured design and the fact that the Ergodox tends to walk around unless you have a solid desk pad underneath it. Also, the Ergodox never felt as comfortable as the Advantage. Yes the Advantage is not as easy to travel with but still....
2. I like the new design, but there are a few things that would have made the pro perfect. PBT backlit keycaps like they offer on the Ergodox-EZ and RGB backlighting...and maybe a set of f-keys (on the fence with the last one).One other thing... A mix of o-rings and QMX clips made a huge difference with the feel of the keyboard for me. I have been a cherry brown user from the beginning though and different people have different preferences with that.Kinesis is also really good about providing parts and service. I&#39;ve had them send me replacement switches and have seen them offer up in-expensive replacement boards to repair and keep older models going.I&#39;m going to buy one of these, but given that I already have 4 high quality mechanical keyboards and I have yet to have one die I am starting to feel guilty having all of these laying around. That said there is a side of me that is curious about the Keyboard.io :)"</p>

I&#39;m fairly old and this was my first attempt at contributing to open source. Is this the way it goes typically? I imagine they get a lot of people with b.s. pull requests so they get jaded.

As users of your free software since ~20 years, we&#39;re sure that, if this vuln disclosure had been better and there were no sign of widespread in-the-wild exploitation, you would have done a better job at patching it, and a single release would have been enough.We won&#39;t hold a grudge against you; open source means collaboration, and you don&#39;t blame hard-working people that give away their software for free for honest mistakes. Your software still did far more good than bad to the software world.Thanks!"</p>

 I am sick of reading of very senior people complaining about the impact this vulnerability has had on their week when their companies don’t even contribute a penny to open source projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see plenty of comments about security teams that should be doing this or that.I do not know about your security teams, but my security teams are now sitting 9 days straight trying to stop that shitshow. With teams complaining that they have to patch instead of doing Great Things.After that these security teams will be back to invisible work and forgotten again. Until the next issue.If your company has a truly different approach to security, tell it here - you may get really talented people knocking in because they are fed up with the security theater at their current job."</p>

.- Delay answering as long as possible.- Answer with a question.- Request more information than required to answer an inquiry.- Attempt redirection to other people or resources.- Involve as many people as possible- Rebuke the inquirer when they follow up on a previous unanswered inquiry within an arbitrary time window (days, not hours).- When asked multiple questions, answer only only of them, ignoring all others. Wait to be prompted to answer each question individually.- When asked multiple questions, answer the least important or time sensitive question first.- Ignore all information provided besides the single question being answered.- Prefer slower or more onerous communication methods
  1. snail mail

Ben Torrell (an OBS developer) notes later in the thread that there is indeed GPL code compiled into TikTok&#39;s executables; since source is not available and they have not got another license, it is unlicensed and hence illegal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In addition to the points raised by BMJ and in the comments below, there is a limit to what independent fact checking can accomplish. For example, are their fact checkers conducting their own scientific experiments validating claims and outcomes of a scientific paper? Are fact checkers reaching out to sources from a news article and verifying quoted information? When “breaking news” or “scoops” are reported presenting totally new information about the world, how can that be verified against other information that - by virtue of something being new - cannot be verified by other preexisting sources?If the fact checking process is limited to verification based on other information that is currently available, and if the fact checking process cannot distinguish between factual information and the opinions people hold as a result of that information, the outcome will be an inevitable echo chamber that reinforces currently dominant views or whatever preexisting biases are present.In short, fact checking is hard and there is a reason why reputable publishing outlets have their own internal fact verification processes before something gets published (including safeguards and retractions, because they make mistakes too), and why news is separated out from opinion-editorial pages... even if it is in style to add opinions (read: “perspective”) to every article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Both Facebook (now Meta) and Youtube bungled their fact checking by disabling posts and videos that were counter to some narrative, but not factually incorrect.  That places them in a bad position, and they need to be called out publicly, as no other mechanism so far has pushed them towards more accurate fact checking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Praise, 2 suggestions and a question.Color coding OOM (order-of-magnitude) is smart, but the colors chosen seem quite hard to distinguish. Consider picking different default colors; also consider adding a redundant representation of scale, like an integer representing OOM scale.It is strange that a thoughtful design around OOM would also choose keep so many digits. If the goal is to summarize, then please throw those extra digits away. (e.g. 10.3992s is specifying the time down to the millisecond, but those extra ms are not meaningful at the second time scale.)What is this about the runtime polling tasks? Does that happen in Tokio? Why? I am only familiar with 2 async runtimes (node, vert.x) and I was under the impression that neither of these &#34;poll their threads&#34; in any meaningful way. Threads (or process or fiber or whatever you want to call it in this context) never initiate action on their own. They are ALWAYS waiting for something to happen to them, and that includes timeouts, which would be triggered by passing a thread a clock tick. The runtime&#39;s job is to centrally manage resources that must persist between thread behavior, so at most it is going to be polling external resources, and not it&#39;s own threads.Or maybe I don&#39;t understand what polling means here? I would interpret it as meaning &#34;keep checking a well-known place for changes, and then do something if a change is found&#34;. But since async threads can&#39;t initiate any change on their own, this is nonsensical."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Real wages have been flat since the 1970s (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us...). &#34;Okay, so people&#39;s living standards are about the same since 1970?&#34; Not even close. The problem with inflation is that its calculation is fraught with all kinds of selective weighting, bias, and politics. Take a look at the relative differences between the things which have decreased and increased in cost in real terms (https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/5/29/saupload_i...). Okay, so TVs and cellphones are cheaper, but necessities like college, childcare, and healthcare are up significantly.And when you drill in more, there are other issues. For example, the housing metric appears relatively flat in real terms, right? Except, that doesn&#39;t tell the story for the majority of Americans. Housing costs are WAY up in cities as Americans migrate to where the jobs are, while housing costs are down in all the areas where jobs are disappearing. In practise, housing costs are actually significantly up for most Americans, but because the CPI is calculated across the entire nation, the government can claim inflation is low. This allow them to keep the fed rate low, which keeps stock valuations high. This LOOKS great and generates great headlines, but the reality is that most Americans are significantly worse off since the 1970s.And then we come to the other elephant in the room: why are real wages flat? Given the incredible performance of the American economy since 1970, shouldn&#39;t real wages be significantly UP? This is yet another reminder that wealth is being squeezed from the bottom and funnelled straight up. As a non-American, it&#39;s heartbreaking to see efforts to unify the underclass completely derailed by this ridiculous race war. Poor people in America have FAR more in common with each other than the rich, no matter race. I really hope you all manage to set aside the obvious red herring of race and unite in tackling your staggering wealth inequality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had an all-hands meeting recently where we got to submit anonymous questions.  One of the questions was &#39;with inflation rising at 6%, will the company reconsider their &#39;standard&#39; 2% raise?&#39;  The lady answering looks dead in the camera and goes &#39;Honestly? No&#39; and goes on to talk about how we&#39;re reasonably competitive with the local market.  Hey, credit where credit is due, at least she was a refreshingly straight shooter.  It pretty much let everyone on the call know what they needed to do if they wanted a good raise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who does OK, but lives in reality (not the bay area), I feel a revolution coming.  I hope it&#39;s not a violent one, but who knows at this point.  Hopefully it&#39;s just a politician with big policy changes.People feel completely disenfranchised.  You keep hanging housing over their head but just out of reach like some baby toy, then inflation spikes everything else.  What&#39;s the point of working even?I don&#39;t know the solution, but I don&#39;t have a good feeling about the next 10 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish I could say I stopped buying things off Amazon for ethical reasons, but the truth is, I stopped buying because if you look closely at the reviews, you realize that almost everything for sale there is now a scam or a knock-off. This was a slow creep for awhile, but now the problem has grown exponentially. Amazon is what Canal Street was in the 90s - somewhere to buy fakes, stolen goods, and electronics that might catch fire.Amazon has no interest in fixing this problem, because they know that well over half their &#34;inventory&#34; is now from knockoffs, IP theft and/or bait-and-switch scams. it&#39;s almost impossible to find items there anymore that are not fake, whether it&#39;s re-packaged hard drives or &#34;pyrex&#34; bowls that explode in the microwave.One way to look at this, and the way I think Amazon must look at it, is that it&#39;s not any worse than a third world night market. The attitude of vendors in, e.g. Phnom Penh or Mexico City markets is that the very fact that stupid Americans think they&#39;re going to get &#34;real&#34; goods just proves how much they deserve to be scammed. Amazon is actually helping baffled Americans to finally understand what the third world has always known - unboxing is going to be disappointing. Everything you think is affordable is probably fake, and you can&#39;t trust the packaging. Only the rich get actual brand products. As America degrades, people will start to get more savvy and more cynical about this, but right now it&#39;s still a newish phenomenon and people are shocked, shocked! to find out the kids toys they bought are full of toxic chemicals that we ourselves shipped overseas for burial or &#34;recycling&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand what Amazon thinks it&#39;s doing with its legions of data scientists, analysts, product managers and engineers that they consider so much more important than solving this problem, which will destroy their reputation long-term and create space for a competitor.At this rate, Amazon will be on its way to becoming Yelp -- untrusted, irrelevant, ultimately deserted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally experienced this. I bookmarked a keyboard I was interested in purchasing in a month or so. When I went back it was a completely different item with the same reviews. Just today in fact, I was looking for an office chair seat cushion and found a very telling reddit comment from 3 years ago[1].I know Amazon has a bulletproof return policy for the most part but I don&#39;t want to be hassled with returning everything. This just results in me just not using Amazon. You may be able to justify it for large purchases because of Amazon&#39;s return policy but for something as mundane as a can opener or seat cushion? Just shop elsewhere.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/a72co8/seat_cushi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a load of nonsense in the comments here today.* Drata is a vendor that helps a company navigate your SOC2 compliance process, by organizing all the controls and helping you gather evidence that you have done so. For instance, they&#39;ll connect with Github and make sure everyone with access to your repos is a company employee. If you don&#39;t use Drata you have to gather this evidence yourself, repeatedly over months, and it&#39;s a pain.* The Drata agent is a pretty innocuous thing. It checks you have done things like turn on disk encryption, have updates enabled, and that the screen locks if you walk away. It does NOT monitor employee&#39;s activities. These kind of security checks are incredibly common and are required for certifications like ISO27001 and SOC2. SOC2 is not really optional for large enough b2b SaaS.* The poster says &#34;Their business model (in my case) seems to be to take money from companies to spy on their employees/contractors, and then they sell the employees/contractors private information to &#34;targeted advertising&#34;.Do you have any evidence for this?? I&#39;ve just been involved in selecting Drata as a vendor for SOC2 compliance planning for our company. If this is true it&#39;s a huge deal and totally against my understanding of their business model. It honestly sounds like bullshit to me! But if you have evidence that they do this, please let us know.* As a freelancer, whether you are required to install security monitoring software is definitely an open question. If you&#39;re delivering work separately and not connected to company systems, then ok. If you&#39;re basically just acting like any other employee, and connected to the company systems, then you will probably have to do this. Because otherwise they would fail SOC2 and managing your legal status as &#34;Freelancer&#34; vs &#34;Employee&#34; (for tax reasons??) is not worth not being certified."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh this all brings back memories, of Sococo in the 2000&#39;s. We faced all these problems and had similar solutions to them all.We even had a rapidly adapting network make-and-break recovery layer. You unplug your laptop from a wired connection, switch to wireless - we recovered in milliseconds. You heard barely a click.The encryption issue is fun - we had a rotate-key message in-band. The receiver loaded new keys and tried them in sequence to ease the turnover time - out-of-order packets etc could make it ambiguous for a short while which key to use. A cache and aging keys out made it work pretty well.Remixing on user stations proved to be problematic (mentioned elsewhere on this thread). You&#39;d think if 6 people at one site were conferencing with a dozen elsewhere, you could elect one at each site to mix-and-forward. But corporate networks made it hard to determine who was &#39;adjacent&#39; - they were often layered and without uPNP (is that what the router protocol is called?) you couldn&#39;t tell if somebody at the next desk was even in your company.We had up to 100 people in a conference, and our enter-the-conference time was on the order of 100ms. Click into an all-hands, and be able to hear everybody before you finger left the mouse button. It was wonderful.Sococo today is a sad shadow of that. They went open-source and lost all our IP instantly. Just another WebRTC client last I knew."</p>

The pace at which the team advances is incredible, as it seems Apple support is minimal...Maybe the core tech users is negligible to Apple, but it shouldn&#39;t be: Winning over the power users generally precedes larger adoption and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Macs continue to gain market share in the years to come with their CPU lead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Do people regularly run into coworkers like me during their career and simply ignore it because they find it too awkward to criticize them? Have I just been incredibly lucky and every boss I have had is too incompetent to notice? Do I have imposter syndrome and I am actually a 10x developer whose laziness makes them a 1x developer?Lazy developers don&#39;t really bother me, if you do a couple hours of high-quality work a week I&#39;d have no complaint. (Many weeks I do as little, some weeks I do a decent amount of real work :) The problem is developers making negative progress, usually messes that need to be cleaned up ... and it&#39;s an awkward situation, no matter your relative authority. I&#39;m in the &#34;we should consider them lines spent, not lines produced&#34; camp.An old disputed quote:&gt; I divide my officers into four classes as follows: The clever, the industrious, the lazy, and the stupid. Each officer always possesses two of these qualities.&gt; Those who are clever and industrious I appoint to the General Staff. Use can under certain circumstances be made of those who are stupid and lazy. The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest leadership posts. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity for difficult decisions. But whoever is stupid and industrious must be got rid of, for he is too dangerous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there&#39;s also something to be said for passive processing.Sometimes I&#39;ll know I need to write some code or some function and I&#39;ll just think about it in the back of my head while doing other things, sometimes for a whole day or two. Then I&#39;ll sit down and write it in like 20-30 minutes. Did I work 20-30 minutes, or have I been working for a day or two? I would say a day or two, and the 20-30 minutes was the time needed to produce the deliverable of that work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have never done what you describe, except perhaps in times of illness when it was understood that working less was a reasonable accommodation (in that particular case, I had leftover brain fog from general anesthesia).I&#39;ve never heard of any colleagues doing it either. I would never snitch if it happened, but I would certainly consider that person untrustworthy or think that they have an undisclosed condition that is between them and HR.As you covered in your post, we don&#39;t write code 8 hours a day. This is normal. Meetings, context switch and times when focus is unachievable are expected and mostly understood by my experienced management. So are times when we are monitoring technology advancement and keeping an eye on the industry and community (e.g. lurking at HN but not overly posting and commenting) and times of social activity between workers (e.g. talking about the weekend).Most of us take mental health breaks between meetings and need to take time to think through issues. Many also need to periodically break focus to think about personal life issues or hobbies. As long as you generally strive to work, this is not a problem either.But walking into a stand-up and then lying about your day? To me, that&#39;s unethical.The real question to me is:Do you do that on purpose or is this something that happens even if you are trying to focus? There are many conditions, from stress and anxiety to diagnosed mental health issues that can prevent you from focusing. Burn-outs and bore-outs also come to mind.In my eyes, the fact that you asked the community about it shows that you have some form of concern towards that behavior. Would you say it is negatively impacting your life?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder why no one ever talks about architectures in the middle between those two - modular monoliths.The point in time where you&#39;re splitting your codebase up in modules (or maybe are a proponent of hexagonal architecture and have designed it that way from the beginning), leading to being able to put functionality behind feature flags. That way, you can still run it either as a single instance monolith, or a set of horizontally scaled instances with a few particular feature flags enabled (e.g. multiple web API instances) and maybe some others as vertically scaled monoliths (e.g. scheduled report instance).I wrote more about that approach on my blog, as one of the first articles, &#34;Moduliths: because we need to scale, but we also cannot afford microservices&#34;: https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/modulith-because-we-need-to...In my eyes, the good part is that you can work with one codebase and do refactoring easily across all of it, have better scalability than just a monolith without all of the ops complexity from the outset, while also not having to worry as much about shared code, or perhaps approach the issue gently, by being able to extract code packages at first.The only serious negatives is that this approach is still more limited than microservices, for example, compilation times in static languages would suffer and depending on how big your project is, there will just be a bit of overhead everywhere, and not every framework supports that approach easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a lot of talk about monoliths vs microservices lately.. I just want to throw into the ring that you can do both at the same time. easily. And noone is going to kill you for it either.maybe we are getting caught up in sematics because its christmas, but &#34;monorepo/monolith/microservices/etc&#34; is -just- the way you organize your code.Developing a montolith for years but now you have written a 15 line golang http api that converts pdfs to stardust and put it into on a dedicted server in your office? welp thats a microservice.Did you write a 150 repo application that can not be deployed seperatly anyway? welp thats a monolith.You can also build a microservice ecosystem without kubernetes on your local network. We have done it for years with virtual machines. Software defined networking just makes things more elegant.So dont stop using microservices because its &#34;hard&#34; or start writing monoliths because its &#34;easy&#34;, because none of that is true in the long run.What is true is that you have a group of people trying to code for a common goal. The way you reach that goal together defines how you organize your code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless you have a strong technical or organizational reason to use microservices, using microservices is just more work to achieve the same results.Organizational reason would be multiple people/teams who don&#39;t want or can&#39;t talk much to each other, so they develop pieces of a larger system as relatively independent projects, with clear API and responsibility boundaries. Frontend/backend style web development is an example of such approach, even though we don&#39;t typically call these parts &#34;microservices&#34;.A technical reason I can see is some component of a system actually having to be written in a different stack, or to be run in a separate location for business reasons (separate physical computer, separate VMs or containers don&#39;t count). Like a firmware running on an IoT system. Or most of the system uses python, but there&#39;s a really good library in java for solving some very specific problem, so let&#39;s use it.If neither of these reasons stands, you don&#39;t have a microservice architecture, you have a distributed monolith. You just replaced some function calls with RPC. RPC call which takes a much a longer time than a local one, and can randomly fail. Most of your microservices are written in a single stack, so you refactor common parts into a library, but then different services are stuck to use different versions of this library. You end up with a much slower and a much more fragile system which is harder to work on for no good reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The years when Rails monoliths were the de facto web stack were some of the best of my career. As I progressed in my career and the popular tech stack shifted to things like microservices, document DBs, serverless functions, Node, importing tiny nom packages for everything, docker containers, React, and GraphQL, the sheer cognitive overhead of getting a simple app up and running gradually took all the fun out of the job for me. The fast, satisfying feedback loop of writing a feature in Rails was replaced with weeks-long coordination efforts between independent microservices, constant discussions about tooling, and doubts over whether or not we had chosen the “right” flavor-of-the-week framework or library for our product. Every time I started a new project or a joined a new company, we had the reinvent the wheel for our bespoke Node/serverless stack and have the same tiring conversations about naming conventions, logging, data consistency, validation, build scripts, etc., all of which Rails gives you by default. I ended up spending more time on tooling setup than actual business logic.I eventually gave up and switched to a semi-technical product management role."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have spent a lot of time with node(express), Java(Spring) and rails. I see a lot of complaints about node, but node with typescript has been a joy to work with. It is lightweight and has a type system. I know where every piece of code is coming from, there is no magic involved. I either wrote the function in that file, I am importing it, or it is a method on a js object. I only have know one language for both front end and back end. A better standard library would be nice.Rails is nice in terms of getting the project set up, not bikeshedding about the tooling, and working with the db. But the actual coding has been painful for me. I really dislike working with a non typed language. I dislike optional parans in function calls and optional braces for hashes. I dislike all the magic of rails. I never know what is going on because there is some functionality that inherits from a rails class or some other part of the code base. I would rather write a bit more code for a bit more clarity. Maybe if python were typed I would like Django? But python has all of that nonsense around virtualenv.Spring has been ok, but not great. Too much bloated abstract factory creator nonsense. Dependency injection never really clicked for me. All of these annotations. I quite liked plain Java but Spring just felt like this monster.All in all node(express) has been the nicest for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prediction: the big move in the next few years is going to be &#34;back to hypermedia&#34;People are realizing that you can accomplish quite a bit more with hypermedia than you could in the past, and that the complexity of javascript stacks isn&#39;t worth it in many cases.Older, mature hypermedia-based technologies like rails, django, and even PHP, will experience a resurgence and a lot of older lessons and techniques in web development (caching, SQL tuning, etc.) will be rediscovered.I have a dog in this fight, w/ htmx, but I think we are increasingly seeing evidence for this move."</p>

Tons of reasons in the negative column though. There isn&#39;t even anything to salivate over that might make you think it might be worth it to deal with the other tradeoffs. Hard pass."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firefox should go all the way on this. Exploit bugs, modify binaries, whatever it takes. With user consent of course. If the user says they want Firefox to be their default browser, Firefox is justified in modifying the operating system to achieve that. Ultimately Microsoft is powerless to stop this except by using their antivirus to block installation of Firefox in the first place, and I&#39;d like to see them try that because the blowback would be epic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Windows 11 was an absolute downgrade to my Windows 10 experience. To the point that I went back to windows 10 in less than a day of Windows 11.1. I can&#39;t ungroup the taskbar windows. So now I have to hoover the taskbar to see multiple instances of the same software;2. Who the hell thought it was a great idea to couple all the commands like WiFi, power energy, etc under the same menu? On Windows 11 I needed to click the WiFi icon, select WiFi menu, select a WiFi to connect to. Whereas on windows 10 I just click on the WiFi symbol and choose the WiFi. I don&#39;t like my computer auto connecting to the Internet so I manually connect whenever I want and use this menu multiple times a day.3. Speaking of great ideas, now all the right click useful stuff is behind a second menu... Pure genius move.I know I can hack my way around these issues but I don&#39;t see the point of installing sketchy software or messing registry hacks to fix this mess. I will use Windows 10 until its end of life."</p>

Free-market economies still take measures against insider trading, still place limits on how and when high-ranking executives can trade company stock. Placing restrictions on how congress members can trade, when they have access to material non-public information, is totally compatible with a free-market economy.This is not a defense, it&#39;s a dismissal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, we are a free-market. But there are people, like company executives (and high-ranking politicians) who have non-public information that does not belong to them. When congress uses insider knowledge, they are stealing from the ameria, and undermining any semblance of policy integrity.And for that reason, the SEC has 10b-5 plans, which can certainly be critiqued, but at least removes the low-hanging fruit like &#34;we are getting acquired so I&#39;ll buy as many shares and out of the money options as I can&#34;.Iirc her husband was basically buying fairly far-out (~16-18 months) calls at the onset of the pandemic, and they were expiring around the time of, was it an antitrust hearing? The timing itself was poor, but the expiration didn&#39;t seem diabolical.But it was just like, c&#39;mon, I don&#39;t even like the anti-trust bent congress is on, but how are you thinking people are taking your goals in good faith when you have any explicit (and intrinsically timed) personal interest in not harming the businesses you are looking into anti-trust action against?The Fed trading ethics thing with Kaplan and Rosengren was also pretty bad. But imo, they made real changes. They restricted a lot of individual trading, and anything they can still trade in, has to be requested 45 days in advance. I think they understood the gravity of what that said about them, and took real steps to remedy.The STOCK Act otoh says Congress and employees have to report within 45 days..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I worked for a finance adjacent firm, not even a firm that handled money, my compliance policy was super strict even by industry standards and I was a lowly Sr. SWE. 
The reasoning I was given was to not never even provide a hint of impropriety or using data ahead of our customers. Reputation was everything.The blanket company-wide policy was as follows. Certain departments had rules on top of this.1. Limited to general stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, etc. No derivatives allowed (options, etc.). Even private stock or private options from my prior require required a review from compliance when I started.
2. No selling for a gain within 30 days of the purchase date on ANY security. Selling for a loss was allowed at any time.
3. All brokerage accounts had to be linked to their compliance portal. An automated compliance check pulled your statements weekly and would open a ticket with compliance if anything looked to violate policy. If your brokerage was not supported electronically, you had to submit monthly paper statements.I don&#39;t see why Congress shouldn&#39;t be subject to similar rules, especially those on finance committees."</p>

JS and PHP are getting more ergonomics, you get a load of new low level languages to sharpen your hardware, Java is modern now, C# runs on Unix, the Rust and Go communities are busy with shipping fantastic tools (ripgrep, fdfind, docker, cue, etc), windows has a decent terminal and WSL, my mother is actually using Linux and Apple came up with the M1. IDEs and browsers are incredible, and they do eat a lot of space, but I have a 32 Go RAM + 1TO SSD laptop that&#39;s as slim as a sheet of paper.Not to mention there is a lot of money to be made.I know it&#39;s trendy right now to say everything is bad in IT, but I disagree, overall, we have it SO good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good! I‘ll go long on them.Reddit is the ONLY place on the Internet where you can simultaneously watch garbage recycled content from TikTok and visit extremely-niche and highly knowledgeable communities in the same session. Heck, I get my HN updates from Reddit now.Facebook/Instagram/TikTok are nothing like this in that the info you get is wholly dependent on your social graph. Twitter has very high quality content, but it’s a firehose that is very difficult to curate and keep up with. Reddit is democratizing in a sense, like riding the NYC subway.An even wilder bet: Reddit can fit nicely into the metaverse (as a news outlet of sorts, on steroids) and even potentially minimize the need for Google Search.Anecdotally, a VERY LARGE percentage of my Google searches end in “site:reddit.com” these days. Reddit posts, especially from smaller subs, tend to be higher quality and don’t have ulterior motives (ad revenue). If Reddit’s Lucene cluster were better, between that and SO, I’d use Google a handful of times a week. Maybe this IPO can help fund that.If the ad revenue from the whale subs allow me to continue learning about interior design, supply chain logistics,  the inner workings of car sales, finance and tax strategies if I become high net worth, and more, I’m here for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Reddit of 2006 where tutorials on generating HTML in Lisp rocket to the top of the homepage is long gone. I can&#39;t imagine investing in an ad company that is fueled by clickbait and outrage the way Reddit is. Plus, some percentage of the userbase will always run aggressive ad blockers and be impossible to effectvely monetize. However, my brain works very differently from other people&#39;s, so I could be wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The larger subreddits have problems, but Reddit has done a remarkable job of collecting people with niche interests into one area.I wouldn&#39;t discount their success and future success (as much as I&#39;d like to).What&#39;s odd is they haven&#39;t stopped growing. It&#39;s just been linear user growth.They could literally do nothing and the site would still grow. It&#39;s closer to Wikipedia than a social network in some respects. And by that standard, we should try to judge it.I look forward to the next forum site as much as the next person. But I don&#39;t know what it would look like. If anyone does, I definitely urge you to build it if you can.Substack has every incentive to build a community. Discord as well. So there&#39;s definitely opportunities, but from where I sit, I don&#39;t have any insight as to what you could do to beat this behemoth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That design is badly missing some registers (D-type flip-flops) -- the whole &#34;let&#39;s read/write multiple bytes and discard the first one because the ESP is not ready yet&#34; seems like a super hacky solution.A pair of something like 74574&#39;s would make this so much easier. When sending to ESP, register latches the last byte written and then ESP can read it at its leisure. When reading from ESP, ESP pre-loads the data into register, and then gameboy reads data from the register. This generates interrupt which ESP uses to load next byte into register.Moreover, there might be a right logical series which will be compatible with both 3.3 and 5V busses. Then one could replace the level converters with register, keeping the overall complexity about the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very cool project, and impressive he got it working!I feel like possibly a better way to deal with the communication though might be to put a dual-port RAM [e.g. 1] in-between the gameboy and the microcontroller, and load in a program to it so the Gameboy is just waiting for certain areas of memory to be updated (with flags that one side sets as &#39;new data&#39; and then the gameboy flips). Basically some kind of circular buffer of commands, and as long as there&#39;s enough space in there and you only fill it from the microcontroller slower than the Gameboy can process them, you wouldn&#39;t need to have careful synchronisation. The microcontroller just has to check that the next slot in the circular buffer has had its status bit flipped to &#39;processed&#39; (or hasn&#39;t been used yet) before putting the next command/data in.1. https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/memory-logic/multi-po..."</p>

I feel like I&#39;ve made the opposite journey from everyone else on HN, because I joined the programming community _after_ the big RoR hype and during the Node/React hype.Trying out rails, I understand how much magic is involved here. Because I&#39;ve had to build all this crap myself - many, many times over. Complicated things become simple, and tasks that usually make me sigh (add a new data point and add it right through Knex, Hapi models, routes, redux actions, redux store, dispatch/selector and template) turns into a SINGLE COMMAND. Sold :)Very excited about this new release!Edit: I wrote a blog about this a while ago btw, but there are many others pieces out there like it: https://nikodunk.com/a-node-js-developer-discovers-rails/ - using it to create https://electrade.app currently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve played around with the new default frontend (no js build step at all!) and it&#39;s been an absolute joy. I was able to write basically babby&#39;s first Rails app and have it look, feel and behave like an SPA, and that&#39;s a wonderful thing for apps that need just a little bit of interactivity. While I&#39;ve mostly moved on to Phoenix for my personal &#34;weekend project&#34; web needs, Rails is still a wonderful framework for getting an app off the ground fast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just today I was helping a junior (php) developer get setup &amp; started with ruby.RVM, gems, bundler. Then onto rails. Upon first attempt to launch rails it choked on yarn requiring to install packages.And then I had to go through node, npm/yarn, webpacker, rails is primarily the backend, webpacker manages the front end. And it all seemed needlessly complicated.I love that rails have doubled down on the low-js direction.  Progressive enhancement, the whole js ecosystem is there if/when you need. But until then KISS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"They really need to stop requiring SVPs or higher to show non-green status on the status page, as other HNers have revealed in last week&#39;s AWS post. It&#39;s effectively not a status page, and they could probably be sued if it can be demonstrated that X service was down but the status page showed green (since the SLA is based on status page). Should be automated and based on sample deployments running in every region and every service. And they should use non-AWS instances to do the sampling, so they can actually sample when, say, we experience the obligatory black friday us-east-1 outage every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This tool is so neat! One thing I&#39;ve learned from it is my ISP (sonic.net) seems to be doing queries to _.example.com. For instance:$ dig @50.0.1.1 nelson.lily6.messwithdns.com aResults in two queries being answered by the messwithdns server. One for nelson.lily6.messwithdns.com as expected, but also one for _.lily6.messwithdns.com.Any guesses what that naked underscore query is for? Not every nameserver does it (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, and Adguard all don&#39;t). But Sonic isn&#39;t the only one that does.I&#39;ve asked on Twitter and the best guess right now is it has something to do with RFC2782 or RFC 8552. But those are about using _ to make unique tokens that aren&#39;t likely domain names, things like _tcp or _udp. What would a naked _ mean?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s another AWS outage, &amp; presently the top comment is talking about us as barbarians that have stumbled into fancy hot baths &amp; are amazed but have no idea how to keep them running. And a wonderful follow-up reply[1] talking about living in an apartment in a storm versus living in a cave during a storm. It presents another severe image of how much drift there has been in the world, how much more built up, but how we ourselves are not necessarily more advanced, smarter, wiser.It&#39;s work like this (Mess with DNS). This is the stuff. Revealing, experimenting, inviting people in. Tech that illuminates &amp; shows off, that is there to explain &amp; help create understanding. This is the stuff, this is what keeps humanity powerful &amp; competent &amp; connected. Tech does a lot for us, but when it helps us become better wiser more creative people, when it reveals itself &amp; the world: that holds a very dear place in my heart, is the light &amp; heat in a vast cold and dark universe. I love this project. It&#39;s a capital example of revelatory technology, of enlightening technology.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29568078"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awesome.But I wish a service existed that made domain names easy enough to use that the average person could manage them. IMO you shouldn&#39;t have to learn DNS and TLS in order to securely use a domain name. If I want to sign up to have Fastmail host my email, why do I have to manually copy and paste a bunch of DNS records? Fastmail already knows exactly what records need to be set. I should be able to OAuth redirect over to my domain registrar and approve giving Fastmail control over a subdomain of my choosing, and Fastmail should be able to use a simple open protocol to update the records."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the top of the article:&gt; We want to thank Citizen Lab for sharing a sample of the FORCEDENTRY exploit with us, and Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) group for collaborating with us on the technical analysis.This reminded me that NSO went after Citizen Lab on multiple fronts. They even tried to use a spy to talk to JSR (https://www.johnscottrailton.com) and make him say controversial things, which could be later used to malign Citizen Lab. Darknet Diaries covered this incident recently: https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/99/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is mind boggling. NSO used a compression format&#39;s instructions to create logic gates and then from there &#34;a small computer architecture with features such as registers and a full 64-bit adder and comparator which they use to search memory and perform arithmetic operations&#34;, all within a single pass of decompression. Combine this with a buffer overflow and you&#39;ve got your sploit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a real shame that the people who came up with this exploit are working for NSO and not on solving P = NP or something. I&#39;m sure if we got them and the ones working on crypto at NSA in a room together, we&#39;d have it and clean unlimited energy in a week.I often feel sad thinking about how many brilliant engineers are dedicating their time to helping governments spy on people or other governments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The one about using print/console.log/whatever lol.I&#39;ve always done this, never have I used a library for this, because:  - running manually? &gt;myapp.log 2&gt;&amp;1
  - using systemd? use journalctl
  - using docker/kubernetes? capture automatically the stdout/stderr of your containers and pipe them through logstash or something

Real question: why would an application need to know where its logs go? This is not in the business perimeter, but the ops perimeter. Am I wrong?EDIT:Most responses are about configuring logging level, output format, etc... This can be done with a print-based approach without sending a request to an external service (which would need to trust you and your inputs).Example: Python&#39;s default logging module.Still, thank you for your insightful answers :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent this weekend removing Elasticsearch usage in our project. Just earlier I saw that our API wasn&#39;t responding, and was wondering how the hell someone with log4j got to us. Turns our AWS West 2 was down.If it weren&#39;t for the fear of DDOS attacks, I&#39;d put every webservice in a physical server in a basement somewhere and be done with it. I&#39;ve been fighting this whole year to simplify and reduce the number of dependencies we use, but it&#39;s such an exhausting battle as it goes against the grain of the industry right now, and everyone almost actively works against you: build now, someone else may pay this technical debt."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I am seeing a lot of comments about how the graphs are not anchored at 0.  The intent with the graphs was not to &#34;lie&#34; or &#34;mislead&#34; but to fit the data in a way that was mostly readable side by side.The goal was to show the high level change, in a glanceable way, not to get in to individual millisecond comparisons.  However, in the future I would pick a different visualization I think :)The benchmarking has also come under fire. My goal was to just to put the same site/assets on three different continents and retrieve them a bunch of times.  No more, no less.  I think the results are still interesting, personally.  Clean room benchmarks are cool, but so are real world tests, imo.Finally, there was no agenda with this post to push HTTP/3 over HTTP/2.  I was actually skeptical that HTTP/3 made any kind of difference based on my experience with 1.1 to 2.  I expected to write a post about &#34;HTTP/3 is not any better than HTTP/2&#34; and was frankly surprised that it was so much faster in my tests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s great about HTTP 1.1 is it’s simplicity. I mean, you can explain it to a complete newby and have that person write a functioning implementation in a few lines of shell script, all in one afternoon.In fact, you can probably figure it out by yourself just by looking at what goes across the wire.And yet, it runs the whole modern world. That’s beautiful. I think simplicity is underrated and it’s something I really value when choosing the tools I use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a little confused about the test methodology.The post clearly explains that the big advantage of HTTP/3 is that it deals much better with IP packet loss. But then the tests are done without inducing (or at least measuring) packet loss?I guess the measured performance improvements here are mostly for the zero round-trip stuff then. But unless you understand how to analyze the security vs performance trade-off (I for one don&#39;t), that probably shouldn&#39;t be enabled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish more front-end stuff was oriented this way.
This is how I want front-end coding to be:
  Rattle off what I need, semantically,
and then by default it will be styled and presented in a sensible way.
  Then later, if our company stylist want our apps to 
look a particular kind of fancy, he can configure some styling
that will apply to all.This is also why I hate Windows WPF so much:
If you just add a label, a field, and two OK/Cancel buttons to a form,
it will look horrendous by default.
  Only if you manually or deliberately set up some styling for it,
will it start to look sensible.I want gui frameworks to look sensible out-of-the-box,
without cluttering everything with piles of boilerplate crap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s incredibly disturbing to me how little much of the HN crowd seems to understand how these systems like CSAM actually work.  I&#39;m not talking about the tech or programming.This is a fast track tool to putting anyone in jail for the most despised crime a person can commit.  The tool has no oversight, no transparency, no counter, no clear your name, no real usage definitions other than relentless spying on the &#34;protect the children&#34; fallacy.Most people don&#39;t understand how life destroying a false accusation is once the government paperwork is started.  At that point like it or not you are basically considered guilty by all the agents of the governement by default.  Their jobs are to prosecute not eliminate false positives.  Once you have been on their radar your life will never ever be the same.  And since it is CP related you will not even get helpful people willing to touch it with a 10ft pole cause of fear they may be implicated.  CSAM is a dastardly and effective way to establish a totalitarian rule by fear of life in jail, nothing more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This case reminds me a bit of the big stink with the Daraprim price hikes and Martin Shkreli being dumb enough to be the public face of it. That worked out pretty bad for him but also bad for everyone else, because now we had a guy to blame for it, instead of asking the harder questions like &#34;why aren&#39;t drug prices regulated?&#34; Utilities must go to the public utility commission to raise rates so why is the same not done for drugs? The federal government stockpiles oil in case of shortages, why is it not responsible for ensuring that drug production is continued?The maddening thing about the Apple CSAM scanning controversy is that I still have no idea which legislation Apple is complying with, and it&#39;s difficult to find out any reporting on that aspect. US? UK? EU? Clearly there is/are some government organization(s) with teeth long enough that Apple is not willing to go to court again as was the case with the San Bernandino shooter. Point is, whether or not Apple has been dishonest about this whole thing, they are still just a distraction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built multiple systems using vector search, one of them demoed in a search engine for non-commercial content at http://teclis.comRunning vector search (also sometimes referred to as semantic search, or a part of semantic search stack) is a trivial matter with open-source libraries like Faiss https://github.com/facebookresearch/faissIt takes 5 minutes to set up. You can search billion vectors on common hardware. For low-latency (up to couple of hundred milliseconds) use cases, it is highly unlikely that any cloud solution like this would be a better choice than something deployed on premise because of the network overhead.(worth noting is that there are about two dozen vector search libraries, all benchmarked at http://ann-benchmarks.com/ and most of them open-source)A much more interesting (and harder) problem is creating good vectors to begin with. This refers to the process of converting a text or an image to a multidimensional vector, usually done by a machine learning model such as BERT (for text) or ImageNet (for images).Try entering a query like &#39;gpt3&#39; or &#39;2019&#39; into the news search demo linked in the Google&#39;s PR:https://matchit.magellanic-clouds.com/The results are nonsensical. Not because the vector search didn&#39;t do its job well, but because generated vectors were suboptimal to begin with. Having good vectors is 99% of the semantic search problem.A nice demo of what semantic search can do is Google&#39;s Talk to Books https://books.google.com/talktobooks/This area of research s fascinating. For those who want to play with this more, an interesting end-to-end (including both vector generation and search) open-source solution is Haystack https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People say google search is terrible these days, but I find the opposite.I can vaguely describe in a sentence the gist of an article I&#39;ve read, or an image, and the proper result will usually be in the first page.Of course, it doesn&#39;t always work, sometimes there are &#34;hash collisions&#34; so to speak, but I don&#39;t think the old algorithm would have been more successfully either, since if I knew the exact keywords to use, I wouldn&#39;t need to start with a vague description in the first place."</p>

Use of GPT-3 to augment OCR is an amazing (and, retrospectively, obvious) insight and a great immediate use case for these language models.I wish Remarkable took this idea -- they really oversold their OCR capabilities[1]. It works great in their support and promo videos, but I found the actual performance to be absolutely terrible.[1] https://support.remarkable.com/hc/en-us/articles/36000266143..."</p>

I should probably move to the US or Canada first, otherwise it might not be possible for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Marshall McLuhan would have appreciated this. Most everyone is familiar with his “The medium is the message” phrase, but if you dig a little deeper, you’ll come to appreciate his fascination with “Technology as extension of the human body.”That brio pen; the light bulb illuminating your workspace; the words you write; they’re all extensions of your body — from transcribing your internal thoughts, through your extremities, through transmission and distribution.If the author is reading this, I hope you’ll consider connecting with a few reputable online stationary retailers to offer a curated collection of reasonably-priced premium notebooks and pens. Additionally, consider expanding your original scope to include tags, which would open up your platform to paper-based automation opportunities.If you’ve made it this far and are just looking for the best cross-platform handwriting recognition, check out the Nebo app. It requires a stylus, but it’s the best I’ve come across and it reads PDFs, too."</p>

Now that Go is going to have generics, all we need is sugar syntax for early return on error -- like more modern languages such as Rust and Zig have -- and Go may finally be pleasant to program in!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure I like this change. I liked interface{} since it just works out naturally from Go&#39;s relatively simple type system, and anyone could come to the conclusion without actually being told &#34;use interface{} to represent any possible value&#34; just by having an understanding of that type system. Adding what is simply a type alias, multiple words for the same underlying concept, to me just feels like jargon. I admire Go for its simplicity and clarity and this change gives me anxiety that that will be obfuscated."</p>

(In my mind Hayek is the person most associated with distributed knowledge.)  ~&#34;You may not understand the forces that have led society to be organized the way that it is, but you should respect that sometimes the order of things reflects knowledge you may not have.&#34;One of his essays on this topic was &#34;Individualism: True and False&#34;:&#34;&#34;&#34;This brings me to my second point: the necessity, in any complex society in which the effects of anyone’s action reach far beyond his possible range of vision, of the individual submitting to the anonymous and seemingly irrational forces of society—a submission which must include not only the acceptance of rules of behavior as valid without examining what depends in the particular instance on their being observed but also a readiness to adjust himself to changes which may profoundly affect his fortunes and opportunities and the causes of which may be altogether unintelligible to him.&#34;&#34;&#34;https://fee.org/articles/individualism-true-and-false/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of CEO-speak.A CEO cannot speak their true mind or their true assessment of a situation. They can&#39;t say &#34;wow we&#39;re in trouble here&#34; because then people will jump ship and then the company will be even more in trouble (and the CEO would get sued for breaching Fiduciary Duty)What a CEO says is merely wishful thinking for a goal they want people to follow. They can never speak their true plan. (And of course, it&#39;s all just game theory, a more elaborate version of https://youtu.be/S0qjK3TWZE8)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a set of poems, Knots, by R.D.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Moderna is working on a vaccine targeting the Omicron variant for 2022.[1]The mRNA vaccine technology is &#34;agile&#34;. There&#39;s a workflow from sequencing a virus to generating a candidate vaccine. It only took two days to generate the original COVID-19 vaccine. It&#39;s the clinical testing in small, then large groups that&#39;s the time consuming part.Also, the inhaled vaccines are entering clinical testing.[2] It&#39;s not like we&#39;re stuck with the original vaccines.[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/moderna-says-an-omicron-vari...[2] https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/e1637976-5c3f-11ec-90d0-c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a few important bits here:First: &#34;The study by Discovery Health, South Africa’s largest health insurer, of 211,000 positive coronavirus cases, of which 78,000 were attributed to omicron, showed that risk of hospital admissions among adults who contracted covid-19 was 29 percent lower than in the initial pandemic wave that emerged in March 2020.&#34;and second: &#34;At the same time, the vaccine may offer 70 percent protection against being hospitalized with omicron, the study found, describing that level of protection as “very good.”&#34;Yes the vaccine does improve outcomes BUT the hospitalization rate for unvaccinated people is still lower with Omicron than previous variants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did anyone notice the comparison of vaccine-based immunity to natural immunity in the findings within the source PR [0]? With a little work, you can compare them.If we convert the measure used in finding 2 (relative risk of reinfection) to finding 1&#39;s (relative protection), then the study found that natural immunity from Delta variant gives 60% protection against Omicron; roughly double the vaccine&#39;s protection.Unfortunately, no stat was given for natural immunity&#39;s protection against hospitalization.From finding 1: individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had 33% protection against infection, relative to the unvaccinatedFrom finding 2: People who were infected with COVID-19 in South Africa’s third (Delta) wave face a 40% relative risk of reinfection with OmicronAm I reading this right?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The inimitable Hans Rosling[1] used to call himself a &#34;possibilist&#34;:People often call me an optimist, because I show them the enormous progress they didn&#39;t know about. That makes me angry. I&#39;m not an optimist. That makes me sound naive. I&#39;m a very serious “possibilist”. That&#39;s something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. As a possibilist, I see all this progress, and it fills me with conviction and hope that further progress is possible. This is not optimistic. It is having a clear and reasonable idea about how things are. It is having a worldview that is constructive and useful.           • • •

In his book &#39;Factfulness&#39; (definitely read it), he talks about &#34;bad and better&#34;:Think of the world as a premature baby in an incubator.  The baby’s health status is extremely bad and her breathing, heart rate, and other important signs are tracked constantly so that changes for better or worse can quickly be seen. After a week, she is getting a lot better. On all the main measures, she is improving, but she still has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical.Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? Yes. Absolutely. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all relax and not worry? No, not at all. Is it helpful to have to choose between bad and improving? Definitely not. It’s both. It’s both bad and better. Better, and bad, at the same time. That is how we must think about the current state of the world.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another good quote for the OP is Miguel De Cervantes, author if Don Quixote: &#34;there is madness in too much sanity, and the greatest madness of all is to see things as they are instead of as they should be&#34;.He would know: Cervantes killed a rival on a duel at 17 and fled to sea.  They were attacked by pirates and he fought well before getting his hand blown off and taken prisoner.  He lived in captivity but befriended his captor, who taught him chess and literacy.  Then he was &#34;rescued&#34; by monks who bought his freedom but placed him on indentured servitude through debt, which he finally escaped by writing one of the early great novels.The point of this story is not that cynics were wrong but that one never would have survived his ordeal.  In a world fit for cynics, you have to be ready for things to go right if you want to escape."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m pretty sure I fall into the definition of a cynic given in the piece&#34;according to cynics, the world operates in a certain way, the elites are always the same, and will always be the same. The cynics think we are always playing the same game that has always been played. For example, a cynic may think that media’s only purpose is to sells your attention to advertisers - like I did here. And often they might be right.&#34;but I too be honest don&#39;t really see the problem with that kind of worldview. I&#39;m not chronically depressed or antagonistic because of it, but I think I&#39;d rather have what I&#39;d consider a realistic and true view of the world as it is rather than anything else.&#34;One of the strongest medicines against cynical mindset which I’ve tried is to do a “no-complain challenge”. I find its effects to be enormous and durable for years. In this challenge, you move a bracelet from one wrist to the other when you catch yourself complaining. The goal is to make it 21 days without having move the wrist. &#34;Before you start prescribing medicine we need to agree that cynicism is an illness first, which is not so easily done. I think the author conflates people who are sort of angry or pessimistic because of their lot in life with his definition of a cynic. I take the cynical view because of what I perceive are fundamental aspects of human nature collectively, not my mood personally. I can beat that challenge without a problem because I rarely complain, or win the lottery tomorrow and it wouldn&#39;t really have an impact of my views on the way the world operates overall."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found that there&#39;s a weird internal psychology I have with any news relating to Webb.  I&#39;m just as excited and hopeful as everyone else.  But somehow the whole story underscores the perils of singular hope.  It also seems to underscore the inherent issues with massive, carefully planned, &#34;vertically&#34; scaled science projects a la 20th century NASA.  I&#39;ve carved out a little nook in my psyche to cope with the outcome that something goes wrong during the Webb&#39;s incredibly complicated launch process and all those years of effort come to nothing.It&#39;s also made me wonder if there&#39;s a way for humanity to pivot to more &#34;horizontally&#34; scaled science.  I&#39;m imagining a kind of science conducted by aggregating the data collected by many cheap, easily produced instruments instead of a few incredibly fragile, extremely difficult to build contraptions.  I have an intuition that we&#39;ll increasingly run up against practical limitations in undertaking ever more complex projects of this kind in the coming years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Talking about Ariane 5, it&#39;s been interesting reading parts of its history. Particularly:&#34;Ariane 5&#39;s first test flight (Ariane 5 Flight 501) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software. A data conversion from 64-bit floating point value to 16-bit signed integer value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias caused a processor trap (operand error)because the floating point value was too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. The software was originally written for the Ariane 4 where efficiency considerations (the computer running the software had an 80% maximum workload requirement) led to four variables being protected with a handler while three others, including the horizontal bias variable, were left unprotected because it was thought that they were &#34;physically limited or that there was a large margin of safety&#34;. The software, written in Ada, was included in the Ariane 5 through the reuse of an entire Ariane 4 subsystem despite the fact that the particular software containing the bug, which was just a part of the subsystem, was not required by the Ariane 5 because it has a different preparation sequence than the Ariane 4&#34;I wouldn&#39;t want any part on something as mission critical as getting a rocket to deliver something into orbit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This hurts.RSS is the only way I know, without having to scrap things by hand, to get an aggregate of &#34;news/articles&#34; from the sites and blogs I follow, and I consider to be of good quality.I prefer to filter my information like this, instead of having to rely on some algorithm, or endlessly scrolling in a &#34;social medial wall&#34; full or clickbait articles, immortal/vintage memes or exuberant rants.If RSS dies, what is the alternative then? I understand that technically speaking it&#39;s not a good solution, but let&#39;s have something else before killing this.PS: I&#39;ve clicked on this link from a RSS reader (just a simple browser extension... that keeps me posted every morning)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a very happy daily RSS user, but we ought to be upfront about its ginormous deficiencies:- every day I deal with broken links and broken images because my feed reader doesn&#39;t know from which URL it should resolve relative links- there&#39;s no pagination mechanism, or way for a client to ask for &#34;all posts since last Friday&#34;. If you want your feed to always have all posts available, you need to include the entirety of your archive in every feed response.- if I want to follow any link I get kicked back out to a bloated web page- lots of posts include iframes, or content that only makes sense with JS enabled- XMLDespite this, I still love RSS. It&#39;s what we&#39;ve got and we should continue to make the most of it. But it also sucks, and it&#39;s not any surprise that mostly only technical people use it. I think feeds are pretty much doomed to keep breaking and disappearing. Many of the replacements or pseudo-replacements that people come up with seem fine, but the problem - as always - is getting people to actually use it, which mostly never happens."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The whole (non-Spotify, ugh) podcast ecosystem would like a word about RSS being obsolete.Patreon (and to a greater extent, the podcasters I support) keep making real money out of me and millions of others every month for personalised RSS feeds for content. That RSS feed is the delivery vehicle. It&#39;s very reliable, I can use it in any app, much good, so benefit, wow."</p>

No more coins; nothing. &#34;I&#39;ll pay you tomorrow,&#34; he told the door. Again he tried the knob. Again it remained locked tight. &#34;What I pay you,&#34; he informed it, &#34;is in the nature of a gratuity; I don&#39;t have to pay you.&#34; &#34;I think otherwise,&#34; the door said. &#34;Look in the purchase contract you signed when you bought this conapt.&#34; In his desk drawer he found the contract; since signing it he had found it necessary to refer to the document many times. Sure enough; payment to his door for opening and shutting constituted a mandatory fee. Not a tip. &#34;You discover I&#39;m right,&#34; the door said. It sounded smug. From the drawer beside the sink Joe Chip got a stainless steel knife; with it he began systematically to unscrew the bolt assembly of his apt&#39;s money-gulping door. &#34;I&#39;ll sue you,&#34; the door said as the first screw fell out. Joe Chip said, &#34;I&#39;ve never been sued by a door. But I guess I can live through it.&#34;(Philip K. Dick: Ubik)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is just bullshit.A $8/mo charge for a app based remote start? I could live with that. Servers need power, the app needs updates etc.A $8/mo charge for something which does not incur costs for Toyota? Hell no.It seems like bit by bit - every single industry is going down a fucked up route. TVs with built in ads? Cars with pay-by-month features? DRM locked coffee machines? I really hope, there is some sort of evil-bullshit-corp ranking homepage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And the toxic trend of corporate short-term-ism continues...This is clearly set up as a gotcha with a 3 year/10 year &#34;trial&#34; included, then suddenly $80(!) a year. The irony is that both periods are right around the time different demographics start to consider a new vehicle, and Toyota has just pulled this nonsense.You may be thinking $80/year isn&#39;t so bad if it includes breakdown coverage/SOS button, but you&#39;d be mistaken. The $80/year is ONLY for their &#34;Remote Connect&#34; service (app stuff, remote lock/unlock/start and notifications), you also need to pay another $80/year for &#34;Safety Connect&#34; (breakdown, SOS, stolen vehicle location), &#34;Wi-Fi Connect&#34; starting at $420/year for 2GB, and &#34;Destination Assist&#34; for $80/year.So you could be paying $660 per year OR MORE for your Toyota vehicle subscriptions alone.edited/fixed: &#34;per year&#34; now, instead of a confusing mix of per month and per year. Also, originally miscalculated the per year total and mislabelled it on top (was &#34;$275 per month&#34; which is double-wrong)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most likely some spambots hit the &#34;report&#34; button on your channel. sometimes its people with very similar video as yours and want their content to be viral.youtube &#34;Hero&#34; is a dumpster fire. Someone mass banned my google dev account for one app that I had for around 8 years as &#34;impersonating or trying to impersonate&#34; whatever that means.I applied for review and got an automated review that even all related accounts will be banned and they went ahead and banned a related play dev account.Weird thing is that I have a google cloud account with $120k yearly spend and my startup on it. Time to hedge my bets and move off google cloud."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m suspicious of video #4 being the reason.There is a wave of people copying other people&#39;s music, claiming as their own and then sending claims to the original video.Maybe since your channel is small, Youtube decided to just ban. I&#39;ve seen it happened with people who tried to pirate music more than once.I don&#39;t post any music at all on Youtube. It all goes trough a third-party service that posts on my behalf and on streaming services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work solely in marketing/advertising and have no clue how to code. I generally enjoy technology, which is why I&#39;m on HN.I think marketers and developers need a stronger culture between ourselves. The tools of marketers (data mining, consumer behavior analysis, surveys, market testing, etc) aren&#39;t just a veneer to be applied at the completion of a development project. Marketing, when done correctly, informs UX. Marketing can provide developers with insights into the problems they should try to solve.From what I can tell, many developers view the development process as a sacred protected space for creation. This is not the optimal means to delivering a high-impact product. Developers should be asking themselves during the development process: &#34;Is this feature going to excite a group of users, and do we have some statistical mechanism to predict that excitement?&#34;When you create something that you already know will excite people, the product launch becomes much simpler."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the thing. Developers are generally perfectionists and marketers are realists. As a Developer, I am naturally uncomfortable with marketing because my default view is that I don&#39;t want to lie or over-promise and I don&#39;t like fluffy claims.Marketers and sales people can be less bothered about facts but I think much of the time, we just think that, the truth is that there can be a lot of fact-based marketing but also you just have to remember that your product will never be a perfect fit and neither are any of your competitors but you can sell anyway because you are making your customer&#39;s life better, not perfect!Imagine you are selling something like a Toyota SUV. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best price-point? Possibly not; the best MPG? Probably not but I am selling a package, a vehicle that ticks a lot of boxes for someone and ultimately something that is better than the competitors in some ways and worse in others.If I am uncomfortable selling the Toyota because the MPG isn&#39;t the best it could be, I am not saving the customer from disappointing MPG, I am pushing them to a competitor and taking away the benefits that they would get from a Toyota.If your product solves a problem, assuming it isn&#39;t garbage, then it will be better than competitors in some ways and worse in others. You can market it accordingly!Good luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I struggle with marketing so much. I built an amazing product, existing customers love it, but spending any time on doing marketing feels like either wasting development time or spending time to try to force people into buying something they might not want.Most ads are trying to trick you into buying stuff you don&#39;t really need. I know there are cases in which you actually see a relevant ad for something you really want to buy and that will bring value to your life, but that&#39;s usually an edge case.What I am working on doing now is to combine development + marketing. Instead of creating marketing material to sell, I am creating marketing material to educate: create how-to instructional videos, technical blog posts, improve the documentation, etc. If you sell a tool I think this is the best way to go, instead of advertising how cool your tool is, teach people how to use your tool and what they can do with it (eg. if you sell a hammer don&#39;t show people how to drive nails and give a 50% limited time discount code; teach them how to build a chair and let them decide themselves if they need a hammer or not)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The coloring, fonts, monsters, sets, and UIs of NGE are so pleasing to look at.I hold NGE in much higher regard than other similar IPs, and would continue to do so even without the excellent art direction. Like many other stories, NGE asks &#34;what would happen if a young boy with an unusual ability was entrusted with the saving of humanity?&#34; However, unlike many other stories, the show answers &#34;he would fail, be driven insane in the process, and humanity would fall.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Typeface work in NGE it&#39;s amazing. Despite using the most common typefaces, you can recognize the card titles as the &#34;Evangelion Art Style&#34; despite only using fonts, copywriting and layout as design elements.Plus I love how Evangelion falls into a middle of exaggerated UIs to have the &#34;hacker look&#34; of /r/itsaunixsystem/, and at the same an amazing level of detail that make sense in their own world.Like when MAGI it&#39;s being hacked by the Computer Angel or SEELE, you can see they use a form of assembly and a Unix System to fight it.And then, the MAGI system by itself it&#39;s an amazing use of redundant architecture with 3 computers that should have the same output. That a system that it&#39;s resistant to data corruption, but at the same time working as an GAN AI.Amazing to think this it&#39;s from the 90s, and the most amazing part that those details are just 1% of what makes evangelion interesting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NGE has always been a favorite of me because of the UIs that are represented throughout the series. The new(ish?) movies are just gorgeous, I highly suggest you give them a try if you haven&#39;t already.If you like this, you may as well enjoy: https://scifiinterfaces.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I’d like to see, in browsers, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, etc: explicit network firewall in the software stack.An example with Workers, one script might only need to fetch from Backblaze. I’d like to set their host as a whitelisted address, and so even if a log4j type vuln happens, it can’t go anywhere except Backblaze.I think this could even work in browser-land? If you don’t need to pull in any resources outside the original host, deny any fetch made unless it’s added to a whitelist. For browsers this would need to be opt-in for backwards compatibility, but an ideal state would be opt-out (to allow all)."</p>

In fact one of the projects I haven&#39;t gotten around to finishing is to patch the memory init code for an old Atom processor embedded motherboard to make it recognise more combinations of RAM modules; analysis of the BIOS and leaked sources shows that it was stupidly written as &#34;if(512MB in slot 1 and 512MB in slot 2) ... else if(1GB in slot 1 and empty slot 2) else if(1GB in slot 1 and 1GB in slot 2) ...&#34;, when the memory controller can actually be set up generally to work with many more different configurations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was looking to Hackintosh an older Dell desktop I had squirreled away and in the process of gathering all the hardware every piece of documentation I found insisted that it topped out at 4GB. This was a late-era Core 2 so that seemed completely nonsensical to me (I don&#39;t think I ever owned a Core 2 that had less than 8) and, wouldn&#39;t you know it, 8GB worked perfectly fine.Funnily enough, like the article&#39;s author I also encountered a DSDT-related problem on that same system: if you were to dump the tables and recompile them with the standard Intel utility it straight up wouldn&#39;t work. Came to find out that there are apparently two compilers, one from Intel and another from MS and the MS one is super-lenient about accepting garbage. Eventually worked out that the logic in the stock tables was such that several features (HPET and sleep, iirc) just straight up don&#39;t work unless the OS identifies itself to ACPI as Vista (and not like Vista+, Vista exclusively). Such a pain."</p>

However, when I started to &#34;block&#34; scam sites I became acutely aware of just
how many there are.   
It is like playing endless whack a mole.I recently have had the need download some Windows software and all the top links from Google are scam sites. By that I mean they pretend to look like the legitimate / real site and they can be damn good at it.No wonder my dad for one has downloaded stuff from those kinda sites.I started blocking them, but there seemed to be an endless supply.I am hoping users can work together to create smart blacklists, and
there are already some subscription feeds for it.I do worry about performance as the lists grows."</p>

Even if Intel is able to close performance gaps, cloud computing is often an easy sell for ARM and Amazon is likely going to be able to get the chips cheaper given that they&#39;re looking for markup on the service end while Intel needs markup on the chip.If I&#39;m writing new software using Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc. it&#39;s easy to deploy to ARM. With Apple moving to ARM and 25% of developers using Macs (41-45% using Windows)*, there&#39;s going to be good ARM support for what developers need. Sure, some things might might run better on Intel and some things might not easily port, but that feels like it isn&#39;t the case for the majority of stuff that developers are going to be doing.It seems likely that Microsoft and Google will introduce ARM-based instances. We know Google has dipped its toe in with its Tensor processor for the Pixel. We&#39;ve seen reports that Microsoft has been working on ARM processors for servers. Qualcomm is gearing up for a major push into better ARM processors to compete with Apple on the desktop/laptop, but presumably they&#39;d be happy to get cloud workloads as well. Oracle, while not a major cloud provider, has ARM-based instances already.Intel has had a virtual monopoly for 20 years. Now they&#39;re facing a resurgent AMD stealing x86 marketshare and ARM processors that are quickly becoming a better price/performance option - and Apple is ensuring that everything developers need will be ARM compatible. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an existential threat, but there&#39;s a huge difference between the margins you get as a virtual monopoly and the margins you get when you have to compete against strong competitors.Plus, I&#39;d guess that AWS is probably making sweet margins off those Graviton instances. Let&#39;s say that their margin on Intel instances is X and that margin on Graviton is 2X. That leaves AWS a lot of room to start pushing Intel out of their datacenters as old hardware is replaced. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a company spending $100M/year with AWS and you&#39;re renewing your contract. Maybe Amazon suggests that they could give you a 20% discount off Intel boxes and a 40% discount off Graviton boxes - which they say are already 20% better price/performance so it&#39;s basically 52% off!It also gives AWS negotiating power with Intel. If 20% of AWS customers move to Graviton, you can go to Intel and say, &#34;we&#39;re finding Graviton processors really cheap to make and operate and customers are loving them...more and more they&#39;re realizing they don&#39;t need your Intel processors...if we don&#39;t get cheaper Intel processors, we might have to accelerate our incentives to get people onto Graviton boxes...the more we accelerate that, the more Google Cloud and Azure will likely want to prioritize ARM boxes...&#34;They&#39;re scared because it&#39;s the type of thing that snowballs until their lock-in is near meaningless. If ARM becomes 50% of the server market, there goes Intel&#39;s ability to demand high margins. 5-10 years from now, most deployments could use Intel or ARM based on price/performance rather than instruction set - and that makes life a lot harder for Intel.The problem with this ad/page is that the ship has already sailed. Once Apple introduced its M1 MacBooks, we were getting first-class ARM support for everything developers would need going forward. It didn&#39;t happen overnight, but with Apple going all-in on ARM chips and with Macs being such a big player in developer usage, the war was lost that day. Now it&#39;s just a matter of time. Once all your devs are running and testing their stuff on an M1 MacBook, why not deploy it to an ARM instance?* From StackOverflow&#39;s 2021 developer survey"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This ad reminds me of the way it felt to work at Sun Microsystems around 2002, when all the engineers  knew that cheap GNU Linux boxes were the future. The marketing people had similar FUD-based ads about how the TCO of Linux was higher, how certain HPC jobs wouldn’t run well etc. super similar to this Intel ad today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"25 years ago I was excited to learn that the Quake editor (and Doom before that) was written on NeXT. I figured with my rudimentary Linux and C skills I could get it working, but of course it was a little harder than installing everything and running makeFrom JohnC:&#34;This is a NEXTSTEP application, so hardly anyone is going to be able to use the code as is. This is not an OPENSTEP application. It doesn&#39;t even use the foundation kit, so porting to gnustep or openstep-solaris/mach/nt would not be trivial.&#34;&#34;This application was really not a very good fit for NEXTSTEP. The display postscript model fundamentally doesn&#39;t fit very well with what we need here -- if you run in an 8 bit color mode, the line drawing runs at an ok speed, but the texture view goes half the speed it should as it dithers from 24 bit color down to 8 bit. If you run in 24 bit color mode, you get less screen real estate and significantly slower line drawing as a 3 megabyte XY view is flushed. Sigh. If anyone does actually run this on NEXTSTEP be advised that you want a fast machine.&#34;&#34;QuakeEd is written for NEXTSTEP 3.3, while GnuStep is an implementation of the OPENSTEP spec. I haven&#39;t had time to port it to openstep yet, but it looks like it will take a little effort. NeXT has tools in NS 4.0 to help, but it still isn&#39;t automatic.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I use GNUstep and I really like it.It is not an Apple emulator—it is an OPENstep emulator and so it implements the amazing Cocoa API and many mac/iOS frameworks can be used server side with minimal porting.This makes it easy for what I intend to keep as a one person project forever or as long as Apple continues to support Objective-C.You want to know an unpopular opinion?? I love Objective-C and I think it is better—way better than Swift. And—if you have discipline, the preprocessor is excellent.So while many might say GNUstep is buggy, it is working for several of us—and happily so.I do agree that the homepage is terrible and that what should be done is put some installer scripts so you can start using it immediately. An Ubuntu installation following the corresponding script here is foolproof: https://github.com/plaurent/gnustep-buildCheck it out!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was nice endevour to port NeXTSTEP development stack.Nowadays with it being several releases behind macOS tooling, and the whole issue of what from Objective-C v-latest is actually supported, it is more of a curiosity and nostalgic experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"*Technically*, this is very cool, impressive, and generally an elegant work of art.*Pragmatically*, I see 2 flaws in their thesis (as explained on the about page):&gt;&gt; &#34;The entire network already consumes 10% of global electricity production with traffic doubling roughly every 2 years&#34;I think the implication is electricity consumption will also double roughly every 2 years, but Moore&#39;s law actually operates on approx. same timeline, so traffic can continue doubling at this rate without an increase in energy consumption. *This is why technology is brilliant.* It allows us to do much much more with the same resources. We should want more technological innovation.&gt;&gt; &#34; These black-and-white images are then coloured according to the pertaining content category via the browser’s native image manipulation capacities&#34;This essentially shifts some of the burden of computation from the server (PNG compression) to the browser (dithering interpretation). This may save some energy, or it may increase energy as most personal computer processors are much less efficient than server processors, and don&#39;t benefit from energy savings from caching. I&#39;m not sure where it nets out, but just solely focusing on reducing server compute time isn&#39;t necessarily a path toward sustainability if it shifts more computation to the client.Very happy to hear if I&#39;ve misinterpreted the thesis. Again, I commend the technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Small technical nit: I love the dithered images and the retro feel, but their CSS should specify `image-rendering: pixelated` to make sure browsers don&#39;t interpolate the pixels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this also shows how inefficient modern website hosting is. The fact that this person was able to get a raspberry pi to host the #1 website on HN powered by a small 50 watt solar panel is very cool (meaning maybe 10w average power budget), but also shouldn&#39;t be as uncommon as it is today. To put this in perspective, a modern server uses 50-100 watts idle doing nothing, and many more under load. To handle the top of HN, the developer probably would use load balancing and other tech, multiplying the power usage accordingly.
Edit: fixing typos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once used PuTTY as the base for an internal SSH tool. We needed to provide data entry teams with access to a green screen but didn’t want to expose any more servers than what they were authorised to use and a simple interface because a lot of the data entry guys were technologically illiterate.After spending hours looking for solutions that were purpose built for this kind of thing I gave up took PuTTYs source and made some tweaks to the UI.The source was so easy to work with and I was so grateful that the license allowed me to do this.The custom client only ran for a couple of years because the web replaced green screens. And being a *nix guy I don’t get much need for PuTTY in my day to day. But I’ll always be grateful for PuTTY for making that particular job possible (and secure)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was such a fantastic response, particularly the sections where he talks about how he responds to companies demanding he reply as if he has a contract with them.The main point being that, with the log4j issue (and others before that), the thing that&#39;s struck me when maintainers complain about not being appreciated or that they are working as hard as they can, unpaid, is that maintainers are under no obligation to respond at all, and that you can&#39;t control how other people will react.As someone who&#39;s dealt with anxiety for a long time (and as a former opensource primary maintainer), I can most definitely commiserate with feeling burdened by the expectations of others, but one of the best things I learned from therapy is that you can&#39;t control others emotions, you can only attempt to understand why you react as you do in certain situations."</p>

I had in fact introduced that team to PuTTY, though this friend didn’t know that.So I own a postcard that says words to the effect, “nobody has ever asked me for an autograph before”.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. Removing senescent cells extends life by 30-40% with huge quality of life improvements in the last 25% of the life (relative to control), in mice. This isn&#39;t an elimination of all aging, but quite a valuable thing regardless. Eventually, other causes of aging would kick in and still cause death, without a single senescent cell in your body (e.g. DNA methylation).2. I believe all governments should create Warpspeed for this approach. At the depths of covid lockdowns, GDP was down 20%. Imagine the massive GDP creation from making every 65+ year old feel 40 again. They&#39;d work, consume, and generally flourish. Even if it&#39;s only 10 more years of quality life, this is the  greatest good that could be done for humanity. To avoid another 10 years of my parents death is something I&#39;d do a lot for. Economically and ethically, we should prioritize this research above most else.3. This approach is scientifically sound. Certain aspects of aging cures are approaching engineering levels of work rather than pure science. We simply know that many diseases are caused or amplified by senescent cells. And we have ample evidence that elimination of these cells reverses diseases in complex mammals, as long as you don&#39;t remove too many, too quickly. The rest, is the engineering problem of how to remove the right cells at the right cadence.4. This is the kind of thing biohackers should hack on. Find an aging part of your skin, and attempt to convince your body to kill the senescent cells. If you succeed, you will have benefited humanity, become beautiful, become wealthy, and be remembered forever (is there any other fundamental need humans have, not covered)?Let the race begin!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The team, including Juntendo University professor Toru Minamino, confirmed that mice administered with the vaccine showed decreases in the zombie cells, medically known as senescent cells, and in areas affected by arterial stiffening.By now this has become a trope. &#34;Researchers develop new treatment for {UNTREATED_DISEASE}&#34; ... in mice.Mouse models of human disease are very limited in their predictive ability. There&#39;s a lot of research that needs to follow this before there&#39;s even a hope of a human trial, let alone vaccine. And the failure rate for treatments at the mouse stage is quite high.Some of the comments on this thread treat this research paper as the announcement of an an imminent anti-aging vaccine. It&#39;s not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that these mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD), essentially toxic fat overload to generate disease phenotypes that one can demonstrate an improvement in. Mice normally eat a mainly grain based diet, so getting 45% of calories from fat is as you can imagine pretty bad for them.This is a common theme in anti-ageing research. When you administer some cariacature of poor lifestyle, it is much easier to find ways to improve things. The long running calorie restriction experiements in monkeys illustrate this well [1,2] - in monkeys being fed a bad diet, calorie restriction works great. In monkeys eating a kinda normal monkey diet, calorie restriction doesn&#39;t do much (and the unrestricted healthy eating monkeys live longer than the calorie restricted junky monkeys). Peter Attia had a good podcast with Steve Austad where they discuss this, albeit paywalled.Unfortunately the style of experiment in the OP is good for publishing papers but hardly advances knowledge or helps us to explain anything.It is much more difficult to demonstrate improvements in healthspan in animals that are living well. The ITP experiments have shown a few drugs can do this, with rapamycin being the most broadly effective.[1] Junky monkey: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812811/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There already is a better solution and always has been, it&#39;s called setting cookie preferences at the browser level and then leaving it.Trying to regulate the option for cookie preferences at the individual site level was always a stupid idea. The average person visits thousands of websites every year. Of course nobody is going to take the time to do that.If the lawmakers in the EU were intelligent, they would have created a law that forced all web browsers to provide &#34;X&#34; privacy setting features for EU-domiciled users (where X is what they were aiming to achieve).In addition to not burdening the entire world with time wasting popups all day, this option would have also had the bonus of not burdening millions of small businesses around the globe with complex regulation and legal liability.Not to mention the total lack of enforceability of the current law when it comes to websites operated outside of the EU.If done at the browser-level you really only have to police &lt;10 companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Laws that require software companies to implement a user choice should really contain some wording against dark patterns. EU lawmakers could have been warned: A similar thing happened back when Microsoft was forced to give users in the EU a choice of browsers, when they created the most confusing dialog possible and hoped that users would just click OK to Internet Explorer out of desperation.For me personally, when those data protection laws where implemented, seeing the extent of the market for user tracking was a shock to me. The respect that I lost for actually quite a lot of companies as a consequence has informed some purchasing decisions. And I don’t think anybody would mind those banners if the opt-out option you want to click is reachable with a single, easily visible button.Edit: Responses suggest that the GDPR already contains something to that effect. Glad to know. If that’s true, then I guess it’s time for court cases to sort this out."</p>

Just unzip and run the .exe.If you want a single-file exe (as in completely statically compiled without self-extraction) that&#39;s a bit more advanced and requires a few properties in the csproj to configure how to handle native assemblies that expect to exist on disk. If you want it to have no runtime dependencies, add `--self-contained`"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion: native GUI app development on most platforms is a shitshow. Huge toolkits, copious amounts of boilerplate, and a huge amount of dev effort thrown at the platform just to get it working.Meanwhile, say what you will about the web ecosystem, I&#39;ve given interns/jr devs tickets like: see if you can get this webapp running in electron, and maybe figure out how to do push notifications and save data locally. Two days later the project is done. A week later, the app is ready to install.I think the real reason I quit doing meaningful amount of native GUI development a decade ago was velocity. The developer experience with iOS is probably about the best of the major GUI platforms, but even that is rife with tarpits of tribal knowledge and gets really complicated to release an app due to the whole App Store experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot to untangle here.Point 1 is largely true, Microsoft builds too many competing UI toolkits.Point 3: You can slim down Visual Studio&#39;s install a lot if you&#39;re more selective during installation. For example if I only wanted to do .Net desktop application development it is closer to 4 GB and under 10 GB on disk.Point 4: Is actually the end of the original synopsis on the topic and after it veers off. You successfully built the application.Now it goes a little off the rails:Point 5: &#34;The app is extremely resource heavy and way too over-featured.&#34; Ok? You didn&#39;t say which toolkit, guide, or similar you used nor what you define as resource heavy or in what way it was &#34;over-featured.&#34; This is too vague to discuss meaningfully (e.g. Win32 applications built in C++ definitely aren&#39;t resource heavy or over-featured for example, and since you didn&#39;t clarify even what tech stack was used let alone guide/template this isn&#39;t constructive at all).Point 6: I&#39;ve read this sentence several times but seemingly you opened an executable in a text editor and that somehow broke your build process? Or something? Was it write-locked by the editor?Point 7-10: You had a working build pipeline, you broke the pipeline, then decided to start again from scratch in an editor that doesn&#39;t have native desktop development support on Windows (because the old editor was &#34;bloated&#34;). You found this process problematic.So in answer to:&gt; Why is building Windows apps so complicatedYou made it complicated by using unsupported workflows and introducing arbitrary limitations on what was a successful outcome. There&#39;s a lot you can legitimately criticize Windows and even its desktop application development workflow for, but this isn&#39;t that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use the old-fashioned snap traps. They work fine. Sometimes it&#39;s necessary to tweak the catch to make it more sensitive. They&#39;re made of wood and wire, and aren&#39;t an environmental problem.I live near a greenbelt and there&#39;s a never-ending invasion of mice. If I leave the garage door open and unattended, they&#39;re in in a flash and setting up shop. The only way to get rid of them is the traps, and you have to get rid of them.Peanut butter bait is irresistible. I used to use gloves to bait them cuz the books say they mice are deterred by human smell. They aren&#39;t. They aren&#39;t deterred by The Cat, either, as they know The Cat prefers human flesh. They&#39;re not very smart, either, as if you put two traps adjacent, they&#39;ll crawl over the body of their buddy dead in the first one and get caught by the second."</p>

Plus good reviews, hard to leave a bad review for it when you&#39;re bleeding out in the ER.I don&#39;t use poisons for pest control.  We have too many owls, hawks, and the occasional eagle overhead.  I&#39;ll kill stuff mechanically (damned pocket gophers...) and toss the carcass out where something will find it and eat it, but I won&#39;t poison them.  The best mouse trap is actually a slightly erratic supply of cat food."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Readers who are interested in the actionable aspects of this topic should probably read the last instalment in this series: https://commoncog.com/blog/accelerated-expertise/The basic idea is this:1. Deliberate practice only works for skills with a history of good pedagogical development. If no such pedagogical development exists, you can’t do DP. Source: read Peak, or any of Ericsson’s original papers. Don’t read third party or popsci accounts of DP.2. Once you realise this, then the next question you should ask is how can you learn effectively in a skill domain where no good pedagogical development exists? Well, it turns out a) the US military wanted answers to exactly this question, and b) a good subsection of the expertise research community wondered exactly the same thing.3. The trick is this: use cognitive task analysis to extract tacit knowledge from the heads of existing experts. These experts built their expertise through trial and error and luck, not DP. But you can extract their knowledge as a shortcut. After this, you use the extracted tacit knowledge to create a case library of simulations. Sort the simulations according to difficulty to use as training programs. Don’t bother with DP — the pedagogical development necessary for DP to be successful simply takes too long.Broadly speaking, DP and tacit knowledge extraction represent two different takes on expertise acquisition. For an overview of this, read the Oxford Handbook of Expertise and compare against the Cambridge Handbook of Expertise. The former represents the tacit knowledge extraction approach; the latter represents the DP approach. Both are legitimate approaches, but one is more tractable when you find yourself in a domain with underdeveloped training methods (like most of the skill domains necessary for success in one’s career)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO Tacit knowledge is what we used to call judgement.Judgement is basically knowing a bunch of things but having a good idea of which things are more important than others, and especially knowing which things are worth spending time on any which aren&#39;t.It&#39;s like when I see someone talking about financial options and they put everything on the board at once: what are puts and calls, what&#39;s an iron butterfly and other strategies, do they need to know the payoff diagram, what about black scholes, what are the Greeks, when should I exercise, and so on. They are all things that a professional option trader knows, but when you&#39;re a pro you reduce your cognitive load because you know what actually matters and you are not juggling all these concepts at the same time.It&#39;s also the source of frustration when interviewing. Say you&#39;ve written CPP for many years, you&#39;re probably not prepared to answer questions on all corners of the language, even though you&#39;re an expert in some sense. Someone relatively newer might be better at that task, because they&#39;re thinking a lot about everything, including things they haven&#39;t decided are unimportant yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sorry, I was really into the whole Deliberate practice thing and then I read this and thought &#34;Oh no, did I have it all wrong?&#34;So I read the book he quoted - &#34;Source of Power&#34;. And you know what? It has a tremendous overlap with Deliberate Practice.The proponents of Deliberate Practice never claim to &#34;just do it over and over&#34; - you have to have background knowledge, a teacher/coach, etc... the tacit knowledge. Part of it is given to you and part of it is something that you&#39;re put into a position to experience for yourself.It seems the &#34;divide&#34; is overstated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The people trying to point out that this falls short of photorealism are missing the point. This is a tech demo aiming to show off the next generation leap unreal engine 5 is making. There’s lots to be impressed about here and this was made using a ton of procedural generation using a team of just about 70 people.Here’s a great deep dive into some of the new technologies that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of some of the new engine tools: https://youtu.be/ib6_c6uliLgThis is extremely exciting this is possible on a year old console and not a 3090."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This writeup is unsubtle in being a puff piece. The demoed tech is very impressive! Individual stills taken from the video are pretty convincing.The motion version definitely still exhibits uncanny valley, though—lights that are too hard on flesh, tightness and sharpness where there should be softness. That I have to resort to hand-wavey descriptors is cool; they’re getting close! But crossing uncanny valley is HARD.What this demo convinces me of is not that we’re there; we are not. Claiming that we are is disingenuous, and makes me distrust the claimant. But it makes apparent that we will get there. And that’s impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks to HN, I checked it out on my PS5 tonight. Very impressive. The thing that immediately jumped out at me was the 24fps target. The demo has a cinematic feeling, and thus the 24fps framerate feels “correct.” Compared to 60fps, you can do a lot more when you have 2.5x as much time per frame.The first part is a CGI representation of Keanu and Carrie-Anne. I was shocked at the quality; it had “the demoscene feel,” if you know what I mean - “I did not know the hardware could do that.” Artists going full OCD, just because it was the right thing to do. Great work.Parts of it had that CGI feeling, but most of the first two minutes, I swear I was watching video and not CG.Part 2: the city tour. I am not sure if there’s a detailed YouTube video of same, but the artists used some clever tricks, as any good 3D artist would. You can fly around and peer into offices and apartments through their windows. There are a limited number of static rooms, and they use frosted glass to blur the details. Interiors are fully modeled and there is parallax through the glass. HVAC units on rooftops are robust, down to the warning messages. Great use of LOD.I saw Z-fighting and LOD “popping” when surveying the city from on high.I walked away from this (um, got up from the sofa) thinking Epic’s gambit is to push Unreal Engine 5 as a virtual movie set.They went all out on the character models in the first part, with Keanu and Carrie-Anne. There were a few uncanny valley shots (“dead eyes”) but very impressive overall. Some of the shots could be taken as a reference, or gold standard.Even more impressive is that it’s running on a (loss leader) $600 Sony PS5."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Our machine has W=UINT16_MAX words, of N=16 bits eachDid the seemingly-off-by-one-error catch anyone else? A 16-bit integer has 65536 values, so you&#39;ll be going one past the end of the virtual RAM if you attempt to access address FFFFh.With this simple trick, we can avoid writing a switch statement with 16 (+1) casesPersonally, I prefer having a switch since it&#39;s more obvious which opcode goes where. Probably makes the code a little shorter too (and is that another off-by-one, this time in the other direction?)Also, I understand the need to keep a &#34;learning architecture&#34; simple, but without byte-wide memory access, you&#39;ll quickly realise how annoying it is to work with actual bytes. For example, any string handling, unless you decide to use UTF-16 instead. I think a sweet spot is 16-bit address and 8-bit data, with register pairs for 16-bit operations, much like the popular Z80 and the 8080/8085 that preceded it.The DEC Alpha is a real architecture that made a similar mistake and later had to be extended to fix it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Alpha#Byte-Word_Extensions..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool!I&#39;ve never understood why modern software projects use names like `mw` or `mr`? What&#39;s wrong with `memory_read` / `memory_write`? Or `opcode_execute_fn opcode_executers[NOPS]` is magnitudes clearer than `op_ex_f op_ex[NOPS]`, and the only advantage of the latter is less time to write.You will spend at least twice as much time reading your code as writing it, just take the extra time. Nobody needs another `vsnprintf_s`.ETA: I have to repeat this is an insanely cool project idea, and very good execution"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Granular control over requests is completely lost in Manifest V3.For example, with Manifest V2 we can initiate a request from a content script after we begin listening for it from the background script, pass a single-use token in the Accept header, identify the request from the background script based on the token, remove the token from the Accept header and edit other headers before the request is sent to the server, then manipulate the response for that single request and stop listening from the background script.I use this workflow in Search by Image to grab an image from the page context when no CSP headers are present for the asset, and the image is only served if a certain cookie and referrer is sent. This will no longer be possible to achieve with the current API of Manifest V3. Extensions used for page archival will also be impacted.Manifest V3 removes a robust toolset that content blockers can use the react to all evasion techniques ad companies implement, and the rest of the extension ecosystem will be part of the fallout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the interesing things about this story is that there appears to be no consideration of not &#34;updating&#34; to a new Chrome version.  The idea of user choice in &#34;updating&#34; is completely absent.  Why cannot a user say, &#34;V3 sounds wonderful but I will stick with V2, thank you.&#34;  A user has a version of a program that works for that user (e.g., with uBlock Origin), and Google can apparently forcibly stop that user from using that working version, through a process of &#34;automatic updates&#34;.  Users must &#34;accept&#34; updates which makes one wonder Google can pull this off.  Does it not rely on user behaviour.  By accepting every &#34;update&#34; without question, the user is effectively consenting to being controlled.Perhaps users will someday &#34;wake up&#34; to realise that so-called updates are not necessarily being remotely installed for their benefit, but for the benefit of someone else.  No doubt Google has some parallel construction type explanation why users need V3, but how many folks cannot see that they are letting the fox guard the henhouse.Perhaps if ads can be blocked, so too can updates.  (IME, it&#39;s possible.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Now is the perfect time for Open Source maintainers to become legible to the big companies that depend on them—and that want to get more out of them—and send them five-to-six figure invoices.Well, this is exactly what I&#39;ve been doing around VideoLAN (VLC, x264) and FFmpeg for the last few years. In order to do that, I&#39;ve created 2 official companies Videolabs and FFlabs (besides the non-profit orgs) and I&#39;ve gone through all the hoops to get paid (PO, billing, invoices, registering to large companies is a lot of paperwork, tbh, but well..) and we try and bill small to large companies that depends on those projects.And FFmpeg and x264 are the core of the online video.So I did exactly what Filippo is saying we should do.But the result is really not impressive. Seriously, asking for money for support from those companies feels like we&#39;re pulling the nails, even if their full business depends on it. Getting 30-50k$ from those companies for support for one year can be very challenging, long or leading to nowhere at all.So, large SV companies and startup should also start agreeing to pay for open source, when it&#39;s the core of the tech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an open source author and maintainer of a somewhat-popular python package[0] (~1M downloads/month) that I&#39;ve maintained for over 10 years. I don&#39;t recall ever receiving a donation. I am still maintaining it, but I just don&#39;t have time to add the improvements that it needs to keep up with the ecosystem (asyncio, for example). If organizations who use it got together and chipped in some non-negligible amount, I would be much more serious about keeping up with it, but $0, or $5-20/month, is just not realistic incentive to compete with other priorities in my life.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once upon a time, the best way to get a software job was to demonstrate your ability to build useful open source projects.  10 years ago the Principal Engineers I would work with had super sized open source portfolio&#39;s which leant them both credibility and experience building products people liked.  Junior devs would search (sometimes in vain) for issues where they could contribute a few PRsNow the best way to get a job is leet code, leet code, and more leet code.  Rather than spending  &lt;5 hours a week working with real code and producing real value on open source projects - most career minded engineers will simply focus on leetcode.Not many people patch esoteric software that&#39;s been around for 10+ years because it&#39;s particularly fun or because there is specific business value in it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a project I&#39;ve been working on to create decentralized, peer to peer, &#34;serverless&#34; websites using several technologies including webtorrent, dmt (mutable torrent BEP-46), and handshake decentralized domains.You can create either an immutable (uneditable) torrent site, or you can create a ed25519 keypair and create a mutable (updatable) torrent site.This is great for blogging, whistle blowing, and other things.  It also scales well since torrent technology is great although it had previous been pigeonholed to other use cases.Please give it a try and let me know your thoughts!  I don&#39;t take any credit for this since I just weaved the great technologies others already made together!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic work!The best part of Federalist is reading and displaying the websites from BitTorrent using BEP-46. The Handshake part is less impressive for me personally, since it basically reads Handshake values from a service (query.hdns.io/dns-query).If Federalist adds a Handshake daemon, it will be much more decentralized, but at the same time much heavier on resources.For historical perspective, decentralized websites (or p2p websites) are here since like 20 years. Here&#39;s a super concise list of what I recall off the top of my head.- Freenet is the first project I&#39;m aware of doing that- ENS+IPFS websites is a strong movement now (see esteroids.eth.limo, I&#39;m a co-creator of this)- ZeroNet was going strong like 5 years ago, and even though it&#39;s less popular now it&#39;s still functional and a nice project.- Agregor browser brings decentralized website the Hypercore (a successor of DAT protocol)- BitTorrent was supposed to have a project especially for decentralized websites (Maelstrom web browser), but it didn&#39;t took off eventually- Magnetico is a search engine built on top of BitTorrent, very similar to Federalists, but without the Handshake part.- Skynet is a project meant almost only for decentralized websites, based on Sia. They have integration with ENS, and afaik, also with Handshake (check it out!)- Swarm, Namecoin etc. could also be used for decentralized websites. I saw some people doing demos with it, but can&#39;t recall any links/names atm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ironically, on a previous team I had switched our log4j2 log formats over to %m{nolookups} like 8 months ago... I didn&#39;t realize the whole jndi issue, what we ran into was the O(n^2) behavior of its string substitution.While deploying an ancillary change, our jvms started locking up for minutes on end. What was happening was that we were logging customer input, and the change caused it to run certain things in parallel, which ended up logging the data multiple times. Normally the extra logging didn&#39;t matter but one customer had data like &#34;${foo} ${bar} ${baz} ...&#34;. Even when the ${foo} portion is replaced wothout modification, this triggers quadratic behavior. So we were already potentially vulnerable to the DOS but it was rare enough that we never got locked up until logging the string multiple times, which then overflowed log4js internal buffer and blocked worker threads.You can try this yourself by just logging a string like &#34;${}${}${}...&#34; And in fairly short order it starts taking forever. I&#39;m very glad the fix in 2.15 is to disable lookups by default.I hope that in the time after I left, the security org at the big tech company I worked at and reported this to (as I thought it was - a dos vector, not the complete pwnage it actually was) forced teams to switch to nolookups. Otherwise a lot of people had a bad week forcing updates through..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be a misunderstanding here. We have on the one side a garbage feature that should never have been implemented - but if you want to keep it for backwards compatibility, sure. But then we have log4j scanning all values instead of only format strings - I think it can be argued that this behavior is a critical bug and was never intended to begin with. It seems to have only come about because whoever implemented the JNDI stuff lost their bearing in the absurd class hierarchies and abstractions in log4j.Of course the last part holds the solution for our backwards compatibility issue. Remove the JNDI nonsense from the default package and move it into an extension package. Whoever wants to keep it can just add that to their dependencies and continue to enjoy logging functions that sometimes also make network connections and block your program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; for a feature we all dislike yet needed to keep due to backward compatibility concerns.It&#39;s logging. While logging is extremely important, I think we could all tolerate removing a vulnerable feature. Or, just move the feature to a separate package.I have made bad decisions, we have all made bad decisions. Own them, improve, and celebrate the opportunity to learn and improve. Keeping this around, as a default, was a bad decision. If your enterprise contracts don&#39;t want to turn a flag on, then they can always skip upgrading (they generally do regardless)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You need to speak with a qualified domain name attorney, not just any attorney or solicitor.As Director of a domain name protection company (and not an attorney) I can offer this:If you registered the domain name before the other party files for a trademark, then there is no way you would have known that they would file for the mark. So, in most cases you probably don’t have to give up the domain name. It comes down to whether or. Or you registered the domain “in bad faith” or not. And again, how would you know they would start their business and get a trademark? You wouldn’t.Are you in the same industry and compete with each other? If so, there might be an issue, but I’d your site offers different products and there would be no confusion between companies or websites, then there may not be an issue.The best way to handle this is to get a domain name attorney to respond to their letter to you, essentially telling them to go away, and that you plan on keeping the domain name.If you cannot afford an attorney, look for a company that offers domain name insurance or a domain name warranty, if you have an issue like this with your domain name, your legal fees to defend the domain are covered.As you have described the situation here, you bought the domain before they filed for their trademark, and you’re not pretending to be them. So you should be able to keep the domain. They are just trying to “ strong arm” the domain away from you with a threatening letter. If they do sue you or file a udrp, defend yourself with the help of a good domain name attorney."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a 4 letter domain name. A stock photo company trademarked the name and then threatened to sue to force transfer. However, I registered the domain before they registered the trademark. I looked up the ICANN rules and saw I had priority. Pointed out the ICANN rule and told to go away. They did.IANAL; this is not legal advice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is definitely a bunch a hot air, unfortunately they could frivolous sue you to simply win on financial grounds alone (in particular they could sue you in a location where the cost of travel would be expensive and if you ignored it they get a default judgement, or sue you in both state &amp; federal courts for slightly different things and drown you in legal costs).I&#39;d evaluate what your endgame is. If your endgame is to keep the domain then I&#39;d get a lawyer in order to make it clear that you will respond to legal challenges (and, yes, the bill is going to run up). If you were willing to sell, for a price, then you should try to figure out how much a legal challenge would cost them and set a price a bit higher than that.Is it fair? Absolutely not, but the US legal system is set up so that those with the deepest pockets often win. It isn&#39;t a fair fight for normal citizens, and even having the law on your side is often not enough because it is a financial battle more than a legal one.Either way may be wise to lawyer up today, either for a better selling price, cause them to back off entirely, or move it into the &#34;bury you with costs&#34; phase of bullying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Craig Murray, friend of Julian Assange, was just released from a Scottish prison for the crime of jigsaw identification of some of the accusers in the trial of former First Minister, Alex Salmond despite the fact that many journalists from mainstream media had published information that allowed their readers to identify some of the accusers explicitly.So it&#39;s not just a problem of dictatorships in second or third world countries. But then again, maybe it is.https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s framing of the problem (increased authoritarianism, decreased tolerance for reporting) leaves a lot to be desired without more evidence. The evidence is:- A small increase in total jailed journalists (roughly matching world population growth, and the delta is a small discrete count which would yield large error bounds)- Specific examples of horrific events (matching atrocities that governments have been more than willing to commit in 2020, 2019, 2018, ...)Without looking at longer time scales (e.g., over the last 10-20 years journalist jailings significantly outpace population growth) or providing some justification for why circumstances have changed and we would expect journalist jailings to not pace population growth (e.g., if there are significantly fewer journalists per capita (not sure if that&#39;s true, just hypothetically)), a story that matches the evidence better is that lots of countries were horrible to journalists in years past and they&#39;re repeating that bad behavior now.To be clear, that&#39;s not saying that the overall problem shouldn&#39;t be fixed or even that their framing isn&#39;t correct, but...it&#39;s not exactly hard to provide evidence that _actually_ backs up their claim; why wouldn&#39;t they?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A satellite dish salesman with a storefront in Brooklyn, New York, was jailed in 2009 because he turned on the ability to watch al-Manar, a station associated with a political party that has made up 10+% of Lebanon&#39;s parliament since 2005 (both associated with the Shia organizational group in Lebanon, Hezbollah).https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/nyregion/24cable.htmlGermany, France and other European countries have banned the channel as well."</p>

It is the McDonald’s of city planning. Cheap, ugly, bad for you but also shockingly expensive once the medical/infrastructure maintenance bill comes due.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting how more city planning articles are making their way to HN. I&#39;ve just been to the Nobel week dialogues yesterday discussing the city of the future (https://www.nobelprize.org/events/nobel-week-dialogue/Gothen...).For those who have not heard of them, the Nobel week dialogues are discussions, talks with some of the leading experts on a given topic together with Nobel prize winners who have often worked on the same topic since winning the prize. It&#39;s a free event, held in either Gothenburg or Stockholm. On the 9th of December every year. But the great thing is that since the pandemic they have started to live  stream the event so everyone from around the world can join. I highly recommend everyone to check it out, it is not often that you can see 5 or more nobel prize winners in one place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case you have not seen it, there is a very interesting video series by Clickspring about building an Antikythera Mechanism with tools that were abailable at that time. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZioPDnFPNsHnyxfygxA0...The tl;dw is that it was possible to build it with tools that were probably available, but some tools are specialized enough to guess that they had already build other similar devices. The final IRL reconstructed device is very nice. It&#39;s a long serie (10 episodes of 15 minutes each + some additional videos with even more details in other playlist) but it&#39;s worth watching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we tend to underestimate what ancient technology could produce because we forget that in ancient times they often operated on longer timescales than we do.With our technology for example we could make all the parts for the Antikythera mechanism in a short time. The ancient Greeks definitely had no technology that would have allowed them to do that, so we see the existence of the Antikythera mechanism as a great mystery.But I don&#39;t see any reason to believe that the Greeks built it in a short time. It could easily be the lifework of the builder, or even the lifework of successive generations of a family of builders.If you need to make a very precise gear in a day you need our technology. If you need to make a very precise gear in 50 years you just need someone with an abrasive that is harder than the material you are making the gear from."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previously on HN:  
https://hn.algolia.com/?q=Antikythera+mechanismI am curious, is this device as fascinating to the average person as it is to the average HN&#39;er? I suspect not, but I don&#39;t really understand why. I myself have read quite a few articles/posts and watched a few videos about it. Every time I re-encounter it, I get sucked back in.See also:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Batteryhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_fire"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder at which point the fines will outgrow the &#34;cost of doing business&#34; and really start to hurt?Tech companies are getting fined so often in the EU recently that it seems we&#39;re seeing a new article about a 9+ digit fine every other week."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get that emotions are high when we discuss Amazon, but the article seems to imply that they were fined for not adding the &#34;Prime&#34; badge to items that were not fulfilled by Amazon (i.e. that didn&#39;t use Amazon warehouses).Frankly I don&#39;t see why that&#39;s a problem, the Prime badge is for one-day or two day shipping item. If the seller is not using Amazon for their logistics then they simply can&#39;t guarantee the time window so they don&#39;t add a prime badge?From a customer point of view it would make for a worse shopping experience if Prime items weren&#39;t  fulfilled by Amazon"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Doesn&#39;t seem this will hold any ground if Amazon decides to fight it...FBA products have a clear competitive advantage: free shipping for Prime customers, fast and reliable shippings, easy returns, a networks of lockers so you don&#39;t have to wait for the package at home (in Italy packages have to be handed to a person, they can&#39;t be left in the front yard unattended).Marketplace products have longer and unreliable shippings, you need to pay extra even if you are Prime customer, customer services is usually subpar, customer protection is inferior and so on...There&#39;s not an abuse, they offer a better service, they get better business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Advertising. I know this is an extreme view, but I think any advertising other than a spec sheet style ad (just facts) should be banned. I feel like it steals your attention and mindshare day after day. The ads I see on TV now (rarely, as I don&#39;t watch live TV much) are just so horrible. Dripping with emotions and trying to tug on your heartstrings to sell some toilet bowl cleaner or some other garbage.Social media. I feel like if it weren&#39;t for these algorithms that prioritize &#34;engagement&#34; over facts and polite content, my country would be a bit less polarized. I think that social media will turn out to be like cigarettes and someday we will discover that it has an extremely bad outcome; at least how it&#39;s implemented today. I have come to enjoy HN a bit more lately, as I just don&#39;t engage with the trolls or the horrible people that have opinions I disagree with vehemently. The people I think are horrible, at least, because it&#39;s a personal opinion, and other&#39;s might view me as a horrible person. I have also learned that it&#39;s best not to judge someone by one or two views overall, here, and that helps. I wish more social media could be like HN and allow a diverse set of opinions, but ban the name-calling and such that really take things into a bad place.Most products today are less durable and are generally worse than &#34;yesterday&#34;, in my opinion. Perhaps it&#39;s the old man in me coming out, with a rosy view of yesteryear, but I think that the quality of things are just lower, in general. I do think that things &#34;look nicer&#34; and are more consistent, but at a lower level of quality. 20 years ago, I had only 5 or so choices for any given product, maybe a curtain rod for example (because I just bought some). Today I can go down to several stores and pick from hundreds of curtain rod designs that look really nice, but half of them break after a few years or less. I still have some shitty looking but sturdy curtain rods from 20 years ago, no joke. Electronics are worse in some ways, but faster and more complex, so maybe that complexity is the source of the decrease in perceived quality. I can say that computers are way faster now, and it&#39;s easier to do many things, but I have less freedom than I had with older computers for sure.This is just about the end of my old man rant. Thanks for listening.&#34;The important thing was that I had an onion on my belt...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there is an &#39;optimum&#39; level for technology of all kinds, below that you really want more and it is clear that there is room for improvement. But once the optimum has been reached any further additions will degrade the experience.Examples:Car controls:  pre: direct taps and gauges plumbed into engine parts and such, real switches and levers. 
  optimum: does what it should, not more, not less, more reliable than the old stuff, easy to fix and relatively cheap to fabricate
  too much: touchscreens. For everything.

(ICE) Car electronics:  pre: carburettors, bad winter starts, bad fuel consumption, pollution
  optimum: EFI, highly reliable, aftermarket parts interchangeable between brands
  too much: DRM on everything, parts won&#39;t even fit same model a year older, are ridiculously expensive and unreliable to boot

TV:  pre: two channels, black and white, bad image quality, crappy small screens
  optimum: 20 channels or so, in a way already more than you can consume, good quality color image, fairly easy to see screens (say, up to 3&#39; across).
  too much: wall-to-wall screens that intrude on your privacy every chance they can, inability to build up your own collection of content (DRM), pay *for ever* for the same stuff
  way too much: youtube.

CPUs:  pre: 8 bits, too slow for many applications, nice and better than an abacus though
  optimum: 1990s OS, very little eye candy, just enough to take the edge off, fast, and enough horsepower to do meaningful work
  too much: 2020 OS, nothing but eye candy, reduced functionality, telemetry, spyware, forced updates that are just as likely to improve things as they are to leave you stranded

and so on, you get the idea.Technology has and always will have a place in my life. But my car is a 1997 model that doesn&#39;t phone home to the factory, has buttons instead of menus, my phone is a Nokia, and so on. Technology is my slave, not my master."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Algo-paranoia.Every time I interact with a remotely &#34;clever&#34; system, I keep thinking how my input will feed some machine. How fast do I scroll, what is in my viewport. What do I listen to and when. Is this an A/B test? Will something I do on a whim affect that machine to predict something incredibly stupid tomorrow?It only became obvious recently, as I was readying an actual, physical book. The relief to realise that the publisher won&#39;t optimise the font based on how fast I turn the pages. And the disgust at that aspect of tech.And to what end?"</p>
