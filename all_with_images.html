								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I could ask Apple for one thing it would be to require approval of every push notification that an app developer wants to deliver. That an app gets either cart blanche to send me notifications or nothing at all drives me crazy. I don&#39;t want to miss a notification that my delivery food arrived, but I don&#39;t want to be bombarded with daily advertising messages from foodpanda trying to get me to change my behavior. Require app developers to submit a template string (and not &#34;\(message)&#34;) for each notification the app can deliver for approval in the App Store and let me have an on/off switch for each one.&#34;Notifications&#34; across every platform drive me crazy, because they usually start out as useful, but because people tend to pay them more attention than all the other channels that have already been tuned out, companies start juicing them for engagement. I use twitter rarely, but every time I do I am perplexed why my &#34;notifications&#34; are full of crap about who recently tweeted. Shouldn&#39;t that just be in my timeline?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article wants Apple to save us from mindless browsing, but I see mindless browsing as unavoidable. Not because of some technical or legal thing, but because mindless browsing is a good thing. We need it. Mindless browsing is like a walk through the woods, just looking for what is happening, navigating a huge amount of information that is hardly important at the moment – oh, the cherry tree is blooming – but could be important later.The &#39;outside&#39; is made up of myriads of tiny details – wind is moving the leaves, slowly and irregularly, the birds are singing, insects flying through the air, the earth feels soft and damp and smells of freshness after the rain, the movements of clouds and the sun are inexorably changing the lighting. We are, however, spending time in concrete boxes where nothing ever moves, and even seal off the sounds and air flow from the outside. Within those boxes we sit and lie and enter other, flatter spaces of our screens, which nonetheless offer us the possibility of some kind of change, movement in the world.. Of course we will browse those changes mindlessly.Since mainstream social media has turned into a manipulative toxic landscape, I find myself retreating to more niche and better moderated sites, devoid of hate and over-strained emotions. I also find myself wishing for a digital space, be it a game or a website, that would feel similar to a walk in the woods – where a lot is happening but not much is important. Like watching the breaking of waves on the beach. Like sitting at a campfire. Like watching the tree tops move in the wind.I like mindless browsing. I enjoy it. Just give me the right space for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even though this article is sarcastic(?) I can&#39;t help but get genuinely angry at these trillion dollar companies thinking they know what is better for us and trying to control and police everything. This is even worse than govt censoring porn and cuss-words back in the day thinking they know what is moral for the society.I was just talking to a friend the other day on how badly Apple and Google are trying their best to kill curiosity and creativity. I mean when I first got my 286 the machine was just full of possibilities. I think learning the ins and outs of it was more fun than doing anything productive.I used to hack away at it all day and night. Learning about interrupts, tinkering with the BIOS settings, hacking the serial port, irq, etc. Now everything is just locked down. In my latest phone I can&#39;t even run `fastboot` as that too has been locked down permanently because &#34;security&#34;.Thank god we have Linux created before all this Bullshit started happening. If Apple, Google and Microsoft was in charge of things as they are now, we wouldn&#39;t even have any hardware to run anything else than Windows and iOS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that if you are just interested in US sales taxes, and only need to collect tax in the ~1/2 of the states that are part of the Streamlines Sales Tax (SST) project, you can have your tax rate calculation, registration, reporting, and filing all done for free.The member states of SST have agreed to pay for those services from several  tax SaaS companies. (There is one catch: to avail yourself of this, you must collect tax for all SST states, even though you might be below the threshold in some of them).The companies participating are Avalara, TaxCloud, Sovos, and Accurate Tax.For small online businesses I suspect that a lot more can take advantage of this than you might expect. Here&#39;s a map showing the SST member states [1]. Although it is missing some big states that you probably do a lot of business in (California for instance), a lot of those big states have quite high thresholds for sales or number of transactions before tax kicks in.Some of the companies that provide the fee SST service will also add non-SST states for a fee. If you only need one or two non-SST states, it will still probably come out cheaper than using Stripe (and will include reporting and filing).[1] https://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was lucky to be part of the beta for my SaaS (https://turnshift.app) and I must say this new feature simplifies things A LOT.Especially as a EU business owner, I previously had to sync every VAT tax rate possible, use a complex workflow to know if a customer needed to pay taxes or not, link tax rates to customers, and create taxes reports for my accountant. Stripe tax does all of that automatically, based on the customer full address and VAT numbers.Here&#39;s a twitter thread of everything you had to do previously: https://twitter.com/vvoyer/status/1347488977738149888PS: Yes there were other services (Paddle) providing this (and much more to be honest), but the Stripe API and customization options makes it my go-to solution for integrating payments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question: can somebody enlighten me about Stripe&#39;s appeal? I am not an user (until recently they weren&#39;t even available in my country) but I used ShareIt (now Digital River) 20 years ago and Avangate (now 2checkout soon Verifone) in the past 15 years and they both:- had a much larger international presence, with localizations and everything- had sales taxes, VATs etc computed from day one- had cart (not sure about ShareIt though) &amp; API- integrated countless payment gateways: from credit cards to purchase orders, wire transfers and even PayPalHow comes Stripe won even if they arrived much later on the market? I believe their pricing structure was not very far from the competition. What did they offer to attract users even though they lacked such important features?I want to learn."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back, I had the opportunity to lead the Product Team of a 200+ people company. It took me over a month to understood who does what, and I tend to try to know things around me and at least have the idea of “what to do in an emergency.”I stumble on one DevOps guy who wrote every bloody thing happening in the system. He likes doing it, but from the way people were asking questions in the common chatrooms, group emails, I knew nobody read them. He loves plain text, nicely formatted with the old-school Unix-styles et al. I had talks with him outside of work and found him fascinating; I asked him help with my hobby, home-lab tinkerings, etc.By that time, I had already started internal blog groups and was encouraging people to write. And indeed, a lot of people came out to write about engineering, marketing, product, and it became a routine for people to show off what they can do, what they love, and what they are good at.In one of my regular company-wide emailers, I dedicated a big piece to the DevOps guy, pointing to his work and the beauty of his documentations. People loved it, and they began reading it. He remained a friend. That mailer was the only way I could highlight people I encounter doing good work, to the whole team up to the CxOs.By the time I left the company, I was responsible for many vital things in the company, but I could transition everything smoothly with the documents and credential details (thanks to 1Password).In the last year or so, I have been thinking more about -- always be dying. I think the similar vein of Always be Quitting; I try to document, write out details, just in case I die and my family has to figure out the intricacies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What does one do when they live by this philosophy of documenting everything and making sure knowledge is captured, but your team mates just refuse to volley the ball back? I find myself documenting how the software works, writing up proposals with beautiful diagrams etc, but my teammates won&#39;t take the simple step to even read the dang thing without scheduling a meeting with me to spoon feed / read it aloud to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paradoxically, by being disposable, you free yourself.No, you just make yourself disposable.War is peace.
Freedom is slavery.
Ignorance is strength.Don’t listen to this article. It sounds like something overseers would tell their underlings.And when you’re quitting, that’s the company’s problem, not yours."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is good.Now states are combating such hesitancy by drawing lottery for vaccinated folks.Like, having this magic, absolutely mind boggling potion that prevents serious illness and death *isn&#39;t* already the lottery win of our lifetime??People in India and elsewhere are dying because of lack of vaccines and here we have educated, first world countries struggle to get their citizens vaccinated.Unfortunately shaming such people will only push them further into antivax territory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a range of anti-vaccine opinions from idiotic (the example Linus quotes) to more reasonable. The way this issue has been handled is emblematic of the way many such political issues are handled: fringe views are promoted and &#34;debunked&#34; while more reasonable views that go against mainstream narratives are ignored. This is amplified by various high profile personalities in the media who shape the views people are presented with, so that all critics of the mainstream narrative appear to be lunatics. Thus stigmatizing anyone who has a more reasonable objection. This is not a new phenomenon but has played out much more frequently over the last year or so.Also, I got the vaccine, so if you interpret this as some sort of veiled anti-vaccine comment you are part of the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting given one of the lesser known complications of covid can be myocarditis in otherwise healthy individuals with few or no other covid symptoms.In fact, it’s likely the incidence of covid-induced myocarditis is vastly underreported given it often shows no symptoms and can only reasonably be diagnosed with a cardiac MRI which is not always widely available or advised for less-serious heart conditions.I was diagnosed with myocarditis last year and despite a negative PCR test around the onset of symptoms (light-headedness, heart palpitations, fatigue) was strongly suspected to have contracted covid.I was lucky enough to get my first dose of the moderna vaccine a few months back and beside a few days of increased heart palpitations I’ve had no trouble as far as I’m aware, does make me wonder about getting that second dose though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdote: I had this reaction to the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine, saw a cardiologist and she mentioned that she’s been seeing this quite a bit after the second dose.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the interesting things that happened at my company is that productivity instantly doubled when we started working remotely. The reality at my company is that people are only getting 20 hours or so of work done in the office - the rest is socialization, pointless meetings, lunches, or trying to look busy. When we went home for lockdown and kept working 40 hour weeks, not only did productive output double, but everyone burned out in a few weeks.In my opinion, the reality of working from home is that 20-30 hour work weeks need to be acceptable and we should use the rest of our time on non-working things, just like we did in the office, but now that time can be more meaningful to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So yes, as a &#34;boss&#34;, the work-from-home future is definitely and absolutely destroying my brain, but I think the whole discussion around control in the article completely misses my point. I couldn&#39;t care less about control and never cared about seat-in-the-ass time before.But as an engineer become manager, I can absolutely feel both sides here:While everything development is massively more chill remote (no interruptions and hey, just go fill your dishwasher while stuff compiles), everything about managing remotely completely sucks for me.Videocalls. Whiteboarding. Interviewing. Strategic work. Reading emotions and connecting to people. What was a matter of just getting six people in a war room for a week and getting that hard problem done now takes eternities and every meeting is an energy hog.Honestly, I really enjoyed being a leader for a technology organization, but right now, I absolutely hate it. There seem to be others who cope better, but it&#39;s certainly not for me.I&#39;m pretty curious on how all of this will turn out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, someone insufferable will read this and say “NOT ALL MIDDLE MANAGERS,” and let me tell you, if you’re thinking that, you are probably part of the problem.Clever.  Take the obvious objection--that this is all based on stereotyping of the role and, frankly, cynical assumptions about the way management is or can be structured--and then just turn it into another symptom of management dysfunction!How very tautological: Before you tell me I&#39;m wrong, let me tell you you&#39;re wrong for telling me I&#39;m wrong.And yes, I&#39;m a manager.  And no, I never spent time &#39;[walking] the floors, “[keeping] an eye on people” and, in meetings, “[speaking] for the group.”&#39;&#39; because I have far far more important things to do, like helping my staff understand the corporate vision so they can make good, independent decisions; helping solve problems for my staff when they come to me with issues; working with our sales team to manage customer expectations and negotiate on projects and solutions; managing the expectations of senior management based on the information I&#39;m getting from my staff.  And the list goes on and on.But, who am I to say.  I&#39;m just a middle manager who is, I&#39;m sure, just part of the problem..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  Grzegorz Prusak&gt;       Comment 5 • 6 hours ago&gt; I do not understand the math behind the mentioned problem.&gt; Is either the RFC or BR really specifying a DATE of 1s precision to be an INTERVAL rather than a POINT IN TIME?
It specifies a granularity of points are allowed to be endpoints of a validity period, but these are still POINTS AFAICT.&gt; It means that, for example 10:00:01 is AFTER 10:00, even though 10:00:01 is not a valid endpoint of a validity period (and it doesn&#39;t have to be, as it is a measurement result, not a validity period endpoint).&gt; Does RFC or BR requires a browser to round down the measured current time to full seconds, before comparing them against the validity period?As a random member of the public, this seems like a reasonable interpretation to me... though the time format which expiry dates are required to be expressed in is explicitly not allowed to include fractional seconds... so maybe it is meant as an interval not a point in time."</p>

Apple built a platform, where they take some cut for themselves, while allowing other people to sell digital contents on their platform.Other than the argument that this could be an anti-trust situation (i.e. in that case, the argument would be that Apple is abusing their market position), what differentiates these two cases ?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the replies from the founder:
&gt;We removed the ability to subscribe in app, but Apple still required us to do their 30% or would remove our app. However, if you do have the current app, it&#39;s not yet subject to Apple&#39;s 30% and all creators still will receive 90% of their earnings.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a hedgehog is useful on the journey to domain mastery because sticking to frameworks saves you time and headache compared to not having any frameworks at all.The 3 stages of domain mastery:Stage 1 - No knowledge or structure to approach a domain (everything is hard, pitfalls are everywhere)Stage 2 - Frameworks that are useful to approach the domain (Map to avoid pitfall areas)Stage 3 - Detailed understanding of the domain (in which you can move through pitfall areas freely and see where frameworks fall short)Hedgehogs are at stage 2. You move from stage 1 to stage 2 by adopting frameworks; hence, hedgehogs are seen as &#34;thought leaders&#34; because they teach the frameworks that lead MOST people to more mastery. Except when you&#39;re at stage 3, in which case frameworks lead you to more inefficiencies compared to your own understanding.All good decisions must be made by stage 3 persons, but ironically, training is most efficiently done by stage 2 persons. Hedgehogs get more limelight because 90% of the population is at stage 1 and values the knowledge of stage 2 (and can&#39;t grasp the complexities and nuances of stage 3).Many hedgehogs struggle to touch stage 3, and instead see stage 2 as mastery. This is compounded by the positive feedback loops of success - the frameworks save time, it gives them reputation, it allows them to save stage 1 persons from their ignorance, and it&#39;s the foundation of their current level and achievements. Frameworks are also convenient and broadly applicable to many problems; detailed domain mastery in contrast is difficult, time consuming, and  highly contextualized.All of this makes it hard to move beyond stage 2 into stage 3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s cathartic to read other people who have to go through this.I&#39;m fighting red tape for my team as we build out a dashboard.Outlook is packed with 1–2 hour meetings for the next 3 months where so far I&#39;m:* being asked to load test our system to make sure it can handle the load (of 3 people?)* being asked to integrate with various analytics platforms so we can alert some poor schmuck at 3 AM in case the API goes down then (it&#39;s not a vital part of any platform)* told to have this run in k8s since everything runs in k8s* other pedantic tasks by Sys Ops who think everything is a nail and love to argue their points ad exhaustium (or worse, argue why their fav stack is the golden child)I understand the need for standards and making sure they&#39;re followed, but there really needs to be a human element of, &#34;is this truly needed for what I&#39;m trying to do?&#34;. So many engineering departments are all about automation, but don&#39;t truly think through how much automation is needed, rather than a 1 size fits all approach.I appreciate that this article comes to the conclusion that the more correct an answer will be, the more complicated it tends to be. I wish more people in decision making positions would understand this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My leadership is constantly pushing for “hedgehog” style advice to be depersonalized, encoded in policies, and handed over to bureaucrats or automation to enforce.Trying to empathize with their position, I think they think failure happens because the right hedgehogs didn’t show up to the design review that day, or forgot to harp on whatever point that time. They are never satisfied with the “it depends, there’s no hard and fast rule, you have to let the experts think about it in context” responses I give them when pressed for policy. This is limiting my advancement. But worse, someday someone will join the team and will write those hedgehog policies, and then I’ll have to live under them too.Software engineering is a thinking person’s game. I get that management wishes it weren’t, but it is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. Wow, uh, I definitely did not expect to be featured on HN this morning, but seeing this linked put a massive smile on my face.There are just so many examples of captivating writing, innovative problem solving, and candid discussion throughout the FFFs. Taken all together, the Factorio journey is one of my favorite _stories_ to read...and it contributed to becoming a better designer and engineer along the way. I really encourage people to read more of their blog than just what I&#39;ve linked, since it crosses so many areas of interest.To anyone reading that&#39;s worked on Factorio, thank you and you all are wonderful people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick links to the five &#34;must read&#34; posts that William highlighted:&gt; FFF #243 - New GUI tileset: Showing off their GUI design document. A MUST READ, if only for a good example of a comprehensive design style that fits the game theme perfectly. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-243)&gt; FFF #176 - Belts optimization for 0.15 : Incredible analysis of transport belts and optimizing their performance. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-176)&gt; FFF #204 - Another day, another optimisation : Solid technical writeup on how a prefetching optimization patch works across a number of resource-heavy factory builds. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-204)&gt; FFF #296 - All kinds of bugs : The snippet at the bottom is a perfect encapsulation of their attitude towards problem solving. It’s such a simple concept, just going a little farther, that can take tremendous discipline and focus. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-296)&gt; FFF #356 - Blueprint library for real : Michal “kovarex” Kovařík, one of the two cofounders, talks about falling out of the development process, losing his sense of purpose, and how playing Factorio with his son brought him back. Reading this one, even through the sometimes-broken English, is inspirational and a wonderful look at how things fall apart and come back together. Like I mentioned in the intro, this is one of those rare, special offerings that is technical in nature but deeply personal and human-centric in form. A MUST READ. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-356)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a huge fan of Factorio since 2014.A huge fan of the game, the team, and the entrepreneurial adventure.Their willingness to share insights, every weeks, for 7 years is quite rare in the industry.It was also awesome to read the thought process behind each design decision alongside some nerdy story about C++ optimization.Factorio team, if you&#39;re ready this, thank you!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s why investors buy up houses: they know your neighbors will do the dirty work of artificially constraining the housing supply, which makes it a good investment.Here&#39;s one who comes right out and explains this:&gt; Meanwhile, local opposition to building is so commonplace and the approval process so cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive, even when a proposed project complies entirely with requirements, approvals are not forthcoming, at least in an expeditious manner and needed supply is simply not provided.  Recently I heard of a new acronym to add to my vocabulary: CAVE, Citizens Against Virtually Everything, to be added to NIMBYISM and BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone).https://www.clearcapllc.com/2021/04/27/q1-2021-clear-capital...Support groups like https://yimbyaction.org/ if you want to &#39;stick it to the investors&#39;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If only so many people didn&#39;t treat land and houses like investments, there wouldn&#39;t be such a disastrous hoarding problem. Henry George&#39;s Land Value Tax [1][2] seems like an obvious economic fix that would require a large fraction of the population to change how they think about land and natural resources, but most of them are invested in such a way (i.e. owning multiple houses on multiple parcels of land, often without renting anything out) that it is in their economic self-interest to block any such proposals. Although, I suppose this situation isn&#39;t unique. The world has long been doomed by coordination problems.[1] https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progr...[2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Bitcoin is positioned to disrupt the remittances industry in El Salvador, estimated at about $5 billion annually. Most families in towns like El Zonte do not have bank accounts, and rely on services such as Western Union WU +0.5%, which take 5-10% in fees. The closest Western Union is approximately one hour by bus, requiring the recipient of the cash transfer to take the bus back with cash on hand, creating a safety issue.&#34; [0][0] https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/07/14/this-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazingly shortsighted. The primary beneficiaries of this will be organised crime, who will now be able to wash the Bitcoin via El Salvador to convert it to dollars, which they can use to buy trade items and export the profits.The number one export of El Salvador is actually people. If they were concerned about remittance fees they could just set up a bank in the US with low fees, instead of getting kickbacks from OCGs and Western Union / Money Gram etc.El Salvador is set to be a big climate change loser, and every joule spent on bitcoin is bringing them closer to disaster.&#34;El Salvador has seen a steady increase in extreme events (storms, floods and droughts) during the last 30 years. The Pacific coastline is already experiencing rising sea levels and it is expected that 10–28 percent of the country’s coastal zone territory will be lost by the end of the century. Coastal areas, home to over 30 percent of the population, are highly vulnerable to the combination of sea level rise and El Niño events.&#34;https://www.climatelinks.org/resources/climate-risk-profile-...Coastal flooding risk is significant due to loss of mangroves.https://thinkhazard.org/en/report/75-el-salvador/CF"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To give some technical background: yes, using Lightning (as they seem to do) for affordable BTC payments is challenging for most. As far as I am aware that is why they rely on custodial solutions [1]. People hold their money with someone from their village they trust, which is not ideal but neither is being unbanked. Down the road I could easily see this trust being spread over multiple people using multisig wallets.The amazing thing about all this is that everyone can become a BTC &#34;bank&#34;. You need a bit of capital but orders of magnitude less than a normal bank would require, maybe 2k$ to get started of which you might spend 400$ on hardware and fees to open some channels. The trustless nature of lightning lets you and your users then join the global payment network without asking for permission from anyone and you can engage in commerce internationally.I think, while we are still early, that this is an awesome experiment. It will highlight the UX problems so we can fix them. Hopefully at some point all this will make sense to the average westerner too, so we can finally have a money not controlled by anyone (states, incumbent banks) again. But that might take a long time.[1] https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy#status-of-the-project"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Your problem is not with SMS as a second factor though. (Unless you think the attacker had your password as well). It is with the use of SMS as a single recovery factor.The very things that make SMS a uniquely good second factor make it an awful only factor. Use of SMS for account recovery should in general (or at least for important accounts) have a delay (order of days) that allows the real user to intervene."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lost my Microsoft account years ago. I still get emails from Microsoft stating that there&#39;s suspicious activity on the account. I got two just yesterday.Despite that, despite still having access to the email the account is on, I cannot recover the Microsoft account. Despite Microsoft notifying me that the account is still, years later to this day, being abused, cannot use any form of recovery. I cannot access the account with help from support or even after visiting a brick-and-mortar store.It&#39;s one big reason that I&#39;ve long since refused to purchase anything more from Microsoft and have ditched Windows.Good luck recovering your stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have said, it is not that SMS 2FA is insecure; it is that thieves have figured out how to defeat it using SIM jacking and a bit of facebooking and googling.  It is now trivial to figure out your home town, your favorite pet, etc.  Also as others have said, the current alternatives have their problems.  What if you lose all your Yubi keys?  What if your phone was accidentally wiped and you never got around to backing it up?  You cannot prove you are you and so customer support cannot help you.  Google, Microsoft, and Apple are not known for helping consumers get themselves out of this catch-22.It is a mistake to ask consumers to protect, backup, and secure their digital lives themselves.  Consumers don&#39;t have the time or skills to keep up with the hackers.  If Apple, Google, ATT, Verizon etc. cannot provide digital security, this is an opportunity for someone else to step in.  My personal suggestion is this is a ripe opportunity for someone like the US Post Office or Department of Motor Vehicles.  Consumers would go to the US Post Office or DMV and purchase a Yubi key from them.  The additional value they add, is they can verify the identity of the consumers who is purchasing the Yubi key and replace the key if it is lost/stolen.  Similar to how they process driver licenses or passports.  This service is optional and would actually cost money.  I would gladly pay a monthly fee for this peace of mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am really curious to see where we&#39;ll be in a year, two, three down the line wrt remote/office/hybrid work at major companies.This forced experiment has had some surprising outcomes about the effectiveness of remote workplaces, but working from home for only a year, in pandemic conditions, is clearly not the same as indefinitely in normal times. But there&#39;s reason to think that may go even better, not worse; I am really curious to see how it plays out and glad more companies are continuing to let people work remotely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been back in my company&#39;s office in person (medium-sized tech company) for the last week with a small subset of employees before we all go back, and I&#39;ve become pretty convinced that these hybrid models will not go well. Even while wearing masks and social distancing, I feel far more connected to the others that work in the office, and whether it&#39;s fair or not, personal connection and trust play a huge role in collaborating effectively and deciding who gets what work, who gets promoted, etc. If everyone can choose whatever combination of remote and in-person they want, it seems impossible to me that there won&#39;t be extremely strong in-group/out-group effects that will cause big organizational problems for companies. But I&#39;m saying this as a young person excited to work in person, so maybe others (parents, those with long commutes) feel it&#39;s still worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My office before the pandemic was basically people looking at screens and slacking each other rather than lifting their head up an inch to speak - literally even if the person was one chair over from them.When we went remote, nothing changed other than people no longer had to commute. The feedback from the team has been overwhelmingly and consistently positive. Nobody wants to go back full time - ever. The most they’ll concede is a day or two per week, but I strongly suspect reality will be less than that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vivaldi Mail? That took a while :-DVivaldi is developed by a team created by the former Opera founder and CEO. Vivaldi kind of tries to re-create the spirit of Opera, but I think it&#39;s going to be too hard to do it.For those who didn&#39;t use it, Opera was first a paid browser (which limited its reach), then an ad-supported browser (which again limited its reach). It then finally became a free browser but by then it was too late.It had its own, super fast, rendering engine (I forget its name, Presto?). It had a built in email client, feed reader, calendar (unfortunately with no Exchange or Gmail integration), a notes app, a powerful download manager and even a Bitorrent client. And a TON of features and UI flexibility.It was super compact, a marvel of engineering and UX design that managed to pack all those things in a package of about 5MB at the time, and you wouldn&#39;t even see or load the extra functionality like the email client if you didn&#39;t use it.Unfortunately with HTML5 and the Chrome-ification of the web, it couldn&#39;t keep up :-(Vivaldi tries to do the same on top of web techs and web techs just can&#39;t handle it. Web techs are almost as flexible but they&#39;re really slow and bulky.Still, I wish them luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to offer Vivaldi some praise, I switched to it as my main browser a few years ago, and it&#39;s been great. I had to look for a new browser when Firefox (that I had used since the Firebird days) kept breaking my settings and plugins with their updates. After yet another Firefox update I wasn&#39;t able to restore the browser to how I want it to be, so I tried Vivaldi.I&#39;m not even a big fan of the original Opera, but love Vivaldi&#39;s features such as easy screen splitting between two tabs and one-click actions to disable images or apply certain filters to a page. Picture-in-picture and pop-outs for media are also great, periodic tab reload is occasionally very useful.Ideally I&#39;d like to use a fully FOSS browser, but my patience with Firefox ran out, and Vivaldi is Chromium + custom open-source parts + closed-source UI layer. Good enough for me, though not ideal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I switched to Vivaldi from Chrome earlier this year as I was uncomfortable with the level of Google integration in that browser.Vivaldi is based on Chromium and has lots of improvements over Chrome, like gestures out of the box, side panels, lots of clear options. And Chrome extensions work perfectly.
I&#39;ve had no issues so far.The complexity of managing a browser engine that does what everyone expects requires humongous resources so I can understand the move to Chromium. As long as the google bits are removed and the extensions work, it&#39;s great to have an alternative to Edge and Chrome.I mostly use Firefox as my daily browser and nothing would make me abandon it but it&#39;s nice to be able to segregate your various professional/private persona using different browsers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I&#39;ve pointed out before, I think this problem didn&#39;t exist in 01974, or in CP/M at all, ever; I think CP/M was perfectly capable of creating files named AUX.H, or PRN.H, RDR.H, CON.H, LPR.H, etc.  IIRC, even CP/M PIP (which is what actually implemented the special device names) required the colon to indicate that you meant a device.  So if you wanted to print FOO.DOC on the printer in CP/M PIP you could say PRN: = FOO.DOC but not PRN = FOO.DOC.  You could also, I think, say B: = FOO.DOC to copy FOO.DOC onto drive B:.The problem was introduced, IIRC, in MS-DOS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I knew what this was going to be as soon as I saw &#34;aux.h&#34; in the screenshot.Some years ago I was working on an embedded system that involved DisplayPort. For those unaware, DP&#39;s control channel is called AUX. One day, my new co-worker who used Windows asked me, who used Linux, why my AUX-related code wasn&#39;t checked in - which it most certainly was.And that, folks, is how I learned about this absurd property of Windows that exists to this day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thread inaccurately describes the limitation of these special names being on the &#34;OS level&#34; -- it&#39;s actually one layer down, in the DOS and Win32 subsystems. Windows NT doesn&#39;t throw fits about these file names if the subsystem you run under (see: POSIX, LXSS, OS/2) doesn&#39;t care about them. Cygwin can even override the Win32 behavior by just passing all its file handlers through the native NT API instead of the Win32 API."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The mob is a huge problem with Twitter (and adjacent social media), and the issue with a mob is purely that of its size. It&#39;s the size that makes the mob, and everyone who has ever considered chiming in to add their voice why so-and-so was bad should stop to think about whether the world really needs that additional voice. Each individual voice may be perfectly right. So-and-so may really have done wrong. But did they really do such wrong that the 10,000th voice is needed?I am ashamed to say I&#39;ve done it myself, back when I was on Twitter. My feed would start lighting up with some really Bad thing that so-and-so said -- and generally it was &#34;Bad&#34; -- and I&#39;d add my voice somewhere to that cacophony. Not necessarily writing to the Bad Person, but chiming in on someone&#39;s long thread.Now I look back and see I was another participant in the mob.Look, the author described in the post absolutely did herself no favors. Her book may have been great, but the way she interacted with people on social media was absolutely not. But being the 10,000th person to tell her that is never necessary. That&#39;s just wanting to join a mob, because mobs are fun, because you&#39;re all justified in this act together.Mobs are scary, because everyone thinks they are justified. A good friend of mine grew up in Kenya and recounted that when he was about nine, he saw a mob catch a thief. Joining in with everyone else, he took a wire and whipped the man. Next thing he knew, the crowd had put tires over the alleged thief and set him on fire. He has never forgotten the guilt he felt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not that the people who form a twitter mob don&#39;t think or &#34;let twitter think for them&#34;.It&#39;s that they actively enjoy hurting someone as a mob. They get a kick out of it, and it&#39;s not discouraged (as would be actually forming a mob out in the streets be). If anything, it&#39;s encouraging, and gives them not just the joy of kicking someone who is down, but also &#34;good person&#34; credits (because the one getting kicked is a bad person, of course).In other words, people are not mislead &#34;against their better nature&#34;: they are just encouraged to embrace their badness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many comments here blaming Twitter while blissfully unaware that HN fuels the exact same online outrage. Almost every day there&#39;s a &#34;&lt;company&gt; did bad thing to me&#34; article on the front page and people immediately pick up their pitchforks and join the mob. You cannot fix the problem without acknowledging that we are all part of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary:1. Capital Gain taxes are delayed until you actually sell the stock.2. Corporate taxes are being reduced because companies are moving profits to foreign jurisdictions.3. Estate taxes &amp; income taxes are being avoided by the creation of charitable foundations.The 2nd and 3rd points are very valid, and I wish the author had spent more time on them.  Unfortunately instead, the author spends much more time on point 1, conflating wealth with income, and avoiding the obvious argument that capital gains are eventually taxed - the rich are not escaping that....unless point 3 (foundation) occurs.  And that should be the main story.Squabbling over a wealth tax is not useful.  The real issue is that the super rich create these personal &#34;foundations&#34; that act as never-taxed income holes, and then use them as personal and political tools.In total, there&#39;s nothing very revealing about this article.  It&#39;s everything we&#39;ve already known.  IMO, we need to curb foreign tax havens, and severely limit tax exemptions for charitable donations.A more interesting question is how did ProPublica get a copy of Jeff Bezos&#39; tax returns.  Seems like a leak at the IRS?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article does not conflates income and wealth, stop saying that. This is NOT what it says. 
Thats&#39; the whole damn point, they say that the system &#34;tax the income&#34; is flawed because it allows to borrow as much as your wealth allows, and live your life exactly as if you had that in income, without ever paying the income tax.I am quoting &#34;Their wealth derives from the skyrocketing value of their assets, like stock and property. Those gains are not defined by U.S. laws as taxable income unless and until the billionaires sell&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless you are a wage or salary earner, it is trivially easy to avoid having to pay taxes, at least in the USA. Same with the much lauded “inheritance tax” and even, to a lesser extent, sales taxes. It costs about 4000us a year to maintain the legal structures required to pay essentially no taxes, except sales taxes in some locations.  In many cases, for lower levels of income, just having a small business can negate income tax burdens.Taxation always has been, and continues to be, a burden for the servile class to bear. The rich or enterprising pay taxes only when they are ill prepared or choose to, often to reduce scrutiny.The &#34; I should pay more taxes&#34; rhetoric from the wealthy is merely virtue signaling, it is totally legal to pay more taxes than you owe, and you can even reclaim the money later if you need to. There is nothing preventing anyone from paying the taxes that they feel that they should owe, in excess of legal requirements.By and large, sales taxes are more evenly applied, but that too is far from perfect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If we ignore all this culture war bullshit for a minute there&#39;s a really fascinating issue here.The concrete issue is flight search. When you google &#34;flight from a to b&#34;, rather then seeing search results linking to websites for flight search, the first thing you see is the results of Google&#39;s own flight search. Is that wrong? What about image search? When you search for &#34;skyline berlin&#34;, you&#39;ll see images of berlin&#39;s skyline, before you see links to other image search sites.Same is true for a lot other stuff. If you search &#34;timer&#34;, you&#39;ll see a timer, not links to various timers that look ugly as shit.As a consumer, I love it. So much easier.On the other hand, google could take over almost any business like this. At least, any business that is &#34;functional&#34; in the sense that the only thing you really want is to get some output based on your input.There&#39;s a clear tradeoff here between what&#39;s good for consumers, and concerns about democracy, the concentration of power, etc.. And also innovation. Why start a new company, if google can just take over everything?There are only two clear, non-arbitrary rules: Search engines are only allowed to show a list of links, or search engines can show whatever they want."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Terraform is such an underappreciated tool. It seems like so much of the hate surrounds HCL1 (back in Terraform before 0.12) and doesn&#39;t reflect modern Terraform.For example, after introducing `for_each` and dynamic blocks, it&#39;s possible to nearly entirely ditch variables files and local modules, and just add more infrastructure by editing a local YAML file. The only variables your Terraform code should have should be credentials / other secrets that are not loaded from environment variables by providers. A great public example of this usage pattern is supplied by https://github.com/concourse/governance to manage their GitHub repositories."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to the talented people at Hashicorp.I love Terraform and have used it for years (before 0.12 I think). The workflow, meaningful diffs and reproducible &#39;infrastructure-as-code&#39; gave a user experience that really was a massive step up to what I was used to (basically cloud console and scripts in CI).In fact the Terraform workflow / philosophy inspired some of the design of an OSS &#39;data-as-code&#39; tool (https://www.getsynth.com/) that we&#39;re building a company around. We wanted to use HCL instead of JSON for our config to start off with, but the Rust HCL parsers when we started the project weren&#39;t really robust so we settled.Anyway, congratulations Hashicorp!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been sitting on the fence wrt Terraform and other such tools for quite some time now. After being _forced_ to finally write massive k8s YAML files (and ansible YAML files) for a consulting gig, I&#39;ve been wondering whether these tools should be developed as _libraries_, that you glue together using a full-fledged programming language, instead of shoe-horning a programming language in YAML.For example, could the following be library functions that you could glue together in the programming language of your choice: (a) get current state of infra, (b) calculate diff between desired state and current state, (c) perform a single step (safely) that represents a granular change in infra, (d) perform a series of steps representing infra changes with safe rollback?Does something like this already exist?"</p>

Grades mattered more in the old days when the route to success was to acquire credentials while ascending some predefined ladder. But it&#39;s just as well that their tactics are focused on grades. How awful it would be if they invaded the territory of projects, and thereby gave their kids a distaste for this kind of work by forcing them to do it. Grades are already a grim, fake world, and aren&#39;t harmed much by parental interference, but working on one&#39;s own projects is a more delicate, private thing that could be damaged very easily.It&#39;s so true. I got obsessed with programming around 11, started off with my shitty vb6 programs and moved on to reverse engineering video games and writing hacks. I never told any adults what I was doing until I was nearly an adult myself, out of fear they&#39;d ruin my hobby like they did everything else. I remember thinking to myself how much school sucked and being determined not to let that poison the one thing I liked worked on. My parents thought I was a degenerate who did nothing but play computer games all day. Blew them away when I got my first programming job and eventually skipped college to start working right out of high school.I have a bunch of friends who say the same thing. They&#39;d find some new cool thing, show even the slightest interest in it and their mom would immediately start making them drill it three hours a day until they hated it and weren&#39;t interested in it anymore. It&#39;s a sad story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jared Diamond, in his book &#34;The Day Before Yesterday&#34;, talks about how children in Papua New Guinea when he was an anthropologist there would play at making a garden or raising pigs.  The kid would have a toy, wooden pig, and then eventually be given a piglet, and then gradually their &#34;play&#34; would become more realistic until it shaded into adult work.My daughter, as a youngun&#39;, wanted to play &#34;coffeeshop&#34; where she would set up a coffeeshop at home and charge her mother and I for drinks.  I think this says something about how much she saw the inside of coffeeshops while I was programming there.The main obstacle to still using the play-better-until-it&#39;s-real path, is that we don&#39;t have a good way for kids to see what adults are doing, in most jobs.  Otherwise, their natural instincts are still to &#34;play&#34; at doing what they see the adults doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another aspect of personal projects is that if they’re truly enjoyable they can be a kind of salve for burnout.* If you feel like you can’t even open your IDE, a personal project can generate the excitement that reinvigorates your passion.There’s also less of a speed limit with personal projects — the things like: “before you go down that road let’s talk with X; hold off on that idea for now; let’s wait until...”This freedom is conducive to learning new things. My career success rests heavily on skills I gained pursuing personal projects, where I was able to try ridiculously complicated or “out there” ideas. I’ve worked for people in the past who were strongly against me spending free time on personal projects, but benefited from all the skills I had gained doing so. Beware of this mindset — it’s fear based and leads to unsuccessful outcomes in other ways.* Side note is: careful not to burn out on what’s supposed to be a fun personal project."</p>

Unfortunately, that which makes electric cars and planes feasible, namely energy density (Wh/litre) and specific energy (Wh/kg), has not improved that rapidly. The article mentions a factor of 3.4 over 30 years for energy density, ie 4% p.a., or doubling every 17 years.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; on the good side of things, getting an Intel CPU to enter the red state is not easy to accomplish. In fact, it should never happen unless there are vulnerabilities in the Intel Management Engine (ME), an almost undocumented subsystem present in all Intel CPUs since 2008 that Intel says is required to provide full performance.&#34;unless there are vulnerabilities or backdoors in the Intel Management Engine (ME)&#34;.There, fixed it for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My initial guess was &#34;WRMSR, and the 64-bit version of WRMSR&#34;. Fortunately, this appears to be an actually new finding rather than the memorable case a few years back of someone claiming to have discovered something that was clearly documented in the datasheet.The whole idea that there&#39;s a &#34;red state&#34; and a bunch of others on a CPU, normally hidden, should immediately raise the attention of many who wonder what those extra modes can do, and more interestingly, why they&#39;re hidden. From the (very little!) research I&#39;ve done, it appears this is not unlike SGX where only Intel has the key[1] to some part of the hardware you bought from them, and based on some leaked internal documents, it&#39;s very plausible that this is indeed a backdoor which only they can use. Ostensibly, for debugging purposes. Here&#39;s a previous comment I made on this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26521359[1] If these keys were leaked, which I very much hope will happen at some point, no doubt the &#34;security&#34; community will be heavily against it and spread plenty of FUD about how it makes everyone&#39;s computers insecure. But IMHO it should be eagerly awaited and received with the same optimism as the other DRM key leaks (HDCP, HDDVD, etc.) --- it is a path to freedom."</p>

It&#39;s a double whammy, in that the network has been blown wide open and the AFP is now telling Ayik to hand himself in to avoid recriminations from his associates.  No doubt there will be a movie about this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As to how the FBI got access to the messages, Vice says[1] after Vincent Ramos of Phantom Secure was arrested in 2018, a confidential human source offered Anom, which the source was developing, to the FBI (probably in exchange for immunity or a reduced sentence, in my opinion). The source then seeded Anom phones to his existing distributors as a replacement for Phantom Secure phones, and from their they made their way into criminal organisations.[1] https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shie..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What we&#39;ve learned is only what was in Austrlia&#39;s piece of the cake, given they started their day already. New Zeland had theirs already, too. I imagine thousands of arrests are still happening worldwide and several press conferences are going to be held today. Looking at the seal of the operation (https://www.anom.io/trojan_shield_seal.jpg), following countries participated in the operation:
Canada, Australia, US, Sweden, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Austria, UK, New Zeland, Estonia, Scotland, Germany, Denmark.I expect this to be bigger than Panama Papers. Way bigger. I expect a few prominent politicians to be soon either arrested  or &#34;convinced&#34; to step down. I expect the US to have gained a lot of intel and leverage over those from the countries who did not participate in this. We will absolutely not learn about everything they discovered. CIA will and the respective intelligence agencies will.EDIT: Europol will hold their conference live on YouTube at 10 AM CST: https://twitter.com/janoorth/status/1402164252266409987EDIT 2: given how Serbia was in the top 4 of messages sent, I really hope that the info gathered will help Interpol fight child trafficking and exploitation in the EU.From the VICE article (https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shie...) quoted elsewhere here:&#34;Additionally, the review of Anom messages has initiated numerous high-level public corruption cases in several countries. The most prominent distributors are currently being investigated by the FBI for participating in an enterprise which promotes international drug trafficking, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.&#34;&#34;Late Monday, the FBI said that it would be holding &#34;a news conference announcing a massive worldwide takedown based on the San Diego FBI’s unprecedented investigation involving the interception of encrypted communications&#34; on Tuesday.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Naturally, I took down my project right away...So a CEO bullied you. He threatened to have lawyers look at something, accused you of behaving poorly, and accused you of being difficult. He is being manipulative. He is trying to guilt / scare you into stopping. And it worked.For all readers... do not be afraid of lawyers. Especially if nobody has even talked to them yet. Lawyers do not like to lose cases, so will not push a losing agenda. Yet they also must do what their client asks, so lawyers looking into a concern, or even sending nastygrams... those are meaningless actions. It only becomes meaningful if and when if their lawyers indicate they believe they really have a case, or if your own lawyer believes they have a case. Everything before that is posturing and bullying.If I were in the same situation as OP, I&#39;d state that my intent was positive, ask to be informed of the results of discussions with attorneys, and wish them to have a nice day. Admit no wrong, make no apologies, ignore irrelevant statements (in particular personal attacks), and just let it slide until they take a real action of some kind.Once they do take an action, then it might be appropriate to do what they want. But seriously... stop letting people be bullies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seeing a lot of posts like this. Open source is wonderful in its way, but it&#39;s really not sustainable to work on projects that make money for other people - including big commercial interests - when they don&#39;t help out in any fashion. I&#39;m not just talking money or contributions. I&#39;m talking about simple acknowledgement: &#34;we use project X&#34; - even privately.A open source library that I worked on at Intel (the Hyperscan high performance regular expression library) had to shed most of its staff (including all the original folks who worked on it, including me). One of the big contributing factors was a sense that &#34;well, who really uses this&#34;. The answer was &#34;tons of people, including some major Intel target customers&#34; but a number of Hyperscan users picked up the library and never told anyone (not asking for public plaudits, but even a private communication would have been something to show our management).When you can&#39;t even say &#34;thank you, we&#39;re using your library now, it&#39;s great&#34; in a goddamn email, don&#39;t be surprised when 75% of the people maintaining and advancing it don&#39;t have jobs anymore. Never mind paying money or contributing - even acknowledgement.Open source is a recipe for burn-out. If something is important to people - especially corporate interests - there needs to be a way of getting paid. Much as I dislike those wacky &#34;free for non-commercial use, otherwise, give me a call&#34; licenses, I&#39;m starting to see the point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As somebody with experience in developing many OSS projects of different sizes (Redis, Hping, Jim Tcl, Visitors web analyzer, and many additional smaller ones), I think that the solution is simpler than it appears: just do what you want. When you are inside the flames of a successful open source project, you may think that the solution space is binary: don&#39;t do anything, or do everything people are demanding from you. Instead you can just keep doing what you want, cherry picking what issues you want to address, reply to, what features you want to add, and so forth. Just give you a fixed amount of time to spend on the project (in my case most of the time it was &#34;all the time I&#39;ve in a day, but up to 6/8 max&#34;, but it can be even just 10 minutes every day), and in this time do the things you like to do and ignore all the others. A few issues/PRs will be perfectly aligned to what you feel is right and you&#39;ll enjoy taking care of them. Others will not, and who cares?And anyway, doing things this way I was able to write a database that beaten, in the market, products developed with hundreds of developers while I was alone, so there must be some merit in what the original author feels is worth investing into. So, just do what you want, but:1. Don&#39;t fall in the trap of thinking that who asks you for things is doing some kind of mistake or abuse just because (for example) they are not paying you. Nope, they are fine asking for things, you are fine to ignore the requests.2. Don&#39;t fall in the trap that you are not accountable about the quality of the software just because it&#39;s free software: do only want you want, but ship finished work that is reasonably well written and well documented. To do what you want, at your own peace and according to your own personal expectation has NOTHING to do with the quality of your work. Software fails, but one thing is to ship terrible stuff just because &#34;Hey it&#39;s free&#34;, another thing is to do things the way you want, but with love.3. When people attack you, reply gently saying what you think. Don&#39;t get trapped into fights, don&#39;t feed the troll, remember that many criticizing you, if you are stealing money from the table providing something free, have specific agendas (but sometimes they are just assholes), and their goal is to mount a big case. Stop them replying carefully and without anger, then let the discussion end, or continue without you.4. Make good friends in the process. They&#39;ll help you immensely when there are hard times. Remember: the smartest people 99% of the times have a big hearth and are the most friendly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my last gig I got budget to bring in the maintainer of an open-source testing library we using for some really important stuff.We paid him $1500 for a couple of days consulting. He showed us how to fix a couple of tricky bugs and gave a talk to the eng team. At this point we&#39;ve more than recouped the investment.He was psyched to see his tool being used and I feel the visit contributed to him continuing to maintain the project.After those two days we also tried to hire him (he declined because he was making bank elsewhere). But those two days were also the best interview process ever because we did hours of pairing in non-interview mode.If you&#39;re a senior dev at a tech company with money you can easily make this kind of thing happen and it&#39;s such a win-win"</p>

At the end of the day farming is just a business same as any other, it&#39;s the same reason why a lot of trucking companies lease their trucks or warehouses lease their forklifts, it&#39;s generally cheaper and less of a headache overall.I&#39;ve tried to make pleas with some of my old friends who&#39;ve complained about the locked-down nature of their JD equipment, explaining that other companies like Kubota don&#39;t have that same limitation, but the branding is just too strong (&#34;the Kubota might be cheaper to buy, and cheaper to run, and I can easily maintain it myself, but, it&#39;s not a John Deere&#34; - actual quote from a SW Ontario farmer)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No-one wants to sell hardware any longer, it&#39;s not as profitable as providing it on a subscription (dare we say &#34;rent&#34;) and forcing all support, maintenance and additions to go through your channels as part of the subscription package.Unfortunately this trend is everywhere now. It happened to servers, media, has started to happen to cars... but it&#39;s happened already to agricultural hardware.Super profitable if you are the provider (especially with all the data one can yield from operating the hardware), super annoying and frustrating if you are the consumer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"diesel engine mechanic by trade here, and ive followed this topic with interest for about five years now.  Its similar to large over-the-road trucks in that its ultimately manufacturers catering to large fleets instead of owner/operators.most farms in America are corporate monoliths.  &#34;farmers&#34; here want mttf, mtbf, metrics, and a projection of how many cam chains, PTO knuckles, lockout converters, etc... they will need to buy in 30 years of depreciable service for a machine.  They want to be able to carve the machine they own down to the last cent...the only way to do that is to turn your IH or Komatsu into a rolling cloud.  even the windshield wipers get a sensor.smaller farms with actual farmers that wear hats and overalls already balk at a million dollar sticker shock from a harvester, and if you ever go to a farm and take a look around, most tractors there are nearly sixty years old.  the priority is farming, not investor return.  The tractor needs to perform its stated function first before anything else matters.  service interval warnings and degraded performance alerts here are a failure condition the farmer works around.  they arent incentivized to stop what theyre doing at 4:15 AM and call up the local JD dealer 143 miles away for an appointment.  there isnt a second tractor.If legislation isnt passed, ultimately youll end up with what commecial trucks got in response to sensor overkill:  Gliders.  gliders are 60 year old truck drivetrains and engines that get a new cab and body parts, and get recertified for the road.  they belch smog and roar like a freight train at idle, but all thats grandfathered into EPA legislation.  New manufacturers get to crank out fleet machines at high prices, and owner/operators get their old reliable filling the parking lot with NOx and waxy sulfur haze at 4 am.  they become a market that manufacturers refuse to tap, because it cannot be fully exploited to the disadvantage of the operator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. That is unexpected. I have to say that FaceTime in a browser sandbox is one of the few Apple products I would consider using. I wonder what made them take this path?I also wonder if someone could build a Matrix bridge if it is available via web, that would be fairly cool.Some questions:- Is it phone-number based IDs? Or can I pick a username or get a random ID?- Is spam going to be a problem? Previous Apple had the advantage that you had to buy a multi-hundred dollar advice to call someone. Will they need to implement new spam measures (or will you simply have to add a contact first)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of Apple&#39;s previous attempts at &#34;web apps&#34; have been pretty half-arsed. Including Apple Music currently. Let&#39;s see if this is any different.I&#39;m currently using Signal on Windows/Android/iOS and apart from two annoyances it is fine.- No gif support on Windows (Android/iOS only)- Cannot add a second phone but can add a tablet. As soon as it detects a SIM card slot (with or without SIM in it) it only allows you to set it up as the primary device, rather than a secondary like a tablet."</p>

I find it absurd to give away the keys to your bank, search history, personal notes, images, whatever - it&#39;s beyond private and personal besides being economically dangerous and very bad job security wise for most jobs.Not blaming regular people though, but it&#39;s weird that people are so lax about giving the keys to absolutely everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not really sure why this was originally flagged (or this is possibly a dupe of the original post which was flagged?), but even though the comments that I&#39;ve seen so far are giving it a negative spin I think there are quite a few important points in the article about the way in which our (I&#39;m generalizing about the broad HN demographic) quite privileged lifestyles do have a concomitant cost for somebody who needs to service our day-to-day needs and wants.This ranges from everything like online shopping (I bought a pair of trainers yesterday on a Sunday afternoon, and they were shipped from the warehouse 2 hours later), to the people who are used in low-wage countries to make those trainers at a price I feel is &#39;affordable&#39;.I&#39;m reminded of a newspaper interview with a bank director here in Sweden a few years ago. She spoke at length about how we should accept that our children won&#39;t have regular jobs - they would have a few &#39;gig&#39; employments: driving a cab a few days each week before stocking shelves in the evening and maybe working part-time at an old-people&#39;s home. The obvious implication to me was that it was other people&#39;s children she was talking about not her&#39;s. On the contrary, they would obviously be sitting in the back of the cab, on their way to their well-paid career in banking, just like their mother."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You have a 40+ hour workweek, until you put in enough intelligently focused 80 hour work weeks coupled with some dumb luck, to possibly arrive at anything resembling a 4 hour workweek.I&#39;m really tired of seeing online &#39;equality&#39; warriors think entrepreneurship is easy and should be used to pay for all of society&#39;s financial hardships; entrepreneurship is a significant toll that can cause financial ruin and mental instability just to have a chance at arriving at any sort of time liberation.When you create something you place your own time, finances, energy at risk - in many cases you get a low ROI in return. But like all educations, one can get better and improve over time.One must vision the system, design the system, find ways to finance the system, execute the system, manage the system, and optimize the processes. Then possibly, you might be able to receive benefits from that system - but it is in no way guaranteed.So don&#39;t pity the founder, but don&#39;t denigrate them either; actions taken on own volition mean founders must enjoy or live with the outcomes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author has crab in a bucket mindset. One person having enough success to have the lifestyle they want does not mean somebody they employ is being victimized by them. This might resonate with some, but for me it is a big turn-off. It smacks of jealousy and a rejection of all personal responsibility in charting a path to where you want to go in life.Tim&#39;s book isn&#39;t without flaws (and is now significantly dated in many of the details), but one of the core messages is to recognize we all have a choice to do something other than work 50 years at a job we hate and then retire/die. Tons of people go through life without considering any alternatives to the path they are on, or developing the self-knowledge about what they actually want, which is a big reason so many people end up so unhappy.He also emphasizes creating repeatable systems that you can then automate with software or hand off to other people. This helps you scale your business and income, but more importantly it preserves your time for other things you value more. The blog author thinks this is somehow a bad thing, but if nobody ever realized the efficiencies of exchanging money for services then most of us would be naked and starving; a huge chain of such exchanges is needed to produce the modern miracles of cheap clothing and food that are the foundation of modern living.Tim didn&#39;t actually retire to the beach for a hedonic 4-hour lifestyle with servants refilling the wine glass and fanning him with palm fronds; the guy works harder than most people with a new huge book every couple of years, lots of active investing, and running a major podcast almost every week. The difference between him and other people is that he&#39;s not wasting time on stuff that other people could do for him.I&#39;m not a &#34;bro&#34;, but I guess I&#39;ll stand here and defend Tim&#39;s book because it gave me a lot to think about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Founder here,ToolJet is a no-code platform for building &amp; deploying custom internal tools. ToolJet is built using Ruby on Rails and ReactJS. ToolJet can connect to existing data sources of companies such as databases, Google sheets, API endpoints, external services, and more. ToolJet&#39;s drag and drop app builder can quickly create UI widgets such as tables, charts, forms, etc and connect these widgets with the data from data sources.I have been dabbling with the idea of ToolJet for a while. but the real progress happened over the last 7 weeks while I was in quarantine.  One of my family members tested positive for covid and then came to the state-mandated lockdown. Not being able to step out of my home has been particularly hard, but nevertheless gave birth to ToolJet.I believe that the tools that require access to sensitive data should be self-hosted ( data never leaves the premises) and open-source ( modify the software to fit organization-specific requirements )."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like low-code apps like this have hit commodity level.A bit of history - in the late 90s, you could (and we did) build a multi-million dollar product doing basic content management for plain old web pages. That heydey lasted a couple years before Wordpress and other such tools came around and basic CMS was more of a solved problem than a unique product.The same has occurred over the years in multiple niches - a tool that would have been a terrific SaaS at one point gets built out, normalized, and well understood... to the point that it is no longer a unique value prop to just build a tool that solves problem X. You need to build the tool AND have some unique perspective and value prop that escalates it above all the others.Low-code CRUD builders with DB integration and some basic workflow, reporting, and security now have hit that mark. There have always been big players in this market (Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, etc.) It is good to see smaller players coming into their  own in recent years, and this specific one is open source, which is a nice differentiator between it and many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty cool project to build in 7 weeks! Congratulations! Your lockdown has been way more productive than for some of us.I&#39;m a founder of Appsmith, which Tooljet mentions in the GitHub project as an inspiration. https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmithWe are an Apache 2.0 licensed internal apps builder that&#39;s being used by teams in Adobe, IBM, MSFT, Rappi, Swiggy, and 1000&#39;s of other companies.Difference vs. other projects mentioned here:
1. Community edition is free for unlimited users
2. Great developer experience(local development, debugging, &amp; Git sync is coming soon)
3. Pricing model will be usage based and not user based"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are many parallels with seismic interpretation here.  Many companies/etc keep promising to &#34;revolutionize&#34; interpretation and remove the need for the &#34;tedious&#34; work of a geologist/geophysicist. This is very appealing to management for a wide variety of reasons, so it gets a lot of funding.What folks miss is that an interpreter _isn&#39;t_ just drawing lines / picking reflectors.  That&#39;s less than 1% of the time spent, if you&#39;re doing it right.Instead, the interpreter&#39;s role is to incorporate all of the information from _outside_ the image.  E.g. &#34;sure we see this here, but it can&#39;t be X because we see Y in this other area&#34;, or &#34;there must be a fault in this unimaged area because we see a fold 10 km away&#34;.By definition, you&#39;re in a data poor environment.  The features you&#39;re interested in are almost never what&#39;s clearly imaged -- instead, you&#39;re predicting what&#39;s in that unimaged, &#34;mushy&#34; area over there through fundamental laws of physics like conservation of mass and understanding of the larger regional context.  Those are deeply difficult to incorporate in machine learning in practice.Put a different way, the role is not to come up with a reasonable realization from an image or detect feature X in an image.  It&#39;s to outline the entire space of physically valid solutions and, most importantly, reject the non-physically valid solutions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Radiologists are not even trying. They treat their methods like FDA-approved medical devices. Even basic image segmentation to help with 3D structure recognition is off-limits. The benefits of neural networks in diagnostic radiology will not occur in one shot, and I don’t think it will happen at all in the United States until people start sending their data elsewhere. But good luck getting it. I just got my CT scan from a total mis-diagnosis that resulted in an unnecessary surgery. It came on a CD that won’t read in the only drive I have access to. And even that is just images. It’s not possible to get the actual data. This is not a failure of DNN. This is active AMA hostility toward technology, and not just in radiology. Just watch, people are going to start going elsewhere for medical care. They will do everything they can to get insurance requirements, subsidies, and laws against it, but they will lose. They are a dishonest Luddite cartel, and they’re hurting people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Radiologist here with an interest in this topic. I think the problem with most AI applications in radiology thus far is that they simply don&#39;t add enough value to the system to gain widespread use. If something truly revolutionary comes along, and it causes a clinical benefit, healthcare systems will shift to adapt this in a few years. AI just hasn&#39;t lived up to it&#39;s promise, and I agree it&#39;s because most of the people involved don&#39;t get that the job of a radiologist is way more complex than they think it is.Everytime I open a journal, I see more examples of either downright AI nonsense (&#39;We used AI to detect COVID by the sounds of a cough&#39;) or stuff that&#39;s just cooked up in a lab somewhere for a publication (&#39;Our algorithm can detect pathology X with an accuracy of 95%, here&#39;s our AUC&#39;).Hyperbolic headlines - Geoff Hinton saying in 2016 that it&#39;s time to stop training radiologists springs to mind - don&#39;t help the over promise of AI, and then they shoot themselves in the foot when they underdeliver.Earlier discussions about radiologists being self interested in sabotaging AI is tinfoil hat stuff - if I had an AI algorithm in the morning that could sort out the 20 lung nodules in a scan, or tell me which MS plaque is new in a field of 40, I&#39;d be able to report twice as many scans and make twice as much money.Companies come along every month promising their AI pixie dust is going to improve your life. It probably will, but 10 years from now, not today. The AI Rad companies are caught in an endless hype cycle of overpromising and under delivering."</p>

It would have been a wonderful end to the story if you got something back for all the years of hardwork you put into running it. You do have my appreciation if that means anything though.P.S. this story is very similar to rawgit which was a wonderful site but also fell prey to malware aholes."</p>

The site was getting slow, and I thought it is just a random site that the author didn&#39;t really care too much.I dropped my jaw when I read it was getting 30B req/day.Thank you for running this site for so long, and thank you for keeping it up for free, and deciding to not monetize it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of `echo $(dig @ns1.google.com o-o.myaddr.l.google.com TXT +short | tr -d \&#34;)`. I have no idea where this DNS query came from, because searching all of Google turns up nothing but https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-self-test-kit/b..., which is never referenced by anyone. I had to track it down myself for a bootstrap.sh, but I don&#39;t like using undocumented sources for critical infrastructure.My use case was needing to set the result of `hostname -f` in /etc/hosts in an automated fashion if a VPS provider didn&#39;t already add a line for the public Internet address in that file. You need to do this so that sendmail doesn&#39;t fail on `apt install` when it attempts to read your FQDN. So I couldn&#39;t use the NGINX example posted elsewhere here.It seems like https://checkip.amazonaws.com/ is much more &#34;reliable&#34; in that it is publicly documented at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/s....To anyone who needs to read this: please don&#39;t use &#34;services&#34; like icanhazip for your provisioning. Even my examples above are bad.It does strike me as weird that there is seemingly no POSIX-compliant way to get your public Internet address, from my readings.Edit: Oh goodness... even Amazon&#39;s documentation recommends using Google&#39;s undocumented DNS query.[1][1]: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/route..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; How to explain a technical concept behind closed doors to a senior person too embarrassed to openly admit that they don’t understand itThis list should also include: How to admit you don&#39;t know something as a senior engineer and learn from junior engineers who are closer to the new technologies.As a junior engineer I found that I respected senior engineers more when they asked me to teach them something they didn&#39;t know.As a senior engineer I feel like I get a lot more respect from the junior engineers when I just admit, &#34;I don&#39;t know that can you teach me more or point me at some good resources?&#34;.  For that matter, I get a lot more respect from other senior engineers when I give them exactly the same response."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fantastic list. I find #11 to be especially critical to one&#39;s career growth:&gt; How to give up your baby, that project that you built into something great, so you can do something elseThis is the only way to really scale oneself, while growing others in the process. Hanging on to a project indefinitely can rob you of an opportunity to tackle bigger, more challenging problems. It&#39;s so easy to get stuck on a comfortable track, feeling like (and probably being) an indispensable subject matter expert, while the bigger fish get away, often without being aware of them or having the necessary bandwidth to even consider their existence. This, in my mind, is one of the big differences between a senior and a staff engineer (where such distinctions exist).I highly recommend this article on &#34;giving away your Legos&#34;: https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other.... Have shared it with many senior engineers that were looking to grow to the next level.Oh, and +1 to the author&#39;s book &#34;The Manager&#39;s Path&#34;. Best one I&#39;ve seen for anyone looking to go down that road."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yea no, can we stop putting ALL of the weight on the technical people that already are MASSIVELY skilled on their field and are chronically overworked? The soft people skills responsibilities fall on the soft skills people i.e. management. That is THEIR job, not mine. They can&#39;t do shit else so they better do at least that.This is the fundamental problem with our profession, we are goal oriented and try to make things work at all cost, and we get taken advantage all the time even when we are holding all the cards (high demand for us, low supply).Stop making their work easy by making yours hard, you are not a fcking lap boy, you are an engineer, you solve the technical sht. Make the &#34;management and meetings&#34; people earn their over inflated checks or simply move to the next job for an even better pay, simple as that.All my PM, TL, RRHH, QA, and the rest of the spreed sheet crowd have always been the same: Lest waste an hour every day in a pointless meeting to show them who is boss and pretend that we do something useful, then lets spend the rest of the day in Facebook and social media while I pest the nerds on chat every few hours asking &#34;how is that going? do you have an estimate?&#34;. That is not working, that is been a parasite. Force them to earn their living."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the perspective of a diesel engine tech, this is a controversial opinion, but I&#39;m absolutely glad to see this breakthrough.Lithium is a conflict resource.  its scarce, its hard to mine, and as a result so far electric cars are a fanciful plaything for what i would consider &#34;the rich.&#34;  This paves the way for electric cars that a working class mom and dad can afford to get to and from work and the store.  and of course electric trucks that have obscene amounts of torque means never &#34;getting stuck&#34; behind a slow truck ever again. it also means cleaner cities and hopefully cheaper trucking for over the road drivers and owner/operators.Ive told my coworkers and apprentices this for as long as i can remember:  expect to service elecric long-haul trucks in your lifetime.  Learn the powertrain, the dynamics, the performance characteristics and keep pace with the technology as it evolves.  Make it part of your expectation in the future, because the economic model of diesel is a last-ditch effort at best in the 21st century."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Adding another solution to the issue of mining lithium for batteries at scale is awesome, I hope they find a way to deal with the brine that this produces (Edit: it does not really produce brine in the classical sense according to the paper [0]).Maybe this process could be a way to deal with brine from seawater desalination [1] by at least removing lithium ions from the waste water. Since the ion concentration in the waste water is higher than in seawater, it should theoretically make the lithium separation process easier, shouldn&#39;t it?Another thing: combining this with cheap solar power and seawater lithium mining might be a part of a possible solution for a post-oil industry in the Gulf States? They did the tests on Red Sea seawater which has a higher salinity than most other seawater but apparantly the eastern Mediterranean matches or even surpasses that [2].[0] &#34;It is also noted that the total concentration of other salts after the first stage is less than 500 ppm, which implies that after lithium harvest, the remaining water can be treated as freshwater. Hence, the process also has a potential to integrate with seawater desalination to further enhance its economic viability&#34;, from page 5, (PDF) https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2021/ee/d1ee00354...[1] I am not linking to a particular article but this is what I am talking about: https://www.google.de/search?q=toxic+brine+seawater+drinking...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity#/media/File:WOA09_sea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re still at the bench-top stage with this, from the pictures. This is something that ought to work, since lithium is commercially extracted from denser brines.[1] Extraction from seawater is quite possible but not yet cost-effective. So cost is the big question. This is the usual problem when articles announcing &#34;cheap and easy&#34; come from the surface-chemistry crowd.The authors write &#34;a preliminary economic analysis shows that the process can be made profitable when coupled with the chlor-alkali industry.&#34; So they apparently want to run this off of the reject stream from a plant that extracts chlorine and sodium hydroxide from brine. Running this downstream of a chlor-alkali plant means somebody else already has a brine source and a way to get rid of all the rejected brine. This sort of thing is common. A lot of rare mineral extraction is done as part of a process that extracts a less-rare mineral.Profitability is going to turn on all the usual problems with membrane systems - how long does the membrane last, how often does it have to be backwashed, what parts in the system corrode, and similar routine engineering problems. That&#39;s usually the hard part.[1] https://www.samcotech.com/is-it-possible-to-extract-lithium-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a little disappointed in the conclusion because there are more secure password managers out there that still offer the same level of convenience as the browser built-in password manager. Yes, if you use a password manager that&#39;s implemented entirely as a browser extension, you may as well use the browser&#39;s built-in password management features. However, if you&#39;re an advanced user and are comfortable using a separate password management application, there are options out there that don&#39;t force you to choose between a difficult-to-use app and the convenience of something in-browser.For example, exploiting a browser-based password manager likely means escaping the sandbox that contains web pages and accessing the shadow DOM. But this is still a larger surface area than 1Password, where the password selection menu (on Windows at least...) is actually rendered by an entirely separate process on the system. (I.e., clicking the icons that the extension displays triggers the 1Password desktop application to display UI at the cursor&#39;s current position. Picking a password from this UI will transmit it to the browser extension for filling. The password is only present in the browser&#39;s memory once you&#39;ve interacted with the desktop application&#39;s UI.)As always, do your research. Don&#39;t get suckered into paying a subscription fee for a browser extension that offers the same functionality your browser has built-in. But realize that there are other options out there that may actually be worth investing in.Disclaimer: I&#39;ve been a happy 1Password customer for a few years now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This somewhat overlooks the main threat model that password managers solve - leaked credentials.People can’t remember 80 passwords so they reuse the same one, that password eventually gets leaked and 9/10 times it doesn’t get leaked due to a targeted attack or a compromised machine but rather due to a breach of a service you signed up too.Sure password managers have issues, they don’t solve user related errors and can even add to the attack surface of a machine they are running on but that’s really not important...Using password managers and generating different passwords for each service reduces the blast radius from any breach.This is why I don’t care if the password manager has the best encryption, or does it even encrypts at all or does it uses the clipboard vs some more secure side channel. Yeah that’s nice but that’s not in my threat model.Which is why I don’t care if your password manager is a spreadsheet, it’s a terrible choice for a business because their threat landscape and the fact that a spreadsheet won’t allow you to audit who has access to what but for you or your mom even that is better than using the same password everywhere else.Heck at home print your passwords and store them somewhere safe... put them on a post note for all I care as long as you live alone or at least not with anyone you wouldn’t want stumbling on that list..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As it looks like Tavis isn&#39;t hanging out and responding to comments here, I thought it&#39;d be worth linking to a question and response he gave on Twitter as most comments revolve around this point.&gt; @diractelda: Based on your thoughts, it seems a more accurate statement is &#34;Don&#39;t use a password manager that interacts with your browser automatically unless it&#39;s the built in password system. Non-integrated password stores are fine.&#34;&gt; @tavis: Yep, that&#39;s a fair summary, I was just trying to be punchyhttps://twitter.com/taviso/status/1401253440622235649?s=20"</p>

Luckily, I had written the course notes (basically a textbook) in latex.I consulted with the student and saw how the reader worked. All was fine, but it was slow because it said e.g. &#34;backslash begin open brace equation close brace&#34;, so I made a perlscript to remove backslash and braces (and a few other things) and then it all worked really well.People, especially those who don&#39;t use mathematics much, think latex is hard for humans.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is a general critique of the reward system in academia, bolted on the lab leak hypothesis for clickbait. &#34;The Science Game&#34; is a thing and often discussed on HN, but I don&#39;t see any causative link here.&gt; All to say: scientists create dangerous synthetic viruses to achieve “high-impact” scientific output.Does gain of function research yield more high impact papers than  more benign types of virology research? The article seems to suggest so, but provides no citations indicating that. Were the scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology publishing their research to general acclaim up until now? Given how little we know about it, doesn&#39;t seem so. Are these scientists driven by the same invectives as western university research academics? They&#39;re probably state employees on stable contracts for a start, not the PhD students and itinerant PostDocs of the university system, who are the main players of the Science Game.I don&#39;t know the answers to these questions, but the article would be more persuasive if it did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work in one of the top fMRI labs. The comments about The Science Game are spot on. The vast majority of scientists, by the time they&#39;re midway through their postdocs, just want to do whatever research will get them a professorship and some grants. Actual knowledge generation is a distant second to keeping the ball bouncing by getting out papers and getting in grants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; .. may one day pose similar risks due to the run-away prestige games scientists play.It is happening in front of our eyes. From where should we start.(1) Responsible AI, but the outcomes didn&#39;t challenge AI research enough to stop some of the practices. I would avoid commenting on what happened at Google AI recently, but I would say that most of the AI-based solutions that are deployed at large scale can be challenged.(2) paperswithcode.com solved this issue. Back in the day, we would re-implement models that we see in the paper. When we email authors, we will always figure that an RA implemented the solution and s/he left.(4) Rich is becoming richer. There is a phenomena in academia to blindly trust those who are in good labs. I have seen many papers that are great coming from these labs, but there are bad papers as well. we shouldn&#39;t just blindly trust ppl.(5) Review process is broken. Review is a voluntarily work for professors, and imho it shouldn&#39;t. In industrial R&amp;D, reviews are one of the most important things as part of the work. Some of our PRs takes days.(6) All recommendation engines are black-boxes. I don&#39;t know what YT or FB recommend to a kid and whether this is aligned with some of our values. If s/he accidentally watch something bad, we noticed that their timeline is full by the same ideas. In our spare time, we tried to check if we can influence this behavior as a user. I figured that all of our recommendations engines are black-boxes. I don&#39;t know why we don&#39;t challenges. I hacked an App to fetch data, new, feed and run it through recommendation engine and started customizing what I can read.(7) It&#39;s 2021, most of good papers are coming from industrial labs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The first proposal of having a minimum corporate tax rate probably doesn&#39;t mean a lot because you to then start policing what subsidies governments give to effectively discount below 15%.The more interesting part is what I hope is the start of serious efforts to tackle profit-shifting, which is a name invented for &#34;transfer pricing&#34; because that is technically illegal. But it&#39;s the same thing.A good starting point is that if you book x% of your revenue in country A then country A should get to tax x% of your profit.Here&#39;s another part of this they should adopt: borrowing money should count as repatriating profits. In the era of zero interest rates debt is used to effectively defer taxes forever. There&#39;s no legitimate reason to allow entities to borrow money at near-zero interest rates instead of repatriating retained earnings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; The G7 group of advanced economies has reached a &#34;historic&#34; deal to make multinational companies pay more taxNo, it hasn&#39;t. Some finance ministers met and talked:&#34;Finance ministers meeting in London agreed to battle tax avoidance by making companies pay more in the countries where they do business. They also agreed in principle to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to avoid countries undercutting each other.&#34;I have no idea how it works in other countries, but in the US, finance ministers don&#39;t have the power to agree to treaties. Treaties in the US require a super-majority (two thirds) vote in the Senate. Unless Mitch McConnell has signed off on this, the G7 group of advanced economies did not reach a deal on anything. I don&#39;t even see the word &#34;Senate&#34; in the entire article.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen can tell reporters whatever she wants. Without buy-in from Republicans in the Senate, finance ministers agreeing &#34;in principle&#34; amounts to finance ministers agreeing that if they had ham, they could make ham and eggs, if they had eggs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do wonder if we wouldn&#39;t be better off eliminating corporation tax entirely.The revenue of a corporation can, roughly, be:1. Spent on goods or services from another company (including freelancers, contractors, etc.)2. Spent on rent3. Spent on capital purchases4. Spent on wages5. Spent on debt repayment or other forms of financing6. Paid out in dividends7. Spent on share buybacks8. Invested in something elseItems 1-5 are all good things that we want companies to do, and corporation tax is normally applied after this spending is accounted for. Items 6 and 7 ought to be taxed, and frequently are (dividends and buybacks create income for individuals who will pay tax on that income). Item 8 is a bit vaguer, but probably shouldn&#39;t be taxed in most cases (if we&#39;re worried about companies parking cash in very low-risk assets, then super-low yields are effectively a tax on that anyway).All that the corporation tax adds to this picture is the creation of work in tax avoidance services, and an unjust inequality between those firms that can afford those services and are structured to take advantage of the rules, and those that can not and are not.It&#39;s not obvious to me that corporation tax /can/ be fixed, and so it may be better simply to scrap it and replace it with something more difficult to dodge.EDIT: formatting"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s JPEG 2000, which is nothing like classic JPEG. It doesn&#39;t have the artifacts classic JPEG introduces at sharp edges, so you can read text. It has more color depth if you want it. It also doesn&#39;t mess up non-color data such as normal maps the way classic JPEG does.JPEG 2000 is not used much. Decoding is slow, and encoding is slower. The decoders are either buggy or proprietary. It has way too many options internally. 
The big users of JPEG 2000 are medical. It has a &#34;lossless&#34; mode, and medical imagery is usually stored lossless because you really don&#39;t want compression artifacts in X-rays.(I&#39;ve been struggling with JPEG 2000 recently. Second Life and Open Simulator use it for asset storage. Some images won&#39;t decompress properly with OpenJPEG, a free decoder. I finally found out why. There&#39;s a field used for &#34;personal health information&#34; in JPEG 2000. This is where the patient name and such go in a CAT scan. That feature was added after the original version.  Some older images apparently have junk in that field, which causes problems.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The XVideo extension, commonly used by MPlayer (at least in the past, maybe still?), has supported sending YUV images to your video card for 20½ years, since XFree86 4.0.2: https://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~on/mplayer/en/xv.htmlThere are various problems in XVideo that make it hard to use for general application display, but the fact that this was a thing they included in it makes me think that a substantial number of video cards have included YUV decoding capability in hardware since the previous millennium."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the challenges with Y&#39;CbCr (what Carmack is calling &#34;YUV&#34;) is that there are so many flavors.He mentions 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. But he doesn&#39;t mention chroma siting. Or alternative sumbsampling schemes. Or matrix coefficients. Or full-range vs video-range (a.k.a. JPEG vs MPEG range). Heck, how you even arrange subsampled data varies by system (many libraries like planar; Apple likes bi-planar; etc.).I&#39;d love to see more support for rendering subsampled Y&#39;CbCr formats so you don&#39;t have to use so much RAM, but it gets complicated quick."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The timeline of browser extensibility is quite fascinating. There&#39;s really not a single place that covers all of it, so I decided to research my own timeline/history:  - Consumer web browsers (1993-)
  - Plug-ins (1995-2015ish)
  - User Style Sheets (1998-2019)
  - Bookmarklets (1998–)
  - Browser Extensions (1999–)
  - Mozilla XUL (1997–2017)
  - Alternative Browser Distributions (2004–)
  - Userscripts (2005–)
  - Converging on the WebExtensions API (2017–)
  - Manifest V3 (2021–)
  - No/Low-Code Browser Extension Builders (2021–)

Here&#39;s a link to the blog post with my research: https://medium.com/brick-by-brick/a-brief-history-of-browser...Also, if you care about browser extensibility, join the w3 group (it&#39;s free) and watch the GitHub repo!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is their charter: https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/blob/main/charter.mdAnd the twitter announcement from the co-chair: https://twitter.com/xeenon/status/1400862543673921536I&#39;m cautiously optimistic that this will work well, but somewhat concerned that this will cause Manifest V3&#39;s de facto limits on ad blocking and the like to become endemic. It will be interesting to see how they balance &#34;compatibility with popular existing extensions&#34; against their foundational focus on security and privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The headline is what it is on the site but it should probably be clarified that it is extensions, not plug-ins. The author didn’t correctly distinguish but as other comments point out, it is more than a semantical difference.This is a good move and something we’ve been moving towards for years, but it is still nice to see. Extensions are often one of the biggest barriers to browser lock-in on the desktop and making it easier for devs to build extensions that can reliably work across browsers, the better it will be for users.Obviously, the individual browsers will stink have their own specific ways of doing things, but this is a positive development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Cumulative layout shift is supposed to measure whether your site shifts around while it&#39;s loading, but it&#39;s so strict that even Google Translate fails the test.And so it should be. There&#39;s hardly anything worse than having things shift around after you start reading, scrolling or clicking on something.I think it&#39;s a very good sign if Google&#39;s own sites fail these tests. It means the tests are meaningful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It&#39;s causing a fair amount of panic, because 96% of sites fail the test.Good. That sounds like a realistic estimation of the number of slow and bloated websites. What good are nice animations and designs when they destroy the UX?You&#39;ll never see someone gaming in 4k with hardware that can&#39;t render it with more than 15FPS. Yet we see that kind of &#34;tradeoff&#34; every time we browse the web. Users get loading times for the site itself, then processing of JS to redundantly do the browser&#39;s job of arranging the 20 layers of &lt;div&gt;s, then loading animations for the actual contents, and then a couple seconds after that you might get the first thumbnails.And I&#39;m absolutely not surprised Google&#39;s pages fail this test as well; Everything from Google Images to YouTube got increasingly worse with every new design iteration, with both slower loading times as well as an increase in breakage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Im actually surprised how good YT comes out in this. The page is a dumpster fire:Before Polymer (current YT framework) YT video page weighted somewhere around 50KB (10KB compressed) and was ordinary HTML + 1MB js player (400KB compressed). As soon as HTML part loaded the page was all there.Now its 600KB (100KB compressed) JSON + additional 8MB desktop_polymer.js (1MB compressed) that needs to be compiled/interpreted before it even starts building the page client side and anything starts showing up. 1MB js player is on top of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep.  It is not surprising at all that the term “insulting” appears three times because that’s how it feels for so many reasons.Remember:- They pretend with a straight face like it was somehow impossible to sell software or reach customers before their magical store made it happen.- They pretend like the current “search” feature of the App Store is not a sad reduction of what it used to be (or what it could be if a trillion dollar company put any effort into it at all).- They pretend to have all these problems hosting apps that are somehow solved by fees, while completely ignoring all the free apps that clearly tax that same infrastructure.- They conveniently ignore the absurd amount of money they must be making from scams that are constantly top-grossing to add insult to injury.I could go on but there are entire blogs written about this by now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the core sentiment here is being lost.This isn’t so much a call to action against Apple’s fees.It’s pointing out something that I’ve felt building over the last couple of years out of Apple, which is an attitude of hubris, contempt, and a “taking for granted” of Apple’s developers.The WWDC spiel of how much they value us has become trite and transparent.They do produce some really nice tools and APIs. I can’t knock what they provide developers.But often times the attitude beneath the veneer is a precursor of things to come, and it’s becoming noticeable that Apple’s culture seems to care less about its developers now than before.You might say “sure, but so what? Developers are part of the means to an end of selling stuff”, and you’re not wrong.But one of the things I loved about Apple circa 2009 was their respect for their user. It was palpable and magical, even.Then, learning Cocoa and Interface Builder coming from Eclipse and Java, that same respect seemed to permeate their dev environment as well.That seems lost. Following some of their tech leads on Twitter exposes some rather vitriolic feelings towards people in general.Customers, be they users or devs, deserve respect. Apple used to be great at giving that respect. I fear it’s slipping away culturally, and is worth calling out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At D5 [1], What did Steve &amp; Bill Gate admire in the other?Bill: Steve’s taste,Steve: Microsoft’s ability to partner.Apple is basically repeating a lot of their early mistakes. Some of those lessons Steve took it to heart when he returns to Apple from NeXT.&gt;This isn’t about the 30%, or the 15%,.......It’s about what Apple’s leadership thinks of us and our work.There is also another point Marco didn&#39;t mention. It is not your customers either. Apple has been very clear in all of their communications. The user of iPhone, are Apple&#39;s customers. Even the third party Apps, they are accessing Apple&#39;s customers. And hence the relationship is very much not a partnership. Since Apple claims  ownership on both the Apps and the customers. In the name of privacy and user experience.&gt;but Apple uses their position of power to double-dip.Finally! Someone in the Apple community use the term double-dip! A term Apple has used against Qualcomm and sent a whole PR team to damage their reputation.&gt;But the leaders have already shown us who they really are, what they really think of us, and how little they value our work.Unfortunately Tim Cook isn&#39;t the type of person who understand this. You should probably listen to his testimony to make your own judgement. But after the Epic Vs Apple trial it became very clear why Steve said Tim Cook isn&#39;t a product person. There are quite possibly zero product sensibility within Tim Cook. And I am not sure who is in-charge of the PR now either. Their message are delusional, hypocritical and reminds me a lot of Google in the 00s.   I missed Katie Cotton&#39;s era.[1] (76:30 ) https://on.wsj.com/2zWWqPU"</p>

It looks like some lobbyists got hired by a wallet company stacked with angel investors willing to pour money into the idea of being integrated into the government at such a low level. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they also announced that all transactions will be forced to go through a wrapper or other type of layer, maybe even justified with the classic &#34;think of the coal&#34; argument..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who readily admits to not fully knowing what legal tender entails, I have a question for the optimists:As I understand it, legal tender status forces creditors to accept bitcoin as debt repayment. Given the volatility of bitcoin, wouldn&#39;t this impact risk assessment of loans? Being obligated to accept a high volatility asset as a repayment sounds like a nightmare for creditors. Wouldn&#39;t interest rates rise in order to cover this added uncertainty?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even though the market hasn&#39;t really reacted to this news (which I suspect is due to the fact that it&#39;s proposed/didn&#39;t happen yet), this is one of the most bullish news in a very long time in my opinion (even more bullish than companies buying into it). I suspect this will start the domino effect of countries slowly, but surely adopting BTC.It&#39;ll probably be the smaller countries first where they don&#39;t have great currencies to begin with, so they&#39;ll always have to use a foreign one, either USD or an alternative. With USD, they are at the mercy of USG and will get pushed around by them. With Bitcoin, the network itself is kept safe with all the energy and mathematical properties, but the price is very volatile at the moment, though volatility will decrease with increasing market caps.This will be a very interesting experiment to watch."</p>

I (and it seems, many others) look forward to hearing more about the &#39;dupe&#39; article others have linked to below.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m not surprised but a little disappointed that most of the older techniques aren’t mentioned:- checkbox/radio inputs can be used to toggle state with `:checked ~ .foo` selectors- `:focus` (and now `:focus-within`, and `:active` though it’s less useful) can be used similarly, but also allow child selection [Edit to add: `tabindex=&#34;-1&#34;` makes anything focusable with a pointer input, but doesn’t capture keyboard tab or  iteration with assistive tools]- `:target` can be used similarly, paired with fragment links [Edit to add: but beware history entries, this can be a poor UX]- `&lt;label&gt;` can be used to not only set those states but also trigger scrolls (including within `scroll-snap` parents) without creating navigation history entries- the `attr()` function can be used to reference server-dynamic HTML data for display with `content` in pseudo-elements- I have to assume CSS animations are adopted widely enough that people aren’t using JS for that where it isn’t needed; but you can also use declarative, even interactive, animations in SVG- speaking of which, inline SVG (even `&lt;use&gt;` references) are part of the CSS cascade, and you can change any CSS-addressable property with `currentColor`- and you can nest HTML in SVG with `&lt;foreignObject&gt;` if you want to use SVG techniques in HTML- probably not worth mentioning but in case you don’t know... if you miss table layouts, you can use them with `display` on basically anything; if you want table semantics without tabular rendering you can override `display` as wellAlllllll of that being said, if you use these techniques check your stuff with assistive technologies!"</p>

The rest was about software and programming (nice!)- third year: software and programming only (very nice!)So, about 80% of the students didn&#39;t pass the first year because of its heavy mathematics + physics content.Extra:- mathematics I = logic, Boolen algebra- mathematics II = calculus- matehmatics III = Multivariable calculus and something else I don&#39;t remember- mathematics IV = Complex analysis/complex variable calculus- physics I and II = electromagnetism and friends"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Detecting an error when creating a record is much better than when using it later on, as during creation you have the context needed to debug the problem.This is a great insight no matter what language or framework you&#39;re operating in. Laziness has its virtues, but invariants, validity checks, run-time type checks, etc. should all be performed as early (and often) as possible - it&#39;s much easier to debug issues when the are proximate to an object or structure being created or modified, then when that data type is being used much later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One of the coolest parts of our codebase is the new general purpose language at its foundation. Though the semantics of the language are substantially different than Clojure, it’s defined entirely within Clojure using macros to express the differing behavior. It compiles directly to bytecode using the ASM library. The rest of our system is built using both this language and vanilla Clojure, interoperating seamlessly.Actually this sounds quite horrible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what I imagine experienced clojure developers can squeeze out of a language like clojure. I would venture that they can train a junior programmer in a couple of weeks, and make them productive very fast.I guess they could make it work in any language but judging by the description clojure is indeed a great fit, due to the macro capabilities, flexibility and solid runtime via JVM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the most shocking article I have ever read in my life. I&#39;d ask everyone to please read it because it is incredible.One thing I did not realize is that US researchers who conducted gain of function research tried to downplay and discredit the possibility of the virus originating from the wuhan lab. There was an anti-lab theory Lancet statement signed by scientists, and &#34;Daszak had not only signed but organized the influential Lancet statement, with the intention of concealing his role and creating the impression of scientific unanimity.&#34;Plus there&#39;s all the stuff about the miners shoveling bat poop for weeks and then dying of coronaviruses, and the Wuhan institute collecting and doing gain of function research on these similar-to-SARS samples. And then several of the lab&#39;s gain of function researchers became ill in late 2019. And there&#39;s the weird renaming of samples to hide the unmatched closeness of the mine samples and covid. This is just the absolute surface of the article. There&#39;s too much to list hereEdit: here&#39;s another amazement for the list: &#34;Shi Zhengli herself had publicly acknowledged that, until the pandemic, all of her team’s coronavirus research — some involving live SARS-like viruses — had been conducted in less secure BSL-3 and even BSL-2 laboratories.&#34; And the article says &#34;BSL-2 [is] roughly as secure as an American dentist’s office.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this article is quite illuminating on the political side of the lab leak theory, on the evidence side it&#39;s mostly a rehash of some long-standing speculations.The only recent evidence it contains is the fact that 3 researchers from WIV sought hospital care back in autumn of 2019 with symptoms similar to COVID. However, this piece of evidence is hardly consequential without further details:- First, most common symptoms of COVID are indistinguishable from common cold. If the researchers were known to have any &#34;signature&#34; symptoms like loss of smell the article would certainly mention it.- Second and more importantly, China doesn&#39;t have a robust GP/family doctor system found in western countries. As a result, many people would go to hospitals directly whenever they&#39;re mildly sick.Taking the evidence as we know it now, the straightforward explanation is that 3 researchers caught cold, got mildly sick, so went to the hospital to get prescriptions or doctor&#39;s notes for sick leave (in China it&#39;s common for employers to require a doctor&#39;s note even for a short sick leave).That said, I believe the lab leak theory is still plausible, and shouldn&#39;t be ruled out unless a clear transmission path from bat to human has been identified (which was done for the 2002 SARS outbreak). But I also think that we may never know. I trust that some theories put forward were in good faith, but so far they are little more than speculations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Assuming the chance of a lab leak is non-zero, it is worth considering how this will ever end.- If there was any hard evidence actually proving they had SARS-CoV-2 in the lab before the pandemic, it will be long gone. Only an independent full access forensic level investigation would ever find any sign that evidence was destroyed, and that is never going to happen.- It seems extremely unlikely to me that anyone from within China will A) blow the whistle or B) that we would hear about it.- If a whistleblower were to escape the country, China would be able to claim they are lying, and it is a plot by the West to oppress the Chinese people etc. The chance that the whistleblower would be carrying irrefutable evidence of a lab leak is again almost zero.We can keep shaking the tree, but I don&#39;t think anything truly satisfying is going to fall out. Consider that even if the USA for example had actual evidence of a lab leak, they would be better off using this as leverage over China secretly than releasing it publicly.What actually can and should happen, is that some major change comes to virology research to absolutely minimise the chance of another lab origin pandemic. Wherever SARS-CoV-2 came from, we have had lab leaks before and we will have them again, that much is certain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I was interested in how well Boom was doing in keeping to its timeline, and found an article from two years ago:https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/supersonic-passenger...Some side-by-side comparisons:2019 article:  &#34;Boom envisions its Overture airliner traveling at Mach 2.2.&#34;  2021 article:  &#34;a plane that could fly at Mach 1.7&#34;2019 article:  &#34;Its planes could be ready for commercial service in the mid-2020s&#34;.  2021 article:  &#34;It is targeting the start of passenger service in 2029.&#34;The 2019 article also says that Boom is constructing a 1/3rd scale version of Overture that could be making test flights later in 2019.  This article from October 2020 says that the 1/3rd scale vehicle was &#34;rolled out&#34; in 2020 and could be ready for test flights in Q3 2021. https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2020/10/26/boom-supe..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see so much innovation in aerospace. Boom has said they&#39;re going to reduce noise, but they&#39;ve also said they&#39;ll only fly supersonic over water with buffers between supersonic zones and populated areas. So the &#39;boom&#39;, as it were, is still a concern.I&#39;m super interested to see how quiet their planes are at subsonic. If you ever saw the Concorde flying subsonic, it was unbelievably loud. Nothing to do with being supersonic - their engines were just obnoxiously loud. Came into Cape Town a long time ago and made the whole town rumble on final.In this blog post: https://blog.boomsupersonic.com/booms-principles-of-sustaina.....Boom says: &#34;Today’s subsonic commercial aircraft are 80% more fuel efficient than those of the 1960s, and noise footprints have shrunk up to 90% in the last 50 years. This technological progress has fueled Boom’s efforts to design a supersonic airliner that makes economic sense for airlines and their customers. &#34;However, the innovation that enabled this is high bypass turbofan engines. Turns out if you move more air slower, it&#39;s way quieter and more fuel efficient because physics. Boom can&#39;t take advantage of this - at least directly, because they have to go supersonic. A high bypass turbofan engine is huge, by it&#39;s very nature. At supersonic speeds this presents a lot of drag. That&#39;s why I&#39;m super curious how they plan to be quiet and fuel efficient while also being supersonic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Problems with supersonic (?):- Noise means you can&#39;t do US domestic- Concorde didn&#39;t have the range for Pacific- Costs didn&#39;t work for Atlantic routes- And airlines want lots of identical planes, not one special one for one routeWhich ones has Boom solved?https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1400425028022308874"</p>

Dismissing this because companies should do better security is like dismissing doctors because people should get more exercise. That&#39;s silly. We need preventative care and treatment and everything in between.I&#39;m not surprised by this announcement because the way that the pipeline-company ransomware hackers beat a hasty retreat was noticeably unusual, and already seemed to telegraph that the state was getting involved more...actively. Good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What about the other side of this? Instead of seeking backdoors and using them to spy on Americans, the NSA should be stepping up their game and securing vital infrastructure and domestic businesses against these attacks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is needed because the security industry seems to be well on the way to adopting paying off these people as a routine cost of business. That is going to lead to an absolute disaster if it is allowed to continue and grow.It needs to be a double edged sword though where companies are just as afraid of facilitating ransomware attacks as they would be of the consequences of facilitating terrorists. In other words, this will only work if it means company&#39;s are taking the threat more seriously, not less."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of when Apple started providing &#34;smaller size updates&#34; to OS X.  I was curious about the details since my doctorate had touched on the topic, so I worked my contacts (I had a few in Apple engineering from the FreeBSD / OS X relationship) and after a few months I got back as answer: &#34;We&#39;re using a tool called bsdiff, are you familiar with it?&#34;  I was indeed, since I was the author of said tool.(Just to be clear, there was no license violation involved in this case; just a lack of awareness of the provenance of the open source software they were using.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago, I interviewed a candidate for a role on my team.  As usual, one of the ways I break the ice with candidates is to get them to talk &#34;war stories&#34;.The team he&#39;d worked on had produced a tool that was only ever intended to be used by the team to solve a particular problem they had.  It contained proprietary code.Unknown to the team, word had spread about the tool, and others had started to use it, including solutions architects.  Who started shipping it to customers to use, who absolutely loved it.That&#39;d be fine except one of the core libraries it used was GPLv3 licensed, and there was non-open source proprietary code used in the tool.The nightmare scenario he found himself in was having to rapidly re-architect the tool around a non-GPLv3 licensed library, without breaking any functionality, all the while having to have regular sync up meetings with a furious CEO and Legal department (who, to be clear, were mad about the situation, not this particular developer or his team, who weren&#39;t to blame)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My stories are very minor. I did my PhD in a reasonably well regarded mechanical engineering lab. My area is experimental fluid mechanics. I ended up writing a lot of Matlab code while there and even worked with a spin out company from the lab in the biotech sector for a while.I&#39;d get a lot of other students coming to me for coding help. Most just wanted me to do their job for them and I was too naive to say no. One wanted to count cells in a microfluidic device using image processing. I sat down with them for a couple of hours and walked them through a few methods they could look into to get started collecting all the examples in a script. Basic stuff so they wouldn&#39;t feel overwhelmed. A few months later I see he published my simple introduction as a paper with zero modifications. He had the good grace to at least thank me in the acknowledgments.Several years later while working a $BIG_TECH lab we interviewed a candidate from my old lab. They presented their work and had performed some data analysis of thermal camera images. Turns out they were using a script I&#39;d written there and it was still actively used to work with the thermal camera. Nobody ever modified or improved the code — many engineering students are terrified of code. I was annoyed because there was no interest in further development the code, I don&#39;t think they even read it or understood it.While at the spinout company I developed a software tool for the PCR optofluidics platform that was being developed. It was considerably faster and more robust than the hacked together script they were using before and had a user friendly UI that I build with feedback from the biologists on the team. A few years later the founder and one of their new students published a paper documenting their amazing tool without any reference or acknowledgment whatsoever. That one pissed me off.There is a lot of ignorance around code authorship and respect for the developer in physical sciences research. Like I said, many are terrified by code but don&#39;t value the time and expertise it requires; once they have it they no longer think about its maintenance or acknowledging the author."</p>

I would explore random interesting subjects and dive deep.  I would constantly publish code and demos, etc.  As my career grew, one of one these started to fall off.  I look at my peers and it&#39;s the same story: they were all vibrant hot-shots in their early-mid 20s, and now are just weighed down by the teams and projects they manage.Peter is an inspiration.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got reasonably far in stats -- up to a single grad level course.My biggest problem with the teaching of math (and I can weigh in on this a bit because I spent over a decade as a private tutor of math) is that math is often not introduced in a concrete manner, as well as in a way such that its utility is obvious.  These are two sides of the same coin.You can see this problem in most Wikipedia math pages.  I took more math than most physics majors and I find quite a lot of what I stumble across either baffling or of unknown utility.  Set theory is a great instance of this.  I rarely see multiple examples listed as it is explained, nor does anyone bother to tell me what it is for, other than to do more set theory.Stats at least has the benefit of having to stick closer to applicability, I think."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not quite as simple as &#34;it works like &#39;Lord of the Flies&#39; or it doesn&#39;t&#34;.  Nicholas Christakis, in his book &#34;Blueprint&#34;, devotes a chapter to a database that he and his grad students made of shipwrecks, where the survivors lived long enough, in enough isolation, that they had to more or less put together a temporary society.  There were lots of cases where they turned on each other, and lots of cases where they did not.My review of Christakis&#39; book, in case you&#39;re curious: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2851365787"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It shouldn&#39;t be glossed over that these were six boys from a boarding school on a getaway. So, unless there were only six pupils in the boarding school, it would mean that this was a group of boys who like and trust each other enough to let in on a plan which could get them into serious trouble if the wrong person found out about it. Also, the school being a boarding school implies that the group had a preexisting social structure, and that they had been literally living together before the event.So, it&#39;s sort of a best case scenario of &#39;a group of boys forming a society on a deserted island&#39;.EDIT: Another commenter posted an audio interview with one of the survivors, highly recommended:
https://www.rnz.co.nz/audio/player?audio_id=2018746636"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a wonderful story and and an uplifting rebuttal to Lord of the Flies.But to be fair, six Tongan boys were probably far hardier and well equipped than the typical British schoolboy of that time would have been. It seems they thought nothing of stealing a fishing boat and heading to sea, and they most likely had abundant life skills already - they basically relocated from life on one pacific island to another.So a great story but I don&#39;t know how much can be extrapolated from it about human behaviour in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m surprised at the negativity here. I agree with this decision.When I saw it was a 6-3 decision my first instinct was &#34;oh another conservative-liberal divide&#34; but no it isn&#39;t. I&#39;m actually surprised to find Thomas dissenting since he&#39;s just. a stickler for the literal text.To me the ruling seems correct: the offender may have exceeded department rules and such access by that measure was &#34;unauthorized&#34; but he was not an unauthorized user to the system.It&#39;s refreshing to see limits to the overreach on what constitutes &#34;hacking&#34;. This isn&#39;t hacking.Were this ruling in effect when Aaron Swartz was charged, I very much suspect it would&#39;ve invalidated the hacking charges under the CFAA (since he used a guest account he had access to)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am loath to defend agents of the government, law officers or otherwise; but I have to agree with the decision here.Van Buren violated department policy, and perhaps other laws in his conduct. But he did not gain unauthorized access to a system. He already had authorized access - he just used it improperly.Similarly, if I were granted access to my company&#39;s production database to perform some kind of operation that required me to read/write data, and I used that privilege to access financial records of customers, I would certainly be violating my company&#39;s policy and likely some privacy and financial laws. But it would not be gaining unauthorized access, as I was explicitly granted access to that system - just for a different purpose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess this is the part that matters most?&#34;We must decide whether Van Buren also violated
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), which
makes it illegal “to access a computer with authorization
and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the
computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or
alter.”
He did not. This provision covers those who obtain information from particular areas in the computer—such as
files, folders, or databases—to which their computer access
does not extend. It does not cover those who, like Van Buren, have improper motives for obtaining information that
is otherwise available to them&#34;Thomas, Alito and Roberts dissented, and I hate to say it, but I agree with them.&#34;The question here is straightforward: Would an ordinary
reader of the English language understand Van Buren to
have “exceed[ed] authorized access” to the database when
he used it under circumstances that were expressly forbidden? In my view, the answer is yes. The necessary precondition that permitted him to obtain that data was absent.&#34;That&#39;s Thomas dissenting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Live by the sword, die by the sword. That said, firing him, like they did with Damore would have been more consistent. Because everyone is under arbitration agreements that always benefit the company, vs the courts where you might have a shot at justice, they have no incentive to do that.As repugnant as his past anti-semitic rant was, people change and sometimes say and do stupid things. In a sane world this guy would not have been removed from his position and Damore would not have been fired. Instead we could have had a conversation to win hearts and minds, but today it is all about getting scalps, witch hunts and over-reaction. What we are currently doing sends people underground which radicalizes them more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A major reason why today&#39;s politicians are so bland and uninspiring is because they have been groomed to never say anything controversial or contentious. Trawling through adults adolescence photos and shaming/blaming them for some youthful indiscretion is another aspect of this societal disaster.The anti war candidate Tulsi Gabbard in the recent US election is an example of someone relentlessly ridiculed and destroyed despite the absence of anything controversial in her background and is a dismal example of the way politics works today.Now we have the pretentious corporate diversity industry insisting no one in their orbit has any opinions that might offend.

All that X bad actor has to do is just figure out any worrying take on a topic of choice and then just sit back and watch the mayhem.I also think the most likely originators of this content are state actors. If they can pay a group of people to drop intellectual bombs in the public spheres of their enemies all day, I&#39;m sure they see that as an overall (and very cheap) win.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Holding the money hostage for half a year on a 20 year old account? Not surprising. Paypal and their other entities like Ebay are pretty shit when it comes to nuance and their impact on others.Had a 15 year old Paypal business account (parent started it and I took it over ~7 years ago) and last year they shut it down because I, as the new owner, was not 18 when the account was created. Nothing from the support but &#34;computer said you bad, nothing we can do&#34;.In Ebays case I sold an item, got the regular email from Ebay (DMARK/SPF/IP verified) that they had received payment and was holding it until the item had been delivered. Then a week later I got another email from them saying they had blocked the buyer for abuse (i.e. a fraudulent transaction to them) and that I shouldn&#39;t ship the item they told me to ship a week ago. After 2 months of trying to get through to the support they just claimed that someone spoofed their DMARK, SPF, and servers IP. After explaining how impossible that would be their &#39;proof&#39; that it was &#39;spoofed&#39; was that there should be a copy of the message in the Ebay inbox where, after the reply, all messages about the auction ever existing were suddenly gone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Switzerland, we&#39;re soon going to vote on two initiatives ¹² aiming at reducing pesticide use.
The first is essentially about forbidding the use of all artificial pesticides by 2031 (also importation of food that was produced abroad using pesticides).
The second is about removing subsidies to farmers that use any kind of pesticide, or regularly use antibiotics on their livestock, etc.I feel like they are quite drastic initiatives, but it&#39;s good to at least have a desire for change.
I&#39;m interested in any opinion from knowledgeable people on the subject!¹ https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/202106...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve watched the entire cycle in the past thirty years as a former agronomist.  We were able to genetically modify plants so they generated natural pesticides as a defense against insects.  This allowed us to stop spraying thousands of tons of less insecticides.But the very people complaining about spraying chemicals rejected these new enhanced plants saying they weren&#39;t &#39;natural&#39;.  We have been breeding plants to do things the past 170 years ever since Gregor Mendel and his pea breeding.  The only difference now is that we have better tools.

Fogging (1) is pretty common.Now, the Singapore government says fogging should be used judiciously, not routinely. But, that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. Many condos will fog once a week, year-round. Supposedly all operations must be submitted in the an &#34;E-fogging Submission System&#34;, but as far as I can tell, there&#39;s no visibility into this.Singapore has also recently declared a &#34;climate change emergency&#34;, and I&#39;d consider biodiversity, at the very least, a part of that.My point is that: if the Singapore Government is unable or unwilling to manage this with a sense of urgency (or &#34;emergency&#34;), then I&#39;m not generally hopeful.(1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fogging_(insect_control)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work for another company that is going to do a partial return to office.  I will be looking at options for companies that offer full in person office (or 90% in person office) after things settle down.  I  have worked full remote for a total of 5 years of my career, and I believe working in the office is a competitive advantage.* Overhearing hallway conversations (and joining them) helps spawn invocation.* I often do/did paired programming, and over-the-shoulder code reviews.  These are easier in person* Having a workforce socially close improves productivity because everyone wants to step up for each other.* Being seen by my fellow employees helps keep me from becoming distracted.* Working at the office helps prevent home life from being distracting during work hours.There are some personal benefits I enjoy from being in the office.* I save money by spending less on food, drinks, and electricity.* I enjoy the routine.* I had a stronger work/life separation.  I rarely turned on my work laptop at home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some here are being honest, so I&#39;ll be brutally honest: Covid has upset the master-slave relationship, and they&#39;re realizing they&#39;re giving up too much control.  Yes, even the supposedly forward-thinking, progressive tech world.It&#39;s so much easier to ignore the BS of &#34;company culture,&#34; &#34;a new family&#34; and other such nonsense when working remote.  Plenty of people here have outright stated they work as a way to fund their lives and they couldn&#39;t care less about &#34;the mission,&#34; &#34;changing the world&#34; and other similar lies.  When WFH you only need to put on a show (and sometimes pants!) when on a video call, then you can relax and get your work done and shut out the BS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never thought I&#39;d handle WFH well. When job-hunting, I&#39;d always ignore fully remote jobs. It sounded totally depressing and demotivating to sit at home and interact with my coworkers virtually. I also always valued the office perks.During the first few months, it felt like WFH stripped out all the non-work aspects of my job. At Google those perks were substantial, and it put the work itself in full focus.But you know what? I like it now. I&#39;m able to put in more focused work between 9 and 6 because I can take real breaks. There&#39;s less BS intruding on my life. In the office, your breaks feel more limited to 1) walking to grab a snack in the kitchen, 2) scrolling through something at your desk, or 3) going all the way outside to take a walk. 2/3 of these make you look like a slacker when you do them too much, so I always ended up doing a lot of &#34;pretending to work&#34; breaks to refresh my mind. That said, nobody ever had a problem with my performance.Now I can pop out and walk around the block in 10 minutes, or wander into my back yard. I can do manual chores and intersperse them with knowledge work to give myself a break. I also don&#39;t have to commute for 2 hours each day. This means I have more time and willpower and actually get more done. I actually measure every minute of focused work, which is how I know."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These are the kinds of articles I love to see on HN!I think it&#39;s so interesting to see how different OS&#39; have approached these long lived operations over the years. Arguably, *nix OS&#39; have been able to move past these problems since it appears that package management is much more of a first party concern. &#34;Oh, you want to upgrade this utility? Well, I rely on these other things so you should update them too.&#34;I&#39;m a webdev so a lot of this is foreign to me w/ how it actually all functions but it&#39;s cool to read about these problems and speculate how/why they came to be and why they may only exist on certain platforms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, didn&#39;t even know you can cut files from a zip in that Windows zip file viewer. I would have thought it&#39;s some read-only filesystem like viewing a mounted CD or so.In that context I wonder if you could cut from rewritable CD-RWs as well back in the day (can&#39;t remember) - that seems like another abstraction that&#39;s similarly slow in reality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having written a shell namespace extension, I now use the concept as a great example of making the wrong abstraction interestingly enough. Shell namespaces are a odd win32 concept rather than a filesystem concept and cause a lot of headaches (read support calls) when people see that they work in explorer, but not from arbitrary applications depending on how they use the underlying APIs. If you&#39;re trying to abstract the filesystem with pluggable components... abstract _the filesystem_ with pluggable components.It&#39;d be interesting to now what lead to the architectural decision of wear to cut that abstraction. It feels like a Microsoft team balkanization issue (the explorer team and POs being different from the NT kernel ones, I assume?), but it&#39;s near impossible to know without inside knowledge."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first job out of college was scanning books for the Internet Archive down in the basement of the Library of Congress. Their scanning machines used a foot pedal to raise and lower the glass Platen, so I&#39;d use one hand to flip the page and wiggle the cradle to get things nice and flat and the other would snap the photo. You can get pretty fast after a while, but boy is it mindless. Older books that had been rebound a couple times already were the hardest to work with as you have the least amount of margin. There&#39;s a bunch of different sized dowels that we would put under the spine in the cradle so the glass could gain a couple millimeters of margin, just enough to avoid cutting off text. Worst case scenario the book had to be unbound in order to capture. I did get to flip through a lot of cool old illustrated catalogues like this: https://archive.org/details/illustratedcatal00keil/page/14/m..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built one of these out of pine 2x4s and plywood. I thought it would be cheaper than buying one (I was wrong) but I&#39;m also not a skilled woodworker and had to buy most of the tools.It works quite well and I digitised dozens of textbooks I&#39;d purchased and needed to reference but couldn&#39;t carry around every day while finishing my masters. My one had 2 Nikon mirrorless cameras controlled via Pi-Scan. https://github.com/Tenrec-Builders/pi-scanI had a smaller toggle switch wired to the GPIO pins so I could click the scan next button without having to take my hands of the book. Once I got used to the workflow I could scan about 1000 pages per hour while watching Netflix.I replaced it with a Czur scanner that isn&#39;t as good, but is a lot smaller and is good enough for my less demanding needs now that I&#39;m not doing a masters degree :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At Japan in the meantime, people in book scanning community (that exists) often just cut the book spine and scan the pages using normal scanner, throw it away once all the pages are scanned.People (rightly) value room spaces than books there.
It&#39;s called &#34;Ji-sui&#34; (scanning by oneself)  and gear recommendation sites like [1] are abundant. Another reason of &#34;Ji-sui&#34; prevalence was the poor availability of ebooks, although that reason was less relevant today.[1] http://monomania.sblo.jp/article/60578693.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recall visiting the Yangtze river by boat tour around 1997. This was before the dam was built and the place was beautiful.  Imagine the grand canyon but it was covered with lush vegetation. We visited a center where there were models of the three gorges dam would soon to be built. On the tour they said we would be the last tourists to see the Yangtze as it stands, after the dam, many landmarks/settlements would be flooded, and even back then people critiqued how many species of fish would die because they can no longer swim up river to spawn."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its cousin, the American paddlefish, is still around, though it&#39;s vulnerable.Among other similar reasons (overfishing, pollution), dams are related to its decline: &#34;Series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on the Missouri River have impounded large populations of American paddlefish, and blocked their upstream migration to spawning shoals.[29]&#34;But it&#39;s not too late...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_paddlefish#Population..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, the utility of being at home versus being at the office is massive. If I need a 15 minute break, I can start a load of laundry, or run the dishwasher, or do some other chore.I can wake up later since I don&#39;t have a commute. I don&#39;t lose two hours a day due to the commute.I can wear as comfortable clothing as I desire. I can delay my shower until after my daily workout (Which I can do since my workout equipment is at home).I can control my environment so there are as many or as few distractions as i like. I can put on videos or audio that might not be considered work appropriate. I can use speakers since no one is around me to hear the sound.The number and magnitude of inconveniences we subject ourselves to by heading to an office every day has been fully revealed. I will do all I can to work from home for the rest of my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK. I WFH as well. I know all the benefits. And as I&#39;m WFH for pandemic only I&#39;ve been trying to find remote work post-pandemic and there I realized some bitter points:1. I compete for positions with people all over the world. Who can complete with a fraction of the salary I need.2. As a remote worker -most often working as a contractor- I&#39;m even easier to be replaced in a heartbeat. No severance or anything alike.3. Did I mention that I compete with all the planet? That makes competition for good roles really crazy.4. Work blends into life and it is very hard to keep it from. This gets worse depending on the company/role but in general these things tend to go the employers way not yours.5. You need to find new ways to socialize (and the motivation to do so is minimal) or you risk mental health issues.All I&#39;m trying to say is be careful what you wish for because you might get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope this is the start of a nation wide trend towards better work life balance. Production output has gone up over the past few decades and we’re expected to work the same amount of hours. I think the future probably looks something like 4 6-hour work days each week. Life is way too short and precious to be spending so much of it working for somebody else, even if you mostly do love your job."</p>

The act of selecting and changing text is just a small part of the problem space.I use emacs not because I&#39;m a neckbeard, but because I can script it to do whatever the hell I like. I switch to vscode when I want to do something my emacs setup isn&#39;t yet good for (like, working with Typescript).On the flip side, I use sublime text as a notepad replacement because it&#39;s that fast. I still use nano as my default editor for commit messages. Sometimes I use vim because that&#39;s what I happened to type to open a file.This isn&#39;t a comment on helix editor itself...just that, it&#39;s a pretty saturated space and I&#39;m keen to see something as novel as light table play out again, but only more successfully."</p>

Emacs Lisp is weird, but powerful. Python is great and everyone knows it.

If you want to make your UI easier to use on touch devices that&#39;s fine, but Windows 10 has a tablet mode that I keep disabled, so there&#39;s no reason to assume I&#39;m not using a mouse. If I go to Customize toolbar there&#39;s three density options: Touch, Normal, and Compact (not supported). Why aren&#39;t there a supported compact mode, and why is the normal mode so full of unnecessary padding?With the new design my bookmarks menu that previously had plenty of vertical space left now needs scrolling. Tabs have poor contrast and lack visual anchoring to the web content they contain.I&#39;m going to keep browser.proton.enabled to false in about:config as long as it&#39;s possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t stand this new UI.  Removing icons that which ends up making navigating menus more difficult, these new &#34;floating&#34; tabs are ugly as sin, you can barely see them in light mode...just...awful.  Making the browser harder to use to follow &#34;design trends&#34; is ruining Mozilla.  That Alpenglow theme was a completely asinine waste of resources, just make your browser match the system theme - we have theme extensions for a reason.  They claim they are removing unused features but give us useless garbage like that built-in rainbow theme.The only reason I use Firefox is because it&#39;s the only decent FOSS option that I can use on all my devices.  My patience is wearing thin and this is not going to be a good enough reason for much longer.Make your browser competitive with Google instead of trying to impress your inner circle of designer hipster friends.  The CEO gave themselves a fat raise and gutted staff for _this_?!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imagine 32GB of this V-Cache instead of RAM. Does each additional layer add latency? If so, I wonder how many layers you could have until it would reach RAM-equivalent latencies. Also, it would require a compiler change if you had 500 sections of RAM (at 64MB per section) with latency increases for each section."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love that AMD is making technology open and cross platform on the GPU end. They don&#39;t get enough credit for doing that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here comes another knockdown punch for Intel.Now they got a solution to add hundreds of megs of cache for cheap.More importantly SRAM can be binned/tested/KGDed separately!And it can be fabbed on its own customised process!And also, they can throw in an eDRAM there instead on a moment notice.And as they already have silicon interposer here, adding HBM2/3 will be also a triffle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"People have the cause and effect backwards in my opinion. You know why &#34;binge drinking&#34; isn&#39;t a problem in Germany, except for when the Australians turn up for Oktoberfest? It&#39;s because you can just buy a beer on the side of the road with your currywurst, and drink it without being hassled. If you act up, you get arrested for acting up. Try openly having a few beers in the park in Australia or the US, you&#39;ll be run out by the constabulary, or at the least they&#39;ll make you empty it in the trash. When you treat people like naughty children and bake into your culture the idea that drinking is itself an anti-social behaviour that always leads to fighting and dickheaddery, then that&#39;s how they act."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title is definitely true (america has a drinking problem), in a way. Excessive drinking is normalized, though not as common as problem drinkers think. Since college I always drank too much, but my real issue was that I assumed everybody drank as much as I did (maybe 20-30 drinks per week). Since I wasn&#39;t drinking as soon as I woke up or getting shakes without drinking, I thought I was fine. It wasn&#39;t until I realized that I drank waaayyy more than most people that I started working on reducing consumption. Thankfully I only drank that much because I just have fun being drunk or enjoy the taste - I&#39;ve never used alcohol to cope with stress, anxiety, shyness, etc - so it was easy when I decided to go cold turkey for a month. So I&#39;m sharing in hopes that I can help someone else realize they drink too much even if they don&#39;t think they do, and that it&#39;s totally doable to cut back.Just in this one month, I&#39;ve already noticed a huge difference in my life. It&#39;s amazing to wake up rested and energetic every day, never having that dread about a hangover, being groggy, or wondering if I did something embarrassing last night. I feel present in everything I do, rather than having my routine and my attention thrown off by alcohol. Saving calories makes my weight more stable and lets me indulge in more food if I want to. I&#39;m saving tons of money, especially at restaurants. I&#39;m already regaining the hyperactivity and excitement towards life and events that I had in grade school before I started drinking, because now I can look forward to stuff other than getting drunk. It feels great to go to parties, restaurants, watch a movie, go on a date, do anything, and not even think about alcohol. For me drinking was fun and easy, but now I&#39;ve learned that drinking is shallow and comes at way too high of a cost compared compared to the deep joy of living sober and enjoying life for its own sake again.I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend drinking less to anybody who does drink. You don&#39;t need to be black and white and think that it&#39;s either cold turkey or stay where you are. You don&#39;t need to worry about the &#34;benefits&#34; you get from red wine and whatever other stuff people love to talk about. Just try drinking less. Maybe don&#39;t drink on weekdays, set a maximum number you can drink in a day, take a 1-day break, take a 1-week break, start drinking lower-percentage drinks, set a maximum number of drinks per week, there are tons of options. I tried them all and over time I was able to consistently reduce how much I drank. I used to have trouble imagining not drinking during a weekend, and now I&#39;m already having trouble imagining wanting to drink more than a few times a month at most.Alcohol is like junk food or soda. It&#39;s fun and it&#39;s easy. But life is a lot better if you can break the habit and stop making it part of your life, or at least make it a once-in-a-blue-moon indulgence rather than a regular thing. Learn to love things with deeper and healthier value. If you don&#39;t control these things, there&#39;s the risk that you&#39;ll gradually get worse over time. You don&#39;t want to look at yourself in 20 years and realize you gained 50+ lbs and don&#39;t recognize yourself because you didn&#39;t take the chips or chocolate seriously. You don&#39;t want to look at yourself in 20 years and realize you have cirrhosis or heart disease because you didn&#39;t tone down the drinking. You don&#39;t have to be obese or an alcoholic to benefit from making healthy lifestyle changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite OBS feature is that you can bring in transparent browser windows all over the place. As such, I have my work conferencing set up so my time appears in the upper-right corner. I’m on the east coast and everyone I work with is on the west coast. It’s a nice way to remind them of my current time. (It also passive aggressively animated to purple with a moon when its “after hours,” a/k/a 5pm for me.)I also have shortcuts to pull in live weather conditions, our company stock price, crypto prices for fun, a 1- and 3- and 5-minute timer, as well as a countdown of days until important work events.It’s fun, and all just a bit of HTML and CSS and JS. (And PHP/cURL/cron to pull stock and weather prices in the background.) All this for free with OBS.Easily a top 5 app for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excited for this release since it contains M1 Apple VT H264 Hardware Encoding support[1] — I know on my Intel Mac, OBS would massacre the CPU if I didn&#39;t have the hardware encoding enabled. On the M1 it&#39;s not quite so bad, but being able to use hardware encoding does save a lot of CPU cycles when streaming at higher bitrates![1] https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4170"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OBS is such wonderful software. It&#39;s immensely powerful yet approachable and performant. I am not a streamer, but I&#39;ve found it really useful as an audio/video swiss army knife. Many thanks to the team and community behind it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I haven&#39;t heard of using docker compose for production development, only local development. In production I normally see people building production images and spinning up them up in their cloud with Terraform and whatever other infrastructure they need, especially for databases where your local MySQL container isn&#39;t going to be configured or provisioned like an AWS RDS instance. What do you hand a docker-compose file off to in production? Swarm? When would you choose this path over a separate system to provision your production resources (like Terraform)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had remembered docker&#39;s own documentation in the past recommending against using compose at all in production, but that is apparently no longer the case: https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/I&#39;m fairly surprised by this. You can deploy a fairly similar compose file into a Docker swarm cluster, but if you&#39;re doing a single-server deployment of everything, that is awfully brittle for production, to say nothing of considerations brought up in other comments where you may be using managed services from a cloud provider for things like database and caching in production but you&#39;re probably just spinning up a local postgres server on your laptop for development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pro-tip: nowadays podman can pretend to be a kubernetes cluster and launch pod And deployment definitions (in yaml, of course).That of course is way close to the &#34;production&#34; in &#34;production ready&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing about smoking is that when you quit smoking you quit it every day. Imagine a light switch on the wall. You turn it off by quitting smoking and you can always go back at a desperate time for instance and turn it on. And some time later off again. Smoking your first cigarette implants that light switch on your mind and you can&#39;t make it go away. Since you know how it makes you feel good when the switch is on, you at some level desire to back to it. Whole idea of quitting smoking is then finding ways to stop yourself from turning it on again and this is true until you die. So do yourself a favor and avoid any substance that creates such light switches in your mind.Edit: Of course this is not the case for 100% of humans. Everyone is different. Some weak some strong in willpower, discipline, etc. But we can all agree that it is an addiction that sucks life out of you slowly. You wouldn&#39;t want to test your willpower your whole life against such a sneaky enemy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started smoking when i went to study in China. Someone gifted me an expensive brand of cigarette, and I kept it hidden in a drawer for two weeks as I didn&#39;t smoke. One very cold day with no where to go and nothing to do, I took the pack out and lit one stick. My did it have a lovely scent. The heat it created inside me was also soothing. It took me about a week and half to finish the pack of 21 cigs. I couldn&#39;t afford to buy the same brand often but i had become addicted to smoking. I struggled with anxiety back then and smoking calmed my nerves. Within 1 year I was smoking 2 packs a day.Smoking is frowned upon in Ghana, so upon my return there were few places I could smoke. One day while out and about I got really anxious about something and I needed a cig badly. I had to go some distance to get one, and even got a harder time finding a place to hide and smoke. I felt like I was committing the most heinous of crimes cause I had to take off my shirt to ensure the smell didn&#39;t stick on me. I didn&#39;t even enjoy the smoke because the quality wasn&#39;t that good, I smoked in a hurry and kept looking over my shoulder. I simply couldn&#39;t live like that anymore. So I quit after that day. The next time I tried to smoke again was 2 months later. I couldn&#39;t even finish a stick as it made me feel sick. I have disliked the smell of cigarettes ever since. And that was 7 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ian Banks in his novel Complicity writes powerfully decrying smoking. Quoting from the novel.  I take out another cigarette, light it and draw deeply. I 
  gag again, coughing and hacking and feeling the whisky 
  and the can of Export I had earlier slosh around inside 
  me, almost coming up. My eyes are watering. What a stupid 
  drug, what a completely useless fucking drug; no real hit 
  after the first drag, highly addictive and lethal in all 
  sorts of ways, and even if the lung cancer or the heart 
  disease doesn&#39;t get you you can look forward to 
  gangrenous legs in your old age, bits of your body just 
  rotting away still attached and dying in instalments for 
  you, rotting and stinking while you&#39;re still alive and 
  then they have to cut them off and you wake up after the 
  operation wheezing and burning with pain and gasping for 
  a fag. Meanwhile the tobacco companies sponsor sport and 
  fight off advertising bans and look forward to all the 
  new markets in the East and the Far East and more women 
  taking up the weed to show that they can be brainless 
  fucks too, and suits with worm-shit in their brains go on 
  television and say, &#39;Well, nobody&#39;s actually proved how 
  tobacco causes cancer you know&#39;, and you sit there 
  seething and then you find Thatcher is taking half a 
  million from Philip Morris for a three-year find 
  consultancy and you swear never to buy any of their 
  products ever again but at the end of the day you still 
  light another cigarette and suck in the smoke like you 
  enjoyed it and make more profits for those evil fucks.
