A year later, when the archive was still available from umpteen hosts.For all I know, it still languishes on who knows how many old hard drives..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey everybody! I&#39;m David, the creator of YouTubeDrive, and I never expected to see this old project pop up on HN. YouTubeDrive was created when I was a freshman in college with questionable programming abilities, absolutely no knowledge of coding theory, and way too much free time.The encoding scheme that YouTubeDrive uses is brain-dead simple: pack three bits into each pixel of a sequence of 64x36 images (I only use RGB values 0 and 255, nothing in between), and then blow up these images by a factor of 20 to make a 1280x720 video. These 20x20 colored squares are big enough to reliably survive YouTube&#39;s compression algorithm (or at least they were in 2016 -- the algorithms have probably changed since). You really do need something around that size, because I discovered that YouTube&#39;s video compression would sometimes flip the average color of a 10x10 square from 0 to 255, or vice versa.Looking back now as a grad student, I realize that there are much cleverer approaches to this problem: a better encoding scheme (discrete Fourier/cosine/wavelet transforms) would let me pack bits in the frequency domain instead of the spatial domain, reducing the probability of bit-flip errors, and a good error-correcting code (Hamming, Reed-Solomon, etc.) would let me tolerate a few bit-flips here and there. In classic academic fashion, I&#39;ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to implement these extensions :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before broadband was widely available, TiVo used to purchase overnight paid programming slots across the US and broadcast modified PDF417 video streams that provided weekly program guide data for TiVo users. There&#39;s a sample of it on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfUgT2YoPzI but they usually wrapped a 60-second commercial before and after the 28-minute broadcast of data. There was enough error correction in the data streams to allow proper processing even with less-than-perfect analog television reception."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey folks. I’ve had Starlink (standard service) mounted on my van for the last three months travelling around Australia with roaming off. Has been a game changer for working remotely and helping build Gitpod. It works just fine even when driving [1] or at techno bush doofs [2].[1] https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSdXwqGrP/?k=1[2] https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSdXwbq2b/?k=1Happy to answer any questions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From their ToS:
Best Effort Service for RV Users. Network resources are always deprioritized for Starlink RVs users compared to other Starlink Services, resulting in degraded service and slower speeds in congested areas and during peak hours. Stated speeds and uninterrupted use of the Service are not guaranteed. Service degradation will occur most often in &#34;Waitlist&#34; areas designated on the Starlink Availability Map during peak usage hours. See the Starlink Specifications for expected performance of the Starlink for RV Services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been waiting patiently for almost two years to get it the old-fashioned way.  Just canceled my longstanding deposit, and ordered Starlink for RVs.  It helps that I really wanted it for my RV anyway, and just assumed all along that at some point in the not-to-distant future they were going to allow that.Fairly expensive, but it will allow me to work remotely from a very beautiful, remote location, and I intend to take full advantage of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been using CAT phones for a few years. They really are tough, work pretty well with gloves, do not care much about water, etc. Can recommend, and the infrared sensors are worth it just for the wow effect alone :). From the downsides - some of the smaller things break faster than you&#39;d like (e.g. laser meter, or rubber covers for the USB port, or the painted/glued layer on the back in one of the older models). These downsides do not invalidate the main purpose(s) of the device. Also the phones rather quickly fall out of the supported Android version range, but this seems to be a common problem with all Android phones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We have push-to-talk, group chat, and live video software for similar devices:
Kyocera DuraXV https://kyoceramobile.com/duraxv-extreme/
Sonim XP3 Plus https://www.sonimtech.com/products/devices/xp3plus/Both flip phones are based on AOSP (https://source.android.com/) and we&#39;ve had to deal with custom implementations of soft keys, and push to talk headsets. Even Kyocera&#39;s implementation varies between the ATT version (https://kyoceramobile.com/duraxe-epic/att/) and the Verizon one.This phone is made by https://bullitt-group.com/ and they very smartly license the CAT brand. We have not worked with them yet, but I&#39;m guessing it would be relatively trivial to support the phone.Without good soft-key support, these phones are unusable. Any questions, please LMK."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently reading Digital Minimalism from Cal Newton and have started preparing for a 30-day digital declutter. So I was really excited to read this title and immediately disappointed after clicking - the Cat phone has a web browser. If you have access to the entirety of the internet in your pocket, it is hard to limit yourself and no little trick or hack is going to actually help - in my experience.I&#39;ll go ahead and take advantage of this post to ask, what do other digital minimalists on HN use for their phone? I&#39;m looking for something with messages, maps, a camera, and WhatsApp with no access to a browser or an app store. The most difficult item on that list is definitely WhatsApp. Unfortunately, if you travel a lot (which I do) it&#39;s not really optional. Outside of North America, EVERYTHING happens on WhatsApp. I&#39;ve started looking into custom Android ROMS but that feels like an extreme step for what must be a common problem?"</p>

In short: DKSB is not in favour of this. You know, the people that probably know what they are talking about when it comes to the protection of children, unlike the politicians who are trying to force this through.The politicians which only really talked to salesmen of surveillance software [3] about this and never really consulted any independent people with expertise in tech, privacy or the protection of children [4].Because this was never, at any moment, about protecting children.[1]: https://www.dksb.de/en/home/[2]: https://www.eu-info.de/dpa-europaticker/316232.html[3]: https://netzpolitik.org/2022/dude-wheres-my-privacy-how-a-ho...[4]: https://edri.org/our-work/private-and-secure-communications-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Living in France, the lie is also obvious for a very sad reason : we aldready don&#39;t do anything significant in case of a majority of &#39;obvious&#39; child abuses (sex related or not, that&#39;s not even the point).I know a fair amount of social worker whom sadly report that in a lot of child education place they know about A LOT of abuse, and a non negligible (and mental burden inducing) part of the work is to do triage, because they know they get (the number are made up) 50 report per week, but they only can &#39;investigate&#39; about 20, and even if the 20 are really worrying, they can only launch action for 3 to 5, any more would overflow the dedicated services.And that&#39;s not they are lazy, investigating is really complicated (and often not even worth, the main goal is to help the victim, no chasing culprits) and acting worse. You are pretty sure some girl in bad social context is being abused ? with whom do you send her living ? the maybe abusing father ? The probably violent alcoolic uncle or the nice but drug dealing older brother (who maybe is not ready to support her education even with a little financial help) ? That can seems parodic but I&#39;ve seen real conversations like that.The idea public services who cannot aldready read all the professionally redacted reports will suddently became omniscient because they can read my discord server private channel is funny.Hope some representative will jump on the occasion to request more social worker founds to treat the case we aldready know about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very well written article that justifies its criticism of the EC&#39;s proposal with facts and numbers. Based on this, it really does look like child abuse is merely used as an excuse for more general surveillance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I hope some experienced people in the industry can give some hope and advice. Is demoralizing to find out I spent 4 years in school just to get into a really harsh job market. First pandemic, then recession? F...Overall, I&#39;d say relax a bit. You&#39;re still in a good situation. Recessions are hard for many, but software engineers were among the best off during the last one and I expect will be this time also.&gt; I wanna know if during recessions recruiting slows down even for big profitable companies.I remember Google&#39;s recruiting slowed down in ~2008. [edit: 2009? Maybe not right at the start of the recession.] [1] So sometimes yes. On the bright side, it&#39;s rare for profitable large tech companies to lay off software engineers, so if you get in, you&#39;re pretty safe.Even at startups, I don&#39;t expect a universal freeze. I asked an external recruiter (that is, someone who recruits for a variety of startups) a couple days ago about the present situation. She told me some companies she works with have done hiring freezes, others are still desperate to hire. There are opportunities. I&#39;m not a good enough business person to give you solid general advice about which startups will be most resilient, though.If you are good enough and/or persistent enough, my feeling is there will be a place for you in tech. (Even if, for example, you freeze up during coding interviews. Some companies do these, others don&#39;t. There&#39;s enough variety that you can still be okay if you don&#39;t have your sights set on a particular company.)If you are not, there&#39;s almost certainly still a place for you as a software engineer in a stable, non-tech company or government position. Non-tech typically isn&#39;t as lucrative, but you can be comfortable. My feeling is many of these places have a tremendous need for just basic automation. Arguably more so during a recession, although they may not all realize this.I started my career not long before the last recession. I didn&#39;t have any real existing savings to lose. Then I was earning far in excess of my needs and investing much of the rest in index funds (e.g. VTI) when stock prices were low. The recession ended and stock prices soared. I feel scummy saying this about many people&#39;s suffering, but the recession worked out well for me.[1] Personally I think this was a mistake. They could have hired a lot of great people during this time. &#34;Be bold when others are fearful.&#34; They had solid financial footing for hiring, and if nothing else, they could have put a fair number of folks on efficiency projects that would have more than paid their way in machine costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Is demoralizing to find out I spent 4 years in school just to get into a really harsh job market.I know it doesn&#39;t make your experience any better, but this is *not* a harsh job market. Yes, some companies are pulling back/slowing down/pausing hiring, but there are still far more software jobs available than people to fill them.&gt; What companies or roles will be more resilient?Those that are or can quickly become profitable. Most startups are NOT profitable because they chase growth at all costs. This may change as cheap and easy money dries up.&gt; And how as a SWE / tech industry professional, specially the ones starting their careers like me, can prepare?Don&#39;t do anything different. You had one company pull out on you. That happens all the time for a multitude of reasons. Don&#39;t be discouraged. Apply for jobs at a range of companies, from start-ups to profitable SaaS companies to companies outside the typical &#34;tech&#34; wheelhouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their honesty should be applauded. Imagine they hired you and then had to fire you in 6 months. Keep in touch with the PM if you liked them and see how they perform in the next 12 months."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This title is very misleading (and really should be changed).This is not about search. To be clear, when you load our search results, you are completely anonymous, including ads. For ads, we actually worked with Microsoft to make ad clicks privacy protected as well. From our public ads page, &#34;Microsoft Advertising does not associate your ad-click behavior with a user profile.&#34; This page is linked to next to every Microsoft ad that is served on our search engine (duckduckgo.com). https://help.duckduckgo.com/company/ads-by-microsoft-on-duck....In all our browsing apps (iOS/Android/Mac) we also block third-party cookies, including those from Microsoft-owned properties like LinkedIn and Bing. That is, the privacy thing most people talk about on the web (blocking 3rd party cookies) applies here to MSFT. We also have a lot of other web protections that also apply to MSFT-owned properties as well, e.g.,  GPC, first-party cookie expiration, fingerprinting protection, referrer header trimming, cookie consent handling, fire button data clearing, etc.This is just about non-DuckDuckGo and non-Microsoft sites in our browsers, where our search syndication agreement currently prevents us from stopping Microsoft-owned scripts from loading, though we can still apply our browser&#39;s protections post-load (like 3rd party cookie blocking and others mentioned above, and do). We&#39;ve also been tirelessly working behind the scenes to change this limited restriction. I also understand this is confusing because it is a search syndication contract that is preventing us from doing a non-search thing. That&#39;s because our product is a bundle of multiple privacy protections, and this is a distribution requirement imposed on us as part of the search syndication agreement. Our syndication agreement also has broad confidentially provisions and the requirement documents themselves are explicitly marked confidential.Taking a step back, I know our product is not perfect and will never be. We face many constraints: platform constraints, contractual constraints (like in this case), breakage constraints, and the evolving tracking arms race. Holistically though I believe it is the best thing out there for mainstream users who want simple privacy protection without breaking things, and that is our product vision.Overall our app is multi-pronged privacy protection in one package (private search, web protection, HTTPS upgrading, email protection, app tracking protection for Android, and more to come), being careful (and putting in a lot of effort) to not break things while still offering protections -- an &#34;easy button&#34; for privacy. And we constantly work to improve its capabilities and will continue to do so, including in this case. For example, we&#39;ve recently been adding bespoke third-party protections for Google and Facebook, like Google AMP/Topics/FLEDGE protection and Facebook embedded content protection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just looking at the original title, I knew this was going to be a twitter post by a Brave employee posting either hearsay, or something taken out of context.Private browsing is a small niche, and Brave does their best to drive competitors at every turn, and not by being obviously better at it. Kinda scummy, if I’m honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DuckDuckGo feels like just a front for Microsoft at this point. I once looked into buying search ads on DuckDuckGo, only to discover to my horror that DDG didn&#39;t have its own ad business. DDG is entirely reliant on Microsoft&#39;s advertising system. You have to sign up for a Microsoft account to even put ads on DDG! And it&#39;s difficult — maybe impossible IIRC? — to specifically target DDG in those ads, without also targeting other MS properties.Until DuckDuckGo separates itself from Microsoft and becomes truly independent, especially in its business model, you have to question why DDG even exists.DDG was founded 14 years ago. I can understand initially bootstrapping on MS ads, but what&#39;s the excuse now? How about separating yourself from Microsoft first, before making a web browser that gives special exemptions to Microsoft?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work for Nokia Research during the mid 2000&#39;s. I remember how hard it was to get the source code for this back then as internal employees... One of my colleagues was working on a research prototype that needed tighter integration with the system than what you could achieve with a deployed app. So he needed the source code and the build environment for the OS.And for that he needed quite a few people to agree and he had to sign an NDA (again, as an employee, not a subcontractor!). Then, of course the whole thing was pretty hard to make work on his machine.Later on I did some work with the (public) SDK as well. The build system was based on the GNU toolchain. More precisely, a windows port of the GNU toolchain, so it would only work on windows. But even on windows it had a lot of warts (because these tools were build for unix in the first place, so e.g. drive letters and back slashes were problematic). As far as I can remember, a lot of the build tools were written in perl. There was some script to generate makefiles for your project and even that, as far as I can remember had a front end script. (I remember something called MAKMAKE.BAT, but I may be wrong.)The whole thing was a pretty frustrating experience. And we haven&#39;t talked about the libraries, the OS (cooperative multi tasking, everything is a callback) or memory management (&#39;descriptors&#39; that made trivial string operations a pain). No wonder it couldn&#39;t keep up with android and ios. Now, to be fair, the OS was based on a core and concepts created in the mid 1990s to allow software development on devices with 64k of memory or something. But even with several megabytes of RAM (so the early 2000s), that programming model was obviously way too constraining."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is odd to see people talking about how Symbian was so early on, in the smartphone era.It&#39;s considerably more mature than that. :-) (For the avoidance of doubt: this is a good thing.)Symbian was a rebrand of the Psion 5 and 5MX OS, which was called EPOC32. It also ran on some other hardware, including the Ericsson MC218, Oregon Scientific Osaris, and Geofox One.The first EPOC32 device was the Psion 5 in 1997:http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/5300/Psion-Series-5/Succeeded by the 5MX:https://uxdesign.cc/psion-pda-how-does-it-look-today-327e01b...https://thenewstack.io/retrocomputing-in-modern-times-redisc...In other words, this OS was out there in the real world, in use by hundreds of thousands of people, five years before the first Symbian device (Nokia 7650)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some other dynamics that are worth mentioning here that can stand in the way of undertaking any of the steps the author recommends.  I don&#39;t think they touched on any of these things so I&#39;ll list some of them out:* Technical staff in an organization feel they have no authority or respect within the organization.  This can happen when companies become too sales-driven.* Senior technical staff feel they have no ability to delegate, either because of the previous point or because they don&#39;t trust the technical ability of less senior staff.* Those in an organization who do have authority to delegate lack sufficient understanding of priorities or lack technical knowledge.These things highlight the classic balance between technical knowledge and managerial skills.  If you don&#39;t have people that bring both to the table, you&#39;re in for trouble.  Not sure if I&#39;d go so far as to say this is what it&#39;s all about.  However, reading over the author&#39;s advice, I thought to myself, &#34;None of this could have happened at some places I&#39;ve worked.&#34;  You can come up with a good plan, but if no one will listen to you or take your advice, it&#39;s worthless.The author probably was that person who brought what was needed to the table.  As such, perhaps the plan is not what ended up mattering so much as having someone who was willing and able to push it through.  Also, having the right people from top to bottom.  My feeling sometimes is that effective teams occur almost randomly.  This might be because organizations rarely have the patience or the resources to assemble them deliberately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After the MVP is found, then the real work begins in building a company. We all understand that if everything is a priority, then nothing is, but often times, business resources don&#39;t. Support wants bugs fixed to keep customers happy and to re-sign. Sales whats features to land their whales. Engineering wants to work off tech debt, refine, and innovate. Etc.. I&#39;ve found that a formal &#34;Intake&#34; process works wonders. Engineering needs an advocate to take these disparate priorities and refine what, when and how to address. It&#39;s really that simple, and that complex. Finding someone to own it. Sometimes it&#39;s impossible depending on the Org and personalities involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who have gone through this there is one Achilles heel: appraisals.Unless the management agrees in letter &amp; spirit on prioritisation this is a disaster.When everything is a priority the message from top is &#34;We want best of both worlds&#34; i.e. we want productivity, quality and less complaining.Now you have prioritized in seq: A B C D... The team who has C or D to deliver will have there deliverables pushed by say 6 months. Guess who will be pissed-off with this?But the team accountable for D will say that this is what was agreed and signed on but the top still had those flawed expectations back of their mind.There is also cross-team impact. The product manager who was championing project D now has his/her appraisal in question. He/She will point fingers to the engineering and complain to his/her boss.In other words: Every one in the chain of command has vested interest. Unless they are aligned to large extent its hard to get out of this situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t really see which bits of web3 are meant to threaten the existing web, or are more dangerous to it than the existing threats.The balkanization of the web seems like a threat that gets bigger every year. Surveillance gets worse every year. Regulatory attempts to combat certain kinds of surveillance do so by shifting the burden of &#34;consent&#34; on to users who don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re consenting to. Fewer and fewer people have any kind of &#34;ownership&#34; of the web in the form of personal servers, privately-hosted websites, independent self-managed communities, and so on.Perhaps web3 could be a danger if it proposes unworkable solutions to those problems. Token economies and blockchains do give a kind of &#34;ownership&#34; and &#34;participation&#34;, but the sheer volatility of the pricing of the goods, services and induced-scarcity &#34;land&#34; on offer makes it impractically risky or expensive for anyone who isn&#39;t running some kind of trading strategy.There are lots of good critiques of web3, and good arguments against specific projects, features, or consequences it produces. &#34;Keep the web free&#34; is a fine idea, but I&#39;m not sure that web3 is where the real danger comes from."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Random thought - is Web3 a real danger to the currently existing web, where &#34;real&#34; means &#34;plausible&#34; rather than just &#34;possible&#34;?I&#39;m asking because every Web3 project I have seen so far has collapsed after getting just enough speculators (and therefore money) to make a nice rug pull/attack, but well before gaining any significant traction of non-paying users that are there to use the platform rather than speculate. It seems to me that it&#39;s completely unsustainable to keep a Web3 project running long enough to even gain these users in any way.It seems to me that Web3 is, so far, only providing us with three things: the first is a way to speculate, the second is a way to waste our electricity, the third is laughing stock via https://web3isgoinggreat.com/ which only sorta sweetens points number one and two.Are there any notable exceptions to my above observation? Am I wrong in some more fundamental way?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My mother is amazing to watch because she doesn&#39;t do anything efficiently, really: She puts about three times as much energy as necessary into everything she does. But she never spends any time wondering what to do next or how to optimize anything; she just keeps working. Her strategy, slightly simplified, is, &#34;See something that needs to be done and do it.&#34; All day long. And at the end of the day, she&#39;s accomplished a huge amount.This strategy is remarkably powerful and I&#39;ve used it to great effect in my career. Committing yourself to pushing forward every single day, even if just a little bit, and always just peeling off one single thing you can do next (even if it&#39;s tiny yet takes you all day) has a dizzying compounding effect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Recently, I came across a few old and new interviews of Donald KnuthI have developed the conclusion that reading digestive summary from original source materials is ultimately ineffective for me at this stage of the life.Unfortunately, the author did not provide links to these interviews.For anyone who is writing a summary from other source material, please do provide references. That&#39;s one of the things I learned churning out low quality academic papers in PhD study."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ...it turns up in Philippians 3:16, where the writer says that:&gt; &#34;You don&#39;t race to get to the goal; the process of racing itself, of keeping the pace, is the real goal.
When I go on vacation, I like to enjoy the drive.&#34;&gt; In Christian churches I am least impressed by a sermon that talks about how marvelous heaven is going to be at the end. To me that&#39;s not the message of Christianity. The message is about how to live now, not that we should live in some particular way because there&#39;s going to be pie in the sky some day. The end means almost nothing to me. I am glad it&#39;s there, but I don&#39;t see it as much of a motivating force, if any. I mean, it&#39;s the journey that&#39;s important.---This is Philippians 3:16: &#34;Only let us live up to what we have already attained.&#34;It&#39;s hard for me to connect that to the paraphrase given above. Furthermore, the previous few verses (12-14) of that same chapter seem to be more goal-oriented, than process-oriented:&#34;Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&#34;Also see 1 Corinthians 15:19:&#34;If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some context: The Green Party had long been diametrically opposed to nuclear, to the extent that they have twice exited a coalition government in protest of granting additional reactor permits. Over the past ten years their position has gradually shifted though, thanks to STEM-oriented Greens in particular, as it has become obvious that AGW is a bigger threat than nuclear. This in spite of several setbacks:– Obviously, the Fukushima disaster of 2011.– The fact that the Olkiluoto 3 reactor project [1], a 1600MW PWR unit, was plagued by chronic delays and cost overruns – it is only now being connected to the grid, over ten years behind schedule. OL3&#39;s fundamental problem was that the European nuclear industry simply was not up to the task of delivering a first-of-its-kind, ambitious third-gen reactor after a fifteen-year hiatus during which no new nuclear power plants were built in Europe.– Another planned nuclear plant, Hanhikivi [2], had problems finding a Western reactor supplier; after some arguably rather shady dealings, a contract was made with Rosatom, the state nuclear corporation of Russia. This received some well-earned criticism, but Finnish decisionmakers (perhaps naively) wanted to think there was no political dimension to such an agreement. After February 24, the project is now almost certainly dead in the water, never having left the planning and design phase.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olkiluoto_Nuclear_Power_Plant#...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanhikivi_Nuclear_Power_Plant"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, and hopefully it will stop the premature shutdown of existing nuclear reactors.But it&#39;s pretty tiny climate news overall. Nuclear reactors are aging out and nobody in Western Europe or the US seems to know how to build in a cost competitive way anymore.Deploying 5GW of solar and storage, or 3-4GW of wind, is far easier, faster, and cheaper than trying to build a new reactor, which won&#39;t come on line for a bare minimum of 10 years, best case. We don&#39;t have that long to wait to start replacing nearly all of our fossil fuel infrastructure, and replace the nuclear reactors that are reaching end of life.If nuclear was going to be a climate solution, then all the nuclear reactors started in the 2000s needed to complete on time and on schedule to encourage the building of more. Instead it&#39;s 2022 and we are still waiting to see how bad the financial disaster will be for them. That&#39;s not the route towards building more nuclear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the Greens in England and Wales dropped their opposition to nuclear and also binned off a few of their more anti-egalitarian positions (I cannot in good faith support criminal sentencing where a man goes to jail but a woman doesn&#39;t for the same crime for example) and I&#39;d probably vote for them at this point. They&#39;ve only recently been seen as a &#39;serious&#39; party with mainstream appeal but climate change doesn&#39;t really care for our political sensibilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;What if it changes?&#34; is a reasonable question to ask. But every time you do you are walking a tightrope. My rule of thumb is that we look at what is in use TODAY, and then write a decent abstraction around that. If something is used once, ignore any abstractions. If it&#39;s used twice, just copy it, it&#39;s better. If it&#39;s used 3 or more times, look at writing an abstraction that suits us TODAY not for the future. Bonus points if the abstraction allows us to extend easily in the future, but nothing should be justified with a &#34;what if&#34;.The reason a lot of Java or C# code is written with all these abstractions is because it aids unit testing. But I&#39;ve come to love just doing integration testing. I still use unit testing to test complex logic, but things like &#34;does this struct mapper work correctly&#34; are ignored, we&#39;ll find out from our integration tests. If our integration tests work, we&#39;ve fulfilled our part of the contract, that&#39;s all we care about. Focus on writing them and making them fast and easy to run. It&#39;s virtually no different to unit tests but just 10x easier to maintain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition . https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpris...You never know when you might need to change the implementation of how the &#34;Fuzz&#34; string is returned, so you need a FuzzStringReturner.And you never know when you might need multiple different ways of returning &#34;Fuzz&#34;, so you need a FuzzStringReturnerFactory.And for SOLID it&#39;s important to separate concerns, so you want your FuzzStringReturnerFactory separate from your FuzzStringPrinterFactory.And that barely scratches the surface of what you need!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t seen anyone else point out: One of the ways you can often identify really experienced programmers is by them being able to pretty accurately separate thing-that-probably-will-change from things-that-probably-won&#39;t.Finding a good way to balance YAGNI with this-will-definitely-change-in-a-few-months-because-it-always-does is incredibly hard, and I&#39;ve really appreciated working with engineers who make that prediction correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the bad old Linux days, if you read a huge amount of data off the disk (like if you were doing a backup) Linux would try to take all that data and jam it in the page cache. This would push out all the useful stuff in your cache, and sometimes even cause swapping as Linux helpfully swaps out stuff to make room for more useless page cache.One of the great things about `dd` is that you have a lot of control how the input and output files are opened. You can bypass the page cache when reading data by using iflag=direct, which would stop this from happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Useful uses of dd(1).There remain some useful applications of dd.  These may of course be achieved by other mechanisms, but typically less conveniently.1. Read a specific number of blocks or bytes from a source:  dd if=/dev/hda of=/root/mbr bs=512 count=1

This will make a copy of, say, your master boot record (first 512 bytes of your first disk drive) and stash it in your /root directory.2. Read from specific bytes of a file  dd if=mydata skip=1k bs=32 count=1

Reads 32 bytes after the first 1024 (1k) bytes of &#34;mydata&#34;.3. Write to specific bytes of a file  dd if=source of=target seek=10k bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc

That should write 512 bytes from &#34;source&#34; beginning 10k into &#34;target&#34;.  (I&#39;ve not tested this, you should verify.)4. Create a sparse file.  Sparse files appear to have a nonzero size, but take up no space on disk, until data is actually written to them.  These are often used as &#34;inflating&#34; dynamic filesystem images for virtual machines.  dd if=/dev/zero of=sparsefile bs=1 count=0 seek=20000M # Create 20 GB sparse file

5. Case conversions.  Sure, you could use tr(1), but where&#39;s the sport?  dd if=MixEdCaSE of=lcase conv=lcase   # Convert to lower case
  dd if=MixEdCaSE of=ucase conv=ucase   # Convert to upper case

6. ASCII / EBCDIC conversions  dd if=ebcdic of=ascii conv=ascii   # ebcdic -&gt; ascii
  dd if=ascii of=ebcdic conv=ebcdic  # ascii -&gt; ebcdic


When reading to or from IBM data tapes, you might find blocking / unblocking conversions useful.  I&#39;ve done this, but it&#39;s so long ago that I don&#39;t trust my memory on that any more.

A while back I tweeted:Today I found the magical dd command that causes an NVMe drive to run at almost full speed:  # dd if=/dev/nvme3n1 bs=4096k iflag=direct of=/dev/null status=progress
  959090524160 bytes (959 GB, 893 GiB) copied, 178 s, 5.4 GB/s

The trick to getting this throughput is telling Linux to do an insanely large IO (4 MiB). The drive can&#39;t do 4 MiB reads - the largest IO it can handle is 2 MiB.  # nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme3 | grep mdts
  mdts      : 9
  # echo &#39;4 \* 2^9&#39; | bc -l

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As incremental construction goes, my grandma&#39;s house in North Dakota is a pretty good example.  It went from a one story small home to a two story home with a wrap-around deck.  I&#39;m sure it was some ordered house put on a basement.  It had an outhouse in the 70&#39;s but indoor plumbing was added.  I remember sometime in the 80&#39;s putting in a support beam so they could remove some of the walls and support the second story.  It was an all-hands task of the relatives with most of my uncle and aunts.  I remember Dad&#39;s reaction when Grandma announced she had bought a wood stove to put in the house.  That was a fun install requiring the removal of a wall, brick base, and running venting.There was a bit of danger in all this expansion.  The look of utter horror on my Dad&#39;s and Uncle&#39;s face when we turned off all the breakers and the stove was still on makes me laugh but was deadly serious at the time.  Fixing that was a bit of an adventure.  Dad and Uncle traced every wire in the damn house and I learned some new insults."</p>

Is that more common in water-restricted municipalities? (I live in midwestern US, where backyard gardens are very common.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The only way you could possibly measure this is just to look at the distribution of coins among wallets. This is obviously going to count crypto exchanges as single entities, which is absurd.It&#39;d be like counting JPMorgan as a single person when computing wealth inequality in the US. Analyses like these are a total joke."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several issues with using this metric to measure wealth inequality for crypto currencies, especially those with smart contracts like Ethereum.- A single address might be a contract like WETH, which can hold tens of billions of dollars worth of tokens despite all users in the network having access to it. Similar with centralized exchanges holding many tokens. Addresses are not users.- This metric often confuses “inequality of interest” with “inequality of wealth.” A user holding $10,000 of ETH and another user holding $100 of ETH may be in similar fiat-wealth brackets, but one is more interested &amp; invested in crypto than the other.- It is very easy to spin up a new wallet as it’s effectively just a random unique number. A single user might have 10-20 wallets with almost-zero tokens leftover, and all of their assets concentrated on one or two accounts, which further skews this stat.- A number of tokens in the network are inaccessible due to being locked in a contract or sent to a burn address. The standard ETH burn address has $250M worth of tokens.There is a lot of crypto disparity and inequality but this stat at face value is fairly meaningless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to see the methodology. I guarantee you they can&#39;t actually determine the claim.Beyond that, bitcoin wasn&#39;t designed to &#34;decentralize wealth and power&#34;, it is a disingenuous claim made by an agenda poster. Bitcoin was created to take a step towards a future where economic power is not synonymous with political power. The natural distribution of wealth is not at issue, so long as it&#39;s just that: natural."</p>

I forget who said this but someone awhile ago said in finance said that if someone is promising you consistent above-market returns it&#39;s either a scam or there is unknown or undisclosed risk.And the Crypto Andys were all like &#34;you just don&#39;t understand DeFi!&#34; to which the retort is &#34;No, you just don&#39;t understand finance&#34;.Finance is the way it is for many reasons. There are thousands of years of lessons that have made the system the way it is. I get the innovator mentality of sweeping away the old but there seems to be a fine line between innovation and ignorance.I&#39;m just sitting on the sidelines watching people relearn all the lessons of finance the hard way, some because they think they understand finance because because they understand merkle trees and consensus protocols but really most just want to get rich quick."</p>

There is also a huge spectrum between &#34;we cannot guarantee that there is 0 risk&#34; (which seems to be what the above sentence is saying), and &#34;there exists a risk that all of your funds disappears in 24 hours&#34;.It seems like there is some serious rewriting of history going on here.Question though, do the founders here have any potential criminal liability from this whole situation (including apparently lying about what they were doing with their customers funds)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m going to explain what has happened so far. What happens next entirely depends on how inflation continues and the feds reaction.1. We had zero percent interest rates. This causes the value of assets with cash flows out into the future (think speculative tech, Tesla) to accelerate.2. We had massive herding in megacap tech. These valuations are high in part because for a decade you would not have beat the index without having these names in your portfolio.3. These valuations blew up even further because of call squeezes during the 2020-2021 bull. Tesla even managed to get itself into the S&amp;P.5. Then in December, the megacaps we&#39;re squeezed further until the S&amp;P 500 had a negative return relative to price!A lot of this occured because people remained under the impression that bond yields would never normalize. Now that they have, there is a risk free alternative to stocks.Now for the next complications: Ukraine + Russia, economic war with  China, inflation, how the fed will respond, gas prices.If inflation continues and the fed becomes aggressive with hiking, all assets are dead. Bonds will be wrecked, stocks will be wrecked, cash is wrecked, even gold (depending on how aggressively they hike) will be dead because it&#39;s actually a really good deal to buy bonds when they yield north of 10% (if we get there).Say the fed decides not to hike as aggressively and inflation slows, then you&#39;ll be holding the S&amp;P 500 likely for yield than growth. In the case of a recession or further inflation, that yield may be at risk depending on the sectors you&#39;re invested in.In this context the correction in names like Target make perfect sense. The dividend was near zero at it&#39;s price before the cut. Same thing happened in a company like Newmont mining."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I would be planning to ride this thing out for at least eighteen months or more.I&#39;m betting more like three to five years.I was talking to a friend (another old guy, like me, but really rich, unlike me).We&#39;ve both been through at least two recessions (big, nasty ones, with teeth and claws). We realized that there&#39;s an entire generation of folks; many running companies, that have never seen a real bear market.It&#39;s likely they are having a shit hemorrhage, right now.The company I used to work for, was (still is) an over 100-year-old Japanese company. They lasted through a devastating war, a depression, multiple recessions, and were still around. I&#39;m hoping that they stay around. They&#39;ve made some choices that could be disastrous (I think that sidelining my team was one ;), but not the same kind a lot of companies are making now. Lots of people are leveraged to the hilt. Bad place to be, when the economy starts tanking.HODL is the word. Live cheaply, so you don&#39;t need to cash out in a trough. Don&#39;t rely on other people&#39;s money, keep debt way down, keep margins high, optimize processes, etc.Old-fashioned stuff. It worked 100 years ago, and still works today.Not everything old is bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In the early 80s, the G7 economies tightened the money supply, raising interest rates dramatically, in an effort to bring inflation under control.This article points out a similarity between the early 80s and now. So I think it&#39;s appropriate to point out a major difference as well.Consider this chart[1] which shows both the short term interest rate (Federal Funds rate) and long term interest rate (10-year Treasury yield) since 1962. Before rates started rising in the late 70s, the market was used to an interest rate between 5-10% (both long and short term), after which it rose to 15% (long term) and 20% (short term). Compare this with the current situation. Markets now have been used to 0% short term interest rates and 2-3% long term interest rates for over 10 years. The little blip you see to the far right of the chart is how much interest rates have risen so far (to 0.83% short term and 2.85% long term). If such a tiny blip (historically speaking) is the cause of the current correction, then it seems reasonable to expect that this is only a tiny part of a much greater correction that comes if interest rates get even close to the levels seen in the start 80s.[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=PIsi"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a very interesting theory, but also low-quality evidence. It merits further study, but hard to say that it merits any change in behavior just yet.As far as I can tell, the &#34;340 000&#34; person study was finally published in 2020[1]. The study was an observational analysis of 342,000 dialysis patients. There was no attempt to measure personal exposure to UV (FTA: &#34;it was not feasible to determine personal exposures to UV radiation and temperature&#34;). Rather, these exposures were approximated by dialysis center zip code.I can understand why David Fisher would say that he doesn&#39;t question the data, but doesn&#39;t agree with the implications.1 = https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.119.013837"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this article a couple years ago and it definitely influenced my thoughts on the matter.I think this is yet another case of us collectively ignoring common sense. We know that UV radiation is damaging to the skin and can cause skin cancer. Instead of rubbing chemicals on our skin to negate these effects, it is better to avoid being out in direct sunlight when the UV index is high, especially if you&#39;re super pale. If you have to go out at mid day for a decent length of time, wear a big hat and clothes that cover you up.I&#39;m on the pale end of the spectrum and if I go out at say 2pm when the UV index is at 10 it&#39;ll be physically painful within a few minutes.However, when I go for my daily walks earlier in the day or later in the afternoon when the UV index is say 3-4, I go without sunscreen and feel great. And even though I supplement vitamin D, the effects of sunlight is clearly better.Also I think it is safe to imagine that most of our ancient ancestors weren&#39;t going out in the most intense sunlight and stripping close to naked for hours to develop a nice tan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People have such a hard time with the concept of a trade-off. Life is not a video game where there is an optimal single answer for everyone every time. It’s complicated,
especially with something like biology. So place your bets: do you want possibly better blood pressure, higher incidence of melanoma, and faster aging of skin? Or do you want benefits of more sun exposure and greater risk of cancer?The answer is: it depends on your family history, your lifestyle, and a bunch of other things.I know that organizations like American Dermatology or Outdoor magazine have to water down their message so it’s digestible, but it annoys me when people expect “The Answer”. Science is constantly updating."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool pet project, admirable engineering etc.My comment is about something else: net neutrality, as someone already mentioned.I was teaching English in Laos for school kids. I was amazed that some of their families struggle with providing (nutritious enough) food for their children, yet, everyone had smartphones with always-on 4G,even in the countryside - however, no WiFi almost anywhere.The brains of these kids are like sponge. They WANT to learn, they&#39;re shy, but they want to speak, to read, to practice English. They also like to (constantly) sing (something that is badly missing from western schools), so at one point I referred them to &#34;simple English Wikipedia&#34;, where they can research their favorite singers with easy-to-process articles.Empty stares.&#34;so instead of Wikipedia.org, you go to simple.wikipedia.org.&#34;Still nothing.I had to realize later that even if they knew that this free, always available encyclopedia exists, it&#39;s NOT included in their 4G subscription.Yes, you guessed correctly: those subscriptions are sponsored by big US / Chinese corps, so all these kids had were Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and TikTok, everything else costs ~10$ which is days worth of meals for whole families there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience with in-flight message-only WiFi is that they&#39;re just really slow and the ping times are long. Some services are actively blocked, e.g. Skype wouldn&#39;t work at all even for text messages, but browsing the internet is usually allowed. My VPN wouldn&#39;t work, but I suspect it might have if I used an obfuscated connection instead of OpenVPN or whatever the default is (e.g. over SSL). I could load GMail in the browser and Wikipedia probably would have worked. It&#39;s strongly website dependent. Hacker News is extraordinarily resilient to lousy connections and generally the index would always load without any trouble. It works even on a 3 second ping over satellite internet. Very few websites are that tolerant.The flight crew (BA) knew what&#39;s up. They specifically warned us to check which package we were getting, because evidently they get a lot of complaints when people buy the message-only bundle and are surprised that nothing works.Singapore gave out free passes for single devices last time I flew with them. It was possible to rotate MAC addresses by forgetting the connection and then re-joining. The connection was quite good, you could watch YouTube in potato resolution. It&#39;s quite fun to chat to people and send them photos out of the window."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago (2012) Delta inflight wifi would allow DNS queries out without paying. Being a very frequent flyer I used to run an ip-over-dns tunnel using Iodine[1]. It was slow but worked. I wonder if they’ve blocked that hole yet.[1] https://code.kryo.se/iodine/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have tried to faithfully summarize the video here. If you notice a mistake or omission, please correct me.Rossmann’s main message: “to complain about something that is an option rather than complain about all of the options that are missing misses the forest for the trees”.Key points:1. For certain repairs, Apple’s repair program has “made availiable the exact same OEM parts and tools that they use” via rental. Renting these tools is optional and not required; Rossmann recognizes that while he (and in his opinion, most people) will likely not use these tools, their availability is a non-issue.2. Sean Hollister’s article in The Verge was highly critical of the entire self-repair process, and called out the weight and price of this completely optional tool rental. Per Rossmann, “part of the problem with tech journalism in general is… focusing on the things that are easy rather than focusing on the things that matter”.3. Rossmann reminds us that the right-to-repair fight is far from over. Board schematics and individual components are still not available even to authorized repair shops. He argues that these would enable him to more efficiently perform repairs.4. Rossmann: While the tech press’s complaints are “making the right to repair people look like… fools”, “it is important to [know] that they don’t represent us [normal repair shops and average users]”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good on Rossmann for calling out bullshit on his own side. Legitimate issues often get hijacked by do-nothing whiners, yet all too often they get ignored or even encouraged for the sake of prioritizing short term political gain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally agree with Rossmann: the more important thing is that you can lease the equipment from Apple but there is no obligation. The equipment is intended to do a job compliant with Apple standard but, if you don&#39;t care to replace the water proof sealant, etc, you can use tools you already have or more cheap from your regular sources ( hardware stores, ebay, etc). The right to repair is a serious matter, without activist like Rossmann, who spent his time to speak to the US Congress, we wouldn&#39;t even have the spare parts from Apple: this is the real vantage, not the possibility to lease the tools."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many memories. I am one of those who grew with WinXP (though I usd Win95 at school and for a few years Win98 at home), and as someone said in another comment, what else could a teen geek want besides WinXP with a bandwith connection?I still feel that seeing a XP Desktop screenshot invites to much more experiences (possibly online) than a Win10/Win11 screenshot. It may be with the fact that I associate it to different internet eras as well. With XP I used to browse websits, fansites, blogs, forums, chats, MSN messenger/Yahoo Messenger/etc, whil now everything seems to be the boring social networks where almost everything is generated/shared.Internet used to be much fun back then, and it may be the reason why most of the people have good memories about XP. I think the main reason (and I wanted to write an &#34;essay&#34; about this for a while) it&#39;s that we were offline by default in our lives, and we used to &#34;go online&#34; for a few hours durnig the day. Then you had your experience in the real world and went online to talk about them. Now it is the other way around - we live online by default, sharing photos and videos from a concert almost in real time, photos from a museum, etc. I think it took away its novelty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a former program manager on the Windows XP release so it warms my sprit when I see projects like this. Thanks for keeping the dream alive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of the hacked-up Windows XP Service Pack 3 images you&#39;d find on warez sites. I fondly remember XP &#34;Black Edition&#34; with custom themes.They also had it configured to receive the Windows XP POSReady security updates, which made the system serviceable long after the general EOL date."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most important point in this article is that whether Tether is fully collateralized ultimately doesn&#39;t matter. As long as there are well-capitalized parties (Bitfinex, other exchanges) that want to prop up Tether, it will be fine. Nobody should be under the illusion that Tether is decentralized or anything other than a bet on Bitfinex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As of this writing, on May 20th, it has yet to regain the pegThis is misleading.  Tether has consistently traded between $0.998 and $0.999 between May 13th and May 20th.  See https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/Is it trading at 0.1% lower than it was before the Terra USD collapse? Yes. Has it &#34;lost its peg&#34;?  No."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that everyone in the crypto industry is taking George Soros&#39;s approach to bubbles: “When I see a bubble, I rush in to buy it.”There is more money to be made on the gravy train of providing liquidity for trades, yield farming, etc. than in trying to short Tether and potentially bleeding out before it goes bust."</p>

NSS). The only time Chromium uses a pure BoringSSL implementation is on Android (Conscrypt)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t seen this before, you should definitely give it a try.  I am a big CLI person but I still find it useful, especially for displaying/visualizing metrics/performance.If you&#39;re on a RHEL or Fedora base, it might be already installed and running.  You just hit it on port 9090 with your web browser, and log in with your OS creds (same that you use for SSH).  If it&#39;s not installed yet and/or you want to also add performance co-pilot[1], it&#39;s pretty easy to do:    # Install cockpit and pcp and activate services
    dnf install -y cockpit pcp cockpit-pcp
    systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
    systemctl enable --now pmlogger

    # If needed, open port 9090 in the firewall
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=cockpit

    # Alternatively you can open it for just your own IP
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-rich-rule=&#39;rule family=&#34;ipv4&#34; source address=&#34;38.14.154.124&#34; port protocol=&#34;tcp&#34; port=&#34;9090&#34; accept&#39;

Here&#39;s the same commands in a gist if preferred:  https://gist.github.com/FreedomBen/62b348ed45045e53356aeb714...[1]:  https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/feature-pcp"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh hey, Cockpit; I remember when this was started. It was the Red Hat desktop team&#39;s skunkworks project to make an actual good server UI after the last few attempts failed; I can&#39;t find any evidence of it, but I swear there was this ridiculous project to generate a &#34;Linux API&#34; by automatically combining every other API and adding prefixes and headers. That came down from management since &#34;APIs&#34; were the hotness.The goal was to make in-roads on Windows Server-like deployments. &#34;Cattle, not pets&#34; was becoming uber-popular, but the thinking on the desktop team was that there was still a wide market for pets. People with toy servers, small businesses that just want a server inside their network, they all deserve UIs that don&#39;t require heavy sysadmin-ing.I think it turned out quite nicely, and it seems it&#39;s still going!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cockpit is an impressively robust “server in a box” frontend for homelabs or my favorite, running on a little ARM SBC with a USB Ethernet gadget exported.Why is this a cool setup? B/c I can carry around a little Radxa Zero that looks like a USB-C Ethernet adapter to my iPad, Windows laptop, etc., and gets powered by the same port, and gives me Cockpit on a known local IP, mDNS advert, etc.It’s a pretty good “hacking on the plane/train/mountain” setup, if you’re ever in the mood to try such a thing. :)Edit/P.S.: why not just run a VM? See above re: iPad or other locked-down device; also, exposed GPIOs are useful sometimes too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It turns out that the BBS also had a warez copy of Lotus 1-2-3 for UNIX. This was widely thought to be lost – I’m told it couldn’t compete with a more popular UNIX office suite called SCO Professional, so there were not many copies sold.I wonder if anyone still has a copy of Lotus 1-2-3/M? It was the port to the IBM mainframe operating systems MVS (nowadays known as z/OS) and VM/CMS (nowadays z/VM). [0] Not that I ever used it or saw it, but just I have become fascinated with it from reading descriptions of it. From what I understand, it is more different from 1-2-3 for DOS than the Unix or VMS ports were; the Unix and VMS ports work with character mode terminals (such as VT100 compatibles), which while rather different from the terminal model used on MS-DOS or text mode OS/2 (direct memory access to the  screen buffer), nonetheless are close enough that the bridge can be gapped–which (on Unix) is classically the job of the curses library (and its various descendants). By contrast, 1-2-3/M was written to work with the block mode 3270 terminals commonly used on IBM mainframes, which send to/from the terminal whole screenfuls of data at a time, rather than individual characters (somewhat similar, in principle, to classic HTML forms). This forced greater changes in the UI compared to the other ports, because a lot of things which are easy to implement with character mode terminals are essentially impossible in 3270.[0] https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ss..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That was awesome, but they skipped over the crucial part I&#39;m most interested in: how the heck did they rewrite and reroute the incompatible system calls and libc functions? That&#39;s probably the hardest task of it all.How would you go about it in the first place?EDIT: ah, their coffsyrup tool (https://github.com/taviso/123elf/blob/main/coffsyrup.c) with help from objdump (it&#39;s more powerful that I gave it credit for) does the relocation and patching. I would have loved to read more into that part of the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fascinating write up!Curious how piracy seems half the time to be the best form of archival for older software that was abandoned (most older software is no longer available to download even if one has a license, let alone still runs on a more modern environment, but if you have A you can try and sort out B, as this post so nicely demonstrates)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple can’t win here. If they had sent the sleek, easy to carry tools this author asked for, the author would complain about the pathetic tools they are providing.Really disappointed in The Verge on this article. Could have been a cool piece about the specific tech that Apple provides, but instead it’s framed so disingenuously that I come away not feeling particularly good about right to repair in general. It no longer sounds to me like people trying to get access to their own devices. It sounds like people taking potshots at BigCo because big co bad.By the way. The tools this guy used are common, dead-common in China. Go to any repair mall in Shenzhen and you’ll see hundreds of these.Does he actually want to repair his phone? It doesn’t seem like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading this article and the comments here makes me quite sad.1. The repair kit described here is not mandatory for anyone to rent to be able to buy the parts. You can just buy the parts alone and use whatever tools you want. If you attempt your own repair, you should use the simple ifixit style tools, and understand the higher risk of damage you are taking.2. The kit described in the article seems very decent for any kind of independent repair shop. They will probably already have pretty much the same setup.3. Right to repair is about access to documentation and parts. Nobody epects anyone to make it easy for the user to replace 512 pin BGA part. Right to repair does not mean that it should be easy to repair something, just that there shouldn&#39;t be artificial obstacles and that there should be supply of documentation and parts.4. Repairability is still an important topic and with discussing, but it is a separate issue from right to repair. E.g. I think phone makers could make replacing batteries much easier and that it would be a much smaller design compromise than some people like to claim. But that is a different topic from the baseline of right to repair.To me this seems like Apple has a good basic right to repair offering both for individuals and independent shops. This article is bad for the right to repair movement, because it doesn&#39;t understand what it is asking for.Parts. Documentation. No artificial obstacles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If made to fulfill the word of the law without actually having to follow it in spirit, this would be my modus operandi too.By designing $1200 deposit, $49 rental &amp; two Pelican suitcases of tools and manuals, while keeping the battery replacement price same at $69 (what you&#39;d normally pay in total at Store), they have entirely disincentivized self-repair without actually breaking any law.Masterstroke /s"</p>

With fd that isn&#39;t  true.So it&#39;s hard for me to justify making the move.Same thing happens with things like the fish and oil shells - I have little doubt their UX is better than Bash&#39;s, but Bash is pretty ubiquitous.Emacs has this problem too, as an Emacs user. The UX is completely alien by current standards, but if you update the defaults you&#39;ll break a lot of people&#39;s existing configs.How do you get around backwards compatibility / universality UX roadblocks like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Civil forfeiture is a direct and obvious violation of the US Constitution and shouldn&#39;t even exist under the USA legal system and is dangerous to the US legal system:&#34;Article the sixth... The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&#34;Police under the US Constitution have to go before a judge and court and make an Oath under perjury of law describing the items to be seized. There has to be a justification and supported by affirmation meaning evidence and supporting facts. In the case of the building that was seized it was operating a perfectly legal business under state law. It had the necessary licenses and permits. There needs to be a direct challenge against this type of extra-judicial seizure in the US Supreme Court as it&#39;s a clear challenge to the entire operation of the rule of law and legal system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve long had an idea for solving the civil asset forfeiture problem.It&#39;s simply this: any asset seized must go to the general fund, not into a law enforcement fund.If a local police department seizes cash or a car, that asset goes to the state. If federal law enforcement does the same, it goes to the treasury, not the FBI or ATF or the Justice Department.This small change would remove the incentive to seize assets for any reason other than stopping criminals.We also need due-process reforms, but this would be a good start. Government departments should never profit from criminal activity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Coops is one of the structures that the author talks about in &#34;Developer Hegemony&#34;. The bulk of the book is about the inverted pyramid that modern software development houses are (with production being at the bottom, and manager on top).I really like this passage:&gt; “Consider a law firm. Do the founding partners go out and hire a Lawyer Manager to order them around, and then do they hire a VP of Lawyering to order the manager around? Do they then hire a CEO to rule over everyone and a CFO to handle the finances and a COO to schedule court dates and such? Of course not. There’s no historical precedent for all that fluff. Rather, they handle facets of the business themselves. What they can’t or don’t want to handle, they delegate to subordinates that they hire. The partners don’t specialize in finance, sales, marketing, or operations. That would be silly. But they understand enough about it to act as the boss.”...and this one:&gt; “It turns out that treating knowledge work pursuits like manufacturing operations doesn’t work particularly well. But it was the model inherited from the Industrial Revolution, and it’s been hard to shake. The thinking goes like this: if you break a complex operation down to its individual components and then have people specialize in those components, batching the work and letting people get good at tiny slices of it leads to greater efficiency. This works well for stations on an assembly line but not so much for writing software.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to see this list here on which our coop startup appears! (https://kantree.io) It is very challenging to raise funds as a coop indeed but we have managed to do it on small amounts (a few hundreds of thousands). We are one of the few product based coop and not service based.France (where we are based) is actually a very interesting market for coops. There is a very good legal framework around coops and a growing percentage of them. There&#39;s even an investment fund of tech coop as of recently! https://coopventure.fr/I think coops are a great ownership model for the future and for a more responsible economy. It is too bad that there is still very little support and recognition around it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I deeply wish this was more of a thing. If you look at the way law firms work, this is how they take their specialized knowledge and keep more of the value they create for themselves. I don&#39;t see any reason we can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t have a similar model in software engineering be the de-facto now that the field is mature enough to support it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seen this kind of thing several times.&#34;Assistance&#34; programs meant to prop people up with so many reporting requirements and perverse incentives that punish you for improving your situation to the extent that the best path is to not even try to improve your situation and be entirely dependent on the program because when you do start earning income or saving anything, they take so much away from you that there is a significant cost to any amount of improvement until well after you&#39;d be self-sufficient.  i.e. it is more expensive to earn any income than it is to earn none, and the constant threat of losing support of the program (explicit threats) is much more anxiety inducing for the most vulnerable populations often than the situation they were trying to exit.Being homeless, getting into a program to help the homeless, and then constantly being threatened with a return to homelessness if somebody doesn&#39;t do the paperwork exactly right is just crazy, but I&#39;ve seen it first hand."</p>

Apparently it doesn&#39;t support Wayland, so when you run it under Wayland it offers you a &#34;Fix it!&#34; button that, when clicked, runs sed on some gdm system config files to revert it to X11 (nevermind that gdm is far from the only way to use Wayland): https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/1.1.9/src/platform.... If this is the kind of thing that&#39;s considered acceptable by the developer, I&#39;d rather keep their products far away from my machines.A quick glance at the code also reveals an almost complete lack of comments and copious use of unexplained `unsafe`."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to counter the prevailing negativity in this thread. I admire the pragmatism of this project. The developers are clearly willing to work hard to achieve what they value, such as producing a single self-contained executable on Windows. But they&#39;re also unafraid to take pragmatic shortcuts where they feel that it&#39;s OK to do so.I wonder if the fact that the original author comes from the largest non-English-speaking population in the world [1], a population large enough to have its own distinct software development culture, is relevant. I&#39;m guessing that they don&#39;t routinely participate in our English-speaking software development communities. If that&#39;s so, then they&#39;re not exposed to our norms or the constant negativity of our online discourse. Perhaps that&#39;s liberating. Perhaps we need more independent cultures, doing their own thing with no regard for what we think. In any case, for me, software developed in China, such as this project and Zoom (particularly the Windows client), provides an interesting peek into what Jimmy Maher called a mirror world [2]. It may trigger our natural discomfort with foreignness, but some of the differences from the typical American commercial software culture, such as a continued willingness to develop bloat-free native Windows apps, are refreshing.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31457771[2]: https://www.filfre.net/2017/06/tales-of-the-mirror-world-par...Edit: If anyone thinks what I said is offensive, please let me know, either publicly or privately. I tried to approach a delicate topic without offending, but I&#39;m not sure if I succeeded."</p>

Even comes with a rendez-vous system so you don&#39;t need to mess with firewalls (like you need to with VNC and such).I can&#39;t read anything on the front page though, the website shows up light-grey-on-white. Is that just me? Did the CSS fail to load somehow? Edit: never mind, the CSS sets the text color to #999 and a font weight of 200 for many elements. Apparently that&#39;s intentional. Going by the font list, I&#39;m guessing the theming was tested on macOS and made to look nice without testing if the fallback fonts were even readable in the slightest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Recycling is the most obvious way to cut down on plastic waste.I would think that the most obvious solution is to not use a material that lasts thousands of years for disposable packaging that’s only needed for a few months. Seems like these types of “revolutionary” new processes to make recycling finally work come out every year, and yet nothing changes. I can’t imagine this will be any different. As long as it’s cheaper to create new plastics than it is to recycle them, nothing will change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US sends millions of tons of trash to China, India, and other places. Perhaps it would be better for places to implement local sorting (glass, plastic, paper, etc.) and composting- as many other nations do as opposed to disposing of all trash in the same containers and shipping the problem off for someone else to deal with. But even better would be to generate less trash in the first place or at least have an attempt at transitioning to using biodegradable packaging. Packaging, which also is excessive and unecessary in the first place, like items in layers of plastic casing, plastic boxes, plastic wrapping, and so on when there are ways of distributing goods without convenient prepackaging in favor of instead refilling reusable containers or utilizing materials such as fabric, glass, or others which can be repurposed and reused more flexibly and reliably than plastic.Not even going to get into plastics being contaminated by toxic things, leaching chemicals, microplastics, affecting acquatic life, a variety of other problems relating to plastics and excessive plastic waste.I really wish people would push to decrease the production and use of plastics in the first place, seems more sustainable than trying to engineer solutions at the tail end of the issue. Seems to me much more effective to curtail the source of the problem than to attempt to implement solutions later on  although I do appreciate that some people see the issue and are working to do something about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depends on what the waste products are and how they are captured, otherwise you trade one problem for another. The plastic takes up space but if it&#39;s in a landfill you have carbon capture, best not to release that carbon into the air as CH4 or CO2."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll add my own data point into the mix. I&#39;m 49, have been married for 22 years, with kids who are either grown up, or well on their way. Throughout my life though, I have been an absolute loner in spirit. I grew up quite isolated, in the UK countryside, and learned to amuse myself early on. My first love was computers, which luckily has served me fairly well, career-wise. I haven&#39;t had many girlfriends, and felt very aware of this lack. When I met my wife, I married her more rapidly than I should have, if I&#39;m honest. I had no confidence in myself regarding my ability to form intimate attachments to women, and thought something like &#34;well if I&#39;m married, then that&#39;s that problem sorted!&#34;. Not so much.Still, we&#39;ve persevered, and made it work for 22 years. But I will soon be 50, and have chosen to view this round number as significant. I would like to start living life as I would like it, both career and relationship wise, and am currently trying to plan out what shape that might take. The stories and information in the comments here, are truly fascinating to me, the breadth of ideas being mentioned are a real breath of fresh air, and a great example of what makes Hacker News great (in my view), so thank you everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Loving families are easy to idealize from afar.How many families actually fit that profile? I’m not entirely sure.This is not a jaded attempt to say the pursuit of relationships or family aren’t worthwhile. I just want to set some context here for those feeling lonely, for those who feel like they are standing outside in the cold on the street looking through windows into warm living rooms full of people with warm feelings toward each other.I’m the only one of my siblings who has consistently been on speaking terms with either of my divorced parents. Both of my divorced parents consistently tell me they wish they could get away from their current spouses but feel it’s too late start over. Only one of my 3 siblings isn’t currently fantasizing of leaving their spouse. The mix of who in the extended family is currently speaking to whom is always in flux. Of my friends in very long term relationships that I know well enough to know if they are happy or not, about half are somewhere between resentful to  outright miserable. My grandparents divorced  when they were in their late 60s and went on to live much happier separate lives. In the hospital before my grandfather died, he insisted my grandmother should absolutely not visit him.Again, I am not saying seeking loving relationships and building a family isn’t an extremely worthwhile goal for everyone. Even given all I’ve said so far, I hope I can build one someday. It just bums me out to see people in threads like this idealizing what it means to find a partner, to have a family. It can be extremely good. It can also be extremely bad. Joining with others is not a magic spell that, on its own, fixes your life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in my mid 50&#39;s and a number of peers from different circles have all come to the same conclusion: they want to create intentional communities of friends to age with. One couple purchased several acres of land and has two friends living in a tiny house with them. Another friend is trying to raise capital to build the type of apartments/dormitories that the majority of US city-dwellers inhabitied in the late 1880&#39;s early 1900&#39;s: ones that shared a common dinner table and parlor for entertainment. Another has a B&amp;B that also serves as co-housing for 8 adults from their mid-50s to their 70&#39;s, and they share chores, which has been together for over a decade.I find this to be a uniquely western culture issue, compared to eastern asian cultures and indian subcontinent where multi-generational families mean you&#39;re never really alone.The author seems to have fallen into this void. I&#39;m sure even with everything I&#39;ve mentioned above it is still possible, but intentional or filial, the family must still grow and add new members to prevent this unique type of loneliness. I don&#39;t know how my friends&#39; intentional families will persist over the decades as they start to die, but they seem to be committed today."</p>

Why make your life harder. That is why I wrote Elder.js. Statically generate everything, sprinkle in interactivity where needed.But for internal dashboards I developed a internal framework to spit out crud apps based on nothing more than a couple graphql queries and a couple yupjs validations. It is a breeze and adding new data collection fields takes minutes so I and my team can focus on stuff that drives business value… instead of crud.As with everything picking the right tool for the job makes the job a lot easier. Don’t give into the hype one way or another."</p>

I talked about the Neuralrad Mammo Screening project and Neuralrad multiple brain mets SRS platform.

Though there are arguments that the age cut off is too high, and should be set at 40.The above is with regard to a well-funded and regulated screening program that presumably has much better precision/recall than this website. I wonder what the cut off age is for this website before the diagnoses cause more harm than good? 60? 70?This is getting lots of upvotes because it&#39;s confirmation bias for the large segment of HN readers who believe that problems would easily be solved by a small number of brilliant technologists, if only it weren&#39;t for governments and big organisations with all their rules and regulations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very important caveat for all of you who are thinking, “woo hoo, no need to buy that EuRail pass! Or to buy an expensive ICE ticket!”These tickets are good for all “Nah- und Regionalverkehr,” explicitly excluding ICE, IC, EC (international) and long-distance busses (like the one between Munich and Zürich)If the train number begins with RE or RB, you’re good, but of course, those are the slow ones that stop in every village along the way.This is for the benefit of people who live here and are struggling with 2 EUR/liter fuel, not the kind of people who blithely paid 60 EUR to take the ICE. There does not appear to be any residency requirement, but remember, you’re not the target market for this (unless you live here and are struggling with fuel prices…)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would argue making it free and keeping it free would have been a cool move.
- Less/no expensive accounting
- Less/no personnel for checking tickets
- Less/no personnel for prosecuting people who don&#39;t have tickets
- Less/no ticket vending machines (and all the maintenance that comes with it)
- Less traffic on the roads since you can&#39;t beat &#34;free&#34; and hence less emissions (at least in hamburg trains operate on green energy) and less wear on the roads (might be offset by the wear on trains and busses)
- Fully non-discriminant with respect to incomeI have no idea if that would work for inter-city transport but for inner-city transport the HVV for example (the public transportation network responsible for hamburg and surrounding areas) sells 30 million tickets a year and I wonder how much it truly costs them to do that with all the relevant factors mentioned above."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context is given here: https://www.dw.com/en/germany-introduces-9-ticket-to-offset-...The ticket is part of a support package signed off by the German parliament. The will pay approximately €2.5 billion for the ticket offer, as a response to rising energy prices and the resulting high costs of individual mobility."</p>

A welcome addition!Too bad they&#39;re not using KaTeX [0] instead.It renders the maths server-side, so there&#39;s no runtime needed.An additional bonus is that the resulting math is copy-pasteable, which in the case of disply math might not be that useful (since most equations are to complex to be meaningfully copy-pasted with unicode), but it helps from inline math dissappearing when copy pasting texts.But, that being said, I&#39;m sure they had their reasons to do so. For one, MathJax seems more well-known by quite a bit so maybe it&#39;s the safer option.1: https://katex.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s really sad that PBS ended their sister series on math, Infinite Series[1]. Those videos were just as deep, informative, and accessible as PBS Spacetime. Some of my favorites are the one on the mathematical &#34;hydra&#34;[2] and the ones on voting systems [3][4][1]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4aHmggTfFrpkPcWSaBN9g[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWwUpEY4c8o[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoAnYQZrNrQ[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhVR7gFMKNg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A channel worth subscribing. Matt (and team?) manages successfully to walk the fine line between managing the complexity of the topics they discuss (which are sometimes extremely dense), making it consumable for the population that&#39;s interested in science and physics, but doesn&#39;t pursue it on a daily basis. At the same time, they don&#39;t fall for the trap of dumbing it down to the point where the audience develops misconceptions and starts believing in pseudo scientific claims.There are some series they sometimes do, which are entertaining to follow. I also enjoy things like Journal club, where they pick a paper and deep dive into it. The audience also participates, in a way, where they pick the questions/comments from the previous video and answer them.However, it&#39;s not all academic either. There are some running jokes etc, which keep the content entertaining, while being informative, a format that I see common in some of the best Youtube channels."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot hinges on the dating of this site. How was it done?According to this article[1] (which has a nice wide-angle view of t-pillars in context), it was radiocarbon dating[1]. You find bits of stuff at the site and the isotopic composition of the carbon-containing material tells you the age based on known rates of carbon-14 decay.The actual isotopic analysis seems pretty solid.The problem is that this isn&#39;t any ordinary site. The article notes that the site appears to have been deliberately buried. This raises the question of where the samples that were dated actually came from.This critical review suggests major problems with the older-than-everything-else hypothesis for the site.[2] It notes that at least some of the samples were dated from &#34;fill,&#34; or the stuff that was used by someone at some point to bury the site. And that stuff could have itself come from sites much older than Gobeklitepe:&gt; We already discussed the problem with dating “fills” as opposed to dating “structures”. A fill’s date (no matter how confident we may fill about its actual date) in no way dates structures, as it simply can be coming from soil deposits that are either older or younger than the structure itself. You can fill your home with dirt from your yard, which could be from various geologic strata, some containing fossils from the Pleistocene. This will not make your home a Pleistocene Epoch home. Or you can currently fill a 4th century BC Temple with soil from riverbanks containing live exoskeletons; this will not render the Temple a 2000 AD structure.Even if the site wasn&#39;t deliberately buried, everything hinges on where the fill came from. The base assumption of radiocarbon dating is that no foreign material was brought in. The shakier that assumption, the shakier the claim to the ages being quoted.[1] https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14487942[2] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317433791_Dating_Go..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: I recently watched the amazing Turkish Netflix series Atiye (2019-21), in which Göbekli Tepe features centrally. The main character, Atiye, is a painter who&#39;s painted the same symbol all her life, and one day sees it in a news story about Göbekli Tepe, and feels compelled to travel there immediately. The epic story involves time travel, alternate realities, spirituality/mythology, archaeologists, academics, history, family, love etc. Also you get to see a lot of the Turkish countryside. I and the SO thought it really wonderful, highly recommended. (Warning: Season 3 is a kind of new story and loses the addictive watchableness of the first 2, but is not terrible.)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10075318/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_(Turkish_TV_series)p.s. Bir Başkadir (aka Ethos, 2020-) and Fatma (2021-) are another two excellent Turkish Netflix series.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11301642/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11961378/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"City noise pollution is a factor in all-cause mortality due to
long-term, barely perceptible stress effects on the cardiovascular
system. Unfortunately, one of the most disturbing and frequency sources
of city noise pollution is from emergency vehicle sirens.I gave a presentation at the Audio Engineering Society titled
&#34;Iatrogenic Sound&#34;, on the tragic irony of how sirens may causally
contribute to the heart attacks and strokes that ambulances are
rushing to treat.We were exploring the acoustics of urban design and the sound-design
of sirens. The sweeping &#34;wailer&#34; siren is in fact one of the worst
possible designs imaginable - all the wrong characteristics for
locatability of source, annoyance versus attention ratio, penetration
of dwellings etc. Add to that the design of modern &#34;luxury&#34; cars which
are soundproofed, fitted with anti-noise and blaring ICE systems to
block the world out.There isn&#39;t an easy solution. Most laws give police, fire and
ambulance crews &#34;discretion&#34; in the use of sirens. In the UK that&#39;s
Article 99. But here, the removal of crown immunity and insurance
pressures mean the crew now always deploy, even at times of night
when it would have previously been illegal under other laws. I expect
the same complex spheres of interest clash in NYC too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have lived in nyc for a long time both in manhattan and Brooklyn. I have never understood how these cars and bikes are allowed to roam the streets like they do openly all day and all night while police used to be so quick to arrest youngsters who jumped turnstiles or smoked weed. The asshole in the article that is quoted even has the courage to say things like they need that sound for safety of themselves and cars and pedestrians. It&#39;s 2022, ban these cars and loud bikes from city streets. Heck ban all the unnecessary cars in city centers and just use electric vehicles. The city belongs to pedestrians, not some &#34;tuff&#34; redneck gang who think they can do whatever they want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really excited about this. I live in the NYC area and I think noise pollution from vehicles is an under-appreciated problem. I think the worst impact from street noise is on sleep; even a bit of noise noticeably hurts my sleep quality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess I&#39;ll take the contrarian view here: the developer violated a reasonable Play Store policy, refused to fix the problem, and received an expected outcome.If you read the details of the Play Store complaint, you will see that they say the app was uploading information from the user&#39;s contact list without properly disclosing to the user that this was happening [1]. This is a violation of Play Store policy (a disclosure is required). It&#39;s not an unreasonable policy.You can see in the app&#39;s source code where some of this happens [2]. In short, the contact list is read off the device, email addresses associated with each contact are parsed out, and the app does HTTP requests to remote servers to get the favicon associated with each email contact domain. Note that this is the sending of information off each user&#39;s contact list (the email address domains) to those remote servers. As such, it requires a disclosure to the user.The developer&#39;s response is that he refuses to add a disclosure to the app because he is not uploading &#34;contact info&#34;. [3]. Ok... not a great response. Certainly I would expect apps to disclose whether or not they are using any information on my contact list to reach out to third-party servers, even if only domain names. In any case, it&#39;s Play Store policy.In the end, he finally removed the favicon feature. And Play agreed to allow the app back into the store.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;The policy for the first time directs that good-faith security research should not be charged. Good faith security research means accessing a computer solely for purposes of good-faith testing, investigation, and/or correction of a security flaw or vulnerability, where such activity is carried out in a manner designed to avoid any harm to individuals or the public, and where the information derived from the activity is used primarily to promote the security or safety of the class of devices, machines, or online services to which the accessed computer belongs, or those who use such devices, machines, or online services.Seems pretty reasonable.  There will be arguments over what exactly qualifies but it provides a clear guideline / reasons where someone at the DOJ can not charge someone with good reason.It hopefully side steps some of the &#34;what even is hacking / a security breach / dude just opened browser dev tools ...&#34; type questions where they can look and say &#34;He notified them of the issue, I don&#39;t think this was in bad faith.&#34;  Now you&#39;re all out of those other weeds.If anything hopefully this provides a good example to trickle down to other law enforcement agencies."</p>

Rock the boat, even legally, and you get a not so friendly 6am visit from the FBI and they steal all your possessions, all your flatemate&#39;s posessions, and ruin your life despite no laws being broken or even an indictment.Only to return the stolen goods 10 years later by shipping them unprotected in cardboard boxes so badly packaged they arrive with parts sliding around freely and a video card sticking, literally, out the side of the cardboard box where it punched though.Basically, don&#39;t believe the Justice Dept.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently bought a framework laptop for a daily driver when I&#39;m not on my desktop. For context I was running NixOS on an old 2014 macbook air, and I work on the glasgow haskell compiler in my day job so I do a lot of CPU heavy tasks.I&#39;ve got to say, as long as these things are being produced I&#39;ll never go back. They are just too good and I cannot recommend them highly enough. One of the things that didn&#39;t occur to me before I bought it was that _because_ of the modular design I can switch the side the power port is on. That may not seem like much but it was a revelation the first time I sat on the couch and thought &#34;huh I really wish this was over on that side....wait a minute!&#34;.I&#39;ve also had absolutely no problems with NixOS on my machine, even my apple earbuds easily connect via bluetooth, something that I never quite got working on my macbook.10/10 This is damn close to my dream laptop and I&#39;m excited a new version is on the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently received my first framework laptop after being a loyal Thinkpad user for years. I am loving it so far. I run Ubuntu 22.04 daily and have not had any issues with battery life or the lid (but I do typically leave it plugged in during lunch and overnight). The expansion cards are brilliant and the keyboard is comparable to my old t-series. The aspect ratio is great for coding and I&#39;m happy to see upgradeability is being taken seriously as promised. If I can get 5-10 years out of it like my old ThinkPads (all while upgrading piecewise along the way) I will be a fan for life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m happy to answer any questions around this!  We&#39;ve been working on this since update since we launched the product last year, so we&#39;re excited to be able to share it today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imo, Vangelis brought the synthesizer from an experimental novelty to an instrument for composition. The two sounds I associate with him are the long  brassy triangle with a steep envelope that we know from both Blade Runner and the accompaniment to the piano in the Chariots of Fire theme, and his effective use of chimes.I have tickets for Olafur Arnalds next week, and there is a younger generation of composers like Arnalds, Frahm, Richter, Tiersen, Aphex/James, and even Reznor/Ross, who could not have avoided Vangelis&#39; influence marrying the synth with classical techniques. He was a big part of what inspired me to start making synth music and more than a few of my tracks have homages to his work, and this note triggered a memory of playing the Chariots theme on piano as a really young child and it seemed to be everywhere at the time. A loss, but hard to mourn such an exceptional contribution as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He was a very unique, visionary talent. To back that up, beyond his scores, take a look at the following video to get a glimpse of how he worked.https://youtu.be/GWggDMDhwIAThere used to be some forum posts detailing the custom MIDI controllers and setup more, but it looks like a lot of it has been deleted or removed.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My memory holds that magical feeling, when in the mindnight darkness and quietness of home, suddenly heard a gentle stream of silver bells and a beautiful, maybe melancholic, melody from a tiny radio speaker... with no announcement of the author or name of the song. It was then just used as a last song of the day.Took me a veeery long time and other side of the globe to hear it again, again by chance, but with attribution in that case. Then some hours trying to locate the recording...La Petite Fille de Merhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P6qoTPhhv9wTruly as if having a chanceful glimpse of a Mermaid.Thank you for the magic, Master Vangelis.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They’re just one of several shiny fintech apps/websites running the same scam, a modern two-and-twenty on a ponzi — but with really nice UI.Alice (alice.co / @alice_finance) is another prominent one that may have lost customer funds, which was also using the Anchor protocol. It’s unclear how much they lost, but it’s interesting that Do Kwon’s name is still an actual logo listed on their home page.And Vertex Protocol (vertexprotocol.com / @vertex_protocol) recently raised $8.5m to launch a trading platform based on the Anchor protocol, but because their Phase 1 beta had just closed and the open launch was not planned until this summer, it looks like they may have just barely dodged the bullet?What I’m really curious about are the new and (of course) unregulated “insurance” products meant to cover catastrophic crypto depegs, as happened to Terra/Luna. Unslashed (https://app.unslashed.finance/cover) is supposed to kick in after fourteen days, I believe. We’re not quite there yet, it’s barely a week so far. But I’m sure with this kind of implied loss reserves, it’ll be fine…https://mobile.twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1416392630754..."</p>

I have no experience doing what YC does and don’t claim to, but the jig here was so transparent that the smallest drop of “street smart” should’ve been enough to set off some alarms.We’re approaching a point where being passed over for “culture fit” is a compliment. Hopefully the embarrassment is enough to expand the founder vetting checkboxes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dont like the idea of replacing the time spend compulsively procrastinating with &#34;learning a new language, getting a pet, going to the gym&#34; is the right way.I see the root cause (for me atleast (used to read HN and blogs for 4 hours everyday)) is that i cant stand being with myself.During the last two months ive been trying to not panic when i&#39;m idle. And not take out my phone or read the nearest material i can lay my hands on.Instead i try to accept the necesity of &#34;falde i staver&#34; (danish for &#39;falling out of presence&#39;). When i was a kid i would often just fall into this state and just defocus with my sight and let daydreaming take over.Basically i have a war going against effectiveness. I hold unto my right as a mammal to be inefficient and sit drooling looking at trees.My advice on &#34;doing something&#34; when you have day without plans is the following:
Bike in the forrest, coffee from thermos near the ocean, read newspapers at the library, talk to people at trainstations (the frequent hangouts are always open for conversations)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like OP isn&#39;t necessarily an addict: they have ADHD.Half the article was them complaining about poor working memory, and the rest about getting stimulation/dopamine from unhealthy sources.Everyone has &#34;a little ADHD&#34;. We all occasionally, forget things, hyperfocus on things we are excited about, etc. ADHD is the disorder of having those struggles so often it&#39;s debilitating. It stems from having an underdeveloped frontal lobe that doesn&#39;t feel dopamine as well as neurotypical brains do, meaning an ADHD brain needs more stimulus to feel healthy.Because of the deficit in stimulus, people with untreated ADHD are statistically much more likely to have a substance abuse disorder (SAD); but in many cases, treating their ADHD (with medication and cognitive behavioral therapy) has the side effect of treating their SAD.Addiction, in the public consciousness/vernacular, is more abstract than SAD: it can mean anything from chemical dependence to unwanted habits. I suspect most people tend to make a false equivalence between the former and the latter. I see all the time people struggling to change a simple habit and immediately labeling themselves &#34;addicts&#34;. I think that&#39;s a unhelpful characterization.I think the point people tend to miss is that in order to change a habit, you don&#39;t just &#34;stop doing it&#34;: you must replace it with an alternative dopamine source. This is especially tricky with untreated ADHD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It scares me how much this reminds me of myself. I don&#39;t know how I was able to keep my job (and keep the roof over my family&#39;s heads) with my habit of not being able to concentrate on work at all because the minute I need to think a bit harder I immediately switch to reading news, HN or watching YouTube, only to finish my work late in the evening to save my ass (on good days)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This “default alive” advice is repeatedly shared.One thing it obviously does not address is the human element of who you cut and whether they will be “default alive” unemployed in a recession. A huge amount of YC advice in general positions founders as protagonists and employees as NPCs then are shocked people pick Google over their startup offer.Funny thing is I’ve seen this exact advice destroy a company. In March 2020 they did deep layoffs and cited the need to be “default alive.” Then their main market surprisingly quickly grew in the rest of 2020 , they wanted to capitalize on that, but they had laid off too many engineers who knew their infra and had enough outages and slow product development that they lost to their competitors and are now way underwater on their valuation.They decided to be serious and prudent and go “default alive” which ironically killed them. Of course if 2020 had gotten worse maybe they would look smart but the takeaway is there’s no easy answers.I would just like to see the human impact of layoffs at least lightly considered in these conversations which it rarely is. And it’s bad for business to as Im sure many people are hesitant to join companies that will have a gut reaction of doing 70% layoffs. If you even think about doing 70% layoffs you clearly over hired and are not making good leadership decisions leading up to the layoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dagnabit. Here we go again - this is a fantastic, pragmatic amendment to those notes -&gt;https://dalton.substack.com/p/letter-to-myself-in-late-2008?...For a taste:&#34;Doing multiple small layoffs is a form of cascading failure. Do one layoff, but much much deeper than seems correct. Do it decisively. Do it so that you get profitable. In your case that is something like a 70% cut, not a 5-10% cut. Yes you read that right: a 70% cut. Cutting once and cutting hard allows you to reassure the people that are still here that you are truly profitable and won’t need to do it again. Doing a layoff and remaining unprofitable and counting on fundraising to save you is a stupid plan.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bleak.&#34;No one cannot predict how bad the economy will get, but things don&#39;t look good.&#34;Clif notes:- Plan for the worst ... cut costs within 30 days... get to Default Alive[0]- Get money if you need it, and if you can- With or without money you must survive 24 months- VCs are people too, and subject to the same downturn. Adjust your fund raising expectations in the same direction. Expect lower valuations, lower rounds and many fewer deals.- Disproportionate impact on international, asset heavy, low margin, hardtech, high burn, long road to revenue companies- If you get a meeting, don&#39;t take that as a good sign, we still take a lot of meetings.- Future fundraises will be much more difficult than they have been in the last 5 years.- Don&#39;t expect more money until you demonstrate product market fit.- If you planned on raising money in the next 6-12 months, we recommend changing that plan, or you may be tryng to raise at the peak of the downturn- If you survive, and your competitor does not, you may pick up significant market share.[0] http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is a superficial complaint, but I found Rust syntax to be dense, heavy, and difficult to readI&#39;m a huge Rust fan, but sort of agree. First, I dislike C-style syntax in general and find it all very noisy with lots of unnecessary symbols. Second, while I love traits, when you have a trait heavy type all those impl blocks start adding up giving you lots of boilerplate and often not much substance (esp. with all the where clauses on each block). Add in generics and it is often hard to see what is trying to be achieved.That said, I&#39;ve mostly reached the conclusion that much of this is unavoidable. Systems languages need to have lots of detail you just don&#39;t need in higher level languages like Haskell or Python, and trait impls on arbitrary types after the fact is very powerful and not something I would want to give up. I&#39;ve even done some prototyping of what alternative syntaxes might look like and they aren&#39;t much improvement. There is just a lot of data that is needed by the compiler.In summary, Rust syntax is noisy and excessive, but I&#39;m not convinced much could have been done about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like I&#39;m on the minority here, but I generally like Rust&#39;s syntax and think it&#39;s pretty readable.Of course, when you use generics, lifetimes, closures, etc, all on the same line it can become hard to read. But on my experience on &#34;high level&#34; application code, it isn&#39;t usually like that. The hardest thing to grep at first for me, coming from python, was the :: for navigating namespaces/modules.I also find functional style a lot easier to read than Python, because of chaining (dot notation) and the closure syntax.Python:    array = [1, 0, 2, 3]
    new_array = map(
        lambda x: x * 2,
        filter(
            lambda x: x != 0,
            array
        )
    )

Rust:    let array = [1, 0, 2, 3];
    let new_vec: Vec&lt;_&gt; = array.into_iter()
        .filter(|&amp;x| x != 0)
        .map(|x| x * 2)
        .collect();

I mean, I kind of agree to the criticism, specially when it comes to macros and lifetimes, but I also feel like that&#39;s more applicable for low level code or code that uses lots of features that just aren&#39;t available in e.g. C, Python or Go.Edit: Collected iterator into Vec"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This is a superficial complaint, but I found Rust syntax to be dense, heavy, and difficult to read.I&#39;m not sure this is a superficial complaint. People say the hard thing about learning Rust is the new concepts, but I haven&#39;t found that to be true at all. The concepts are easy, but the combinatorial explosion of syntax that supports them is untenable."</p>

Nothing is more frustrating than working with peers you know aren&#39;t carrying their weight.Do you want to be an engineering leader? This is what you are, regardless of your official title at your company. Engineering leaders are judged by how much better they make everyone else. You may hear the term force multiplier used. Say you are really a 10x engineer, how much more effective are you if you could improve the efficiency of 350 developers by 10%? Mentor, teach, help establish culture, make systemic changes to help your peers become more effective.Regardless, I think you&#39;re a bad fit for your current company and its culture. And yes, many of us have worked in environments, like a startup, where we knew we were critical to success.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I first started programming I was pretty lucky to get a job at a games company. My first lead was a veteran who had shipped a lot of AAA titles and he loved his war stories. He was personally interested in performance and he would often cite hardware timings for specific cpu instructions.One story he told a couple of times was about some grey beard who was before his time. The grey beard was once a legend in the company, often helicoptered into projects at the last minute to help them squeeze out the last bit of performance. His secret was he had a mental library of assembly language tricks applicable to the hardware of his day. But every few years his tricks were less and less relevant as hardware changed and compilers advanced. One day the grey beard was helicoptered into my leads project and everyone expected him to get them some gains. However, this was new hardware and none of his old tricks worked.I think of this story whenever I see jQuery popup on Hacker News. There is always a strong contingent of devs who swear by this library. But to me, they are like the old grey beard who didn&#39;t update his knowledge as the times changed. At one time jQuery allowed them to be the hero and &#34;Get Things Done&#34; faster than their competition. But times have changed.Argue with me if you must but take stories like this one for what they are worth. The writing is on the wall for jQuery. I was writing websites before jQuery existed, during the reign of jQuery and still today. If some candidate mentioned proficiency with jQuery during an interview I would be polite but internally I would note that the person might be out of touch. Not a red flag, but a yellow flag that I would follow up on. Nothing worse than bringing on a guy who claims to be senior/experienced and it turn out his old tricks won&#39;t work because they are no longer appropriate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangential, but sometimes I see people say that jQuery is dead/failed. While it&#39;s not as popular anymore, I think that&#39;s actually the perfect evolution for it. jQuery was making up for browser API shortcomings, and now many of those shortcomings have been addressed and been incorporated into browser APIs (not everything, but quite a bit)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Javascript has become so nice, now that browsers support modules.I use a module &#34;dqs.js&#34; for all my query needs. It contains only these two lines:    export const dqs  = document.querySelector.bind(document);
    export const dqsA = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document);

And use it like this:    import { dqsA } from &#39;lib/dqs.js&#39;;

    for (const rabbit of dqsA(&#39;#rabbits .green&#39;)) {
        ... do something with all green rabbits ...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working on a billing system for utility company and it was a nightmare but not for the reasons from the article.Dates are no problem, everything is billed at the end of month, quarter or year.Upgrades are downgrades are simplified, customer can legally change tariff only on predefined dates/events.Usage - yes, but exampled in the article do not even scratch the complexity of thisIdempotency is not really needed, the billing process is not continuous, it is a batch job.Cash collection is out of scope of billing software.Taxing was clear. Yes, there were multiple billable items with different tax rates, but not too complex. All customers were local.The nightmare part was:- customers can have multiple consumption locations, location can have multiple meters and customer can request to split the bill on multiple invoices or combine multiple bills to single invoice as they please- meters can be replaced at any time- meter readings are available on dates totally independent from billing cycle. Most of consumption data are mere forecasts.- when the actual consumption data is available, everything must be recalculated AND compensated (on a correction invoice showing the difference)- actual consumption data can be wrong and may be corrected at a later date, even multiple times- consumption points can be added or removed or moved to different customer at any time, but this information is only available after the fact- the prices can change mid-billing cycle for some customers but the consumption data is not available with that granularity- customer legal information (company name, address) can change mid-cycle"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at two companies in their payment systems. This post does a good job of mentioning many of the billing system challenges. I think it understates how difficult and important idempotency is to maintain at scale with multiple teams though.Additionally, it didn&#39;t mention financial regulation changes. India had changes sometime in the last few years which required whole new systems built that were specific to India customers. One example of complexity is this: does the system apply to customers who are in India or does it apply to businesses who are in India (the owners might not be)?He also did not mention fraud, which is basically uncollected spend that results in charge backs typically. If you get too many chargebacks, you&#39;ll get fined. If you get even more chargebacks, you&#39;ll get kicked off the card network and will no longer be able to accept cards within that network.Post pay (customer gets the product and pays afterwards) models are subject to more fraud, uncollected charges, etc.There&#39;s also the fun of dealing with downstream payment processors. I haven&#39;t worked with a processor or bank yet that was very reliable. Sometimes they&#39;d return 500 http codes and then process a payment, requiring manual intervention. Sometimes that happens with files of payments because most banks deal with files for transactions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well whether you add “site:.edu” or not, Google still does the thing where they just spit out a pile of extra “matches” that don’t contain your search phrase AT ALL.  Just thrown into the list, as if they have any business being there (oh wait, they do have business: Google’s business).Frankly, if it’s not reliable as a tool, it has no real value and I can’t believe it has come to this.  Imagine if every time you ran `ls` in a shell with a glob pattern, it just decided to sort of “add in” a few other files loosely based on your query (or heck, files that aren’t based on it at all)?  Oh, now imagine if `rm` did that.Sadly this happens with lots of search tools now.  Why the heck is the default state on a new Mac to funnel what you type to everything, e.g. I searched for “Chrome” and hit Return and the FIRST thing it did was throw me into the App Store and call up some not-even-a-web-browser scam app with Chrome in its name, instead of selecting the Chrome already installed on my computer and opening it?  More and more it seems that you have to turn off all kinds of poor defaults to put tools into a useful state, or there is simply no way to get them there at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nitpicky but the tire changing page doesn&#39;t actually fit your rational for choosing .edu pages&gt;Professors are paid generous salaries to share knowledge with the paying customers of the University (students). So, let’s find some paid unpaid University knowledge on how to change a tire by using our new trick!But the bottom of the page says&gt;Prepared by: [students] For Dr. Bruce Magee&#39;s English 303 (Technical Writing) Class, Winter 1997-1998.The professor is actually an English professor and the page was written by students as an assignment. I looked into this because I was wondering, &#34;what would a professor be teaching that he&#39;s writing notes on tire changing?&#34;. There&#39;s probably some professor out there that does that in an academic context, but there&#39;s probably a lot of things that no professor actually gets paid to write about. Maybe they would write about something miscellaneous like that anyway and put it online, but they would be doing so out of the culture of web savvy professors having personal pages where they upload stuff they think is helpful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not a Google problem, it&#39;s a web problem.Everything is based around SEO spam. If someone has a website, and they&#39;re producing content, their point is to monetize the browsing of the website itself, or promote their main product via the website.This incentivizes a certain kind of content, which is marketing content.These days I&#39;m back to searching social networks like Reddit or Hacker News for (at least somewhat) unbiased information.Google is a fuzzy-search address bar at this point for me."</p>

Apple Silicon currently can&#39;t compete with Nvidia GPUs in terms of raw compute power, but they&#39;re already way ahead on energy efficiency. Training a small deep learning model on battery power on a laptop could actually be a thing now.Edit: I&#39;ve been informed that for matrix math, Apple Silicon isn&#39;t actually ahead in efficiency2.) Apple Silicon probably will compete directly with Nvidia GPUs in the near future in terms of raw compute power in future generations of products like the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, which is very exciting. Competition in this space is incredibly good for consumers.3.) At $4800, an M1 Ultra Mac Studio appears to be far and away the cheapest machine you can buy with 128GB of GPU memory. With proper PyTorch support, we&#39;ll actually be able to use this memory for training big models or using big batch sizes. For the kind of DL work I do where dataloading is much more of a bottleneck than actual raw compute power, Mac Studio is now looking very enticing."</p>

Almost all technology of any kind selects in favor of aesthetics over equal access.I have moderate amblyopia and severe astigmatism.  For a frame of reference, I only barely pass the driver’s license vision test when I renew my license (don’t worry I don’t actually drive).My vision has good days and bad days.  My ophthalmologist thinks that I frequently have eye strain from looking at screens which further (temporarily) degrades my vision.Examples that I’ve run into _in the last 24 hours_.  - Why can’t I choose the colors of web sites and applications?

  - Why can’t I change the default system font for my iPhone or my Mac?

  - Why can’t I change the font size in modern video games?

  - Why do most desktop applications fall of the edge of the screen below 1080p?

Further, Medium prevents their users from selecting black text as a choice. While Medium’s “Fischer-Price-simple” content creation is easy to use, it is also extremely limited, and fails in accessibility in areas beyond color. Perhaps this article can serve as a wake up call regarding this issue.So - why on EARTH are you publishing there?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can tell you why people still use ncurses: if you’re actually interested in accounting for all the nuanced eldritch madness that is terminal emulation implementation and history it’s a monumental effort, at least imo.Sure, if all you care about is coloring text on recent terminals, I do think just using ansi codes is fine.However, I completely disagree with the assertion that hardcoding ansi codes is somehow “more readable” than using a well-named API call that abstracts such detail away from the user. Maybe I’m alone in this, but I really don’t want to waste brain space memorizing ansi codes. Yeah I can write my own library or little macros to do this but…why? If I’m doing anything more involved than coloring text why wouldn’t I just pull in the lib I need? There’s no way in hell I want to maintain a custom implementation of terminal cursor movement for kicks. I’d much rather reach for a battle tested library that scores of other devs have already used and improved upon, whether it’s ncurses or one of the more modern TUI libs.Also, it’s become cool recently to hate ncurses for some reason. Are there things ncurses should do differently from today’s perspective? Sure. Is it’s api awkward to use in the face of modern programming features and paradigms that we’re now used to? Sure. But on the whole it’s design is really solid and it has plentiful documentation. Whenever I see rants like this I get the impression the author is a person that lacks an appreciation for history and the way technical development proceeds in general and imagines they are our technical savior, come down from the heavens to enlighten all us blindered fools about how terrible X is.If you want to educate people about ansi codes, great.

I didn&#39;t want to re-invent the wheel on formatting source code, so looked at all the existing libraries. Originally I figured formatting to HTML, and then building a print-friendly HTML render would work. But this proved super challenging. I tried a dozen HTML engines (including Chromium) but none gave me enough control to render just a single page of the original source file.Then I noticed Pygments, a Python-based library for pretty formatting source code, has an option to output an ANSI formatted file. I quickly found a bunch of libraries that could render ANSI formatted text to a print canvas.In the end, I put the original source code file through &#39;pygmentize -16m -o tempfile.an` (`16m` is the 16M color terminal ANSI formatter) and pipe the `tempfile.an` through a print-optimized renderer to actually print the source code.ANSI escapes FTW![1] WinPrint - https://github.com/tig/winprint

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems not to be aware of the recent TUI rennaisance[1]. There are libraries like termbox and blessings (python) that are a middle-ground between full ncurses and adding your own ansi codes. There are a lot of modern TUI frameworks like tui-go or tui-rs that bring common GUI conventions back to the TUI (heck there are TUI programming libraries that are designed to be similar to react) - these too tend to be a lot nicer than working with ncurses.Definitely worth checking out the full landscape these days if you&#39;re going to dive into making your console programs prettier.[1] My words, I just coined that name (although I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if others had said it too). I mean that in the last ~decade there has been a lot of TUI work in the background, with lots of new programs and some pretty stunning results. I blame unicode - once the web folks realized they could use something like font-awesome instead of sprite-sheets (or maybe as a pre-build sprite sheet?), and the &#34;icons in a font&#34; movement took hold, terminal programs got a lot prettier too. It makes sense, its the same font/font renderer provided by the system no matter if the app is a browser or terminal emulator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wowsers. This is a step change in quality compared to SOTA. I suspect that without evaluating samples as a correlated group, distinguishing between the generated samples and those recorded from a human will be little better than a coin toss.And even when evaluating these samples as a group, I may be imagining the distinctions I am drawing from a relatively small selection that might be cherry-picked. Nevertheless:The generated samples are more consistent as a group, and more even in quality, with few instances of emphasis that seem (however slightly) out of place.The recorded human samples vary more between samples (by which I mean the sample as a whole may be emphasized with a bit of extra stress or a small raising or lowering of tone compared to the other samples), and within the sample there is a bit more emphasis on a word or two or slight variance in the length of pauses, mostly appropriate in context (as in, it is similar to what I, a non-professional[0], would have emphasized if I were being asked to record these).In general for a non-dramatic voiceover you want to maintain consistency between passages (especially if they may be heard out of order) without completely flattening the in-passage variation, but tastes vary.Conclusion: For many types of voice work, these generated samples are comparable in quality or slightly superior to recordings of an average professional. For semi-dramatic contexts (eg. audiobooks) the generated samples are firmly in the &#34;more than good enough&#34; zone, more or less comparable to a typical narrator who doesn&#39;t &#34;act&#34; as part of their reading.[0] Decades ago in Los Angeles I tried my hand at voiceover and voice acting work, but gave up when it quickly became clear that being even slightly prone to stuffy noses, tonsillitis and sore throats was going to pose a major obstacle to being considered reliable unless I was willing to regularly use decongestants, expectorants, and the like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best solution to getting past the anxiety/fear-avoidance cycle is to take small, manageable actions while accepting the feelings that go along with those actions.Start with the smallest steps possible. Maybe that means opening the assignment and saving it to your computer. Then put it down and walk away. Come back in a little while and take another small step, such as reading over the assignment or making an outline of what you need to do to get it done. Often once you&#39;ve done something you will often start to feel a lot different than if you&#39;ve done nothing.Keep track of how you&#39;re feeling. It&#39;s okay to feel more anxiety at first because you&#39;re doing something instead of nothing. Those feelings tend to subside over time as you take action, but the point is not to reduce your anxiety, the point is that you are making a commitment to do something in your life, to live your life, rather than to remain paralyzed in fear. Your goal is not to get rid of the anxiety but to live the kind of life you want to live.This is the model for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. A great book on this is &#34;Get Out of Your Mind and into Your Life.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a slow process, but:1. Regular written self-reflection, i.e., keeping a journal and2. Re-framing &#34;failures&#34; as learning experiences; forgive yourselfhelped me a lot.The written part was important to me because it forced me to revisit my previous thoughts and reevaluate them in light of what had happened since last time I wrote.(2) also helped me do things with the mind-set that &#34;failure&#34; wasn&#39;t actually failure.  The goal was to try and learn from it.I didn&#39;t get around to doing this until after school, but I wish I had.  In your situation, I&#39;d try to get myself to do the assignment with a quick pass early on leaving notes for things I wasn&#39;t sure about.  Take a break, then revisit and revise.  Afterwards, write in your journal what worked well and what didn&#39;t.  Write about what you want to try next time differently if some things come to mind.Hope you find a solution that works for you.  E-mail is in my profile if you want to talk more about what&#39;s worked for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been through the same cycle for many years (I can even say decades). My recommendation is to seek help from a psychiatrist. You probably have generalized anxiety disorder and it often goes hand in hand with depression. A psychiatrist will be able to diagnose those and give you medication if you need it. She could also recommend therapy, but you need to be diagnosed first.Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a good mental health professional. You&#39;ll have to try many before finding a good one. Plus you will procrastinate of course. But you need to persist and make this task your priority. I know the pain you&#39;re going through, and nothing should be more important than ending the suffering right now. Once you get better you&#39;ll wish you had sought help sooner.From my research and my experience, there are two effective treatments for anxiety and depression backed by scientific evidence: antidepressants and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.The other comments are well intentionned but most of them are basically asking you to change your mindset and just do it. Obviously, if it was that easy you would have done it already. Anxiety and depression don&#39;t allow you to think clearly, that&#39;s why it is extremely difficult to get out of it on your own."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a long-time small phone Android user. But after the Pixel 5, I have not been able to find a suitable small Android replacement. The Pixel 6 is gigantic, and the Pixel 7 looks like it is also destined to be huge. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve resorted to using an iPhone Mini, biding my time and hoping desperately that some Android OEM would step up.But it’s increasingly clear that a small premium phone is not on the roadmap. So I’ve decided to take matters into my own hands. My goal with https://smallandroidphone.com is to rally other fans of small phones together and put pressure on Google/Samsung/Anyone to consider making a small phone.I have a very specific set of skills and industry connections that I have acquired over a long career in the hardware business (my first startup was Pebble). I will put them to use in our shared quest to get the perfect small Android phone. If no one else builds one, and enough people sign up...maybe I will be forced to make it myself.If you want a small premium Android phone, this may be your last chance (ever?) to help bring back the phone category that we love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi Eric, I&#39;m a hardware startup guy myself (our paths have crossed) with the distinction that my own &#34;very specific set of skills&#34; has been honed at smartphone megacompanies and smartphone startups.  OSOM, Essential, HTC, Samsung, Apple.  I&#39;ve designed and built a lot of phones.  I&#39;m building one now.  I think this is a noble effort, I personally prefer pocketable phones too, but I think there are nigh-insurmountable hurdles in your paths forward.- 1. Supply chain / component R&amp;D -You will be very, very hard pressed to source a pre-existing, high quality, non-exclusive 5.4&#34; display with a hole punch.  If you end up doing this as your own startup then you&#39;re going to start by trying to buy off the shelf parts to keep costs down.  But that display you want is simply not on any of the development roadmaps for the major component manufacturers.  The industry has its own momentum, and the component suppliers have also been looking at the trendlines so they are building bigger and bigger.If you can&#39;t find the screen you want in a catalogue then you have to pay someone to build it.  Convincing BOE et. al that your phone will sell enough to pay off R&amp;D costs is unlikely, so be prepared to pay several million bucks in NRE to make it worth their time (it might still not be) and the wait a year for them to spin up the fabs.  So ~$5M and 9-18 months later you have a display.- 2. Big players are uninterested, not uninformed -Big companies are drowning in market data.  They know some people really, really want small phones. But it&#39;s a long-tail opportunity they&#39;re willfully ignoring, and people who need phones will still buy something even if reluctantly.  I&#39;ve been in the meetings, small phone advocacy goes nowhere.Also I&#39;m a little surprised you&#39;re hoping an online petition will work after your prior experience trying to influence your acquirers.  I presume you saw the inside of Fitbit / Google and how decisions are made..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“matching size and design of iPhone 13 Mini”So, by all accounts, the iPhone mini has been an extremely slow seller.https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/21/iphone-13-mini-unpopula...Why would that form factor succeed in the Android space?---I see these meme on tech sites all the time: “oh phones are too big I just want something simple”. That is a valid sentiment that I think is shared by basically no average consumer. For a lot of people, phones are their primary computing devices, so a big screen is nice there. Bigger phones allow for more battery capacity. Aging populations like them because you can use screen zoom features to really blow up that text size without making the effective viewport too small.And…people just like big stuff. I know that’s simplistic and a little condescending, but then look at SUV and truck sales."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing, just two days ago I was searching for a polar arrangement tool in Inkscape. FOSS tools are often worse from a UI/UX perspective, sure, but I contend that they usually provide something consumer commercial tools often don&#39;t: respect for users. I&#39;m not necessarily talking about welcoming communities here - respect can take the form of, say, not engaging in hostilities like:
- The sword of Damocles that is renting software. Can&#39;t pay? Can&#39;t access your data. Or worse, it&#39;s gone.
- Developed-country-centric pricing models/heavy focus on newer hardware.
- Locking you out of creative uses of the software - either our way or the highway
- Effectively forced TOS or pricing changes
- Unexplained bans/AI moderation/guilt by association/becoming subject to laws not relevant to your jurisdiction
- Forced upgrades breaking workflows or removing features
- Corporate bankruptcy/&#34;amazing journey&#34;/sales/pivots/mergers/etc ruining your investment
- Misfeatures such as nag screens, dark patterns, engagement boosters (time wasters), unclear data collection...
- Opaque bug submission channels, limited to no access to the engineers building the thing
- Optimizing for revenue, not usefulnessThere is a feature count/learning curve price for this, I will readily admit. Sometimes, untenably so. My claim is simply that FOSS tools are important as a backstop/foundation.I feel that any problem solved exclusively by proprietary software is only solved temporarily and for a tiny percentage of the world population. If the company goes away or the IP otherwise becomes inactive, that&#39;s it. Especially with cloud software. With FOSS, the software never really goes away. The problem mostly stays solved, and anyone can resume the work if they are willing and able. I&#39;d imagine a forked FOSS version of Win2k, VB6, or maybe the late-2000s Google indexer (bit of a stretch) would be quite successful today, for example. Guess I&#39;ll never be sure of that.Just musing after a beer and some Red Vines - I welcome any criticism or kindred spirits."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see the project moving along, but it&#39;s been a persistent feeling of mine that FOSS is starting to get left behind in the dust. The design space has been very rapidly moving towards online, live collaboration tools like Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, etc and FOSS just has no answer for this market. Even a lot of the big name proprietary tools are finding themselves becoming rapidly obsolete in a world where people want to IM a link and just have it reflect the latest version rather than attaching files back and forth.It&#39;s not even clear how FOSS would even work in this market or how it would benefit the user when it would be hosted all on someone else&#39;s server with self hosting diminishing the ease of collaboration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Inkscape documents can now hold multiple pages , which are managed by the new Page tool&gt; Layers and objects dialog merged&gt; Redesigned Export dialog with preview and ability to select objects/layers/pages and even multiple file formats to export toIs it my birthday? Holy moly, those are like three of my biggest dream changes to Inkscape. I think I might need to start donating."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you go this route, please make sure your system is robust and ready to go before meetings.We had to ask one employee to go back to his reliable built-in webcam because every other meeting started with 2 minutes of him getting his camera turned on, messing with audio inputs, getting his microphone boom in place, and fighting other quirks. He also had a tendency to drop out of long meetings when his camera overheated, at which point it was another 1-2 minutes of messing around with the camera setup.If you&#39;re going to do this, it must be reliable and ready to go before meetings. Don&#39;t be the person fighting with expensive equipment all the time just to get a marginally better image for your highly compressed Zoom video stream. This isn&#39;t a Twitch stream. We just want to talk and get down to business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Protip: if your goal is to use your smartphone as a webcam, check out this:  https://vdo.ninjaWritten by some guy named Steve, it’s an incredible piece of web software that uses WebRTC to stream phone audio and video as an OBS input. OBS then features a virtual webcam capability to take that stream and make it a webcam. I can then also use OBS to do whatever processing I want, e.g. making my webcam also contain a screen share or whatever else.It’s trivial to then load up multiple instances for multi-angle scenes in OBS, then cut between the two. For example, you could have one ‘face’ camera and one ‘page’ camera showing paper on your desk and make a 2nd scene with the ‘page’ camera as the primary and a small PIP view of your face.It goes much farther than just being an input for OBS, though. For example, it can create video chatrooms of multiple participants with URL parameter configuration and without touching OBS (indeed that’s now one of its primary use cases).I use it to stream applications/webpages with my partner when we’re apart so we can watch a movie together by creating a high res vid/stereo audio input with no noise cancelling as the movie, then have her and I connect as lower quality, mono+noise cancelling participants. Each of us receives the video and audio of the movie, but only the audio of each other.There’s heaps of parameters to control video and audio quality, buffering, etc. - just about anything you need.I stumbled across it when I was trying to get my iPhone to be a webcam early on in the pandemic. There’s multiple apps for that purpose - many paid - but this was so easy and worked so well that it blew them out of the water from a capability perspective.I know I sound like a shill but honestly I’m just a huge fanboy. It’s one of those web apps that does a job really bloody well, with heaps of flexibility and extensibility. I’m genuinely impressed with it and all the hard work Steve’s clearly put in.The docs explain a lot of its capability: https://docs.vdo.ninja/Flick through the how it works and use cases pages, they’ll explain it far better than me.Guides that show sown of the advanced capability: https://docs.vdo.ninja/guides"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an alternative approach that I discovered recently while building a microscope with a webcam driven by linux.Nearly all modern cheap webcams are UVC-compatible and they work with linux.  Different models expose different functionalities, but I ended up with this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R489K8LIt does 1600x1200 25FPS YUYV (as well as a wide range of other resolutions and FPS) uses the C/CS-mount lens standard (easy to buy a wide range of high quality lenses).  It doesn&#39;t have a microphone but you should be using an independent mike anyway. Has software control of exposure color temp, and gain, which is great for various lighting conditions.You read the data through USB, not HDMI.  The one thing I haven&#39;t managed to do is autofocus, but imho, for webcams you want to set a fixed focus around your head anyway.Works with all video conference programs, and OBS studio (I actually import the video in OBS and then create a virtual camera)."</p>

Kudos to the developer for these."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an impressively well stripped down app. It&#39;s all I ever wanted from OmniOutliner (remember when it shipped with OS X?).Unfortunately, I&#39;ve been drawn in by the linking functionality in Roam/Logseq and cannot go back to a simple outliner, though this makes me want to.I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a fan of the animated cursor while typing. It somehow makes the typing feel slower, like it takes some physical effort for the cursor to push forward."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulations on the release! It’s cool to see more outliners with multi-item text selection. The “fluid” animations look really delightful — I’m jealous! I know you’ve shared some details about the animation implementation, but I’m curious about how much system stuff you take advantage of. Is your view accessible through VoiceOver? What parts of the Cocoa text system do you use (or, what do you use instead for layout and shaping)? (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Te...)I think you started working on this around the time I was working on multi-block text selection in Notion. I remember seeing a preview tweet in a Andy Matuschak thread and thinking “great minds!”. When I started working on it, I was so surprised that no outliner I tested had multi-item text selection! It’s a unique fusion. I’m curious about how you handled deletions across different indent levels… Do you know of any other outliners with it besides Bike and Notion?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is kind of funny because the SEC is basically saying Nvidia held their share price artificially high by doing this, but Nvidia also bought back billions of their own shares, by this logic they were overpaying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The SEC’s order also finds that NVIDIA’s omissions of material information about the growth of its gaming business were misleading given that NVIDIA did make statements about how other parts of the company’s business were driven by demand for crypto, creating the impression that the company’s gaming business was not significantly affected by cryptomining.The SEC’s order finds that NVIDIA violated Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the disclosure provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The order also finds that NVIDIA failed to maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, NVIDIA agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a $5.5 million penalty.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay, I love C so of course I had to take a look. The buzzwords are impressive, with all the testing and CI and so on, really nice, modern and ambitious.I dove into the code, literally looking at the first true part of the implementation in array/sc_array.h.Two observations, from probably less than tree minutes of reading:1. The nomenclature with &#34;sc_array_term()&#34; as the destructor (the opposite of sc_array_init()) was new to me; I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a real problem but it&#39;s at least adding friction in a way. I would have expected sc_array_free(), but that seems to be internally used as an alias for the standard function free(). Very confusing, since that name (sc_array_free()) then leaks into the source but it has the feeling of being meant for internal use.2. I wonder if this has a bug:    /**
     * Deletes items from the array without deallocating underlying memory
     * @param a array
     */
    #define sc_array_clear(a) \
    do {                                                                   \
      (a)-&gt;cap = 0;                                                  \
      (a)-&gt;size = 0;                                                 \
      (a)-&gt;oom = false;                                              \
    } while (0)

In my experience, when you want to clear a dynamic array but keep the allocated memory, the &#39;capacity&#39; (&#39;cap&#39;, here) field should not be cleared. I think this will leak memory if an array is grown, cleared, and then re-filled since the sc_array_add() function will see a zero capacity, and allocate new storage.Just my inflation-devalued SEK 0.02, and I did not run the code, I just read it very quickly. Corrections welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I got more into C programming, I started looking for data structure libraries. Found a few [0]. Also evaluated sc, but it had too much pre-processor magic for my taste. It also bundles random &#34;stuff&#34; like a URI parser, a thread abstraction, etc.Eventually I rolled my own [1] more focused library. It&#39;s basic and portable.0: https://begriffs.com/posts/2020-08-31-portable-stable-softwa...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good stuff. I may make use of the .ini parser as my current one doesn&#39;t handle sections.There are a growing number of stand alone support modules in my projects that I need to publish as a collection some day.  Here&#39;s a couple links to some of them:- https://github.com/WickedSmoke/faun/tree/master/support- https://github.com/xu4-engine/u4/tree/master/src/supportThese include more exotic stuff like a grid based field-of-view calculation and a version of the sfxr synthesizer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So spammers have latched onto your search engine because they are getting useful results.  They are able to systematically discover websites built on certain platforms that allow users to post content containing links, which they can target for link spam.  It is very difficult to fight this on a technical level because there is an entire industry built around blackhat SEO, with all kinds of softwares and services dedicated to thwarting your defensive efforts.  Even Google struggles to keep up with this.However, they are also systematically feeding you their footprint lists.  I imagine you could put together a footprint blacklist pretty quickly, and just stop returning results for any obvious spam queries like those containing &#34;powered by wordpress&#34;.It&#39;s not a very elegant solution I&#39;ll admit.  It won&#39;t stop the bots from trying, and you may have to circle back periodically to add new footprints as they surface.  But it&#39;s a potentially quick and easy way to stop rewarding their efforts, and the blackhat world is pretty used to burning out their resources so hopefully they will figure out it&#39;s a dead end and move on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since everyone in this thread wants to jump down OP&#39;s throat about the quality of his web site, another interesting search engine is millionshort.com, which allows you to filter out the top N web sites from the results of your search. It&#39;s a great tool for looking past sites with good SEO; all you have to do is fiddle with the value of N.For example, searching for &#34;electronic music box&#34; as /u/ajnin suggested, with the top 100K web sites removed from the results, filters out the following:&gt; These 23 sites were removed from your results:&gt;     alibaba.com (1 result removed)&gt;     aliexpress.com (1 result removed)&gt;     allaboutcircuits.com (1 result removed)&gt;     amazon.com (2 result removed)&gt;     apple.com (1 result removed)&gt;     bestreviews.com (1 result removed)&gt;     ebay.com (1 result removed)&gt;     etsy.com (2 result removed)&gt;     facebook.com (1 result removed)&gt;     instructables.com (2 result removed)&gt;     lightinthebox.com (2 result removed)&gt;     lumberjocks.com (1 result removed)&gt;     mapquest.com (1 result removed)&gt;     reverb.com (1 result removed)&gt;     twitter.com (1 result removed)&gt;     wikipedia.org (1 result removed)&gt;     yelp.com (1 result removed)&gt;     youtube.com (2 result removed)And the top result ends up being https://midiguy.com/."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This made me curious to try that search engine so I typed &#34;electronic music box&#34; (first thing that came to mind). As far as I can tell none or the 10+ pages of results include all those 3 words. I mean, you might not have any relevant sites in your database (likely if there are only 1000 sites or so as another of your blog posts imply), and I understand you want to show some result to the user, but if I want irrelevant links I might as well go to google.com..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So this one is a tough one for me, because Yuri has certainly spent significant time with Julia and I think he&#39;s a very competent programmer, so his criticism is certainly to be taken seriously and I&#39;m sad to hear he ended up with a sour opinion.There&#39;s a lot of different issues mentioned in the post, so I&#39;m not really sure what angle to best go at it from, but let me give it a shot anyway. I think there&#39;s a couple of different threads of complaints here. There&#39;s certainly one category of issues that are &#34;just bugs&#34; (I&#39;m thinking of things like the HTTP, JSON, etc. issues mentioned). I guess the claim is that this happens more in Julia than in other systems. I don&#39;t really know how to judge this. Not that I think that the julia ecosystem has few bugs, just that in my experience, I basically see 2-3 critical issues whenever I try a new piece of software independent of what language it&#39;s written in.I think the other thread is &#34;It&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s expected to work&#34;. I think that&#39;s a fair criticism and I agree with Yuri that there&#39;s some fundamental design decisions that are contributing here. Basically, Julia tries very hard to make composability work, even if the authors of the packages that you&#39;re composing don&#39;t know anything about each other. That&#39;s a critical feature that makes Julia as powerful as it is, but of course you can easily end up with situations where one or the other package is making implicit assumptions that are not documented (because the author didn&#39;t think the assumptions were important in the context of their own package) and you end up with correctness issues. This one is a bit of a tricky design problem. Certainly adding more language support for interfaces and verification thereof could be helpful, but not all implicit assumptions are easily capturable in interfaces. Perhaps there needs to be more explicit documentation around what combinations of packages are &#34;supported&#34;. Usually the best way to tell right now is to see what downstream tests are done on CI and if there are any integration tests for the two packages. If there are, they&#39;re probably supposed to work together.To be honest, I&#39;m a bit pained by the list of issues in the blog post. I think the bugs linked here will get fixed relatively quickly by the broader community (posts like this tend to have that effect), but as I said I do agree with Yuri that we should be thinking about some more fundamental improvements to the language to help out. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t really say that that is high priority at the moment. The way that most Julia development has worked for the two-ish years is that there are a number of &#34;flagship&#34; applications that are really pushing the boundary of what Julia can do, but at the same time also need a disproportionate amount of attention. I think it&#39;s overall a good development, because these applications are justifying many people&#39;s full time attention on improving Julia, but at the same time, the issues that these applications face (e.g. - &#34;LLVM is too slow&#34;, better observability tooling, GC latency issues) are quite different from the issues that your average open source julia developer encounters. Pre 1.0 (i.e. in 2018) there was a good 1-2 year period where all we did was think through and overhaul the generic interfaces in the language. I think we could use another one of those efforts now, but at least that this precise moment, I don&#39;t think we have the bandwidth for it. Hopefully in the future, once things settle down a bit, we&#39;ll be able to do that, which would presumably be what becomes Julia 2.0.Lastly, some nitpicking on the HN editorialization of the title. Only of the issues linked (https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/41096) is actually a bug in the language - the rest are various ecosystem issues. Now, I don&#39;t want to disclaim responsibility there, because a lot of those packages are also co-maintained by core julia developers and we certainly feel responsibility to make those work well, but if you&#39;re gonna call my baby ugly, at least point at the right baby ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything has correctness issues somewhere. Julia ships an entire patched version of LLVM to fix correctness bugs in numerical methods. It has its own implementations of things like software-side FMA because the FMA implementation of Windows is incorrect: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/43530 . Core Julia devs are now the maintainers of things like libuv because of how much had to be fixed there. So from those three points, that clearly points out tons of cases where Python, R, etc. code is all incorrect where Julia isn&#39;t.I think what&#39;s interesting about Julia is that because the code is all Julia, it&#39;s really easy to dig in there and find potential bugs. The standard library functions can be accessed with @edit sum(1:5) and there you go, hack away. The easier it is to look at the code, the easier it is to find issues with it. This is why Julia has such a higher developer to user ratio. That has its pros and cons of course. It democratizes the development process, but it means that people who don&#39;t have a ton of development experience (plus Fortran or C knowledge) are not excluded from contributing. Is that good or bad? Personally I believe it&#39;s good in the long run, but can have its bumps.As an aside, the author highlights &#34;for i in 1:length(A)&#34;. I agree, code should never do that. It should be `eachindex(A)`. In general things should use iterators which are designed for arbitrary indexing based on iterators. This is true in any language, though you&#39;ll always have some newcomers write code (and documentation) with this. Even experienced people who don&#39;t tend to use arrays beyond Array tend to do this. It&#39;s an interesting issue because coding style issues perpetuate themselves: explicitly using 1-base wasn&#39;t an issue before GPUs and OffsetArrays, but then loop code like that trains the next generation, and so more people use it. In the end the people who really know to handle these cases are the people who tend to use these cases, just like how people who write in styles that are ARM-safe tend to be people who use ARM. Someone should just run a bot that opens a PR for every occurrence of this (especially in Base), as that would then change the source that everyone learns from and completely flip the style."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a long-time member of the Julia community and had a discussion with the author about these issues a long time ago – but did not give feedback on the post. Let me first state that Yuri is a great person and was a valuable member of the community. He pushed the boundaries of the language and produced some very nice packages in his time. His concerns are genuine and should be respected and discussed in that context.Also, let me say that encountering these kinds of bugs is not something I have had experience with. But, I tend to be very conservative with my usage of libraries and fancy composition.If I had more experience with programming language theory and implementation, perhaps I would have a better name to describe the source of the issues described. My attempt is to call it “type anarchy”. The way I see it, there is not a clear way to assign responsibility for correctness. In the case of the array used in the post, is it the fault of the implementer of the `sum` function (without a type signature, as it should be) or implementer of the data structure? I am honestly not sure. But as Julia breaks news ground with its type system and multiple dispatch, this could very much be an open question."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Parag apparently lost his patience with superficial and misleading claims about Twitter spam (like this analysis) and posted about it today.You can see it here (https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1526237578843672576).Noteworthy highlights:* Twitter estimates its &lt;5% number from human analysis of multi-thousand user random samplings of mDAU* Twitter allows that number to remain so high to avoid introducing friction like captcha into real users&#39; experiences* Twitter uses all sorts of internal private data in its analysis* Parag says you cannot get a reliable indication of bot/not bot without this internal private dataHaving just finished building a Twitter analysis tool, I agree with Parag that the Twitter API doesn&#39;t provide sufficient clarity to make decisions about spam. This article&#39;s analysis doesn&#39;t hold up - just because you can name several features you&#39;re going to use to generate a spam confidence score about an account does not mean that spam confidence score will have any precision."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this post means as much as people are acting like it does.The indicators of being a spambot they have in their post seem VERY iffy to me. &#34;Not tweeting in the past 120 days&#34;, &#34;Location set to a non resolving location&#34;, &#34;Small number of followers&#34;, &#34;default profile image&#34;, &#34;No URL in bio or non-resolving URL in bio&#34;, &#34;Not on many lists&#34;, &#34;tweets in a different language than the person they&#39;re following&#34; - Those all seem like extremely weak signals to me. My profile matches 6 of those, and I&#39;m a human. I would like to see them hand-verify a subset of their results and see if their algorithm matches reality.Also note that they define &#34;active&#34; differently than Twitter. They define &#34;active&#34; as having tweeted recently. Twitter gives spambot numbers as a percent of monetizable daily active users. I wonder if Twitter&#39;s given bot numbers are low because bots don&#39;t typically lurk or load ads. I can believe that the total bot count as a percentage of users or as a percentage of recently-tweeting-users is higher than 5%, but that only 5% of daily visitors seeing ads are bots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We undercount active users whose accounts are protected, accounts that view tweets but don’t send any, and accounts that log in and engage in other ways beyond tweeting (like favoriting or adding profiles to lists).&#34;My markup. If I understand correctly, not having a public tweet is a marker for being a spam account. Isn&#39;t that kind of a lot of people? I know from other forums that there&#39;s a large ratio between lurkers and active posters.Given that you need an account to customise your timeline, and, these days, pretty much for just reading a tweet, there may be loads of real reader accounts that never post and never bother customizing their profile."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nothing wrong with p2p. But often it&#39;s simply overkill. Skype started out as a p2p thing. But ultimately, video calls became a commodity where orchestrating them centrally proved to be good enough. I can make video calls with meets, facebook, whatsapp, signal, slack, etc. Not a big deal. I even still have Skype somewhere and it still works even though they ripped out the p2p bits ages ago.I&#39;m not sure what web3 is other than a label that people started slapping on the collective efforts of people vaguely doing anything with or depending on some kind of block chain thingy. IMHO it has very little to do with the web and little or no relevance to end users.From a technical point of view, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with having a distributed store of ownership of stuff. There are all sorts of useful and valid uses for that. The problem is all the hyena&#39;s with dollar signs in their eyes floating around any companies active in this space. It&#39;s hard to see the forest for the trees because of this. Doing anything with a blockchain almost automatically buckets you with the fraudsters, utopians, and other people plaguing this space.Most of the companies in this space are a combination of naive, fraudulent, or misguided. With a few notable exceptions where you might squint and see some potential of some actual economic value. But most of them are obvious duds. I actually briefly used Stellar for some actual applications. Great tech. Mostly works as advertised. Not that expensive to use. Etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll just leave this here [0]I don&#39;t disagree that the concentration of web architecture into the hands of a small number of big corps is a bad thing. I just don&#39;t see the solution being a purely technical one. There are market forces and reasons for that consolidation: efficiency in terms of power; production, acquisition, and deployment of expensive equipment; high-availability of services, operations and staff, etc. I don&#39;t like that a third of the Internet goes down with aws-east-1 like anyone else but the factors that enabled this situation are no conspiracy.We need economic incentives to enable smaller players to build on widely deployed infrastructure, fair competition laws, etc.We could use more edge-computing power with low-power equipment. Make it easy to deploy small-time data-centres on low-power, off-the-shelf hardware. Incentives that align with the economic value they bring so that they&#39;re not fighting on the margins left by large monopolies.Instead we&#39;re supposed to switch over to a &#34;P2P&#34; system built on funny machines evaluating user code. As many chains have tried to formally verify their smart contracts it&#39;s becoming increasing clear that the proofs, when they can be achieved, are so complex that the underlying system probably has more errors in it than we can count. Probably great for departing folks from their money but the folks running this stuff often don&#39;t even understand programming let alone proofs and verification.And then the stuff that actually gets built with it... slow, terrible UX, that it is... is just garbage anyways. Axie? I don&#39;t think anyone in web3 actually plays the game. It looks boring as all hell. And it&#39;s incredibly expensive to get started in it. They literally pay people to play it for them and they just watch spreadsheets for number to go up.And none of this &#34;distributed web&#34; works without the Internet as it exists today anyway. I&#39;m not interested in promises of potential. We don&#39;t drive on potential bridges.Maybe some part of the community is built by idealists but their dreams are poisoned. The world we live in right now is already pretty terrible in some parts. We could be fixing those instead of building another dystopia.[0] https://web3isgoinggreat.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sort of agree. My initial understanding was that web3 was essentially a P2P solution with IPFS, Federated social graphs, decentralized p2p messaging and RTC stuff, and awaiting decentralized DNS. My current understanding or impression is that it&#39;s a coin wallet in my ~browser and I have to mine shit coins via storing and computing stuff on what will certainly be FAANGs behalf."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was reading https://danluu.com/sounds-easy again today, and when reading this article I was reminded of a particular section:&#34;Everything we&#39;ve looked at so far is a technical problem. Compared to organizational problems, technical problems are straightforward. Distributed systems are considered hard because real systems might drop something like 0.1% of messages, corrupt an even smaller percentage of messages, and see latencies in the microsecond to millisecond range. When I talk to higher-ups and compare what they think they&#39;re saying to what my coworkers think they&#39;re saying, I find that the rate of lost messages is well over 50%, every message gets corrupted, and latency can be months or years&#34;Dan goes on to say: &#34;When people imagine how long it should take to build something, they&#39;re often imagining a team that works perfectly and spends 100% of its time coding. But that&#39;s impossible to scale up. The question isn&#39;t whether or not there will inefficiencies, but how much inefficiency. A company that could eliminate organizational inefficiency would be a larger innovation than any tech startup, ever.&#34;Communication scales extremely poorly compared to code and large organizations require a very different skillset than small companies. The author seems like someone who just loves writing code as opposed to wanting to deliver maximum business value (As defined by the company), so it makes sense he dislikes big companies.There are also good and bad big and small companies. A well run big company is still going to have a large amount of communication overhead vs a small company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these meetings, reports, plans and apparently useless things, provide insurance to the different stakeholders of the project. Projects fail in many ways, and you need everyone to feel safe. That&#39;s why you need to document things a lot, in order to say “this was explained in section 3.2.1 of the manual” when the other team doesn&#39;t correctly  use your tools. And this is true for everyone, the finance guys, the product guys, the programmers, the marketers, everyone. Providing insurance to everyone is very expensive, but it makes the large organization stable. If everyone worked like cowboys in an small company, then the large company would disappear in a large fire of infighting.I never worked in a large company, but I work in academia, and we academics are also working on insurance a lot. The funding bodies want us to detail all expenses and justify all the changes in the plan, because they don&#39;t want people to say that the public funds are mismanaged. This is just an example. We also write tons of useless papers, to justify that we are productive with this money. This makes research very difficult. If you really want to do science, you should become rich and do it from home, like Nassim Taleb does, but in Academia we must work on all this insurance stuff, like in corporate world.That&#39;s how things are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue the author is talking about, in my view, is caused by the natural lifespan of corps tending towards bloating middle-management. (Very hard process to fight).At the start the founder group are rutheless productivity-chasers. Then the corp expands to include the its-just-a-job group. Everything ticks along well, and at some point, the rutheless can&#39;t manage the group. So they hire followers to listen to their orders and thereby manage others. In this sense middle management is really &#34;corporate following&#34;.Now you have the its-just-ajobs, rutheless-productives, rutheless-leaders, and leader-followers.When the corp grows too far the balance in these populations is thrown way off (by, often, the shortsightedness of the real leadership in balloning middle-management to cover for them).At this point all the meaningful decisions are still held by the exec, but middle management are now so large they have to &#34;find something useful to do&#34;, which is regulate all the meaningless decisions.At this point most of the ruthelessly-productive leave, and you&#39;re left with the justajobs, leader-followers and the few clueless productives who&#39;ll destroy their mental health trying to grapple with it all."</p>

But did they truly sell them?If I was running a dodgy ponzi scheme and saw it collapsing catastrophically, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be throwing good money after bad trying to futilely patch it up. Much better to stash the remaining assets away somewhere and personally cash out later on.Also, “In a sense, the market is going to take that as kind of bullish.” - a.k.a. the standard &#39;this is good for bitcoin&#39; quote, applicable whatever the news is!"</p>

Sure. The Vatican has started a process to canonize these saints."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean that was the expected outcome and now people are like “proof of the expected outcome!?!”Following months of outcry about the unsustainable nature of Terra Luna, Do Kwon through his foundation tried to partially collateralize the stablecoin with bitcoin, with a goal of buying up to $10bn of bitcoin. He got $3-5bn (at the time, price changed a lot), and this prolonged the confidence system for one additional month.And then it imploded and sold the collateral, of course it was partial collateral so it failed to do anything in a bank run.So it doesnt matter whether we get records from exchanges or not. Nothing different would happen. People want to see Do Kwon have more reasons to have charges against him, but there’s no need to attribute it to malice, everything can be explained by incompetence already."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recommend this to all iOS users that are also on Linux (or run KDE Connect on Windows) because KDE Connect is an awesome piece of software.I do find it interesting that they&#39;ve published a GPLv3 application in Apple&#39;s App Store, though.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At one point (a very long time ago now) it was declared that Dogwood was the future and as a result Go would be the language of choice at Heroku and Erlang would be no more.Trouble is that Erlang ran all the important Cedar code (it might still today) and the Erlang engineers didn&#39;t particularly like the news that Erlang code was essentially deprecated so they left and nobody knew how to maintain the stack. This definitely wasn&#39;t the only problem we had but it was a big one.What do fellow Herokai think? Was Dogwood a fool&#39;s errand? Or did we just not get enough staff to build it properly?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only thing I don&#39;t like is their usage-based pricing. On Heroku I could pay $7 a month and know I&#39;d never be charged more than that. I&#39;m sure when you&#39;re scaling a service it&#39;s fine - maybe even better - to do it on a sliding scale. But for a fire-and-forget blog site, I don&#39;t want to have to worry about stuff like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After all the chatter this week, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that Heroku froze at the perfect time for my 4 person company. All of these so called &#34;features&#34; are exactly what we don&#39;t want or need.1. Multi-region deployment only work if your database is globally distributed too. However, making your database globally distributed creates a set of new problems, most of which take time away from your core business.2. File persistence is fine but not typically necessary. S3 works just fine.It&#39;s easy to forget that most companies are a handful of people or just solo devs. At the same time, most money comes from the enterprise, so products that reach sufficient traction tend to shift their focus to serving the needs of these larger clients.I&#39;m really glad Heroku froze when it did. Markets always demand growth at all costs, and I find it incredibly refreshing that Heroku ended up staying in its lane. IMO it was and remains the best PaaS for indie devs and small teams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Litestream author here. The motivation for this docs page was two-fold. First, laying out the different options with their trade-offs helps people understand what Litestream is trying to be so it helps keep my focus narrow. For example, if someone is looking for very high durability guarantees then they can see that rqlite might be a better fit and they don&#39;t try to fit Litestream into that mold.Second, Litestream doesn&#39;t interfere with other backup methods so you can run it alongside a cron-based backup. I typically run both because I&#39;m overly paranoid and because it&#39;s cheap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A service that says &#39;here is an alternative to our service&#39;? Right on their own website? Even though cron backups are basically &#39;competition&#39; to litestream?That&#39;s it. I&#39;m giving fly.io a try next hobby app I start.I&#39;m so impressed with their business decisions right now, I was afraid for litestream but then I read how the creator is just hired to work on it full time. What a splendid development!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Following the announcement of Fly.io acquiring the Litestream project and hiring its creator Ben Johnson I&#39;ve been looking into it (and am very impressed by what I see!)Reading through the docs I was delighted to find this full set of instructions including script commands for setting up a simpler regular snapshot backup using cron - for situations where Litestream is (quote) &#34;overkill&#34; - ie where the database is smaller and your durability requirements are lower.In fact, the docs have a whole alternatives section for different requirements. I think this kind of thing is great, and something more projects should do! Wanted to share it because of this meta thing, but also because it&#39;s just pretty useful per se."</p>

The author sounds like an investor who would be equally happy to hold long instead of short positions in those stocks if their prices were different."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I weigh 350 pounds. I&#39;m very obese. I know this.When I was a teenager, I looked at people who weighed 300+ pounds and though, how do you get that way. Don&#39;t you realize that you are gaining weight? Don&#39;t you know that you just have to eat less to lose weight?Anyway, now I realize that I am hungry. It never goes away unless I eat a significant amount of food. My body told me to eat, so I ate.It doesn&#39;t even take that much extra food to gain a lot of weight. One extra piece of cake a week is a few pounds in a year. If you live a few years, it adds up. You gain weight in kilograms and lose weight in grams.Hunger is a sensation that happens inside a person&#39;s body and mind. You cannot compare your hunger to my hunger.So many diets talk about not being hungry while you are on the diet. I&#39;ve been to dieticians and told them I&#39;m hungry, and they suggest eating more protein or more fiber. That does help, but I still feel hungry.There is a very good chance that someone is writing a reply with some suggestion as to how I should eat so that I&#39;m not hungry. Thank you for the thoughts, but realize that you don&#39;t live in my body, you don&#39;t know how I feel, you don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve tried.Hunger sounds like a problem to people. Hunger feels like a problem inside the body. People still tell me I shouldn&#39;t be hungry. Maybe part of the solution is realizing that eating to satisfaction is ... bad for some people. Maybe it&#39;s Ok to be a little hungry.Anyway, these are just some thoughts. I&#39;m down 30 pounds from my max. I think I have a good mentality now, but it took years to get here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While correct and useful advice for some people, this advice is useless for many (I suspect most) overweight and obese people.I&#39;m on the border of overweight/obese. I can lose weight if I focus on losing weight. I&#39;ve dropped from 100kg to 74kg and back. I&#39;ve gone back down to 91kg and back. How? Eating less, of course. By counting calories. But here is the problem. Anything below 95kg and my body and mind is hyper annoying, constantly interrupting my thoughts (amygdala?) insisting that I go eat something. It is impossible to program computers when my brain keeps interrupting me. I simply cannot focus on anything other than eating. It&#39;s like a very slow motion breath hold... eventually you will come up for air. I find life so miserable at those weights that I eventually learned to accept my fate and I&#39;ll die early I&#39;m sure, but at least life will feel tolerable until then.Why do some people&#39;s bodies/minds insist so insistently that they eat more when they clearly are already overweight? That&#39;s the question I would love to have answered. People often postulate the answer lies in the kinds of foods you eat, but I&#39;ve proven that hypothesis wrong (for myself) many times. Avoiding sugars and fried foods and eating oatmeal, fish soup, salads, fruit and veg with lean proteins...  does not make any weight difference for me, nor does it make low body weights any more tolerable. Sounds great, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s healthy, but I&#39;ve proven on myself multiple times that this technique does not work. Only counting calories works for weight loss (actually distance running works for me too), and it always leaves me famished and miserable.Going on a zero-carb diet might work. I&#39;ve seen success stories. I haven&#39;t seriously tried it. When I&#39;ve tried in the past I was craving bread so massively that I caved in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone finally wrote this article. So refreshing. It&#39;s obvious when you live with a fat person why they have trouble losing weight, even when they&#39;re on a diet: they&#39;re usually not actually following it. Whether they don&#39;t understand portion sizes for calorie math, or look at calories at all, or eat things that they say &#34;do not count&#34;, there is almost always a failure to understand what and how much they are eating."</p>

They will keep pushing anti-consumer laws through the backdoor of &#34;free trade&#34; agreements, until we stop it by requiring that:Before any international agreement may be ratified, [our country] must pass all the laws needed to comply with that agreement ahead of time, through regular democratic processes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Free&#34; trade agreements. &#34;Free trade agreement&#34; is a propaganda term anyway, but applying it to agreements that impose intellectual property monopolies is bizarre.https://cepr.net/trade-agreements-that-increase-protectionis...https://cepr.net/trade-deals-are-about-increasing-protection...&gt; It is also important to point out that the liberalization of trade in goods is largely a done deal. Tariffs are already zero or near zero in the vast majority of cases. The potential gains from further liberalization are limited, especially since goods are a rapidly falling share of total output.&gt; Instead, deals like the TPP are largely about locking in rules on items like intellectual property protections and preserving Mark Zuckerberg’s dominance of the Internet. The TPP, like other recent trade deals, calls for longer and stronger patent and copyright monopolies.&gt; These protections are 180 degrees at odds with free trade. They are about shifting more income from the bulk of the population to people who benefit from rents on patents and copyrights, by making them pay more for drugs, medical equipment, software and a wide variety of other items."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was prescribed benzos because of sleeping issues, but I was also taking phenibut at the same time.  After about 3 weeks of using large doses of the benzos every night, I stopped taking them, but a year later I still feel pangs of withdrawal sometimes when I get stressed.  It took me another 4 months to get off the phenibut and a month or so after that before my sleep returned to normal.  There were months where I maybe got an hour or two of sleep a night.  If I got stressed, I simply wouldn&#39;t sleep at all.  I once went three days without sleep.  The torment of that combined with the withdrawal from the drugs showed me what hell was like.  I tell everyone to never take benzos for any reasons.  I don&#39;t care how safe the doctors say they are; they aren&#39;t.  Period.  There are repercussions - as this study shows - and they will not help the underlying cause of your issues.  Treat the cause, not the symptoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Caution:  While this is a cool study in Nature Neuroscience, almost all facets of this work are based on a single fully inbred strain of mouse—-C57BL/6J. This strain also happens to have a major mutation in the  GABRA2 gene that reduces expression about 2X relative to almost all other strains of mice.  GABRA2 is one of the most important receptors involved in inhibitory responses in CNS and benzodiazepine responses.This same strain also has a well known splice variant mutation in a key mitochondrial gene, NNT, that modulates both mitochondrial and macrophage function. The microglial mentioned in this paper are a special class of macrophages that reside in the CNS.Given these comments, when the authors refer to “wild type” (WT) mice, remember these are anything but true wild type mice. Fully inbred strains always carry numerous homozygous recessive and dominant mutations (several hundred each) that often affect CNS, immune systems, and mitochondrial functions.The results may well hold up in other strains, but I would not count on it. Do benzodiazepines affect all humans uniformly?Would studies of other strains or types have been practical? Yes. The Thy1-GFP and Thy1-YFP lines can be crossed to make F1 hybrids. This particular transgene is also available on at least one other strain of mouse (DBA/2J).Unfortunately, most reviewers at Nature Neuroscience are not geneticists ;-) They are typically strong molecular neurobiologists who are used to reductionist methods. They are perfectly content with submission to Nature journals that are based entirely on with N=1 mouse genome—almost always the mutant C57BL/6J inbred strain.In my own work I try to avoid this N=1 trap. (But I have also failed ;-)Generality and robustness of results (see quote below) should ideally be established across two or more diverse genomes before making broad claims of relevance to other species, including od course to humans.The quote:“We have demonstrated that microglia in WT mice alter their morphology and functions upon diazepam treatment and cease to do so in Tspo−/− mice.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The world of medecine is degenerate. Sustainable, non addictive and non neurotoxic anxiolytics exists:
the #1 being opipramol the sigmaergic.
emoxypine (which btw cure hangover) and guanfacine are worth mentioning.
Maybe beta blockers to some extent. NMDA antagonists such as memantine have side effects but are not neurotoxic to my knowledge and there are milder ones such as mg-lthreonate.
afobazole is interesting but its pharmacology is too weird to be sure. Etifoxine is revolutionnary, it double axon length growth rate so ironically a great cure to benzo neurodamage. its acts on the mitochondria benzodiazepine receptor. It&#39;s unclear to me wether it is subject to a tolerance effect and if so if it is lower. Also etifoxine can interact badly with other drugs on the liver.
Note that there exists ultra-atypical mechanisms, such as inositol megadose or tofisopam but they are not firstline.So yeah, basically opipramol and guanfacine should be what humans take as first line. Glycine is a nice obvious augmentation (kinda absurd that people forget about the second inhibitor neurotransmitter in the brain, especially since the effect feel nice and doesn&#39;t really lead to tolerance).
if you have benzo neurodamage, take magnesium lthreonate which is a very potent synaptotrophic.also fun fact: the benzo cartel was so strong it was the most prescribed drug in the world, all classes, in the 70s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s no doubt that, for a lot of people, there is just a better convenience/quality trade-off. I had a good size Onkyo system for watching movies and I configured it meticulously. But it&#39;s hard to explain to others why there is so much ceremony and bulk, especially when watching habits degenerate from immersive movies to binge watching netflix serieses.Part of the experience with hobbies is some kind of sacrifice along with the reward. The drive towards convenience takes away that sacrifice and makes me appreciate something a little less.It&#39;s like takeout and boxed wine, wearing a T-shirt; versus dressing up a bit, making a nice meal, and opening a bottle from a winery you visited. The former is ovjectively good and convenient, and all of the latter ceremony is a hassle that provides little benefit (you probably can&#39;t tell the boxed wine apart in a blind test).But... aren&#39;t we happier with the latter experience?I&#39;m too lazy to &#34;waste&#34; time on that kind of happiness though. That&#39;s the sad part.I think if I&#39;m motivated by others it&#39;s different. For instance, stuff like surfing/snowsports requires a significant hassle, and it&#39;s a lot easier to find people who will put up with that hassle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that the AV-receiver market has gone the way of the DSLR market. Compact speaker systems like Sonos (that don&#39;t need a separate AVR) simply got good enough. Thus the need for buying a separate AVR to drive your Dolby / DTS / etc. setup has all but vanished except maybe for the most determined audiophiles (and even most of these would do well to simply get a compact wireless speaker setup instead of some monstrosity that they can hardly ever enjoy...because too small of a listening room, and neighbours).I&#39;m not saying market for Onkyo, Denon, Sony, Yamaha, etc. AVRs is a goner, but I am suggesting it may have peaked and that going forward there will be less and less demand for AVRs, especially in the low/mid range of things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn’t big news, the actual “Onkyo” that consumers know will carry on, the Bankruptcy is the remains of the company that had already sold off the hardware divisions.“The company sold its core home audiovisual business to Sharp and U.S.-based Voxx International and its earphones and headphones business to an investment fund, both in September. A joint venture between Sharp and Voxx is expected to continue using the Onkyo brand”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am only at the first page, but already I must recommend this workhttps://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/as unmissable, and &#34;I should have read this as a child&#34; - that is, for those who feel a lack of solid ground until they know exactly what makes the machine work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read some of this to try to determine how it would compare to a classic operating systems design book - like maybe &#34;The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating System&#34;.Looking at the Paging [1] chapter, the _Linux Insides_ book has a clear, very technical, description of the meaning of every bit in pointers used for virtual addressing. It includes details like what bits you need to set in order to enable a particular paging mode, so it&#39;s really enough detail to actually _do_ something.I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the target audience, but it was interesting to look at.[1] https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Theory/linux-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks like a really good resource, but why is it so difficult to find a somewhat up-to-date description of networking in the Linux kernel?It seems like the least documented (at a high level, anyway) part of the kernel - if anyone knows a good resource I&#39;d love to hear it."</p>
