								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the biggest tragedies isn&#39;t just that the childhood is wasted, but that many people never learn to have agency once it is available. I&#39;m not saying you need to start your own business or anything like that, but it seems like most people live their lives never questioning the scripts that are given to them.The basic life script we all seem to have in western society seems pretty awful when you think critically about it. Essentially we waste all out vitality and youth making other people rich, so that one day when we&#39;re old and infirm, we can finally do the things we like with the short time we have left. I think most of us never even think about it because it&#39;s too bleak of a reality. I feel somewhat fortunate in that the work I do is something I would generally enjoy doing even if I wasn&#39;t being paid for it, but I still have a nagging fear that what I could be is much more than what I am yet I lack the proper tools and perspectives to become that person (and I don&#39;t think that just starting my own business, like a lot of people here want to do, is really sufficient, it&#39;s just a small part of inventing your own life script)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article did a great job of articulating something I&#39;ve always felt strongly about but haven&#39;t been able to put into words.I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who felt like my schooling was mostly a giant waste of my time and energy.I was waaaay ahead in subjects I liked, because those things I learned myself out of innate interest. Rather than the system accommodating and encouraging being ahead, in those subjects I was held back and forced to sit through material I already knew, because &#34;in year x we learn this and in year y we learn that&#34;. Don&#39;t get ahead. Zero agency.In other subjects that didn&#39;t interest me, I was forced to sit through stuff only to forget everything I &#34;learned&#34; soon after.It really begs the question, what&#39;s the point? And while I&#39;m no genius at anything, surely a system like this will kill many, many actual geniuses, just like the article says."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the article is that it only uses examples of extra ordinary people.Most people are not geniuses, they are average. 
You are not a genius.Most people who flunk out or drop out of school
do not become billionaires and neither will you.Most people who decide to give it their all and become
various forms of artists will never be famous, noticed 
no wealty or admired (Though on a nano scale you may have people who do)By a large margin most restaurants / startups fail.
You are not going to create the next unicorn.yes this is not 100% accurate because it does happen.
Much like buying a lotto ticket. 
People do win.But you will not. (Almost entirely certain but again some do win).People like Lonardo da Vinci are 1 in a billion. 
Maybe one in 2 billion.People like Jobs and Zuckerberg are a lot more common. 
There are maybe 1000? 10.000? 
If we say 100.000 that is about 0.0013% of the world
population. 
You are not in the 0.0013% (2019 estimate)(Though you really need take into account the privilege accorded people based. on where they live, where they were born, family. If you win the lottery and grow up in a wealty educated country, you have a HUGE advantage.Much like buying 1 lottery ticket drastically increases you chance of winning.The point being nearly all people fail to be special. 
They will not be remembered by the grater society after their death. They will have made no huge impact on the world.  They will never make it big.Thus we should not focus our choices in life my making a few of the same choices that are advantageous for 1 in a billion.We should not set our goals to achieve what they did.We should focus on having a nice life, a good set of friends, enough money to live ok, having interesting hobbies
Having a job that is ok. A safe and dry place to live.
Have some love.We should expect and respect that we will be average
That is not a failure. That is what most likely will
happen.So set out to make the most of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See also the leak[1] of big oil PR maestro Rick Berman&#39;s 2014 speech to oil execs, pleading for funds to combat rational debate and reliable information about fracking.“Think of this as an endless war,” he told them. “And you have to budget for it.”&gt; He said the industry needs to dig up embarrassing tidbits about environmentalists and liberal celebrities, exploit the public’s short attention span for scientific debate, and play on people’s emotions.&gt; “Fear and anger have to be a part of this campaign,” Berman said. “We’re not going to get people to like the oil and gas industry over the next few months.”&gt; Berman also advised that executives continue to spend big. “I think $2 to $3 million would be a game changer,” he said. “We’ve had six-figure contributions to date from a few companies in this room to help us get to where we are.”&gt; But always cover your tracks, he suggested, adding that no-one is better equipped at doing so than his firm. “We run all this stuff through nonprofit organizations that are insulated from having to disclose donors. There is total anonymity,” he said. “People don’t know who supports us. We’ve been doing this for 20-something years in this regard.” [2]Plenty more in the transcript at [1], and the article at [2]!1: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/politics/pr-executives...2: https://www.desmog.com/2014/10/31/oil-and-gas-industry-s-end..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago, I got to see an Exxon &#34;Legislative Affairs Coordinator&#34; speak to a group of small landowners about how they could make their own lobbying efforts more effective.In less than 10min this lady had the crowd ready to burn her at the stake.She told them things like &#34;your voice doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; urged them to donate all the money they could to Exxon&#39;s lobbying efforts (with unspecified goals), on the basis that at least it would get something done, even if it wasn&#39;t what they wanted. &#34;Donate to our people, and our people will take care of you.&#34;Then, she told them that actual grass-roots organizations like theirs were socially dangerous, because they wouldn&#39;t stick to their original mission but inevitably became cults, essentially. Something like &#34;the best thing this organization can do, today, is vote to dissolve immediately&#34;All this was in exchange for a several thousand dollar speaking fee, which was the largest expense behind the venue for the event."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Where&#39;s the accountability? We&#39;re facing a global crisis. Once again, the rich are insulated from the consequences of their greed, while the poorest suffer the most. It&#39;s high time those who sold us out should have to answer for their actions. Something on the order of seven billion counts of reckless endangerment should do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think i’ve got a slightly different take - i’m not saying my take is any better though.If we’re talking engineering principles, not team dynamics, then it’s:  1. Use immutability by default, even in languages that make that harder than it should be
  2. Understand how liberating idempotency is
  3. Divide and conquer, use abstraction to make hard problems manageable
  4. Delete code, delete tests, re-write stuff, re-write it again. Painful? Keep doing this till you get to the other side and feel liberation and empowerment, took me years to get past wincing at the idea of re-writing that thing AGAIN
  5. Pay attention to your build tooling - to do any given task, it should always take exactly 1 command. How do i run the tests? Run the test command. How do i deploy to non-prod? Run the deploy command. Etc

If we’re talking softer stuff:  1. Don’t block collaboration - e.g. if there are 5 people don’t work on 5 tasks concurrently. Work on 1, maybe 2 in some cases
  2. Accomodate 2 types of work: work that needs collaboration &amp; synchronisation (brain storming, planning, why are we even doing this, that kinda thing) work that needs focus time - sometimes that’s focus as an individual, sometimes that’s a mob focussed on one task and saying no to every other distraction in the world no matter how “urgent”
  3. Change what you’re doing throughout the day, don’t try to code all day, you’ll get in a rut, you won’t write your best code after a while. You can optimise this step, e.g. if the team is low energy after lunchtime, use that to your advantage and schedule the easy boring work then, don’t be afraid to use humour or burn low energy time just getting to know each other better
  4. Make sure people are being heard in the team. Hardest point to get right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like a lot of these principles but there is a crucial element missing from this presentation and that is time.As a company grows the importance of each of these principles changes. As a project within an established company grows a similar maturation happens.If you tried to adhere to all &#39;best practices&#39; (principles or not) from day 1 of a project you&#39;d be carrying a lot of weight that could crush otherwise good ideas.Some principles, when presented without a timeline, seem contradictory and that can lead to fights on teams where developers are well meaning but less experienced.I&#39;m encouraged that this presentation includes dimensions along which you can slice the principles, but I encourage the authors to adopt a &#34;stage&#34; dimension as well that helps focus devs/learners on principles appropriate for 1. The stage they are in and 2. The immediate next stage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh wow, author here - I wasn&#39;t quite expecting this to appear here today. I&#39;ve only really just start talking to people about it.That said, my mission is to make software engineering better for everyone. By capturing the best principles from the best in the world at what they do. And to organise and share that knowledge, freely.It&#39;s currently missing features to organise principles well, but I&#39;m working on it (discussion here: https://github.com/PrinciplesDotDev/principles/discussions/2...)You can reach me through my profile or following me on @princples_dev (twitter) - I&#39;ve only starting pushing this, but a lot more will be coming soon.It&#39;s an open source project and it needs your principles to make this a reality so if you&#39;ve got some to share, please do. Or if you have feedback, leave it here. I&#39;m building it for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When it comes to the problem of targeting, one interesting and promising tech is photochemical internalisation [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemical_internalizatio...], where you put the mRNA inside photosensitive molecules (and not lipids) and then shine some light on the tissue/organ where you want the mRNA delivered. Where activated by the light, the molecules then enter the cells, dissolves and deliver the mRNA.
The Norwegian company PCI Biotech has a tech they call fimaNAc for doing this with naked mRNA.https://www.pcibiotech.no/nucleicacidsThis presentation has a lot of illustrations and explanations:https://www.pcibiotech.no/s/PCI-Biotech-SMi-RNA-Therapeutics..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a long essay about the same topic and came to similar conclusions as Derek Lowe: https://trevorklee.com/are-mrna-therapies-the-future-of-phar...One thing that I&#39;d like to emphasize is how unbelievably tiny mRNA therapeutics have to be. It&#39;s probably around 30 mg, and it&#39;s hard to do it more than once every few weeks, at least judging by siRNA therapeutics (which have similar immune issues).30 mg is really tiny. It&#39;s hard to come up with a meaningful therapeutic in such a small amount of material. People have been hyping up self-replicating mRNA as a solution, but that&#39;s still in its infancy, and has its own problems regarding the &#34;compilers&#34;/polymerases that need to be packaged with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sort of mRNA work isn’t immune-driven at all, in theory, and if you need your target cells to keep producing your desired protein, you’re going to have to keep telling them that by sending them more mRNA. Once a day? Once a week? Who knows? That’ll need to be worked out by experiment.This doesn&#39;t seem like a problem from the point of view of those who are in the business of selling mRNA :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting article for two reasons, how the practice originated and what it implies.The practice seems to be somewhat wide spread (in the distance between departments case). That might be because it came from a Facebook group or forum where Law Enforcement officers exchange tips. The second is the choice of artist (Swift) who has been in a pretty visible battle with ownership of her music. I suspect that if the officers who use this technique thought about it, they might find that using Disney tunes would be more effective in terms of triggering DMCA takedowns.What it implies, and is explicitly stated in the referenced video, is that a law enforcement officer is explicitly attempting to deny you your 1st Amendment right (as adjudicated by the courts). While the doctrine of qualified
immunity would likely shield them from prosecution, it is still a violation of your civil rights and should certainly merit disciplinary action on the part of the police department."</p>

You could do a lot better (and I would never want to have to use the sink proposed in that clip on a day-to-day basis).

What?Meanwhile you have like... storage for plates for 20 people as if you could ever feed more than 3 people at once. And that double-door fridge... I imagine that if you&#39;re in a more rural area it&#39;s more necessary but there&#39;s a lot better choices here if you are actually trying to make a livable space, instead of a place that offers good shots.
This looks a lot like a &#34;set up your own AirBnB&#34; thing. So much so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if AirBnB made a strategic investment in this."</p>

Why would you lock it because it was sold through Amazon?Is it accessible if you buy it direct from Acer?Sounds like a customer support person just made up a reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Guess I&#39;d better say a few things.First, I deeply appreciate that so many on Hacker News have come out for this.  Enough to awaken me from a sound sleep on a Tuesday evening!I don&#39;t really care that much about selling Klein bottles over Amazon - it&#39;s mainly to reach parents over the holidays.  But I do wish that Amazon would do something about this kind of thing.Finally, I&#34;m very low on stocks of glass Klein bottles. It&#39;s weird for me to ask my friends not to buy the things I&#39;ve worked so hard to make, but I guess I&#39;d better.  I hope to have more manifolds in mid to late summer.Warm wishes all around,-Cliff (way late on a cloudy Tuesday evening in Oakland)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That sucks. Nice write-up of how this scam works, I wasn&#39;t aware of the details previously.Also, if anyone is unaware, this is this Clifford Stoll: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stoll - who wrote this brilliant (and true) book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg_(book) - which is a really good read and perfect for HN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A perfect example of why I buy less and less from sites that support 3rd party sellers.The problem is even once reliable sites like newegg.com are now playing these games.  If I wanted the Ebay/alibaba experience I can get that!  Why large retailer sites dilute their brand and frustrate customers in the fruitless chase of &#34;being like Amazon&#34; in catering to 3rd party sellers  amazes and annoys me.At least most other sites let you weed out the 3rd party sellers fairly easily.  What&#39;s really annoying is with Amazon, even if you are buying from &#34;Amazon&#34; it could be ultimately supplied to Amazon by some hackney 3rd party and not a trusted wholesaler or the original manufacturer.  And as Cliff Stoll found out, Amazon doesn&#39;t care either.Talk about coasting on your reputation.  It will be interesting to see how much trust they have to piss away before it affects them enough for them to finally pay attention to stuff like this :/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Attempts to litigate any license violation are going to get precisely nowhere I bet, but I find the actual license violation argument persuasive.This is an excellent example of how the AI singularity/revolution/whatever is a total distraction and that a much bigger and more serious issue is how AI is becoming so effective at turning the output of cheap/free human mental labour into capital. If AI keeps getting better and better and status quo socio-economic structure don&#39;t change, trillions in capital will be captured by the 0.01%.I would be quite a turn up for the books if this AI co-pilot gets suddenly and dramatically better in 2030 and it negatively impacts the software engineering profession. &#34;Hey, that&#39;s our code you used to replace us!&#34; we will cry out too late."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I think a large part of the value add of machine learning is going to be the ability for huge entities to launder intellectual property violations.As an example, my grandfather (an old school EE who got his start on radar systems in the 50s, who then got his radiology MD when my jewish grandmother berated him enough with &#34;engineer&#39;s not doctor though...&#34;) has some really cool patents around highlighting interesting parts of the frequency domain in MRIs that should make detection of cancer a whole lot easier.  As an implementation he did a bunch of tensor calculus by hand to extract and highlight those features because he&#39;s an incredibly smart old school EE with 70 years experience cranking that kind of thing out with only his trusty slide rule.  He hasn&#39;t gotten any uptake from MRI manufacturers, but they&#39;re all suddenly really into recurrent machine learning models to highlight the same sorts of stuff.  Part of me wants to tell him to try selling it as a machine learning model and just obfuscate the fact that the model was carefully hand written rather than back propagated.I&#39;m personally pretty anti intellectual property (at least how it&#39;s implemented in the states), but a system where large entities that have the capital investment to compute the large ML models can launder IP violations, but little guys get stuck to the letter of the law certainly seems like the worst of both worlds to me."</p>

From the original article:
&gt; Alas, all [People&#39;s Policy Project&#39;s website] can do is funnel users into Intuit&#39;s terrible [child tax credit] site.
Today at work, I&#39;m learning how to use the IRS&#39;s e-File SOAP API in the hopes that we can build a flow that is easier to use than Intuit&#39;s.

They have a monopoly position in many of their products and take advantage of some of the poorest people through misinformation and lobbying.Facebook &amp; Uber have received most of the heat over the past few years. Intuit has strangely avoided the same level of scrutiny."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s telling is that TurboTax&#39;s UX is really, really, good, deceptive pricing aside. Like, so good I almost enjoy using it to do my taxes.The very fact that Intuit has clearly invested money into making a beautiful interface for a tax program, a program that people use once a year, just goes to show how profitable the current arrangement is for them, and how determined they are to keep the average taxpayer from switching to any competing tax filing ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This makes me laugh exactly because the number of jobs I&#39;ve seen advertised after I&#39;ve left them to do other things because they weren&#39;t challenging enough, only to see that the prerequisites posted for the &#34;new&#34; job would&#39;ve screened me out before I even had the chance to interview and are far beyond what is necessary to do the job well.99% of the jobs that high quality developers could do that they&#39;re screened out of are because of poor concepts of what is needed to be successful.If someone has decent problem solving and analytical skills, can understand the problem domain and has the capacity to learn a new language/framework/construct in a short period of time (which frankly most of us can, and do with frightening regularity), unless you have something miraculously niche and technical, they&#39;re capable of doing the job. All you need to worry about is are they a competent developer and whether they&#39;ll be a good personality fit for the team.They say we rise to the level of our incompetence, but most developers never really grow out of solving problems and only get better with time and experience.Most degrees and professional certifications are meaningless to people who only care about the knowledge - there&#39;s no point in chasing paper that&#39;s out of date the minute the course is designed. We don&#39;t want that knowledge, it&#39;s old. We want current information which the courses and qualifications haven&#39;t been designed for yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a job for nearly 20 years.  Good job, good people, really hard to leave.  The folks at the company who hired me at the time (dot.com era) &#34;Just wanted people who could think about second order effects&#34;.  They didn&#39;t care about resume much.  They wanted &#34;thinkers&#34;.I worked in tech support and had a great relationship with engineering and etc.  They&#39;d ask tickets get assigned to me because they knew I was honest and thorough when it came to documentation and etc.  It was a good gig.Eventually we were acquired and before selling the company off as pieces they laid a huge % of people off, including myself (it was ok, I was ready to move on / and would eventually change careers).The company that got a bunch of the engineers eventually needed support people and the engineers reached out to me to apply.   I applied.But the job requirements had changed, masters degree required.  I no longer qualified (I didn&#39;t / don&#39;t even have a degree).  I applied, but didn&#39;t make it past new company&#39;s filters.  The engineers were told that if I didn&#39;t make it through the filter they wouldn&#39;t consider me.20 years doing that job in one form or another, and there&#39;s maybe a handful of people who know the proprietary side of their equipment... but no masters = not even considered for job.This was a technical job to be sure but it was largely IP (and some proprietary stuff) networking troubleshooting.   You could take capable high school students and they could do it with some good guidance.The hiring people industrial complex is insane."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"General SE hiring comment: One thing I realized, for most IT/SE jobs, the more accurately you describe your current stack in the requirements (or maybe the person you are replacing), the smaller your candidate pool is. You might even find that your candidate pool is exactly the people you are already working with.Which makes it problematic when we make HR people do the initial screening. They would filter out a lot of good candidates just because they used Python instead of Java, or had been working on a C++ project one year less than the person leaving the team.Could it be then that this is a communication problem between the Engineering team and the HRD? After all, the Eng&#39;g team writes the requirements for the job post, HRD just checks it and makes it look attractive.(Though honestly, I don&#39;t think this general comment applies to the job post in Carmack&#39;s tweet. Honestly I can&#39;t fault the job post for the way it was worded. I say the higher you are in an SE-org chain, the less this is a problem.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like SparkFun and I don&#39;t like patent trolls, but I have to say that SparkFun&#39;s mockery of the patent doesn&#39;t make sense. It is pretty clear that this patent was written by an engineer describing their actual system in great detail followed by one fairly narrow claim. I&#39;ve seen many patents that are mostly written by lawyers, and I don&#39;t see any influence of lawyers in this patent.SparkFun&#39;s criticism is kind of painful to read. The diagram that SparkFun claims is SPI is not SPI. The discussion that SparkFun claims is malloc is entirely unrelated to malloc. SparkFun claims that when the patent discusses processing multiple streams of data that it&#39;s discussing variable length arrays, but it&#39;s not. They claim that a MAU doesn&#39;t exist, but a MAU is a multiplier-accumulator unit. SparkFun seems to be entirely confusing the motivation of the engineer filing the patent in 2008 with the motivation of the patent trolls. I&#39;ve seen many patents that are fluff and nonsense, but this one is a solid patent.The infringement claim is probably bogus; I don&#39;t see any evidence that the pcDuino infringes the one narrow claim in the patent. I hope that SparkFun can quickly get rid of this lawsuit. I don&#39;t get any enjoyment out of criticizing SparkFun&#39;s post, but having spent the time to look over the patent, I feel that I should comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &gt;    The cost is further reduced by employing only static or dynamic ram as a means for holding the state of the system. [...]&gt; Dynamic ram? Can I poke fun at them for not knowing what RAM is? Yes I can.&gt; The above paragraph succinctly describes malloc(), which is perhaps one of the most fundamental advancements in modern computing. The problem is that Al didn’t invent it. Memory management (the ability to take RAM and then give it back when your function is done) goes back to the dawn of computing.No, this is wrong.Nathan is referring to dynamic memory allocation, which is what malloc does, but that isn&#39;t what this line in the lawsuit is talking about.Dynamic RAM, or DRAM is RAM that stores state in a capacitor. This is what your laptop uses -- DDR4 SDRAM is &#34;Double data rate (version 4) synchronous dynamic RAM&#34;. In DRAM, the charge on the capacitors slowly dissipates, so DRAM needs to be &#34;refreshed&#34; periodically, which is why it&#39;s referred to a &#34;dynamic&#34; RAM.Static RAM, or SRAM, is RAM that stores state in a register-like structure (usually cross-coupled inverters). It&#39;s &#34;static&#34; in that it doesn&#39;t need to be refreshed -- as long as the supply voltage is maintained, the bits stored in an SRAM will remain intact.I agree that this patent lawsuit is bullshit, and I really hate to derail the conversation, but I&#39;m surprised by Nathan&#39;s misunderstanding here, given that SparkFun makes embedded boards that use all kinds of memory. SRAM/DRAM isn&#39;t unusual terminology. The distinction doesn&#39;t even matter in the context of this line in the lawsuit, but if you&#39;re going to make a point of nitpicking about something, you should really make sure that you&#39;re actually right about it first..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me: software engr, retired; also patent agent who worked in Google Patent Litigation.A rookie mistake is reading the TEXT of a patent. A pro looks only at the claims. The text is only there to &#34;support&#34; the claims, which boils down to using the same words. Cynical, I know.Claims unfortunately look like gibberish if you&#39;re unschooled, but &#34;construing&#34; them is an early step in a trial, and often if you get a bad claim construction you give up. I worked on tons of claim construction briefs.I&#39;ll read those claims a little later this evening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience at least talking to some younger people there is a clear dichotomy: despite all the talk about Gen Z being &#34;digital natives&#34;, people new in their career are much hungrier to get back into the office because they don&#39;t yet have good career networks built up and they&#39;re eager for mentorship. It is older, or at least more established workers who are less keen on that.I don&#39;t think FAANGs will have any trouble hiring a boatload of eager, hardworking college grads in September even if they lose multi-digit percentage of their current workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly don&#39;t know whether these articles are over-stating their case, and neither do I know how typical my own experience is, but for some reason it bothers me that the tone of the HN discussion is so reflexively dismissive.I understand that a lot of people will respond to a question of whether they intend to quit their job with a &#39;you bet!&#39; even at the best of times, but I&#39;m seeing a lot of people quitting and switching right now, as different company plans are crystallized for the &#39;new normal&#39;.In my current company (for another 2 months) I was interviewed to join a team of 12 tech developers, and a couple of months ago the first of the switchers quit to leave for another company specifically because they were guaranteeing remote-first work.Then another five of us quit over the following few weeks. We met up last week for a goodbye lunch in the park: half the team that I joined a year ago leaving the company over the Spring and Summer.Is a 50% quit-rate normal? Maybe each of us had slightly different priorities and plans for the future? But I do know for sure that people are reflecting more than I&#39;ve ever experienced before, about their work environment, the balance in their lives, and prioritizing other things than 40-50 hours each week sitting in front of a screen, inside an office."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They sent around a form at my work asking everyone what their preference would be. The first guy replied to everyone with his preference: 100% wfh. Since he replied-all, so did everyone else. We got through about 20 employees, all stating their preference as WFH before a manager shut down the reply-all.A week later we got an email saying people wanted 2-3 days in office."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I lived in HK 2018-2020, leaving around the passage of the “national security law”.I think HK is a perfect case study of a line of fallacious thinking popular among westerners: the idea that peaceful protesting or rule-abiding political opposition is generally effective.This is wrong for at least two reasons. The first mistake is failing to recognize that many governments (case in point) are not nearly as vulnerable to bad PR, so generating a bunch of sympathetic imagery (photos of student protestors getting gassed or whatever) might not actually be useful in swaying political outcomes.The second mistake is assuming that most (putatively) peaceful protests in the western world are actually the impetus for political change, and not just part of a legitimization strategy for political changes that were already in development before the protest started."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Empty words and token sanctions are not going to stop the CCP&#39;s blatant takeover of HK and trashing of the &#39;1 country 2 systems&#39; agreement.Real action - offer US citizenship to Hong Kong era that want it. Then go recognize the Republic of Taiwan as an independent country.Unfortunately the CCP is probably right in their assumption that our politicians are to greedy and spineless to make anything beyond a soundbite gesture. They&#39;ll keep expanding their borders, putting minorities in concentration camps, forced organ harvesting and researching interesting new viruses.We&#39;re all complicit, sickening really."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In this article, I was surprised to read that anyone thought &#34;freedom of the press&#34; still existed in HK at all.Once they took the boss of Apple Daily it was pretty clear.
HK is governed by one system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s my beef with estimates.I can give you a really really accurate estimate, but in order to do so we&#39;re going to have to spend a lot of time going through the request, building and verifying actual requirements, designing the solution and then validating it.The process will require dev resources, business resources and probably people from the support team and will take a lot of time.I&#39;m happy to do it. It&#39;s actually my favorite part of the job. But the business invariably doesn&#39;t want to spend the time and money to do that.They&#39;d generally much rather start with a fairly vague description of what they need and let the devs keep throwing stuff against the wall and see what sticks.Good and accurate estimation is not just a dev function. It requires buy in and input from the entire business stack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Estimation that isn&#39;t based on previous data - I think the article that follows this one refers to it as &#34;Evidence-Based Scheduling&#34; - is almost entirely a waste of time.We analyzed our five+ year history of estimates vs actual time, and our standard deviation was larger than our mean. It was ridiculous how wrong our estimates were. The problem was in what was being estimated - coding time. Developers would get asked how long a task would take, and only think about the time spent sitting in front of a computer, typing code, and not the other time - waiting for other resources or people to finish tasks that you depend on, sick days, software and hardware issues, etc.The only way to accurately take those unforeseen factors into account is by analyzing previously completed tasks that have similar scope. Even then you can only get close.A couple people have mentioned weather forecasting as a similar endeavor - but meteorologists don&#39;t just guess, they analyze previous data.Estimation that isn&#39;t based on concrete data is a fool&#39;s game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paid overtime will fix scheduling. Scheduling is bad because the cost falls on the employees, not the employer. If crunches resulted in time and a half, double time, and triple time, scheduling would get fixed.As I&#39;ve pointed out before, film scheduling is an established discipline. Making a movie is much more complex than a software project. There are a lot of moving parts. Things get changed. There are people problems, weather problems, and transportation problems. Most importantly, if a film project goes into crunch mode, everybody starts getting paid overtime. This reduces the tendency to underestimate.There are also third party estimates. Hollywood has something called &#34;completion bonds&#34;. A completion bond is an insurance policy for the investors. Either they get a showable movie into theaters, or the completion bond company has to pay the investors. A completion bond costs about 5% of the cost of the film.Completion bond companies do their own estimates. Estimation inputs are &#34;script, budget, shooting schedule, (and) résumés of key crew.&#34; To survive, they need a net error near zero - they must overestimate and underestimate about equally. Consistent underestimation would put them out of business.Since they do a lot of this, they have scripts and financial data from previous movies. They can look up &#34;car chase, metropolitan area, 2 minutes screen time&#34; for how much that cost the last 50 times someone did it. They also have director info, like &#34;director X averages 2.5 takes per scene&#34;. All this info is collected across multiple film companies.The completion bond company has the right to intervene if the project starts to go over budget. Worst case, they can fire the director and take over the production. This is rare, but it happens. &#34;Malcolm X&#34; by Spike Lee (1992) and &#34;Bad Girls&#34; are examples. &#34;Malcolm X&#34; was an epic movie, a bit too epic - it runs 3 hours and 22 minutes - and somebody had to say no to Spike Lee. &#34;Bad Girls&#34; (1994) was just a botched production, and the bond company put in their own director to try to salvage something. It still lost money, but did reach theaters.That a completion bond company can fire the director puts teeth in this system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like the conspiracy theory/practice distinction and I hope Ed will write more on how we could pay more attention to the latter.Noam Chomsky presents lots of evidence about outrageous acts of American government in his books, and he always claimed that it all comes from official and open government sources. Yet most people are either unaware or refuse to believe it anyway.These are conspiracies done openly, because almost nobody wants to go through and find the smoking gun in the heaps of otherwise boring government documents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Conspiracies happen constantly because people conspire to do nefarious things all the time. However nowadays the framework for evaluating those nefarious things (conspiracy theories) has been completely negated by those in corporate media conflating it with insanity and baseless, nonsensical accusations.And there&#39;s a reason for that, which Snowden touches on. Namely, the world in its current form is largely run by such nefarious schemes. The bad guys won a long time ago. And by taking away the language we might even use to talk about what they did, and the scale of it, they have further insulated their power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed people treat conspiracy theories with the same level of validity or non-validity regardless of the facts or details.Things like flat earth conspiracies have now inexplicably been lumped into the likes of those who believe in things like.https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/758989641/the-cias-secret-que...Or just question in general the motivation behind the decisions made by those in charge.There are some very obviously dumb conspiracies that have no basis in reality, there are some possibly far out there conspiracies that could have some merit and then there&#39;s conspiracies that seemed ridiculous but actually turned out to be true.The world is not black and white...it&#39;s very grey.Again, I find it odd these things tend to all be labeled under one giant &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; label. Much like any theories, some are possibly valid, others very obviously not.Categorizing these things together as has been done in recent years makes no sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using the alpha for the past 2 weeks, and I&#39;m blown away. Copilot guesses the exact code I want to write about one in ten times, and the rest of the time it suggests something rather good, or completely off. But when it guesses right, it feels like it&#39;s reading my mind.It&#39;s really like pair programming, even though I&#39;m coding alone. I have a better understanding of my own code, and I tend to give better names and descriptions to my methods. I write better code, documentation, and tests.Copilot has made me a better programmer. No kidding. This is a huge achievement. Kudos to the GitHub Copilot team!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was an undergrad at CMU, I learned how to work hard. Really hard. After having coasted through too-easy high school, I spent all day every day at CMU either programming, doing mathematics, or thinking about one of those things (to great effect: often the trick to prove a theorem would pop into my head while showering or while taking a walk). I would fall asleep while programming in the middle of the night, dream about programming, then wake up and continue programming just where I left off.One thing from this essay really stuck out to me:&gt; The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working without anyone telling you to. Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarm bells go off.One thing that always happened at the end of a semester is we&#39;d have a few days after exams but before flights back home. On these days I&#39;d typically try playing a video game (my hobby before college) and every time I would stop playing after just an hour with deep feeling of unease at the pit of my stomach. &#34;Alarm bells&#34; is exactly how I would describe it - a feeling at the core of my psyche that I have been wasting time and there must be something productive I should be doing or thinking about.Years later, having tackled anxiety problems that had plagued me most of my life, I came to recognize that my relationship with hard work during my college years was not healthy and that this deep seated desire to do more work is not a positive thing, at least not for me.I&#39;ve since reformed my ambitions, instead of looking to start a company or get a PhD in mathematics, I&#39;ve decided that hard work is not the love of my life and instead I should focus on my hobbies while looking for a career path that can be simultaneously fulfilling but laid back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked my way through college as a mover (and came out the other side with high 5-figure debt). Many of the older guys I worked with had drug habits. I worked 16-hour days with those guys. They&#39;d get on me for not running up stairs, for packing with too little paper around glass, for setting things down more than once. None wrote articles entitled &#34;How to Work Hard.&#34; None knew Warren Buffet as a child (see Gates). None attended the most expensive schools, if they had they certainly wouldn&#39;t have chosen to drop out because they got bored or were unfulfilled (see Graham and Zuck). Take a look at the top 10 highest valued YC startups. All their founders came from schools with less than 10% acceptance rates.Privilege is what I&#39;m getting at. Having an income 300:1 your lowest paid employee is disturbing. Making millions or billions off speculative, debt-fueled VC is disturbing. Proselyting your brand of success is disturbing. Recommendation: every time a founder, investor or businessperson starts to wax poetic on virtue, look for an angle. Why do founders want to appear virtuous and hardworking? Why do we need that from them? How else can they justify making sometimes up to 50% of their companies entire payroll? How emotionally satisfying must it be for Graham and his ilk to tell you why they got what they have?What if most of serious wealth and success is decided at birth?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It was similar with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but his dedication and his desire to win.I can assure you, there are many kids that practice harder than Messi did when he was young. He is not a great player because of hard work, he is a great player because of luck. I know the VC thing about the importance of hard work. They love to promote hard work because that&#39;s how they make money. It&#39;s just plain silly to attribute Messi&#39;s greatness to anything other than luck - both his physical abilities and the environment that taught him how to fine tune his abilities.Hard work is useless without that special precise knowledge of which work you should be doing. Few young soccer players know how to practice in a way to become Messi, even if they have the right body to do it. It&#39;s useless without being in the right environment too.&gt; Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarm bells go off. I can&#39;t be sure I&#39;m getting anywhere when I&#39;m working hard, but I can be sure I&#39;m getting nowhere when I&#39;m not, and it feels awful.That, my friends, is what a VC would love for you to believe. There&#39;s nothing sincere when someone in his position writes something like this. Because hey, if you&#39;re the 0.1% of the time that it works out, he gets rich. And if you&#39;re the 99.9% that wastes their time (like all the kids that never play soccer at the highest levels) he loses nothing.I used to enjoy PG&#39;s writings. He&#39;s crossed a line where he believes that the only thing good in the world is what is best for VCs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not all that great blaming the victim. They clearly made the right moves with at least some of their configuration decisions and leaned on the underlying platform not being bonkers (but alas, it was: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/4737 and https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/22054).Should they have hardened in all the other ways for defense in depth, e.g requiring authentication from localhost? Sure. Should the attacker have not done the attack? Without a doubt. But should docker have not completely undone a security control?Yes, and the fact that docker seems to have persisted with the current state is the topic of discussion.Previously: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27613217"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Network services really should have auth by default even if they only bind to localhost. There’s so many ways that a localhost service can become accessible to attackers. Any process with network access, no matter what user it’s running as, can access a localhost service - UNIX sockets on the other hand can be restricted by the usual user/group permissions. A localhost service can be exposed by e.g. an SSRF bug from a web server on the same machine. Or, accessed by a browser on the same machine browsing untrusted sites (an attack model for desktop services which open local ports), and so on. (In case you believe that the HTTP protocol  restriction in the latter two cases protects you - protocol smuggling over HTTP is frighteningly effective!)Of course, as seen here, a network service binding to more than localhost is strictly more exposed - and auth should be required in those cases (even when the service should ostensibly be LAN-only).Secure-by-default is the best kind of security."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crap like this is why I dont run docker.  I&#39;m glad RedHat took a principled stance on it and dropped it. Podman doesn&#39;t punch holes you didn&#39;t ask for in your firewall.  What a ludicrous anti-feature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When they work well, they&#39;re really good, but when they work badly, they&#39;re _really_ bad.The other week, I went for dinner at a place that had a online ordering system. My experience was as follows...Arrive at the table, scan the QR codeNo phone signal in the restaurant, so I need to connect to the wifi.Connect to the wifi, get a captive portalNeed to put my phone number in to connect to the wifi; there is no signal, so I need to go outside, to receieve the confirmation code.Connected to the wifi, scan the code again, choose my food.Go to pay, need to register an accountPut my email address in, I already have an account on this food ordering service!?Do a password resetPut in my credit card details (why not use apple pay?).This whole time, we&#39;re sat at a table, in theory to meet friends, but we&#39;ve spent the first 15 minutes all glued to our phones!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s really interesting to see how a crowd of tech workers who generally are trying to pave the way are so quick to attack and be negative.Like all things in life, when its implemented well it works and when it does not it is terrible. I still think there is room for this to be the future though. I say this as a westerner but perhaps the west is not ready for it yet but I really enjoyed the experience of using QR codes in China. Go to a restaurant I just get shown where to sit and don&#39;t need to waste time with the host/server giving me menus or telling me anything. If I have questions they are there to answer the but I can also just sit down, scan the QR code, menu opens up and I can order food. Food just shows up minutes later. When I am done I go to the front and pay with Alipay.The benefits to me of not having physical menus is huge. From the business perspective there is less interaction time necessary to serve a diner. Sure if this is an upscale high touch experience physical menu is where it stays BUT the majority of dining experiences are not like this. The menu is up to date and easy to modify. Possible to include multiple pictures and information about the food.I might be wild but I really like the experience and wish more places would adopt it. Like all things I think here in the west its still too new so we have a mixed bag of good and bad implementations. Give it a few years and I think it will be narrowed down to the POS providers who offer it as a feature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I gotta say, I disagree with this piece. I, for one, love QR code menus. I can pinch zoom rather than squint at a menu with small/unreadable fonts in dim lighting. I don&#39;t need to badger the already exhausted wait staff on a busy night when they forget to drop us a menu or two. When orders are taken online, rather than awkwardly force a friend to not go to the bathroom (or take their kid to the bathroom) until a server can take their order, they can just order and then go. I do think restaurants should handle payment themselves and have the option for paper menus or menus posted on a wall if needed, but otherwise I&#39;m a fan."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more concerning security finding here is that Google sat on this for 9 months. Assuming the claims hold, this is a serious problem for any security-conscious GCP customers. What other vulnerabilities are they sitting on? Do they have processes in place to promptly handle new ones? Doesn’t look like it…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While there are a series of vulnerabilities here, none of them would be exploitable in this way if the metadata server was accessed via an IP instead of the hostname metadata.google.internal.The metadata server is documented to be at 169.254.169.25, always[1]. But Google software (agents and libraries on VMs) resolves it by looking up metadata.google.internal. If metadata.google.internal isn&#39;t in /etc/hosts, as can be the case in containers, this can result in actual DNS lookups over the network to get an address that should be known.AWS uses the same address for their metadata server, but accesses via the IP address and not some hostname[2].I&#39;ve seen Google managed DNS servers (in GKE clusters) fall over under the load of Google libraries querying for the metadata address[3]. I&#39;m guessing Google wants to maintain some flexibility, which is why they are using a hostname, but there are tradeoffs.[1] https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance...[3] This is easily solvable with Kubernetes HostAliases that write /etc/hosts in the containers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it certainly seems like a fairly serious vulnerability I think it&#39;s worth highlighting that this attack requires that either you already have access to a machine on the same subnet as the target machine or that the firewall in front of the target machine is very lax. That&#39;s a pretty high bar for getting the attack to work in the wild."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not surprising really.A few years back Hotmail/Outlook were returning people&#39;s Twitter/LinkedIn handles for emails sent/received. It had been noticed you could scrape that fairly easily at scale. With one email account you could check up to 30000 email addresses before being flagged by Outlook.Slightly longer ago you could simply iterate 1...n on LinkedIn URLs to find someone&#39;s profile, by converting the number to base12, you&#39;d be redirected to the person&#39;s public URL.Also their bulk contact upload. Take any data leak of email addresses, bulk upload them as contacts and then correlate email addresses to social profiles.Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are all bad in that regard on the last method, though Facebook at least do not return people&#39;s URLs along with your contact upload (you&#39;re expected to know the person&#39;s face/name to decide whether you&#39;d want to connect). The take away is that once you sign up, whatever information you put on your profile/account is pretty much available to anyone who wants it enough - and clearly there are plenty bad actors who want it. Obviously these social networks want to expand their network, but they also make it much more easy for data harvesting at unprecedented scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, I&#39;ve been scrubbing my social profiles. LinkedIn, Yelp, Facebook, etc.Barest of bones. Removing all connections, photos, posts, personal details. (I know the damage is already done. The aggregators never really delete anything.)Why not just out right delete my profiles? I&#39;m squatting. To ensure they&#39;re not used as socket puppets.After a beloved coworker passed, their profile got highjacked. Ten years later, I&#39;m still so angry about it that I could just spit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dropped out of my PhD because I could not stand the pressure of having to do talks regularly. Even though I was pretty decent at it (I was told my delivery was fine and clarity was superb), and sometimes felt good (&#34;powerful&#34; for lack of a better word) while on stage, I would worry for months before every presentation, then basically get physically sick for weeks before, and take some weeks more to recover.Then one poster I submitted got upgraded to a talk, which brought me over the tipping point, and I quit.I keep wondering if I could have done more to desensitise myself to it, but the anxiety was never decreasing, if anything, it was getting worse each time. I tried therapy, medication, Toastmasters, martial arts classes and dance lessons (which became my hobby, incidentally), and even vocal lessons (since I was particularly self-conscious about my voice), all to no avail.So now I have a co-founder to do all and any public speaking, and I do not plan to put myself in front of a crowd ever again. But I feel I&#39;m missing a part of life by it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, it&#39;s somewhat ironic then that during my early software career (20+ years ago), Fowler&#39;s lucid writing helped me through a lot of the anxiety, insecurity and impostor syndrome I experienced.His work introduced me to eXtreme Programming, UML, Refactoring and more. Much of the agile tooling used nowadays are a consequence of effort he and the groups he was a part of put forth. The book Analysis Patterns is very underrated IMO and was a breath of fresh air after futzing around with the SAMS Teach Yourself series books that were undeservingly popular back then.I think of Fowler as a virtuoso when it comes to explaining practical software matters. I haven&#39;t watched much of his talks, but I&#39;ve read most of his books and PLoP papers.I&#39;m glad he&#39;s going to focus more on writing and helping others with theirs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, these are classic panic attacks.Usually the stressor is obvious, but sometimes it&#39;s not and it&#39;s something you&#39;ve left unresolved that your subconscious gets caught up on from time to time.It might not be the talks themselves. It could be anything.If you&#39;ve never had a panic attack before and start getting these, it literally feels like you&#39;re going to die the first time you get one. Then you get used to them and start adjusting.I went through a period of panic attacks after acquisition talks with a giant corp fell through. I was messed up for years after that, with random panic attacks at all times of day.I worked on returning myself to my previously chill demeanor and haven&#39;t had one for many years now.I also stopped answering any VC/BizDev/CorpDev emails though. lol. But mostly out of a desire to optimize my time use for things that actually matter.Good luck Martin. Covid has certainly put the value of living the life you truly want for yourself into perspective and I hope you achieve that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"link to court ruling PDFhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some choice quotes from the ruling:&gt; The FTC is apparently unwilling to allege that Facebook has ever (pre- or post-Instagram acquisition) had something like 85% or even 75% market share; instead it hedges by offering only that the number is somewhere north of 60%.  The question naturally arises: which firms make up the remaining 30–40%? Although Plaintiff is correct that it is not required to identify every alleged competitor in its pleadings, its choice to identify essentially none is striking.&gt; The Court’s decision here does not rest on some pleading technicality or arcane feature of antitrust law.  Rather, the existence of market power is at the heart of any monopolization claim.  As the Supreme Court explained in Twombly, itself an antitrust case, “[A]district court must retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.” Here, this Court must exercise that power.  The FTC’s Complaint says almost nothing concrete on the key question of how much power Facebook actually had, and still has, in a properly defined antitrust product market.  It is almost as if the agency expects the Court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a good TLDR from WSJ:&gt; Judge Boasberg said the FTC’s lawsuit was “legally insufficient” because it didn’t plead enough allegations to support monopolization claims against Facebook. The judge, however, said the commission can try again and gave it 30 days to attempt to file an amended lawsuit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like terrible news :( After the focus on monetization of platforms such as udemy and coursera, edx seemed to give me a sliver of hope that education will be open. Given the immense trust funds held by Harvard and MIT, I had hoped money would not be a factor and these institutions would be able to develop their platform in the open.I&#39;d like to add .. non-profit does not mean free to end users. There are many good non-profits and there are many terrible ones (highly paid execs, insane amount of money spent on marketing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sad that all education endeavours eventually turn for-profit and then the goals get misaligned.Produce as many courses at as minimum cost as possible.
Enroll as many people as possible without regards for completion percentage.
Create an economy where random people are incentivised to create courses and then the course quality tanks.I wish this turns out differently.Even Udemy and Coursera have become commericialised with edX the last major standing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a huge bummer. edX was the prime example I would hold up when people said &#34;remote learning is terrible&#34;. Several of the courses I took on there ranked among some of the best classes I&#39;ve ever taken, in-person or otherwise.I agree with another commenter in that I had hoped it would persist since 1) education is ostensibly the business of Harvard and MIT and 2) Their pockets are deep enough to think long-term.I will admit that I haven&#39;t used it much in the past few years. Had been getting turned off by the credential chasing and access disappearing after some time.Tough to see an excellent path forward from here. I&#39;ve never heard of this 2U firm."</p>

I think the &#34;war on drugs&#34; charade has gone long enough and it&#39;s time to actually do the right thing. Stop targeting minorities with this stupid war and legalize ALL drugs. Period. Offer rehab programs + make sure that whatever is on the market is safe and the effects are well documented and understood."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This should be the way everywhere. There is no reason for weed to be illegal when tobacco is legal. I don&#39;t smoke either but I support legalisation or at the very least decriminalisation. At least that way the countries can get tax money and also help people who need counselling instead of charging them with unnecessary crimes. They did this in the Australian Capital Territory. Hopefully they&#39;ll legalise it in most states."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unbelievable that in 2021 Cannabis is still a Schedule 1 Drug but Alcohol and Tobacco are responsible for more death and have killed more people in America than all the Wars.https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/features/excessive-alcohol-death...&gt;Excessive alcohol use is responsible for more than 95,000 deaths in the United States each year, or 261 deaths per day.https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/index.htm&gt;Each year, nearly half a million Americans die prematurely of smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke. Another 16 million live with a serious illness caused by smoking. Each year, the United States spends more than $225 billion on medical care to treat smoking-related disease in adults.Our Government is a Kakistocracy. I really don&#39;t believe the current administration will legalize it and any election promises were lies."</p>

When news articles consist of a bunch of embedded Instagram crap, it doesn&#39;t even load on vanilla firefox.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is sadly part of a dark pattern called &#34;stickiness&#34;. You can dress it up as functionally useful or even important but ultimately it is about companies wanting to create enough of a dependency that you have to continue using them, which is anti-competitive.Gone are the days where you bought something from a shop with no stickiness other than good service brought you back. Now there are far too many Marketing Managers who see stickiness as a win, even though the win is only to the supplier and not to the customer.It is similar to those web sites who ask you whether you want &#34;notifications&#34; from them in your OS! Nope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft has been using this dark pattern for a while now.Around 1-2 years ago, I upgraded MS Office on my Windows laptop. It asked me for my username/password-- which I didnt think strange, as I assumed it needed it to upgrade.And thats when I got a message &#34;Good news! Your Windows machine now uses your Microsoft to login.&#34;W.T.F.I was never asked, never warned, just tricked into replacing my local login with an online one.Took me 10-20 minutes of Googling to get my original setting back.I have now turned off ALL updates for Windows-- it is my backup machine, for a few programs that only run on Windows.Every update on Windows scared me (and still does), as I dont know what dark pattern they will try this time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a candidate for an even better reason:I have no reason to believe that Microsoft will not pull a Google and start spuriously locking people out of their accounts (as happens every few months on HN), which may then prevent me from logging in to my own computer.In fact, I&#39;ve already been locked out of my Microsoft account for &#34;suspicious activity&#34; (which was literally just purchasing Minecraft) and was required to enter a phone number to unlock it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My guess as to why it&#39;s successful is that it&#39;s always been moderately priced and Huy Fong is recognized as the originator of the &#34;Americanized Sriracha&#34; sauces.If a company tries to sell a cheaper version - then it feels like a cheap knock-off. And as everybody can afford to buy the original, why wouldn&#39;t you?If a company tried to sell a more expensive premium product in flashier packaging - then it would feel inauthentic. What are you paying more for?Plus whilst they&#39;ve not paid for advertising, they&#39;ve performed an excellent job of ensuring I&#39;m aware of their history. I&#39;ve no idea of the history of say Tabasco or Franks - but I&#39;ve many times heard the history of this plucky little immigrant founded company (and this thread is just a continuation). Maybe the key is to just have a likable story - and let others tell it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The part that strikes me is that they still have the same 10 distributors since the 80&#39;s.The &#34;local Chinese restaurant&#34; is a much more franchised thing than most people are aware of, and those 10 distributors meant it already ended up throughout the country and allowed everyone to try it for free. This is likely the secret to it&#39;s success.The only similar product I can think of is Mountain Dew Baja Blast. Though it did get some advertising, by automatically being available in every Taco Bell it became a minor craze. It&#39;s not an easily reproducible concept though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;No trademark&#34; is misleading. They have trademarks. Without them I expect exact clones would take their sales. The bottle and logo are quite distinctive and trademarked. The thing they didn&#39;t trademark is the name Sriracha."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recommend the excellent video by Youtuber Tom Scott &#34;YouTube&#39;s Copyright System Isn&#39;t Broken. The World&#39;s Is.&#34; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jwo5qc78QUWhile I agree with the OP in broad strokes  (they clearly have the right to post and profit off their performance), I find that the vast majority of comments on Youtube&#39;s copyright claim system fail to even acknowledge major aspects of the problem.  Perhaps Youtube&#39;s practical monopoly does it a disservice here, and it&#39;s hard to separate &#34;big self publishing video platform&#34; problems with Youtube specific problems.Without a system like YT currently has, it would get absolutely sued into oblivion by rightful copyright complaints.  This is in many ways is a problem of copyright law not being designed with modern technology in mind.  I think a good first step would be a way for copyright owners to be punished for broadly overreaching with their claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve said that in a comment about a similar article recently, and it needs to be repeated here:  Google is actually helping big players to harass small groups into submission.  And they are using their copyright system as a weapon.  But nobody questions the sloppy execution of that self-declared law enforcement.  I guess they are deliberately trying what they can get away with, to set the ground for future harassment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bloomberg article with existing discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27651730"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought it was worth clarifying exactly what has happened here, since neither the BBC nor the FT articles make it particularly clear.The entity that the FCA has acted against is Binance Markets Limited (BML) which the parent Binance Group acquired earlier this year, in part because of its existing registration with the FCA which allowed it to carry out a limited range of regulated activities in the UK.The FCA has now placed restrictions on BML which remove its ability to carry out those regulated activities -- however BML was not actually doing any business in the UK so the effect of this is limited.The FCA also issued a consumer warning which, among other other things, reiterated that no entities in Binance Group are registered with the FCA and therefore cannot carry out regulated activity in the UK. Again, the impact of this is limited since the entity that you interact with when using the Binance.com website is not based in the UK, and the FCA does not have jurisdiction over it.A possibly outcome is that Binance will be a bit more circumspect about offering derivatives trading to UK retail because they want to build a more substantial UK business in the future. We saw this with Bybit a while ago, where they do not allow UK retail to use their website (although they have an exception for sophisticated investors, who can self-certify as an eligible counterparty and continue to trade on Bybit). I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; While the FCA does not regulate crypto-currencies, it does regulate cryptoassets. Firms must be authorised [...]to advertise or sell such products in the UK.&gt; This means that people in the UK are not allowed to use Binance&#39;s services to speculate, or bet&gt; However, they are still allowed to use the website to purchase and sell crypto-currencies, which is not regulatedSo, all is well, just don&#39;t bet, speculate. Just buy and sell?"</p>

I was even on their website 24 hours ago. However, for the life of me I can&#39;t find anything &#34;open&#34; about the Open Insulin Foundation.Could someone please point me in the right direction where I can read anything with more substance than a news article quoting an interview?EDIT: Just to clarify. We&#39;re extremely fortunate that we&#39;re in Australia. Insulin is affordable/subsidised here, my daughter&#39;s CGM (and sensors) are free, and anything else we need is heavily subsidised too. I&#39;ve no intention of biohacking anything to do with my daughter&#39;s Type 1.I&#39;m  asking the above mostly because I&#39;m curious. Admittedly I find it a bit scary that I know so little about the manufacturing of something that is 100% vital to my daughter&#39;s survival. I&#39;d like to know more."</p>

Instead, you need to grow your own grains and build a windmill first. Sounds ridiculous in 2021."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the source:
&#34;The high rate of magnesium deficiency now postulated [5,6,7,8] can be attributed in part to a steady decline in general magnesium content in cultivated fruits and vegetables, a reflection of the observed depletion of magnesium in soil over the past 100 years [11,12,13]. A report to Congress was already sounding the alarm as far back as the 1930s, pointing out the paucity of magnesium, and other minerals, in certain produce [14].&#34;The easiest of those references to link to is https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/view/journals/hortsci/44/1... :&#34;Three kinds of evidence point toward declines of some nutrients in fruits and vegetables available in the United States and the United Kingdom: 1) early studies of fertilization found inverse relationships between crop yield and mineral concentrations—the widely cited “dilution effect”; 2) three recent studies of historical food composition data found apparent median declines of 5% to 40% or more in some minerals in groups of vegetables and perhaps fruits; one study also evaluated vitamins and protein with similar results; and 3) recent side-by-side plantings of low- and high-yield cultivars of broccoli and grains found consistently negative correlations between yield and concentrations of minerals and protein, a newly recognized genetic dilution effect. &#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand this seems mostly to be about soil depletion. I&#39;m curious more generally if vegetables are also less nutritious because they are selectively bread for high water content and size. For example, its appeared to me for years that you vegetables you get on a Subway sandwich must have almost no nutritional content. They are all way paler than you&#39;d normally see, and super watery.Thinking about it, I suppose the vegetables may get that way from growing in poor soil, and Subway et al just buy those ones because they&#39;re cheaper"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The BBC more or less episode with James Wong is making me wonder if this is true (shorter summary of what James said on the podcast: https://mobile.twitter.com/Botanygeek/status/984708381507276... )Anyway, from the paper here:&gt;&gt; with estimates that vegetables have dropped magnesium levels by 80–90% in the U.S. (Figure 2) and the UK [11,12,13,32,33]Reference 11 doesn’t support this claim.Ref 12 doesn’t directly mention Mg but does say some nutrients have dropped between 5-40% which is NOT 80-90%Ref 13 does mention mg specifically on page 3 but states under 20%.…I think i’m being fleeced by this paper."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This post for info purposes only having worked with the Amazon app store team and does not reflect my opinions at all, I haven&#39;t spent time thinking about if it&#39;s good or bad:The resigning stuff is because they alter the apps to fix dependence on Google play apis and gsuite apis. Developers were not interested in rebuilding their apps for fire and other devices without those apis baked in and this was a good solution to ease uptake for fire/Amazon app store.Also note that ms will control this android os, so they already control the signature verification method. They could do this without you knowing very easily by just with something like carrying a second sig and hash of what they modified and the original partial sums from the original app. Google and amazon or any os supplier can.Signature verification is only as strong as the verifier code.Glad to burn karma to put data out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is indeed worrisome, I’m not really sure Microsoft is any better than Amazon from a pure end-user point of view.Microsoft has been a telemetry champion and has been collecting troves of personal data through Windows 10, all the while making it almost impossible for the average user to disable it (and re-enabling it with every major update).So if Microsoft goes the same route as Amazon (resigning every app), it’s just a matter of choice between a rock and a hard place.  
On the other hand, even if they allow for the app developer to keep its signature, Microsoft is still probably very capable of gathering data and telemetry through their Android implementation.Either way, and until it becomes illegal to collect data without explicit consent, I’m pretty sure we’re screwed…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an American Jew who grew up with a distorted and racist world view in regard to Palestine this just feels like history repeating itself. The troubles that face Israelis have always been amplified over those of Palestinians in my experience. That control of the narrative led me to be actively racist for most of my life while thinking I was not and also morally superior. This kind of censorship has a body count, and it lets war crimes happen in clear view while the on lookers think they are doing the right thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, criticism of Israel&#39;s policies started being called anti-antisemitism.[1] That made it OK to censor criticism of Israel.
Israel&#39;s policies got more divisive under 12 years of Netanyahu, and there&#39;s more reason to be critical of them.  Those two trends are in collision.[1] https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/criticism-of-israel-is-anti-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One of the charges brought against them was that “their nationalistic sentiment” posed a threat to “state security.”Reprehensible. But when you have powerful enough friends it turns out it&#39;s perfectly acceptable. There will always be someone else out there to serve as the &#34;greater evil&#34; cover and this is a great disservice to the world, as crimes against humanity are just swept under the rug.&gt; Social media, our last remaining avenue for exposing the violence, was aiding and abetting Israeli crimes against us. Our documentation and testimonies of the violence we faced from Israeli settlers were shut down by tech companies far from Palestine. This included videos of mobs chasing Palestinians while screaming “Death to Arabs;” Israeli police firing live ammunition at unarmed Palestinians; the carpet bombing of Gaza;As long as western social media is almost entirely under US control one has to accept that everything there will dance to the tune made by and for the US and their closest interests. That much touted freedom of speech extends only as far as it isn&#39;t an inconvenience or embarrassment for those with the strings and levers. Carpet bombing civilians doesn&#39;t send a good message to be associated with the US by alliance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Aha moment for me came when I was watching Chef Jean-Pierre&#39;s video on the topic. His terminology is unfortunate, he uses &#39;caramelizing&#39; to refer to what we call &#39;browning&#39;, but otherwise he&#39;s taught me more about cooking than any other YouTube chef.There are two steps to caramelizing onions. Cooking, and browning. Cooking, that is, making them soft enough to eat, is what takes the most time. Most of the time when you use onions in a dish, they&#39;re browned first, then they finish cooking with the rest of the dish.But when you make caramelized onions by themselves, if you don&#39;t spend the time to cook them properly, they won&#39;t have the right texture, even if the flavor is close. Since texture carries flavor, browned onions just don&#39;t taste the same as caramelized ones.So Jean-Pierre separates the process of making caramelized onions into two steps. Cook the onions by leaving them tightly covered in a pot on very low heat, they poach in their own liquid. Leave them at least 45 minutes but since the heat is so low it&#39;s almost like sous vide where you can cook them as long as you need.Finally, you brown them in a skillet to desired color.Video for the interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o-u7zjlShQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading a lot of recipes and watching pictures/videos from same authors I learned that the description of browning is very subjective to the author.Very few recipes actually required onions browned through (as in entire volume) and if they actually do, the author will for sure mention it. Onions that are completely browned have very overpowering sweet aroma that is undesirable in most recipes except the ones that are built around it (like, famously, french onion soup or various caramelized onion dips).Vast majority of recipes actually require the onion to just get little hints of being gold in places or some gold just on the surface of it. That is enough to add flavor that will distribute once you add some liquid to it.From my experience most cooking book authors seem to be testing their recipes. Many times I have been frustrated by being unable to get the desired effect only to find some missing technique that the author very likely did not think important enough to mention or maybe difference in ingredients or measuring methodology.I have learned to prefer books that describe the methodology used by the author (for example how they measure things, how they make broth if they use one in recipe, etc.)I have also learned to search the book for a recipe that I already know and figure out if it agrees with my experience and if I would be able to make the recipe from that description.Another important point is that usually you need to understand particular cuisine from which the recipe comes to be able to make it faithfully. Every cuisine is a little small system of thinking about how to choose, process and combine ingredients. Recipes tend to be silent on a lot of stuff that is completely trivial to natives of particular cuisine.For example, I have been practicing Italian, Indian and Thai cuisines for the past 20 years. I can make Italian, Indian or Thai dish on a pinch from whatever I can find in my fridge and pantry but I still can&#39;t make convincing Creole dish even if I tried.(edit)If you are asking for best books for beginners, I suggest to skip books and rather research the recipe on Youtube. Watch couple of people doing the same thing -- this is going to provide much more valuable information than you could ever read in a book. This mostly because having visual reference of how it actually looked when the person was cooking it will give you immediate feedback when you are getting something wrong.It is still my preferred way of learning new kinds of dishes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a 3-dose protein vaccine. [1]&#34;The second of these candidates and the fourth from Cuba uses yeast as a receptor binding domain protein and alumina as an adjuvant.&#34; [2]I suspect there is a translation issue here. I would hope this means they are recombinantly expressing some portion of the RBD in yeast, not that they are using yeast as a vector.[1]

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent news but there&#39;s a translation error or misunderstanding in this article.&gt; The scientists are using yeast as a receptor-binding domain.I think they must mean they&#39;re using yeast as the protein expression medium and encode the receptor binding domain of the spike protein (along with the rest of the spike?) with yeast-y promoters and base sequence preferences. I guess there&#39;s nothing on the spike protein that needs to be glycosylated so non-mammal cell culture works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; According to the state-run biotech corporation, BioCubaFarma, Abdala has proven about 92.28% effective against COVID-19 in clinical trials, which would put it the same league as the most effective vaccines BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna. Huge applause erupted in the auditorium of the CIGB this week when the impressive results were announced.One thing to be careful about is the the regulating authority and the testing authority and the developing authority are all the same and have a huge incentive to have good numbers, not the least of which is national pride.I would be careful with those numbers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’d recommend High Performance Browser Networking by Ilya Grigorik[0].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Beej&#39;s Guide to Network Programming is IMO hands down the best resource I&#39;ve come across:
https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/It also doubles as a very great introduction to C, if that something you&#39;re interested in. It&#39;s funny because both C and socket level programming are often a barrier, or at least they were for me. It&#39;s an attestant to the quality of Beej&#39;s guide that he introduces both simultaneously, and makes it very approachable.This is one of those sources that helped me disproportionately grow as a programmer in a short period of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d recommend Kurose&#39;s Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach (now in 8th edition) book if you want to learn a proper computer networks concepts because this is the definitive textbook.If you want the practical aspects of computer networks, you can try Niall Manfields&#39; Practical TCP/IP designing, using and troubleshooting TCP/IP networks on Linux and Windows book.  Granted it&#39;s a bit old (2nd edition is essentially the same 1st edition), but because you are after the essentials it should be more than fine.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I strongly dislike Haskell&#39;s focus on theory. Just show me examples on how to get things done and then the concepts will become clear. The Haskell and mathematics communities too often act like ivory towers that humans have to become enlightened to understand, and that simply is not how my brain is wired. I&#39;m not sure of there have been any studies on the usability score of languages, but I think that Haskell would come out very, very poorly. There&#39;s a reason why python is so popular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After years of seeing people try to understand abstractions like a functor from the definition first, I’ve started to think it’s the wrong way to do it.This post helps on some of these points, like explaining that e.g. functors are not always containers.I’d love to see someone try taking it further: just hashing out lots and lots of substantially different examples, showing how they are similar to each other, and progressing into higher level transformations, before finally showing the definition of a functor, and how it maps to each of those cases. Forget monads. Can we just start with functors and see how far we get with that?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like these tutorials always fall apart when they start introducing Haskell syntax and say &#34;That&#39;s Monad, simple as that!&#34;  class Functor f where
    flip fmap :: f a -&gt; (a -&gt;   b) -&gt; f b
  class Monad m where
    (&gt;&gt;=) ::     m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b

Sorry, that&#39;s not doing much for me! I am now going to look for a tutorial on Monads that&#39;s written in, say, Python, so at least I don&#39;t have to learn an abstract new language alongside the abstract new concept."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"5 years ago I hit a burnout point and took a year off work. It was a huge perspective shift. I realized that my day-to-day of a rushed commute to work, a stressful and distracting office, thimble-deep coworker relationships and a life completely orientated around doing the above was an insane waste of my short time on Planet Earth. I reoriented my life around family, remote work, flexibility and balance. My quality of life has hugely improved and there is no turning back the clock.When I saw what the pandemic was doing to nearly every professional office worker, I figured it was just a matter of time before the resignations started flooding in. Everyone had a whole year &#34;pause&#34; to reevaluate if their lives were organized around their goals, and for millions, the answer was no. There&#39;s no putting this genie back in the bottle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first guy in the article is a dev. There&#39;s never been a better time to find work as a dev. Jobs are handing out more money with more flexibility than ever seen before. On top of it all, if your firm wants people back in the office soon, now is the time to do loads of remote interviews so that you can keep being remote.I was interviewing recently and almost everyone is at least partly remote, with a huge number of 100% remote. Even people that I know don&#39;t like the idea are bending and giving two or three days remote.On the restaurant-type work, I&#39;d say a bunch of people have been given a breather from the treadmill, and they&#39;re using it to look around. I see this as mostly positive, but it does suggest that a lot of people are completely swamped, working all the time, spending everything. The little bit of credit they got from the pandemic payment has unlocked a great reckoning with the labor market. Previously if you didn&#39;t like your job, you were screwed. Somehow find time to interview/upskill, or somehow jump the gap with your savings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m one of these. I&#39;m an allrounder software dev in his late fourties, &#34;lured&#34; into a non-software middle management position by the promise of money and stability a few years ago.In practice, the money has never materialized because our sector took a big hit and much of that promise was tied to incentives based on the company&#39;s success. I can&#39;t really blame anyone for this, but that&#39;s strike one as far as job satisfaction goes.Second strike, I love writing code, and I don&#39;t get to do that a lot anymore. I&#39;m listing these &#34;pre-existing conditions&#34; because I believe it&#39;s common for us quitters to have other areas of dissatisfaction that hadn&#39;t been enough to drive us over the edge by themselves.Third strike, while my company does not support WFH after Covid, I did get to experience at least a partial WFH program, and it was absolutely wonderful. There&#39;s a problem though: I would absolutely like to continue working from home, but I also want to work on my own projects, on my own terms, on my own schedule. A traditional full time job is not compatible with that.So I put in my notice for the end of this year, to allow current company projects to come to a conclusion and/or hand them off. I want to stress that for a man in my age group, with no significant savings or other safety net, this is extremely scary. It&#39;s just that this Angst is outweighed by the thought of staying on the treadmill hoping for an eventual reward that may never come and seeing the little time I have left drain away."</p>

I am responsible for / contributed to a few features like the current signup flow, AMP pages, push notifications, email digests, app download interstitials, etc.There was a new product lead who joined with many good ideas, but some of them were dark patterns that I heavily protested. After a few months of this, it was obvious that I was going to be reigned in or let go[0]; I immediately transferred to a different org.Now let me explain the other side of the story. 4 years later, Reddit&#39;s DAU, MAU, and revenue have all grown at ridiculous rates[1]. Yes, power users complain—and still continue using the site—but the casual user does not. These dark patterns have been normalized on other websites.These practices are done because it works._____0: They changed it so I would report to the product lead, which is odd for an EM to report into a product chain and the only instance within the company ever.1: Many friends are startup founders and I&#39;ve been at a few startups myself—a byproduct of being in the Bay Area—and Reddit&#39;s growth numbers are impressive.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It constantly amazes me how bad Reddit&#39;s interface is, videos either don&#39;t play or randomly start playing despite them not being in the viewport. They run random A|B experiments which add unnecessary components such as avatars next to peoples comments. Random acts of monetization are shoved down my throat at every turn. I honestly think the Reddit team are on a purpose built mission to design the most user hostile forum.I&#39;ve tried browsing Reddit in incognito on my phone before and it wouldn&#39;t let me without installing their app, thankfully old.reddit.com exists. From clicking on a search result to viewing an image post took ~8 clicks. The flow was analogous to:    -&gt; Click on search result 

    -&gt; ending on an AMP page and clicking the bottom sheet exit button to view the post in the browser rather than the app

    -&gt; clicking on the title to view the actual post in the non AMP format

    -&gt; ending up on the actual post and being told I need to view it in the app (which completely removes the point of using incognito)

    -&gt; changing the URL to old.reddit.com which is tedious with a phone keyboard 

    -&gt; finally load the page and click on the image"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve long thought about making a thread like this so I&#39;m happy to see it. Fed up with this actively user-hostile web experience to try and drive people to the app.My main gripe is definitely expanding comments -&gt; First of all, only the top comment will be shown. Then you can tap view more which will load another two. But you cannot open all the comments.Because the &#34;create an account to continue&#34; toast pictured is unclosable on my phone. Meaning not only can I not expand any more comments, but I can&#39;t even go back see other un-expanded comments. I need to refresh.Just an absolute rancid experience all around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I ran into this last week on my nvidia shield. Here&#39;s a summary of the workaround I found (apologies for not having the specific package names offhand):1. Install a new launcher from play store (I found one called &#34;Basic Launcher&#34; that matches the aesthetics of the default one). This doesn&#39;t solve the problem though, because Google disabled changing the default launcher for some user hostile reason, until you delete the existing launcher.2. Enable development mode by tapping on the build number in settings3. Connect an adb shell to your device4. Remove the built in launcher5. Reboot, select basic launcher when promptedI own a few android TV devices, have recommended them to people in the past, and won&#39;t be purchasing another. I think what happened here should be illegal and shame on whoever worked on this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am hopeful that now that the FTC has a pro-consumer Chair that some of these anti-consumer acts will be curtailed.I would also argue that some of these bad acts could be considered to be false / deceptive trade practices under the various state laws (in the U.S. at least). For example, some people would never have bought a FireTV cube for streaming video if Amazon had revealed that they would be adding advertisements to the consumer&#39;s video-viewing experience.But: how much incentive is there for individuals to file a small claims suit against Amazon for a $79 device? Generally speaking you might get treble damages but not much more unless you&#39;ve had actual damages.And although class action suits are frustrating and should be &#34;fixed&#34; so that those harmed get the bulk of the proceeds (i.e. it&#39;s not okay that consumers receive discount coupons or $10 checks while plaintiff&#39;s counsel receives a disproportionally huge payday) this is one thing we&#39;ve lost by generally not allowing class actions.David v. Goliath is not as effective as 15,000 Davids v. Goliath.Not to even mention the mandatory arbitration imposed on consumers (which do sometimes carve out the ability to file in small claims court).We have cultivated, or at least allowed, a very anti-consumer bias to take hold in U.S. law."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate to be that guy, but this is exactly why I happily paid for an Apple TV. Yes, it’s $100 more than basic streaming sticks, but I have never had to worry about ads suddenly appearing after an update. This whole space is a race to the bottom with sticks being sold at or below cost because you are the product. For example, Vizio revealing in their first quarterly report as a public company that they get nearly as much revenue from selling ads and viewer usage data than from selling physical televisions.https://www.engadget.com/vizio-q1-earnings-inscape-013937337...A smooth, clean ad-free experience is certainly worth the extra price if you can afford it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the era when system research is dying [1], the only saving graces are the Nix/Guix for OS management improvement and perhaps eBPF for OS performance enhancement. The Winix OS is a breath of fresh air in term of potential OS directions.Like they have always said, timing is everything and probably this is the project similar to Apple&#39;s Newton project that have many goods in it but just born several years too early.Winix targets RISC architecture and with RISC-V taking off exponentially at the very moment, having RISC biased OS will definitely provide edges and advantages for the platform, similar to x86 quirks to Linux, and Linux taking advantages when x86-32 and x86-64 took off.This year when Linus was asked for the best Linux achievement compared to other OS, Linus has pointed out the innovative Linux based lock-free filesystem [2]. Winix has built-in innovative POSIX compatible in-memory file-system (IMFS) by default.  Imagine an OS with IMFS that&#39;s also natively compatible with the increasingly popular Arrow and TileDB in-memory format.  With Terabyte (TB) RAM computers becoming the norm in the near future this can easily be the fastest OS with the state-of-the-art filesystem around. Fuschia is another latest OS on-the-block but by focusing on the mobile rather than desktop it will probably optimized for the former, unlike Winix.[1]https://tianyin.github.io/misc/irrelevant.pdf[2]https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/interview-linus-torvalds..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious about the hardware it runs on, and didn&#39;t immediately find answers on Google. Could you talk about what hardware is on a usual system and what device drivers need to do for screen, serial port, disk drives, etc.? Does the CPU use floating point?The reason I ask: for the past six months I&#39;ve been dipping my toes in OS development for x86 with BIOS, SVGA and ATA interfaces: https://github.com/akkartik/mu And I&#39;m way out of my depth. I have this suspicion that x86 might be one of the more difficult environments for device drivers, so I&#39;m curious to hear what other hardware looks like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I shared a co-working space with a guy who had written a distributed OS for rendering; it was quite neat - but about 1000 man years from being usable.I felt sad for him - he&#39;d poured his heart into it for more than 10 years (he said) and had no idea of how to turn it into anything other than a hobby project. He hadn&#39;t open sourced it, his aspiration was that &#34;Facebook will buy it&#34;. I haven&#39;t seen him since the pandemic kicked in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question- what is Google&#39;s exposure here?  Both Youtube and Google (Youtube&#39;s parent company) are blocked in China; those revenue streams were cut off a long time ago.  What does Google have to lose by letting Youtube keep the videos up?I&#39;m sure the exposure exists; I recognize that Googlers aren&#39;t stupid.  I honestly am just curious what that risk is.  Having lived in Shanghai for 5 years, I don&#39;t see China reversing their ban on either company anytime soon, so I&#39;m curious what carrot and/or stick China has left.So far, the one thing I can think of is their physical office presence in Beijing / Guangzhou / Hong Kong [0].  That risk is non-trivial- China could simply swoop in and arrest employees, either specific individuals or en masse (neither would surprise me).

About 975 videos have been moved so far.&#34;I think this is them?

His investigation into the Assange case is probably one of the best and most neutral takes on it, but if true also a really scary one [0][0] https://www.republik.ch/2020/01/31/nils-melzer-about-wikilea..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This principle is how pydantic[0] utterly revolutionized my python development experience. I went from constantly having to test functions in repls, writing tons of validation boilerplate, and still getting TypeErrors and NoneTypeErrors and AttributeErrors left and right to like...just writing code. And it working! Like one time I wrote a few hundred lines of python over the course of a day and then just ran it... and it worked. I just sat there shocked, waiting for the inevitable crash and traceback to dive in and fix something, but it never came. In Python! Incredible.[0] https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great post.  I come back to it frequently.There&#39;s beautiful clarity in the articulation, and the essence is easy to grasp yet powerful.  It reminds me a bit of Scott Wlaschin&#39;s Railway Oriented Programming (ROP) [0]. As a technique, ROP nicely complements &#34;parse don&#39;t validate&#34;.  As an explanation, it&#39;s similarly simple yet wonderfully effective.I&#39;ve a real admiration for people who can explain and present things so clearly.  With ROP, for example, the reader learns the basics of monads without even realising it.[0]: https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This principle can be applied to dynamic languages as well if you have some mechanism such as type hinting, pre-conditions etc. that are checked by a linter during development, even if it isn&#39;t, you can still use it at runtime with sufficient error handling.The essential point of this blog post is to avoid &#34;shotgun parsing&#34;, where parsing/validating is done just from a procedural standpoint, where it matters when exactly it happens. In the paper &#34;Out of the Tar Pit&#34; it is asserted that this leads to &#34;accidental complexity&#34; (AKA &#34;pain and anxiety&#34;), which is something every programmer has experienced before, possibly many times.I&#39;ve become a fan of declarative schema to (json-schema/OpenApi, clojure spec etc.) to express this kind of thing. Usually this is used at the boundaries of an application (configuration, web requests etc.) but there are many more applications for this within the flow of data transformations. If you apply the &#34;parse don&#39;t validate&#34; principle you turn schema-validated (sic!) data into a new thing. Whether that is a &#34;ValidatedData&#34; type or meta data, a pre-condition or runtime check says more about the environment you program rather than the principle in discussion. The benefit however is clear: Your code asserts that it requires parsed/validated data where it is needed, instead of when it should happen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The concepts in the article sound foreign to me - they are, since I live in the EU. In Central European countries, most houses are built to last 80-150+ years. People like to use bricks, aerated concrete or specially treated wood that will last for a very long time. There are other systems too, like walls filled with small clay pellets mixed with concrete. Houses built in such a way are quite expensive, usually €300k or more for a typical family home where I live. That leaves some room for prefab (Fertigteilhaus) to be cheaper, contrary to what OP wrote.There are small model cities you can visit where several dozen prefabbers exhibit their current model homes, and if you stick to their plan, you will usually pay less than building on your own. Those are often built on wood frames, but are still quite sturdy and supposed to last at least 100 years. Others are built with bricks or aerated concrete just like individually built homes. Savings are probably achieved by bulk orders, prefab, and a well coordinated team who has built the exact same house ten times already."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great essay. This is a much more sophisticated analysis of construction efficiency than you typically find; most of them basically imply that construction is inefficient because contractors are dumb.One minor comment: balloon framing is not a synonym for light wood framing, it&#39;s a (mostly archaic) version of it. Balloon framing features long exterior wall studs that extend up multiple stories, as opposed to modern &#34;platform framing&#34;, in which the studs stop at each floor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently read Gates’ book How To Avoid a Climate Disaster which left me with the impression that the overriding factor in building costs is the energy required (and CO2 produced) for construction, heating, and cooling.Unfortunately I didn’t see any mention of energy or carbon in this post.Seems like the biggest breakthrough would be a pre-construction estimate of energy costs over, say, 30 years.  Similar to the Energy Star sticker on appliances sold in the US which tell you the cost to run a given appliance with typical usage compared to the range for other models.This would allow you justify spending more upfront for better insulation, HVAC, air sealing, etc. and recoup that over time.  At scale this would allow our civilization to be more energy efficient and reduce the need to build more power plants.This suggestion stood out:
  ”...move to resistance heating and thermoelectric cooling“Unless I’m missing something, this would be a step backward. Modern heat pumps are 3-4x more efficient than resistance heating, since they aren’t creating heat but moving it from one place to another.  For cooling, if the author is referring to Peltier type thermoelectric cooling, the same applies: heat pumps are many times more efficient.The building revolution we need is one that cheaply produces extremely energy-efficient homes, IMO."</p>

It was similar to a dialog box in Windows 9x that said &#34;This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.&#34; Since the classic Mac OS offered little memory protection, an application crash would often take down the entire system.Unfortunately, the Mac&#39;s bomb dialog could cause naive users to jump up out of their seat and run away from the computer in terror, because they though it was going to explode!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQGX3J6DAGw&amp;ab_channel=Caitl...And Window&#39;s &#34;This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down&#34; error message was just as bad: it could cause naive users to fear they might get arrested for accidentally doing something illegal!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of those medical revolutions that I am waiting dearly for.Facilities that are not hospitals(to avoid the risk of  occupying medical devices that sick people need) built to _regulary_ check up otherwise healthy people for preventive care.Heck, I have so many alerts defined on my monitoring setup for servers to watch for signals of failure before they get too big. But, my own body is not observed until something bad needs treatment. Why can’t we observe ourselves medically and analyze that record for early signs of trouble before it becomes serious?!All the advancement in technology in recent years, this ought to happen sooner than later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"0.5% false positive rate is actually quite high. I don&#39;t have the numbers, but I&#39;d be surprised if more than 1% of the people that would receive such a screening actually already have cancer, which would mean that it produces about as many false positives as false negatives.Picture a population of a million people, all receiving the test. 1% of them have cancer (unknown to them) - half of those people get a negative screening result and half get a positive one (51% successful identification), and 0.5% of the full population get a negative screening result. Those numbers are roughly equal.That doesn&#39;t make it useless by any means, but it&#39;s not nearly as &#39;specific&#39; as it sounds on paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those interested in reading the actual paper, this appears to be it (open access too):https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(21)02046...I’ve only skimmed it, but seen quite a few limitations, notably those with “non-malignant conditions at enrolment” (it would be nice to know more what that means), previous cancer or recent corticosteroids use were excluded. Additionally, it’s a case controlled trial which don’t always translate to screening tools (as mentioned in their own discussion).The problem with screening is that you are doing something on healthy patients, so particularly for rare cancers even a small risk of a false positive is significant. In this case it’s 99.5%. So if you test 1,000,000 people, 5000 (*correction from 500) people will come up positive. This is great for common diseases, but if it’s rare and only 1 in a million has it then you have got 5000 false positive for every 1 positive.I think this will likely be a useful test (if it translates well to a wider screening population), but it’s not as good as it first seems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many years ago I added the feature to xbox.com to allow you to easily cancel your Xbox Live Gold subscription. We built a UX that was ideal for consumers - a couple of clicks, no &#34;Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll be missing...&#34; screens. It was awesome.Before this feature was released you had to call Xbox support to cancel.Once word spread that you could do it on the web, huge numbers of customers, that had been stuck paying for an Xbox Live Gold subscription they weren&#39;t using, began cancelling.So our PM got a call from a VP. We were instructed to remove it from the site immediately. We fantasized about telling the VP to stick it and quitting en masse, but we knew it wouldn&#39;t change anything. We&#39;d just be replaced by someone that would.So we complied, but we all lost a little bit of our faith in Xbox that day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was doing my taxes on taxact a year or two ago, when I noticed a small lag every time I switched fields.  Every time I went to the next field, a network request was being made to some third party analytics thing with the data I entered.Somewhere, in the back of my mind I know that all data I enter online is inevitably being hovered up and used for god knows what, but when you&#39;re suddenly made aware of it, it&#39;s really unnerving.Something about this makes me want to have a &#39;falling down&#39; moment.  Let me get this straight, not only is our tax system so complex and error prone i have to pay money to a third party to figure out how much I should be paying to our government, but the software company I pay then turns around and sells my data?  The government does nothing to remedy this?  It really goes to show who our government serves, and it sure as hell isn&#39;t &#39;the people&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related PSA: many customer support chat integrations on websites today give the rep a real-time view of all input changes before you actually send anything.Think twice before pasting unknown clipboard contents, typing while angry, etc. Best, explicitly copy your finalized reply from another app and paste it into the chat.(I confirmed that first hand when a support person replied to specifics of my message while I was editing the phrasing.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have worked in team with some kernel developers at Samsung, years ago, so let me put some perspective for those who do not understand the dynamics.In some companies, the amount of patents or Linux kernel patches you get accepted is direct measure of your success.As you know, whatever you measure becomes a target -- these guys feel very pressed to get ANY kernel commits accepted, no matter how small, irrelevant or nonsensical. Because in the very end almost nobody sees the amount of value that a company creates for Linux users. What everybody is looking at is that &#34;Company X is nth on the list of biggest kernel contributors&#34;.So &#34;KPI grabbing&#34; is meant to mean the practice of not caring for the value or quality of your contributions but rather for the count of the commits or LoC you can get accepted.This is damaging to Linux kernel developer community because it just creates work for maintainers without creating much or any value at all.These maintainers are absolutely critical resource for the project and their number and availability translates directly to how much stuff can actually be done. So no wonder people are irked by it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The year is 2050 and your dingy old toaster has finally given up it&#39;s last crumbs. You hop onto Amazon in hopes of finding a suitable replacement as there&#39;s no longer any box stores you can travel to. Dumb appliances have been phased out and newer internet connected appliances have taken over. It&#39;s better for the consumer they claim.Not wanting an overtly fancy contraption you pick a no frills unit that includes a touch screen along the side. A few hours later it arrives. Setting it up was almost as easy as your old one. Plug it in, enter your wi-fi password, and a credit card to start your free pro trial of the monthly subscription service that tweets at you when the toast is done. It says you can cancel at anytime but it requires a 5 day waiting period. It also requires access to your contacts.Tired and just wanting your toast you agree. You insert two slices of white bread and press the big red GO button on the touch screen. An electrical motor whines from inside the toaster at it begins to retract the toast into itself. There&#39;s a few seconds of silence as the toaster slowly heat ups. While awkwardly standing there you notice the touch screen flickers and begins to display a buffering icon. An ad for I Can&#39;t Believe it&#39;s Not Butter begins to play. To make matters worse you can&#39;t even ignore it by looking away due to a small tinny sounding speaker playing the company&#39;s jingle.This is your new morning routine.Welcome to the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not blame cooler screen for selling this technology to anyone. But I want everyone to consider how much it takes to bring about a technology like this to a grocery store.If this is any of the big chain groceries, the manager doesn&#39;t even have the authority to put a sticker on the glass door. This was vetted by hundreds of people and none of them thought... glass?Business class tickets were purchased, hotels were booked, months of back and forth, daily meetings. Hundreds of thousands were spent on pilot programs like this one. Still no one thought... glass?In my opinion, it&#39;s a silly idea. But I applaud the person who had this silly idea, built a company around it, got deals with screens, door, glass, and cameras manufacturing companies, and then convinced a grocery chain to buy this for their store.I would really, really love to have been in that sales pitch meeting.Edit: What bothers me the most about this, is that it will actually work. Any surface where eyes may fall on, will be replaced with an ad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone here who’s worked for some moderately large corporation knows exactly why this was done: it’s a flashy pet project for some “labs” team in an otherwise boring retailer and maybe they’ll recoup some of the cost in ads, minus whatever they lose for it being an awful idea. Some charismatic product manager sold it to execs as “being the future of connected retail” or some other BS. In a few months they’ll be removed because it’s a stupid idea.When the company that made these was analyzing their market, I have no doubt they were targeting this exact scenario knowing that even the stupidest products have a place to make a boring brick and mortar retailer think they’re doing technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve built robots. I&#39;ve built greenhouses. I like software and the occasional bit of farming. Thirs looks cute and fun, and I hope they iterate, but it&#39;s not really solving the right problems, and introduces its own.1 - there are no straight lines on a farm. Maybe in a hydro setup built on concrete slab, in which case, why robot?2 - needs a way to cover more ground. If it&#39;s not able to travel linearly indefinitely in one direction along a bed, there&#39;s no way to scale.3 - grit. Precision CnC mechanisms and dirt do not mix. You can&#39;t keep farm things clean (unless hydro, and even then, things get wet and caked with fertilizer salt)Ditch the linear ways for something like bike tires. There&#39;s an open source solar farm robot which rolls around weeding (can&#39;t find at the moment, maybe was a video). Not limited by a box. They need robust mechanisms which can stand up to farm abuse and are easy to service, grease, and replace (unless you hermetically seal the components, which is harder than it sounds).Weeds are actually pretty easy to manage.If someone wants to make an impact in the farm tech space, come up with a cheaper alternative for scooping and dumping dirt. A ride-on tractor can be had used for $500-800. But as soon as you start talking loaders, it&#39;s $2-3000 used, and tens of thousands for new. Also the smallest tend to be a 4 foot wide bucket and a few hundred pounds lift. I want something half or a quarter of that. Able to scoop 50 lbs of dirt, repeatedly, and dig holes/trenches. That would have a massive impact in agrarian communities around the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know cnc and farming, and I really don&#39;t see this product surviving. I can&#39;t find a shovel that lasts more than a few months on my small farm, I don&#39;t know how a big 3d printer is going to cut it in anything like real agricultural conditions. I would love to be wrong though, garden robots would be great, especially if they had lasers for slugs. Actually, forget the rest of the robot, all I really want is a slug laser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh hey this is my industry (robots in agriculture).I don&#39;t like this. It feels way too &#34;Juicero&#34; to me. Too cute, to inconsequential. It feels likely one would spend more time on building and maintaining this thing than work it actually saves and a significant amount the benefit of having a garden is working it with you hands and watching that work grow in fruition.Bots in the farm though, they are the real deal. Reducing herbicide use by 80% or more, allowing the use of non-GMO crop while maintaining strong weed control and healthy crop, treating and optimizing every individual plant in a field, all things that will happen in the next 10 years due to robotics in the farm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I published my first Steam game on Linux as well as Windows and MacOS, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do it again because for a single person developer (as indie as it gets) the time spent supporting Linux doesn&#39;t pay off. Within days of publishing my game I had support request emails that said &#34;so I&#39;m on this specific Red Hat version, with this oddball graphics driver and three monitors and full-screen doesn&#39;t work with your game properly&#34;. As I only officially supported Ubuntu I couldn&#39;t really help each exotic (to me) setup that came into my email inbox, and there was more than a few. Which I still think is a shame.But that was five years ago. I&#39;m pretty sure Photon supports my Windows builds on Linux better than I was ever able to do with the native executables, and at least there&#39;s that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a Steam Dev Days event I hit up a dev from a popular flight sim that ran on Win/Mac/Linux and asked him to rank the support costs for different platforms. I was surprised by his answer. He said:Mac users were effectively the most expensive because his team was (then) spending a lot of time porting their graphics code to Metal.Linux users were the least expensive because they tended to be sophisticated users who were accustomed to solving their own problems. He cited a particular customer who he said had a solid track record of finding graphical glitches in the game, then opening bugs against Intel GPU drivers and getting them fixed.Windows users were somewhere in between.Of course we didn&#39;t discuss the opportunity cost of supporting Linux (financially probably not worth it), I&#39;m not sure how much his view was a function of (maybe) not having to personally answer support requests, or whether his experience could be generalized beyond his particular customer demographic, but I learned quite a bit from his response.==========If I ever ship my own game I hope to support Linux not because I think it&#39;s the right financial move, but because I think offering cross-platform compatibility is just part of being a good digital citizen. A lot of us lived through a time where Windows was about the only game in town, and I don&#39;t want to ever go back there. (Plus there&#39;s a selfish element: I develop on Linux, so I want to play on Linux!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I shipped a tiny game on Steam developed entirely in GNU/Linux with Windows/MacOS/Linux builds all produced from within GNU/Linux without virtualization of other OSes.MINGW covered the Windows build, clang/osxcross for the MacOS build, and plain old gcc for Linux.  It&#39;s all oldschool autotools+pkg-config dances for the cross-compilation.  Plain C and SDL2+OpenGL under the hood, no engine.It&#39;s nice being able to do it all from my preferred GNU/Linux environment, and I was able to at least smoke test the windows builds successfully via WINE.  The main shortcoming currently is there&#39;s no MacOS WINE-equivalent that&#39;s mature enough to run a graphical GPU-accelerated video game AFAIK."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;re interested in buying and/or selling small projects, you can typically expect to pay more than $5k for something that&#39;s making any consistent amount of money.You&#39;re also unlikely to find a great deal on a really special project on a marketplace. People who post on marketplaces like Flippa or MicroAcquire or SideProjectors (there&#39;re dozens of them) have either:1. Realized the time it takes to maintain is not worth the revenues/profits2. Realized the income is not sustainable and are trying to cash out at the end of a great run3. Realized that some folks are willing to pay very high multiples and will list their projects at prices most (but not all) people will balk at.If you&#39;re really interested in taking over a project that&#39;s profitable, network with people, do cold emailing, and find opportunities to take over projects that the owners are simply not interested in any more.In other words, look for the elderly couple who is ready to move on from owning their profitable, outdated shop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My hair started graying pretty much as soon as I graduated from college. It makes a lot of sense now. Around the same time, I:- bought a house (in 2007, yeesh)- got married- started my first job (which at the time felt like drinking out of a fire hose)Shortly after, my wife and I went through the stress of trying and failing to get pregnant. Then infertility treatments for several months. Then my wife had surgery. Infertility treatments no longer an option, we turned to adoption. 6 weeks later (seriously), we brought home our first child.After that, it was like kids fell into our laps every couple of years. After the second child, I struggled with a pretty severe addiction that nearly claimed my marriage. Since then we&#39;ve adopted two more. We now have kids aged 12, 9, 6 and 4.Has it been all stress all the time? Not at all. I feel incredibly blessed to be living this life. But the hair (mostly on the sides) hasn&#39;t gone back to its normal color either, so I guess either it&#39;s genetic or there&#39;s an undercurrent of stress I&#39;ve just become accustomed to.Edit: formatting"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it was a coincidence but at my last job I was so insanely stressed and burnt out. My manager was terrible, treated me like an idiot, and my ideas were stifled day in and day out.I woke up one day and seemingly overnight my beard had a grey patch - almost white, in fact. It fell out in the week after.Almost a year and a half later, after leaving that job, I took the pandemic to really focus on my stress levels and be happier (I am). The grey patch is starting to fade away and some color is beginning to return. Certainly not the stark white that was there before, and definitely not grey either.Idk if I believe it, maybe something else was happening. But it sure seemed stress related at the time.EDIT: I&#39;m &lt; 30 and my family doesn&#39;t have a history of grey hair - quite the opposite. Forgot to mention this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stress is terrible.Work overloaded me and caused so much stress that I had stress-induced alopecia. My beard fell out in patches, and I had random patches of hair fall out on the back of my head, almost like perfect circles. Besides that, I couldn&#39;t really enjoy myself anymore, and I would often spend my non-work time vegetating.Then there&#39;s the teeth grinding and all the damage that comes with that.The hair came back, but the damage done to my teeth is not reversible.These are just the physical damages, the damages to mental health are either still on the mend or scarred."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google&#39;s Knowledge Graph info boxes are automatically-generated and littered with errors. I&#39;ve been burned twice on operating hours, once for my local bank and once for a convenience store, driving over each time only to find the place closed. In both cases, the correct hours were posted on the business&#39;s website. I&#39;ve also seen bad KG results for medical conditions, listing the wrong symptoms or describing easily-treatable maladies as &#34;Incurable&#34;. Now I actively ignore the info box and intentionally click through to an authoritative non-Google website.To a non-technical user, I&#39;m sure the box looks like a human-curated result which they&#39;re more likely to trust. Maybe that&#39;s the goal of Google&#39;s UI choices. Couldn&#39;t be further from the truth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should seriously consider suing for defamation if this isn&#39;t fixed within a few days.  This is an egregious error, especially if it was done by an automated system (and this could be a systemic issue affecting many others).I think you have a decent chance of getting a five figure+ settlement from this. Talk to a lawyer about your options.EDIT: When I search &#34;Hristo Georgiev&#34; (from US IP) there is no longer an image in the infobox. (As of 21:55:10 UTC, June 24, 2021)I think a google engineer saw this HN post :-D(You could still talk to a lawyer - remedying it now does not alter the fact that you were previously defamed.  But Google has a stronger position having now remedied it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It turns out that Google&#39;s knowledge graph algorithm somehow falsely associated my photo with the Wikipedia article about the serial killer. Which is also surprisingly strange because my name isn&#39;t special or unique at all; there are literally hundreds of other people with my name, and despite of all that, my personal photo ended up being associated with a serial killer. I can&#39;t really explain to myself how this happened, but it&#39;s weird. In any case, I am now in the process of reporting this Knowledge Graph bug to Google.I believe that there is a simpler explanation.The Wikipedia article is there in that side box because it is the top hit for &#34;hristo georgiev&#34; on Google&#39;s main search page. The picture is there because it is the top hit for &#34;hristo georgiev&#34; on Google&#39;s image search page."</p>

Apparently this works via the Amazon App Store although I am not sure what this actually means in a practical sense?* A new widgets fly out for weather, news, etc. (appears this will require you login with a Microsoft Account)* Improved windows snapping with a dynamic (based on your screen(s) size and layout) UI built into the maximize button* DirectX 12 improvements (unsure if limited to Windows 11 only?)* Auto HDR for games* Improved experience when switching between tablet and desktop modes* Apparently there will be &#34;Windows 11 ready&#34; PCs for sale &#34;today&#34;?* Microsoft say they have been working with AMD, Intel and Qualcomm to optimise the silicon for Windows 11* 40% smaller Windows Updates* TPM 2.0 and UEFI are hardware requirements. No legacy BIOS compatibility at all?* A Microsoft account and internet connectivity is required for Windows 11 Home setup* 64-bit processor required (no 32-bit build at all?)* There is a universal mute button in the system tray so you can mute yourself system wide rather than in the appProbably some other things I have missed"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Utterly astounded and dismayed to see this much of HN&#39;s audience completely fail to comprehend what they&#39;ve read here and paint this as some sort of sinister theft.This is the law functioning as intended.  Thiel&#39;s case is a one-in-100-million+ event.  He may have the only Roth IRA in existence that&#39;s valued at over $5 billion.  But he didn&#39;t do it by exploiting some sort of &#34;loophole&#34; or paying high-priced accountants to shield his assets in foreign entities offshore.  He put his investments in a Roth IRA just like any of you can do.  The only difference is his investments were in the top 0.0001% in terms of performance.  That&#39;s generally how people get to be billionaires.And that&#39;s not even to mention that the assets in a Roth IRA are essentially worthless to him - he&#39;s not old enough to make withdrawals or take distributions tax-free and you can&#39;t borrow against a Roth IRA.  The funds are essentially unavailable to him for years to come unless he wants to pay taxes and penalties.Again - this isn&#39;t a tax dodge.  This is someone who used the law exactly as intended without any illegal or shady dealings and happened to be incredibly fortunate.The whole article is a hit piece designed to get whip people into a furor.  And lately I&#39;ve been noticing propublica publishing a lot of those."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IANAL but this topic is of interest.Without commenting on whether this was legal at the time Thiel made this transaction, it appears it would not be permissible under current tax law. (Update: the relevant text in the statute appears to have been in effect as early as 1995: https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&amp;edition=1994&amp;re...)
 Specifically, the law explicitly disqualifies anyone who is:&gt;an officer, director (or an individual having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers or directors), a 10 percent or more shareholder, or a highly compensated employee (earning 10 percent or more of the yearly wages of an employer) of a person described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), or (G)(Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4975)So the relatively plain language would almost certainly include anyone who&#39;s a co-founder involved in actively managing a company today.This kind of blatant tax avoidance is going to end badly for our tax regime, which is likely to overcorrect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I don&#39;t understand about this whole maneuver is that Roth transactions must be made at arms length; ie, &#34;Transactions must be made at arm’s length and not involve the IRA owner or a member of his or her family.&#34;An example of this is that if you use a Roth to invest in property, you are not allowed to use it personally, not allowed to manage it or do maintenance yourself, etc.Prohibited transactions risk tainting (and thus exposing) the entire account.How is Thiel investing in his own company not considered a prohibited investment?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NewsBlur&#39;s founder here. I&#39;ll attempt to explain what&#39;s happening.This situation is more of a script kiddie than a hacker. I&#39;m in the process of moving everything on NewsBlur over to Docker containers in prep for the big redesign launching next week. It&#39;s been a great year of maintenance and I&#39;ve enjoyed the fruits of Ansible + Docker for NewsBlur&#39;s 5 database servers (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, and soon ML models).About two hours before this happened, I switched the MongoDB cluster over to the new servers. When I did that, I shut down the original primary in order to delete it in a few days when all was well. (Thank goodness I did that! It&#39;ll come in handy a few hours from now).Turns out the ufw firewall I enabled and diligently kept on a strict allowlist with only my internal servers didn&#39;t work on a new server because of Docker. When I containerized MongoDB, Docker helpfully inserted an allow rule into iptables, opening up MongoDB to the world. So while my firewall was &#34;active&#34;, doing a `sudo iptables -L | grep 27017` showed that MongoDB was open the world. More info on SO[1].To be honest, I&#39;m a bit surprised it took over 3 hours from when I flipped the switch to when a script kiddie dropped NewsBlur&#39;s MongoDB collections, and ransomed about 250GB of data. I am now running a snapshot on that old primary, just in case it reconnects to a network and deletes everything. Once done, I&#39;ll boot it up, secondary it out, and be back in business. Let&#39;s hope my assumptions hold.[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30383845/what-is-the-bes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a quick skim through https://github.com/samuelclay/newsblur for models extending mongo.Document, it looks like the following private customer data has been breached:- all story content from all private feeds- any uploaded OPML files, including URLs for any private RSS feeds- User’s twitter/facebook account info and access tokens, if the user had linked those services with their newsblur account- all data that would be used to create a user profile page, including email address, whether the user had a public profile or notHowever most personal data, such as password hashes and billing info, was stored in postgres."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"10:35p ET: Looks like the snapshot will take 10 hours to make. Ordinarily this wouldn&#39;t be a problem becuase the service is running and a snapshot would be made on a secondary DB. But all of the Mongo DBs faithfully deleted their data, so I&#39;m taking a snapshot of a recent good backup. Once done, I can replicare the DB and we&#39;ll be back.9:54p ET: Holy moly, when I switched to a new Mongo DB server, a hacker deleted all of NewsBlur’s mongo data and is now holding NewsBlur’s data hostage. I’m dipping into a backup from a few hours ago and will keep you all updated.They&#39;ve also given some info on twitter https://twitter.com/NewsBlur that I haven&#39;t digested yet."</p>

They openly admitted they did not know what they were doing because the case was too technical for them. They were just happy to please the big corporation.Hamburg is a favourite for such cases because they just have no clue about technology. They are just old fashioned.As a small indie developer, I could not afford to keep on fighting. I gave up. I was a psychological wreck. And since it is not binding, big entities can afford to sue you non-stop.Hamburg was the second time I was in a court. I got sued by the same big corporation. I won the first one.Despite not being binding Sony will use this as a precedent and they will start going against the bigger DNS players, till all of them have to comply with their demands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Content classification and moderation at scale is hard. I wish this article had provided more concrete statistics.&gt; The group, formed in December, is private and relatively small (57 members) but is still active, with four posts in the last month. We attempted to reach the administrator by email but did not receive a response.It’s not really honest to expect Facebook to correctly classify every single, tiny group created on the entire website."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have we reached a decade of &#34;AI will fix it&#34; yet, or are we still a couple of years off?I feel like so many issues around content moderation have been waved off by the big tech companies as being solved by algorithms and yet time and time again it&#39;s made very clear that algorithms alone aren&#39;t going to solve these problems.I used to think it was because the engineers and managers involved believed so deeply in the potential but now I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s because higher ups know the alternative (e.g. hiring humans, or abandoning money-generating algorithmic feeds) would be expensive and they&#39;ll throw anything and everything they can at the wall to avoid having to do it."</p>

All I could find easily was https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discre...Want to highlight one paragraph from that description: &#34;Intel Bridge Technology is run-time post compiler that can be integrated into Android-in-Container to enable certain Android apps – those not written in Java or compiled to run natively on Intel-based devices - to run on those devices.&#34;How many Android apps out there are not written in Java? I&#39;m guessing Kotlin isn&#39;t supported either. For that matter how many apps are targeting Android devices with Intel CPUs anymore?I was expecting a full VM / emulator, but this doesn&#39;t sound like that."</p>

Then everyone will come up with &#34;revolutionary&#34; desktop interface ideas and we here at HN will call it out that we already had these back in 90s.I am waiting for that time. Windows 10 is &#34;phony&#34; already and becoming more like it&#39;s built for people with low vision. I hate it&#39;s UI.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of nitpicking here, as is typical on HN, but the Australian experience is instructive. We can vote for the Greens without &#34;throwing our left-of-centre&#34; vote away and still preferring Labor to Liberal. Ranking only up to 5 is reasonable - if you want the simplicity of the old system, and don&#39;t want to research beyond 3 candidates, don&#39;t!I can&#39;t see the weird complaining about having to learn more about candidates - there&#39;s usually only a few viable well-known candidates. You don&#39;t have to go research the Natural Law Party or Animal Justice or whoever.The only cautionary tale is the whole horse-trading element of preferences does lead to some weird candidates making it in at the margins. We had someone who was semi-famous for engaging in a Kangaroo poo fight get in this way:https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/it-was-people-play-w...But this &#34;preference whispering&#34; is more of a big deal when preferences were allocated by parties - we had an option where you could vote a single &#39;1&#39; for a given party and it was their preferences that wound up being automatically applied (if you didn&#39;t go through hand-numbering all the preferences). So minor party deals became a huge deal. It&#39;s not going to be so big if you only have to number 5 and don&#39;t even have to keep numbering."</p>

I&#39;m a former YC Founder who&#39;s been working with NYC on voter education for this year&#39;s elections through RankedVote (https://www.rankedvote.co).You can get a sense for what it&#39;s like to vote in a ranked-choice election here:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t very good reporting by NPR.  The downsides they list are just straw men easily dismissed by RCV proponents, and they give an appearance of fair-and-balanced coverage while making opponents of RCV sound like Luddites.  (It also seems like they got all their information from, say, chatting with people from FairVote and not by actually reading online discussions like this one here.)RCV does have some serious problems.  Eliminating the candidate with the least first-place votes at each round means a high probability of rejecting compromise candidates that may be a lot of voters&#39; second choice.  Also, placing your first-choice candidate first isn&#39;t always a safe choice.  RCV is non-monotonic, which means it&#39;s possible that ranking someone first might actually cause them to lose.  That&#39;s weird, and I think it&#39;s a good enough reason to investigate other options.I think we should use approval voting in single-winner state and national elections.  It&#39;s simple and it solves the problem of 3rd party candidates being spoilers (which is why most voting reform advocates dislike FPTP in the first place) without introducing any new problems.  STAR is also a pretty good system.Approval voting is currently used in Fargo ND and they recently adopted it in St. Louis as well.There&#39;s a lot at stake when we change our election systems.  I think one of the biggest risks is that we adopt RCV widely and then when people figure out that it&#39;s not actually all that great, they aren&#39;t going to want to try something different.  They&#39;ll either say &#34;democracy just doesn&#39;t work very well and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it&#34;, or they&#39;ll go back to FPTP because they were misled by a successful PR campaign that sounds like it has the backing of voting system experts.  Voting systems should be changed rarely, and when it happens we should use the best available system, not chase the latest fad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I met John in an Atlanta airport lounge years ago[1]. I recognized him immediately as I&#39;ve always admired him, and I decided to go up to him and tell him as much. He invited me to sit down, and told him about when I was a teenager in the 90s learning about tech entrepreneurs at the time, I always thought he was pretty cool and had good ideas. I told him I respected him, and that I was sure he&#39;d lived an incredible life and thanked him for his contributions. He was clearly totally sloshed(inebriated) and insisted he called his wife so I could recount the story to her. I did. An hr later I had to leave to catch my flight, and i asked him where he was going - he said I&#39;d find out some &#34;pretty crazy shit&#34; about him next week, and that &#34;the doc was a bunch of BS&#34;. Two days later, I read Show Time had announced &#34;Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee&#34;.  In the brief time I spent with him, I have to say he had pretty positive energy for someone who was portrayed the way he was.[1] https://i.imgur.com/qThvR2S.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Was just reading about McAfee freebasing bath salts from old posts on an old Joe Rogan forum and not paying taxes seems like the absolute least he was up to:&gt;I&#39;ve processed 23 kilos of this stuff in the past year or so, and bump it myself every day - in fair quantities the hypersexuality... is beyond belief. I have had a number of acquaintances (both male and female) who have rubbed their genitals way past the point of bleeding and still couldn&#39;t stop.&gt;In all honesty, a first time user, or a user on a large dose, when presented with food, will simply figure out a way to include it in the ongoing sex play with their partner. If alone, they will figure out a way to fuck it, or shove it up their rectum. This is not a joke. Everything on the Tan becomes a sex partner or a sex aid. If only visually. I will not, anymore, let anyone on Tan be alone with my dogs for example.&gt;A local brothel owner (prostitution is legal in my country) talked me out of a large amount of Tan and provides it to his working girls and their customers. The idea was to simply increase business by having hornier customers and more authentic product. It worked for a while, and then girls started taking larger doses and giving customers larger doses. They began leaving and running off with customers - some after a single contact with the customer.&gt;If a person takes a large dose of the Tan and has the misfortune to have no partner at the time, then truly terrible things happen. A number of men, and women, have molested strangers after massive doses of the pure product (which is why I no longer provide it to anyone other than trusted friends - everything else is cut 50 to one). Twice, users on large doses have tried to molest my dogs.&gt;I have distributed over 3,000 doses exclusively in this country. They call it SPT (I named it) and it is a seriously hot underground topic here. I know of at least a dozen people who spend virtually full time playing with this, and hundreds trying to get samples, which I dole out with meticulous care. Anyone caught sharing this with another without my consent doesn&#39;t get any more.https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-mcafee-this-might-be-t..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good or bad, what a sad ending to a colorful life.The guy was troubled and had many shortcomings, but he was colorful and also achieved success and arguably was one of the seminal figures in the nascent AV industry.Sad to see his fall from grace and into a world of extravagance, deceit and cheating (taxes) and, if allegations true, even worse; then to end it on the floor of a jail -all by his own hands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awesome! My only request is to polish it just a bit more when you add it to the home screen. I’d love for this to feel like a native app.Nominally:- The default title when adding to the Home Screen is “React App”.- The icon could be better by choosing something in 1:1 aspect ratio. Maybe just the click wheel?- When opened from the home screen it correctly loads without displaying the browsers nav bar, but the dimensions are slightly skewed so it doesn’t fill the screen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone please tell me how important this topic based on the amount of news time and eyeballs it attracts relative to the number of people that it affects?The numbers I can find for US citizens is: 0.6% or 1,988,696 out 331,449,281 of people total for the entirety of the US in 2021.&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_Unite...In the UK where the featured article took place the latest poll I could find comes counts the number of people who selected &#34;other&#34; when choosing a sex at 0.4% or 224,632 people out of 64,596,800.&gt;https://practicalandrogyny.com/2014/12/16/how-many-people-in...Personally I don&#39;t think this is very important compared to other topics.  There are more blind people than trans people.  There are more people with Alzheimer&#39;s than trans people.  There are more people in the US who have lost a limb than trans people.I don&#39;t mean to downplay what is happening because it is happening but do you not think the amount of outrage this topic generates surpasses the level of impact we can have assuming we fix it?  It just feels like we&#39;re being distracted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One shouldn&#39;t expect courage from The Economist, but it&#39;s always wise to bet on their prudence.I don&#39;t read The Economist for facts or details so much as to get a sense of what topics a current establishment can no longer afford to ignore. The details are secondary to the neccessity that a writer, a sub-editor, and a senior editor with tremendous personal stake in maintaining access to the circles that define establishment media, have collectively recognized that to remain relevant as a publication, the risk/reward on any ensuing controversy still means the magazine has to acknowledge which way the wind is blowing.When The Economist says something is just starting, it means it&#39;s been brewing for at least several years and they need to comment on it. I don&#39;t think direct discourse on the topic improves the discussion on gender because the participants use a critical theory in which the promise of  discourse is just bait to corner political targets for their mobs. However, we (and even The Economist) can recognize that popular tolerance for these tactics has finally reached an inflection point, and this change in attitude is what will finally allow real analysis and insight by thoughtful people into topics about gender."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there an easy answer as to why Costa Rica is doing so well? They seem to be a bit of an exception in Central/South America.EDIT: From Wikipedia &#34;It is known for its long-standing and stable democracy, and for its highly educated workforce, most of whom speak English. The country spends roughly 6.9% of its budget (2016) on education, compared to a global average of 4.4%. Its economy, once heavily dependent on agriculture, has diversified to include sectors such as finance, corporate services for foreign companies, pharmaceuticals, and ecotourism. Many foreign manufacturing and services companies operate in Costa Rica&#39;s Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where they benefit from investment and tax incentives.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We really need two words for renewables: one for types that scale but don&#39;t provide power on demand (wind, solar), and the other for types that provide power on demand but aren&#39;t available at scale everywhere (hydro, geothermal).Costa Rica is blessed with plenty of the second type and uses it. Because we lump it all into &#34;renewables,&#34; it sounds like it should be easy for everyone to follow their example, and that&#39;s not the case. No country has run on a high percentage of wind/solar/battery for a long period of time."</p>

Scoped/Nested labels are a godsend. For example, I can tag an issue with a label &#34;UI::App::Android&#34; and i should be able to filter on the basis of &#34;UI::App&#34; and get all issues.One of the things i still notice about the boards is that it is created on the basis of status. Gitlab&#39;s boards are created on milestones/status...or LABELS. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#org...Most importantly, dragging tickets across boards will change the labels.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title here is a bit misleading: the first few paragraphs of this are a really enlightened description of the challenges of engineering for a startup regardless of what framework you are using.Even if you have no interest in Django at all I recommend reading the start of this.&gt; I wrote this guide to explain how to write software in a way that maximizes the number of chances your startup has to succeed — by making it easy to maintain development velocity regardless of the inevitable-but-unknowable future changes to team size, developer competence and experience, product functionality, etc. The idea is that, given the inherent uncertainty, startups can massively increase their odds of success by putting some basic systems in place to help maximize the number of ideas, features, and hypotheses they can test; in other words, maximizing &#34;lead bullets,&#34; to borrow the phrase from this blog post by Ben Horowitz."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a big Django fan and a former (unsuccessful) startup founder.

This is very well written.3. It&#39;s well organized.4. It&#39;s both concrete and high-level.5. There&#39;s a ton of info here.I&#39;m so burnt out on shallow content, it&#39;s really refreshing to see something well argued, whether I agree with every conclusion or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not mentioned here but important, I strongly prefer and recommend an opinionated framework like django, rails, (possibly ember) over mix match frameworks (express, flask) because they have already thought more about most design decisions than you want to (or your engineers).  Especially for an early stage startup, the performance, scalability, or reliability of your stack isn&#39;t going to kill you.  A long time to market will kill you,  reinventing the wheel will kill you.  When I see django apps built and developed, a shockingly high amount of effort is dedicated to actually solving business problems vs other less opinionated frameworks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; For fear of losing a job, or of losing an admission to school, or of losing the right to live in the country of your birth, or merely of social ostracism, many of today&#39;s best minds in so-called free, democratic states have stopped trying to say what they think and feel and have fallen silent.There are a lot of topics I won’t touch any more, more every year. Accounts - can’t stay anonymous, ml systems working around the clock to identify posters. My social justice focused friends have it worse, their online “friends” attack them publicly over every single little thing. They go quiet or form a tiny invite only groups to hide after an attempt to do something good that backfired because their skin is the wrong colour or they aren’t trans. They have panic attacks over the guilt and stress"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I very often type out comments on HN and then delete them. As Snowden alludes to, everything we submit to public forums is logged and stored. There is no doubt in my mind these comments are easily associated to my real identity with very little effort.Another side of censorship I consider often is signal to noise. There is no reason to prevent people from saying whatever they want if no one will ever see it. I recall a stat I heard that YouTube receives ~400 hours of content uploaded every minute to their site. Or the long-tail of Twitch streamers with 0 viewers.Finally, there is a threat of violence. We all know what happens to high-profile journalists because of their high profile. I often wonder how many nobodies disappear for some string of comments on some no-traffic forums/blogs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is possibly a unique angle, but by being in taboo art circles (erotic art specifically), I&#39;m struck at how much I see this topic resonating with my fellow artists.I know so many, too many, far more than I can count on my hands who have simply given up posting kink art because they keep getting mobbed, doxxed, slandered, and harassed simply by posting art (or seeing their friends getting shredded as well). I know so many that have forced to bounce from platform to platform from instagram to tumblr to twitter because either the algorithm censors you or the mob abuses the &#34;report user&#34; button if they simply don&#39;t care for your art.I know so many who have had to host on friend&#39;s servers because big-name hosts ban erotic art and kinks in tiny print in the TOS and it&#39;s just not worth it to fucking bounce from host to host unless if it&#39;s an actual friend who supports true artistic freedom.I know so many who are winding up in making zines as a last resort, because zines can be printed at the home computer, so they&#39;re one of the last truly uncensored artistic mediums in comparison to the internet. And yet - how many trailblazing artists have we lost from that crushing top-down censorship even with that one meager avenue open?So yes, this is relevant and urgent, and in more ways than it appears."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun fact: similar things, but much more general, were in the HTTP/1.1 standard from 1997. However, HTTP frames relied on HTTP chunks, which were fundamentally broken in the Win-HTTP-stack implementation. (Third party browsers like Netscape Navigator or Opera implemented a HTTP-stack of their own, but IE relied on the built-in implementation.)(Because of this flaw, keep-alive was broken, as well, and requests stalled until they timed out. Which is, why everyone set the request timeout to just a short period and you couldn&#39;t type a HTTP request manually in a terminal anymore.)"</p>

    2. Click the `•••` button at the top right of the page, then click `Export` (you may not see this option if you&#39;re not an admin in the workspace)
    3. Choose `Markdown &amp; CSV` or `HTML` as the export format, and turn on the `Include subpages` toggle
    4. Repeat for any other important top-level pages in the workspace that you&#39;d like to have a backup of

I have a computer which is not connected to the Internet I use to run number-crunching tasks and play relatively-old single-player games, but I still update it periodically. Obviously I don&#39;t need any such performance-killing mitigations there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I am not convinced that removing any optimization which can be used in a timing-based side channel is sustainable.&#34; basically boils down over two decades of JavaScript (now WebAssembly) API and language design, where one subset of the committees fervently argues against any feature or primitive that could possibly be used to acquire timing information, no matter how useful. It&#39;s tough, because they are ALSO trying to make sure any advertiser on the planet can run code on your PC without your permission, so it is pretty important to stop that code from using timing side channels to capture your credit card number or something. Once it was proven that JavaScript could trigger rowhammer (I remember having debates about this during wasm spec meetings at the time when it was still speculative), that kind of guaranteed that the side-channel people would remain in control, I think. SharedArrayBuffer is the biggest example - we basically had safe multithreaded memory access available in browsers but it got disabled due to spectre/meltdown, and we only started getting it back relatively recently with lots of additional constraints to try and make it &#34;safe&#34;. Want high-precision timestamps? Not anymore you don&#39;t, it&#39;s a side-channel!Similarly, when a new browser update goes out it may or may not make all the web apps you rely on slower (or break them), so any web benchmarking also needs to be re-run from scratch on a regular basis. New Chrome and Firefox releases &#34;ride the trains&#34; every 6 weeks or so, and they quietly push changes to the browser more frequently than that which can occasionally impact perf or behavior too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Previous related discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26328758If things go as planned, this may become a paid, ad-free, zero-tracking search engine. I can&#39;t express how exciting this is to me.Over the past few years, I have made several attempts to replace Google Search with DuckDuckGo. But they have all failed and I always ended up changing the default search engine back to Google. I mean, DDG worked fine for 95% of time, but the remaining 5% failure often led to some extreme frustration that I just couldn&#39;t stand. I would imagine Brave Search to have similar issues, at least in the beginning, but they did something smart to make it less painful:&gt; Brave Search beta is based on an independent index, the first of its kind. However, for some queries, Brave can anonymously check our search results against third-party results, and mix them on the results page.So, if I am not satisfied with Brave&#39;s result, Google&#39;s result is on the same page, or just one click away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On 6 June 2020, a Twitter user pointed out that Brave inserts affiliate referral codes when users type a URL of Binance into the address bar, which earns Brave money. Further research revealed that Brave redirects the URLs of other cryptocurrency exchange websites, too. In response to the backlash from the users, Brave&#39;s CEO apologized and called it a &#34;mistake&#34; and said &#34;we&#39;re correcting&#34;.Brave is just a &#34;pop-privacy&#34; company.  I will skip this one..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently, they have their own search index, which they say covers ~95% of queries, and if the results aren&#39;t in the index, it will then get it from Google or Bing.I&#39;d love some more details on how this works. They probably aren&#39;t scraping the whole web. Are they just mirroring Bing and Google indexes? They seem to have their own page ranking algorithm that they&#39;re hoping to get trained."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds like it might be good thing for the company. Having employees who have extra capacity is incredibly important for an organization that wants to get things done; if you&#39;re constantly hard at work on something important, when something else comes up (someone has a question, there&#39;s a bug or an outage, whatever), you either have to delay the thing you&#39;re already working on, or delay the thing that came up. This tends to have a cascade effect on most kinds of work, locking up all your people resources.Plus, those other things you&#39;re doing sound like they overall, in the long-term, probably give you a wider range of knowledge, improving your usefulness.Just wanted to add a voice against that sort of Taylorism perspective on work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly why I&#39;ve concluded trying to go my own way is the best long-term plan for me. Before learning about YC and HN and such, the thought never really occurred to me.When I&#39;m working on a personal project I&#39;m really passionate about, my productivity is literally orders of magnitude higher than at any day job I&#39;ve had. Months or years are compressed into days.For any ambitious personal project that I&#39;m intrinsically motivated by, I&#39;m working on it and designing it pretty much every free moment I have. It&#39;s actually crazy to me how much I can get done if there&#39;s absolutely zero &#34;ugh field&#34; [1] inhibiting me. It doesn&#39;t feel like work at all. I&#39;d happily take 20% of my current salary if it meant I could do that all day instead.Even if it&#39;s stressful and even if I might fail miserably, I think life should be lived. If there&#39;s even the tiniest sliver of a chance that I could support myself just doing something like that, I know I&#39;d be much happier. And if turning such a thing into a job or organization sucks the fun out of it, then I&#39;ll just keep trying again and again until I can find a project with a sufficiently viable enjoyment:financial stability ratio.[1] https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields (Regarding the author&#39;s username: yes, it&#39;s that one.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work! Hacker News still seems to have a deeply skeptical culture with regard to machine learning - not sure why. There&#39;s always someone saying it&#39;s &#34;not novel&#34; and it&#39;s &#34;just doing x&#34;.Overfitting is a known issues in machine learning, people.  If you still think all neural networks are doing is memorizing the dataset completely in the year 2021 - you might want to revisit the topic. It is one of the first concerns anyone training a deep model will have and to assume this model is overfit _without_ providing specific examples is arguing in bad faith.Sentdex has shown his GAN is able to generalize various game logic like collision/friction with vehicles and also learns aspects of rendering such as a proper reflection of the sun on the back of the car.He also showed weak points where the model is incapable of handling some situations and even did the impossible task of &#34;splitting a car in two&#34; to try and solve a head-on collision. Even though this is a failure case; it should at least provide you with some intuition that the GAN isn&#39;t just spitting out frames memorized from the dataset because that never happens in the dataset.You will need to apply a little more rigor before outright dismissing these weights as merely overfit.@sentdex Have you considered a guided diffusion approach now that that&#39;s all the rage? It&#39;s all rather new still but I believe it could be applied to these concepts as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like your YouTube videos in general and think this content is a great benefit to the community.I wouldn’t take the few negative comments personally - I’ve seen many GAN architectures that heavily overfit (including my own bobross pix2pix) get a lot of praise, while ‘less violating’ models (like yours) get more skepticism.  Skepticism isn’t bad! But I’d wager in your case it may be because you’re a YouTuber, and other ml YouTubers are notorious for ripping off content (eg Siraj).Not really related to this, but I’d personally love to see the difference in training times it would take an RL agent to adequately learn to drive a car in gta versus adequately flying a helicopter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These are one of the few times I can say that I don&#39;t care if Boston Dynamics are making money as yet.Boston Dynamics are one of the few real serious players in the robotics space worldwide doing deep R&amp;D.Hyundai are basically paying for the BD Labs research. And they are well positioned to reap the products and techniques from the lab with their own manufacturing and engineering prowess and experience over the next decade.And it won&#39;t be walking dogs.It will be things like a little flexi-joint in a car that you buy without knowing (or caring) it&#39;s in there. Or some industrial machine that Hyundai builds that gives them a 5% competitive edge in the manufacturing of it that 99.9999% of us never hear about.But for that it&#39;s worth it.Very happy to see people put good money into this Lab."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Normally tech companies tend to be overpriced, but $880M for 80% of Boston Dynamics (total value of $1.1 billion), doesn&#39;t that seem a little low?Other tech companies can seemingly lose millions, as long as there&#39;s an advertising or data-mining angle to the product. Because Boston Dynamics aim to actually create physical products they then get valued lower?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;ve gone from Google -&gt; Softbank -&gt; Hyundai in a few years.Does anyone know where their revenue is coming from currently? For all the flashy videos they put out, you so rarely see them that I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re just doing well on the B2B side (warehouse automation? military contracts?), or if they&#39;ve been in the red for the last decade."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more I see, the more I think we need a mandatory „Life School“ curriculum in classes. Financial literacy is just one issue, but all that stuff like media competency, scientific method, cui bono, negotiations, assertiveness, how to deal with bullies, mental health basics, economics 101, mechanics of addiction and manipulation aaaand so on, all explained by first principles, would go such a long way towards a better functioning society.Then again, that‘s not going to happen as it would eventually destroy whole industries and populist voter bases.I smell a non-profit I should do one day…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It bothers me that so many people use the fact that something wasn’t taught in school as an excuse for not knowing it, especially something as obviously necessary as personal finance.I was dumb in college and graduated with about $4k in credit card debt. It didn’t take a classroom lecture to realize that spending more money than I earned was not a sustainable practice. It’s also not that hard to keep track of how much you spend and make sure it’s less than how much you make.For almost anything personal finance related there is free information available all over the Internet if you care to spend a couple minutes googling for it.Likewise with taxes, if you have a regular W2 job, taxes are not hard, just read and follow the instructions. It doesn’t help that people keep repeating the dumb meme that if you make a typo on your tax return the IRS will immediately throw you in jail. They won’t, they just send a letter telling you they corrected it for you (guess how I know)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great news. I’ve long thought that high school students would be better served if they substituted statistics and finance for pre-calculus and calculus. Most people gain very little utility from Calculus, but a better understanding of Finance and Statistics, especially interest rates, amortization, time value of money, and probabilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really glad that projects like this exist.I note that they site privacy as their #1 advantage:  * Respects your privacy 
  * Saves your battery 
  * No unexpected mobile data charges

In my opinion, people have given up caring about privacy and expect to receive an inferior experience from products that proclaim this. Therefore, again imo, products that focus on privacy and such will remain niche.I suspect that the world is ready for paid services that provide a better Ux. I am thinking about how Netflix supposedly put a dent in piracy. People were willing to pay for content with a better Ux.Aside from saving battery and no surprised mobile data charges, the list many other benefits:  * No ads 
  * No annoying registration 
  * No mandatory tutorials 
  * No noisy email spam 
  * No push notifications 
  * No crapware

I wonder if a project could charge a small monthly fee if they focused on these user benefits that everyone cares about, and partially use that money to support OSM and partially use the money to support themselves?"</p>

Not the nonsensical &#39;with love&#39; part (that sounds unpleasantly sticky), but the curation; what is being curated?
