								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is such an incredible amount of vulnerable mission-critical data.- all contacts, including 3rd party messaging apps, with metadata (interactions, timestamps, other stats)
- full address book
- whether any app is installed
- SSID of connected wifiand formerly,- medical info
- device usage
- screen time
- device accessoriesI don&#39;t keep anything mission critical on mobile, but this is still a gargantuan set of exploits, and each appear extremely straightforward to validate and pay out the security researcher (and maybe even patch). It&#39;s utterly tragic how Apple (and others) have devolved to become the same monolithic, careless organizations they once displaced.I really, really hope something changes. Soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Explain I&#39;m naive: why would Apple&#39;s bug bounty program be so poorly run? Is it simply a sign of organizational failure?  
 (e.g. perhaps the managers running the program have been promoted to a position that they simply don&#39;t belong in, and higher up execs don&#39;t care? Or are they prioritizing profit over success?)I would think that, given the profitability and positioning of Apple in the marketplace, that they would be heavily incentivized to provide large bounties for finding such destructive vulnerabilities. And I imagine that there are plenty of security people working there who genuinely care about fixing fix these issues right away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If your annual revenue is above $100M, you should be held accountable to a strict version of GPDR enforced by an ombudsman, that requires you to patch all data leaking vulnerabilities within 90 days, or pay out everyone who bought your product.I just updated to iOS 15 and it now tells you which sites you have been compromised on, or had your passwords/info compromised on. To be clear, I use a password manager with a unique password on every site, so it is difficult for something like this to have a significant impact. Nethertheless, I was compromised on hundreds of sites and products, and those were just the accounts that iOS Safari knew about. None of them bothered to reach out and tell me. Even my coffee machine was compromised. Ridiculous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a mid-sized US manufacturer that recently went through a ransomware scare, we contracted with FireEye for remediation and cybersecurity consultation.  I was shocked that they recommended we install ad-blockers as a corporate policy.  I remarked ads are sometimes useful and that many local companies rely upon them (e.g., the local newspaper).  I use an adblocker just to make the internet more useable, but I was reluctant to make that a corporate policy.  I couldn&#39;t imagine there was any meaningful threat from malware in ads as every company from the Journal to the Times to Nordstrom would be screwed without ads.  But FireEye insisted and we now have adblocking installed with the usual image.  Wild times.  I have to believe this is truly disruptive to the internet as we know it.  It seems to me the ad providers would have a huge incentive to counter this narrative and to make damned sure ads are safe.  I have no idea why that&#39;s not happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I worked at reddit, I refused to run Adblock.  I felt like it would be hypocritical to work for a company that made its money from ads, and then block them.  Also I wanted to make sure that I had the same experience as the users.When I left reddit, for the longest time I still didn&#39;t run Adblock because as a shareholder it still felt hypocritical.But a few years ago I couldn&#39;t take it anymore -- the web go so awful with ads on it became unusable.  And so I relented and went full Adblock.  And life got a lot better.(I did however whitelist reddit and a few other sites that I like whose ads are bearable)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Scrolling through some of the comments here, I haven&#39;t read anything that praises ads. Which begs the question, why do we still tolerate ads? If employees from Ad companies themselves use adblock (!!!), something must be fundamentally wrong.Isn&#39;t it about time we change the financial model of the internet? Or should we just let humanity suffer through this non-value adding ritual?Personally I&#39;ve never bought anything directly because of web ads. I understand that some people do and that some people find them beneficial. But I believe the cons outweigh the pros this time.I don&#39;t claim to have a solution, but it annoys me when we all agree that something sucks yet do nothing about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a big fan of the idea of manufacturing meat in an environmentally sustainable way (and without having to resort to raising and killing animals), reading this article felt as if someone was throwning a bucket&#39;s worth of ice-cold water on my face.According to the article, the barriers to cost-efficient manufacturing of lab-grown meat at large scale are fundamental, e.g., impossible to overcome according to the Laws of Thermodynamics and our current understanding of cell biology and chemistry.Quoting from the OP:&gt; David Humbird, the UC Berkeley-trained chemical engineer who spent over two years researching the report, found that the cell-culture process will be plagued by extreme, intractable technical challenges at food scale. In an extensive series of interviews with The Counter, he said it was “hard to find an angle that wasn’t a ludicrous dead end.”&gt; Humbird likened the process of researching the report to encountering an impenetrable “Wall of No”—his term for the barriers in thermodynamics, cell metabolism, bioreactor design, ingredient costs, facility construction, and other factors that will need to be overcome before cultivated protein can be produced cheaply enough to displace traditional meat.Is there anyone on HN with deep expertise in this area who can comment on this article&#39;s scientific accuracy?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article tries to get away with a giant sleight of hand for a reader that might not be super clear on lab grown vs plant based. The overwhelming majority of fake meat is plant based, not cultured. Sure, one day we might see competitive economics from cultured meats, but claiming that it won’t happen because their factories aren’t pound for pound equivalent makes no sense. People are choosing alternatives to meat because they don’t want the Amazon further destroyed for cattle production, because they watch a video of how animals are treated (I dare you to watch one slaughterhouse video from peta), and because the carbon intensity is simply too high broadly. Plant based meat is now widely available and just about at price parity (not $50/chicken nugget as the post misleadingly suggests of fake meat when actually referring to R&amp;D phase cultured meat production). The main “source” of perspective for the first half of the article is an “animal health” industry insider aka, meat industry representative.  His career has been literally to keep cows alive long enough to kill them at the perfect time before serving them in happy meals, forgive me if I think he more than a little biased"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FINALLY an article that looks at the basic scientific fundamentals of this. Lab-grown meat, similar to carbon removal tech, is currently super hyped in the mainstream media.Like Pat Brown, founder of Impossible usually says, paraphrasing: &#34;There is no such thing as lab-grown meat, and there will never be. If somebody figures out how to grow cells reliably in a bioreactor, it will make much more sense to sell it as organs for use in medicine than to eat it (financially).&#34;It just doesn&#39;t make sense to grow meat in the lab if we can make it from plant proteins directly. Period.What makes me sad and angry about the startups and billions of VC money that goes into this is that we need to reduce emissions NOW. We don&#39;t have time to fuck around with sci-fi tech that maybe brings down the price of lab-grown meat to a level that the top 10% of the population might afford it, in 10 or 20 years. It has been proven that there are great ways to make meat alternatives from plant proteins directly, we should invest time and money into expanding that!On a side note, I think for a lot of people the existence of research and startups on lab-grown meat is an excuse to continue eating meat. They say that once it&#39;s there, I&#39;ll of course switch over. But they are not ready to switch over to alternatives like Impossible burgers that are just as good now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the last year or so I&#39;ve noticed an increasing amount of my legitimate professional interactions going into my &#34;Promotions&#34; tab in Gmail. The effect of which has been, after discovering a few mishaps of this sort, to now regularly and meticulously go through a massive pile of &#34;Promotions&#34; just to make sure I haven&#39;t missed something legitimately urgent or important. Prior to Google&#39;s classification errors producing this particular anxiety I used to basically treat the &#34;Promotions&#34; tab as spam to never look at. Now I&#39;m going through all of it with prejudice which means I&#39;m waaaaaaay more aware of marketing drivel than I used to be. As such, I&#39;m pretty sure this &#34;error&#34; is intentional on Google&#39;s part to produce exactly this outcome of drawing eyeballs to inbox advertising."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yup, getting a few of these each day and manually marking them as Spam (to no avail). Not sure how GMAIL&#39;s filter is missing them.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I understand Apple&#39;s decision to do this. They want to stick it to Epic. Completely understandable desire on Apple&#39;s part. But, sadly, Apple is letting their desire to get vengeance outweigh the interests of their users in having all the games they want to play on their devices.I have been realizing lately that my loyalty to Apple has been waning over the years after having invested heavily in the ecosystem. This is another representation to me of how Apple&#39;s ecosystem is something you have no control over, and you are at the whim of Apple&#39;s legal team in situations like that to be able to play the games you want to play on your devices.Apple remembered their corporate games they were playing and forgot who their real customer and focus should be: the end users. This decision doesn&#39;t benefit their end users in any meaningful way. It hurts end users to score points in their feud with Epic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Epic took a stand and we should be behind them 100%. This case was never about winning on the letter of the contract law, it was about moving the standard of practice and attempting to gain some ground against the evils of mega-Apple. If you are reading this Grubber post and thinking you agree, that&#39;s only because you are used to thinking this way by now.The courts simply do not understand the power companies like Apple and Google have apparently. The startup cost of a competitor would be astronomical, as we&#39;ve seen reflected in the quality, cost, and size of the small handful of other smartphone companies recently. Even if we seem new players become competitive, then what&#39;s to stop us from being back in this same situation in 10 years? 5 years? This is why we have Laws.Not even to mention that the telecom companies are still working against progress and taking absurd cuts for themselves.Hosting, platforming, and The Web are in crisis, as we&#39;re all aware. We should be firmly on the side of open access to our (developers) content. Why let the platforms eat our lunch? Maybe we should just be giving them a snack, or a little treat, but even that would just be for &#34;services rendered&#34;, not as a condition for our meal.I&#39;m just so fucking done with this, sorry I can&#39;t help but be a bit angry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to compare the situation Epic got itself into with previous episodes of Facebook &amp; Google breaking Apple&#39;s rules.When Facebook and Google misused Developer Enterprise certificates to go beyond internal testing and distribute apps to end-consumers, Apple revoked their accounts.  Both Facebook &amp; Google simply admitted they screwed up and Apple reinstated their accounts.[1]  No lawsuits.Epic broke Apple&#39;s in-app-purchase rules and now Epic promises they will comply but Epic didn&#39;t get their dev account reinstated yet.  Big difference is that Epic rolled the dice by filing a lawsuit about Apple&#39;s unfair rules and because they thought there was enough anti-Apple sentiment that they&#39;d get a sympathetic judgement in their favor.  Their gamble didn&#39;t work and in the process, Tim Sweeny&#39;s defiant attitude just made Apple dig in their heels even further.I&#39;m reminded of that quote, &#34;you come at the King, you best not miss.&#34;EDIT reply to some comments saying Epic didn&#39;t make a &#34;promise&#34; to comply with Apple&#39;s rules:&gt;Did i miss something where they actually said that? In this thread&#39;s Fireball blogpost is a link to Tim Sweeney&#39;s tweet of an email screenshot to Apple&#39;s Phil Schiller stating his &#34;promise&#34;:&gt;Sep 16, 2021 at 5:01 PM; Subject: Fortnite and the App Store; To: Phil Schiller&gt;[..] Epic promises that it will adhere to Apple’s guidelines whenever and wherever we release products on Apple platforms.[...][1] https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+reinstates+google+face..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think part of the problem today with individuals trying to figure out how to moderate their social media usage is that it&#39;s not clear what specifically within social media constitutes harm.Is it the like/upvote mechanism? Hacker News would constitute harmful social media in that case. But what might be lost is a powerful lever for democratic input in terms of content curation and moderation.My vote for what&#39;s more harmful is the scroll. I have a web extension that just removes the scroll on my Facebook feed. A few months after setting it up I all but stopped using Facebook, checking in once maybe every two months to visit folks individually. I haven&#39;t done this for Twitter or IG, but then the quality of my main feed is such that I don&#39;t want to remove it outright and want that aggregation of content, somehow.I think that scrolling in general is harmful as a UX pattern, but the obvious alternative of pagination could create all kinds of complexities around deep-linking and fragmentation of content. All the same I&#39;d love to see more platforms adopt this intentional cap on content associated with a given URL. It turns my engagement with content online from scanning to actual reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After the habit of scrolling and liking wears off, you suddenly find yourself in a joyful place. A quieter, calmer, less demanding place where you don’t want to know what others are doing. You focus on what you want to do.But what if you don&#39;t know what you want to do?I feel like this post was written from the perspective of someone who already has their own life goals sorted out, and social media was clearly acting as an obstacle to accomplishing those well-defined goals, so they dropped social media.But when you&#39;re on your own, it is not a given that you have everything figured out and all you need to do is give yourself a lot of free time and just do what you want. The void that remains is exactly the kind that social media is designed to fill for many people.That kind of feeling almost legitimizes the concept of FOMO, because at a certain point you cannot imagine how anything you&#39;re doing could be more interesting than the things that other people are moving forward with in their lives. You want to aspire to be something, and looking for someone else to copy would mean you at least have some kind of aspiration to work towards, instead of nothing at all.Social media is a net negative overall, but once it&#39;s out of the picture you have to work on yourself, and in that domain there are no easy answers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“ We persuade our minds that liking pictures and joining virtual groups gives us a sense of belonging. Connection with others”Except in many cases its not persuasion. Joining groups actually does give us these things. My gf is part of “bay area moms” group and the amount of useful tips she gets out of participating in that is significant. Or “bay area hikers” for me. Also, if i want to sell something, I hire facebook to find a buyer for my old ipad or iphone.Social media has caught on to the jobs framework. Jack Dorsey references it directly on Twitter earnings calls. He says we need to fill more jobs for more people. He constantly asks what can people hire twitter for?I think to reduce social media to some of the crappy jobs it does serve artificially diminishes what it can be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not reinvention of PHP as some are commenting.
In fact I think this is extremely cool.If I understand it correctly, it allows you to achieve reactive data flow in a single page app without any boilerplate.Meaning - you update the database on the server and all the relevant UI(s) will automatically receive the updated data and re-render only the parts of the UI that display that data.This would require a ton of PHP and Javascript dealing with networking, websockets, routing, serializing data and so on.Haven&#39;t tried it yet, but very curious to see if it works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I admire about the Clojure community is audacious projects like this. While a ton of these seem to run out of steam, they certainly shoot for the stars and tend to come pretty dang close for a while.For those working in Typescript, Blitz.js seems to do a great job at drastically decreasing the plumbing you have to write to shuttle data between Postgres and React. There’s also a ton of goodies like auth built in. From my first impression it’s the closest the JS community has ever come to a Django, and that’s very high praise in my book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of Meteor.js[0] from back in the day (2014?), which had a very similar approach—you wrote code that ran on both the frontend and the backend, and database updates were propagated automatically. It suffered from a pretty hard reliance on Mongodb and its own package manager (Atmosphere), and it was at odds with the rest of the JS ecosystem which was settling on NPM.This project looks very cool! I like the focus on composition, Meteor was lacking that (and really, most other frameworks do as well).[0] https://www.meteor.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love how honest this is about the limitations and the whole design process. Truly a great example of a real hacker projectI have a Georgi keyboard (mentioned in the article) which I started getting to grips with then put aside during a way too busy period at work. This has made me want to dig it out and try again.I’m also thinking that two of those faunchpads put together on the long edges could make an even better ‘back of phone’ keyboard (or back of mini tablet) for a handy portable note taking device"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a Blackberry fanboy. My Key2 was far, far superior a device to the latest gen iPhone I own. I have tried for years to get used to glass, and while I&#39;m ok with it, it&#39;s still a massive compromise.My second favourite mobile-device keyboard was that of the Ericsson T28 [0] from about 20 years ago. At some point I accidentally discovered a feature I just found outlined at the bottom of page 28 of the T28 user manual [1], where the volume rocker switch on the left side would act as a text entry modifier key, so that pressing the number 2 button normally resulted in a B, holding the volume up and pressing 2 gave a C, and holding volume down and pressing 2 gave a D.I remember getting so, so fast and so comfortable at texting with this method. By random chance, an acquaintance a few years ago in a co-working place had an old T28 that still worked and let me play with. Naturally the first thing I tried was the old input method - and it was like my muscle memory never left. I was so fast and so comfortable with it. She was blown away... after 20 years she still had no idea that that mode existed.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson_T28[1] https://www.lokety.com/ericsson_t28s_manual.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I applaud any effort to rethink keyboards from first principles.After years of shoulder, neck and back pain I discovered that the root cause was the standard keyboard design. It causes rounded shoulders. Perhaps my shoulders are just too wide. This pinched all sorts of muscles, tendons and nerves. Doctors and physical therapists just failed to identify the issue. Weight lifting didn&#39;t help all that much, even with a strong back I had to scrunch and round the shoulders to type.I finally picked up a second keyboard, and used one for each hand. It was surprisingly easy to convert to. Just added some larger rubber nub things on home row.It&#39;s been life changing. Years of pain was gone in days. No special design necessary.Each keyboard is arranged at an outward angle, distanced so my shoulders are in a natural position.I can&#39;t recommend this enough.On Mac it required a system preference tweak (Karibiner app) so each keyboard can share shortcut keys."</p>

Put one on your resume, the other in production. Everyone goes home happy.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was very keen on machine learning for some time- I started working with ML in the mid 90s.  The work I did definitely could have been replaced with a far less mathematically principled approach, but I wanted to learn ML because it was sexy and I assumed that at some point in the future we&#39;d have a technological singularity due to ML research.I didn&#39;t really understand the technology (gradient descent) underlying the training, so I went to grad school and spent 7 years learning gradient descent and other optimization techniques.  Didn&#39;t get any chances to work in ML after that because... well, ML had a terrible rep in all the structural biology fields and even the best models were at most 70% accurate.  Not enough data, not enough training methods, not enough CPU time.Eventually I landed at Google in Ads and learned about their ML system, Smartass.  I had to go back and learn a whole different approach to ML (Smartass is a weird system) and then wait years for Google to discover GPU-based machine learning (they have Vincent Vanhouke to thank- he sat near Jeff Dean and stuffed 8 GPUs into a workstation to prove that he could do training faster than thousands of CPUs in prod) and deep neural networks.Fast forward a few years, and I&#39;m an expert in ML, and the only suggestion I have is that everybody should read and internalize: https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/
So little of success in ML comes from the sexy algorithms and so much just comes from ensuring a bunch of boring details get properly saved in the right place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall attending a technical talk given by a team of senior ML scientists from a prestigious SV firm (that I shall not name here).  The talk was given to an audience of scientists at a leading university.The problem was estimating an incoming train speed from an embedded microphone sensor near the train station.  The ML scientists used the latest techniques in deep learning to process the acoustic time series.  The talk session was two hours long.  This project was their showcase.I guess no one in the prestigious ML team knew about the Doppler shift and its closed form expression.  Typically taught in a highschool physics class.  A simple formula that you can calculate by hand: no need for a GPU cluster."</p>

  - Install just following instructions described

  - F-droid works

  - Apps installed from F-droid works

  - Full screen videos from Newpipe play smoothly

* The bad  - Had to enable &#34;invert colors&#34; to get correct colors

  - Mouse scroll is inverted

  - Can&#39;t choose correct layout of physical keyboard because android thinks there&#39;s no physical keyboard connected

  - Android gestures on the desktop are annoying

  - Can&#39;t access whole screen of vertical apps and they appear sideways on my screen

  - Multiwindow mode didn&#39;t work at first

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We use Phoenix and LiveView to power all of our non-video interactions on Glimesh.tv[0] and the immediate out of the box features and performance are unmatched. LiveView allowed us to get a completely real time updating channel where streamers can edit their metadata (game, title, viewer count, etc) and all of the viewers can see it in real time. Not to mention we implemented a distributed chat system that sends message updates in real time to both browser clients and API clients. Both of these features combined amount to less than 1000 lines of code and &#34;just work&#34; across multiple web nodes.It can be daunting to jump into such a strange world as a LiveView environment may look (Elixir syntax, OTP terminology, etc) but honestly once you dig in deeper, everything just makes sense. LiveView (and HEEx) continue to be very simple to understand abstractions on top of the rock solid OTP platform. It&#39;s a joy to build real time applications using it, and I very much appreciate the &#34;developer experience&#34; focus both Chris &amp; Jose have for us Elixir devs!I&#39;m excited for the launch of Phoenix 1.6 and HEEx is shaping up to be a complete replacement for your traditional SPA + Backend API, and using one consistent language for your full stack really has very freeing &amp; powerful benefits, especially for small teams![0] https://github.com/Glimesh/glimesh.tv/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Creator of Phoenix here. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions folks have about LiveView, Phoenix, or Elixir in general. We&#39;ve had some big LiveView features land recently with uploads and HEEx so now&#39;s a great time to jump in!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I created Phoenix to build real-time applications. Before it could even render HTML, Phoenix supported real-time messaging. To do that, Phoenix provides an abstraction called Channels.I think it&#39;s really neat that Chris started out with real-time messaging. When I first started working with web frameworks, it definitely felt like real-time stuff was an afterthought—a layer built atop an older model that leaked a lot of the details.Working with LV has been an absolute delight. Need to render a PDF and download? Fire off a `Task.async` to render in a separate thread on the backend. When it&#39;s done, that thread can just `send` a message to the LV process to update the UI that the PDF is ready. So easy and painless. LV really hits a sweet spot for me: I&#39;m primarily a backend dev, but with LV I can build really nice stuff on the front-end with minimal effort/headache from NPM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone is curious, the origami stellated [1] icosahedron in the second image is built from Sonobe modules [2][3], a kind of modular origami. Basic structures formed by Sonobe units have 3-sided 45-45-90 pyramids on top of an underlying polyhedra with triangular faces.Each Sonobe unit functions as an edge in the underlying structure, so building a structure around an icosahedron, which has 20 faces and 30 edges, requires 30 units, and yields a stellated icosahedron with 60 faces and 90 edges.You can also build a stellated octahedron from 12 pieces, and a stellated tetrahedron (which actually just appears as a cube) with 6 pieces, but that&#39;s just the beginning [4]![1]: Strictly speaking, it&#39;s not a true stellation, which is formed by extending the planes of faces until they intersect.

Once, Rogers provided new lyrics for the “Tomorrow” song that ended each show, to ensure that children watching on Friday wouldn’t expect a show on Saturday, when the show didn’t air. And Rogers’s secretary, Elaine Lynch, remembered how, when one script referred to putting a pet “to sleep,” he excised it for fear that children would be worried about the idea of falling asleep themselves.Rogers was extraordinarily good at imagining where children’s minds might go.The more I learn about him, the more I feel he was underappreciated in his time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mother took me to meet him at a book signing when I was very young. She was a kindergarten teacher who studied early childhood development. I got to speak to him briefly, and thought it was neat.Later in life I asked her about it, and she admitted that she only brought me because she knew how much I enjoyed the show, and that she personally found his manner of speaking (on the show) to be a bit grating. However, she said that upon meeting him in the flesh, all her prejudices immediately dissipated, and she could immediately tell that he was one of the most wholesome, honest, charming people she&#39;d ever met.I haven&#39;t watched the semi-recent film about his life because I&#39;m a big softie and I&#39;m sure I&#39;d bawl, but I do know that he was a very good man who will be missed for a long time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am one of the people responsible for making these lists. The fact that the general public as well as journalists think this data is accurate in anyway is really funny. This an exercise of futility that only increases the overall cost and provides job security for me :)No one working in a hospital knows how much do we acquire things for, or how much we get paid for doing things in advance. And only like 8 people can tell you that information 3 months after the fact.Take the simple exercise of figuring out cost/revenue of an aspirin administration.Cost depends on:
1. Are you an outpatient/Obsveration v. inpatient v. ED?
2. Are you on Medicaid?
3. Is the hospital a part of GPO organization or not?
4. Is contractual obligations of GPO includes/excludes Aspirin?Reimbursement depends on:
1. Insurance
2. Group which you are under the insurance from
3. Contract language whether its a fee/service or bundled
4. Is the visit covered or not
5. how the visit/procedure was coded (most important and opaque factor)Everybody in the know, knows that these lists are a joke, but no one can prove it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Around 2012 before my wife and I were married, we both got pneumonia. I was insured through my employer, she was uninsured.We went to urgent care at the same time on the same day, saw the same doctor and got prescribed the same drugs.About a month later when the bills came, her bill with no insurance was somewhere in the $160 range. My bill after insurance was nearly $300.I&#39;m still peaved about this."</p>

In particular, I wanted to use Logic instead of paying huge sums for new versions of Ableton; I wanted to use Pixelmator Pro instead of paying for Adobe subscription (although Affinity Photo is also available on windows); I wanted to use Time Machine instead of Google Drive; I especially wanted my passwords stored on my computer instead of locked behind my Google account at passwords.google.com (I was locked out of my Google account for a week once and it was temporarily life-ruining); and finally, I was so tired of trying to keep up with endless UI changes in Windows and Android.

I pay now way more than I did with iCloud, but I am back in control. I am more productive.- Listening to Music takes 3 clicks and just a few seconds
Wired headphones never run out of battery and have superior audio quality- I can take real photos wiht high quality instead of relying on ever newer iPhone models for thousands of dollars which will always have lesser quality than a mirrorless camera for the same price- I have fun again discovering bands and artists on Bandcamp instead of mind numbing listening to Apple Music playlists- Coding via neovim on a terminal and just being on my keyboard navigating not only tmux and co, but also my OS is way more productive and fasterWhich of these can I not do on a Mac?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this bit very interesting&gt; I realised that my life while using Apple products is 
&gt; controlled by Product Managers/Owners who want to get a

&gt; passion as meMainly because I feel exactly the opposite. I don’t find Windows, Linux or x86 technologically exiting anymore.Apple makes (IMO of course) the most technologically exciting CPUs, their GPUs are a breath of fresh air, I love their approach to UI, APIs and OS security."</p>

Said we’d figure it out, but that she didn’t want me working for somebody like that.I knew it needed to happen but I’d been stressing about how to tell her for nearly a month. The amount of relief that came from her approval and endorsement was incredible. I was less nervous about quitting than I was nervous about telling her.Props to you man. Well done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great read. Thanks for sharing and congrats on your success!I&#39;m in a similar situation. I&#39;m working on a thing and my wife has been supporting me for some time now.Years ago she told me to leave my job and focus on my thing, but I was afraid. I&#39;ve been working since I was 19 years old and I have trust issues. It was very difficult for me to believe in myself and jump into the void but I&#39;m 42 and if I don&#39;t do it now I will never do it.Anyway, I&#39;m a couple of months from the first beta launch. I&#39;m happy, anxious, afraid, hopeful... all at the same time. I hope I&#39;ll be able to write a similar blog post in a year or two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re a keygen.sh user for our Modality product at Auxon. It&#39;s excellent. Some folks on the team have experience with some of traditional &#34;giants&#34; in the space like Nalpeiron and Flexera. Working with keygen.sh is an absolute joy by comparison. It&#39;s not without a few oddities and caveats of its own, but the experience writ large is so incredibly positive that those few issues are easy to forgive and forget.It&#39;s really interesting to get some backstage access to how this fantastic product came to be and what underpins the motivating thesis behind it.From one founder (also with little ones and a fantastically supportive partner) to another, my hat&#39;s off to you. My many thanks to both you and your partner. Being able to just grab keygen.sh and integrate licensing into our product helped us go from MA to GA in about a week and was also essential in getting some investors over the hump to funding (because we could show traction and an easier path to more of it). As a result, I got to reduce my stress level and spend more time with my kids over the summer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Been extremely happy with mine the past couple months. The little modular port attachments seemed like a novelty at first, but now it feels absurd that you&#39;d buy a laptop with a bunch of &#34;hardcoded&#34; ports that you can&#39;t ever change.The only real Linux related quirk I&#39;ve run into so far is that you have to disable panel self refresh (it&#39;s on by default and causes stuttering). Other than that tiny thing I pretty much just installed my stuff and started using it.One little anecdote: I got a card in the mail from Framework saying that there was a problem with the cable for the touchpad, and it had instructions on how to fix it. Contrast that to my experience with Apple where they would delete forum threads for laptop problems and spend years denying issues until legal action forced them to acknowledge it.Anyway, I&#39;m a fan. I&#39;m really looking forward to when the marketplace opens up with some new parts. I really want my blank keyboard. I&#39;m hoping 2021 will be the year I can own a laptop without a god damn windows logo emblazoned on the keys."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The baseline, preassembled model starts at $1000. Windows 10 Home, quad-core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB storage, a nice 2256x1504 display, thin and light (1.3kg, 11.7&#34; x 9&#34; x 0.6&#34;). Compare that to your other thin and light options at this pricepoint.XPS 13, $1020* i5* 8 GB RAM* 256 GB storage* 1920 x 1200 display* 1.2 kg, 11.6&#34; x 7.8&#34; x 0.6&#34;MacBook Pro: $1300* M1* 8 GB RAM* 256 GB storage* 2560 x 1600 display* 1.4kg, 12&#34; x 8.7&#34; x 0.6&#34;It&#39;s almost a no-brainer, even without considering the repairability, unless you like macOS. Unfortunately, not many people see repairability as a feature yet due to the toxic status quo, but this could change. I think that after brand recognition is established, this laptop could legitimately be competitive in the laptop market, and not just appeal to hardcore techies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just got one of these last weekend(I ordered it in early August) and so far it’s really great. The modular I/O and general mission of the company was what initially sold me on it, but now actually being hands on with it, I definitely feel secure in my decision to get one. I can’t overstate how good these modular ports are.I also really like that you can bring your own hardware in a lot of cases. For example I had an extra M.2 SSD laying around, so I ordered mine without one and installed it. You can also do this with the RAM, and even the wifi card.The only thing I’ve disliked about it so far is the arrow keys on the keyboard. Having full size keys for left and right but split keys for up and down feels weird, I would have preferred all full size arrow keys and a small right shift(because let’s be honest, when was the last time you used the right shift key?).For anyone curious about Linux on it, I’m running Arch and had basically 0 problems specific to the device. It’s my understanding there were some incompatibilities with certain kernel versions before so maybe some of these problems exist in distros like Debian with an older kernel, but I have had no issues.All in all, it’s just an exciting project and nice to see innovation in the space that isn’t just rounded corners or a sleeker edge or something where they take modularity or performance away for the sake of aesthetics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My impression is that every SaaS that is successful on ProductHunt (PH) or HN gets copied dozens of times within a few months. That&#39;s especially true for technically simple products. A good example is maybe privacy-friendly web analytics: I think products like Fathom and Simple Analytics were the first to really go after this angle (undoubedtly there were others before them though), and in less than 6 months dozens (hundreds?) of copycats turned up with exactly the same USP and the exact same look &amp; feel. And interestingly it isn&#39;t the first mover who seems to win that market but rather the company with the most agressive (and sometimes outright misleading) marketing. So being the first doesn&#39;t guarantee your success anymore, at least if you don&#39;t have enough time to grow undisturbed.Personally I&#39;d avoid posting products on PH or HN for that reason and instead focus on growing organically in a niche market where you&#39;re not immediately discoverable by copycat founders. In general PH feels more and more phony to me and I think there&#39;s a lot of astroturfing going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, the increase of SaaS businesses have made me more vary of actually using them.It seems like so many wants to have a successful semi-solo SaaS that pay their bills. They aren&#39;t longer a way to sell a product and a startup idea, but an attempt at a lifestyle. Some people throw up smooth landing pages for barely working products, and quickly move on to the next idea if it doesn&#39;t stick.How can I invest time and money in using a product if I&#39;m afraid the founder will bail after a few months?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a founder at heart; I&#39;ve loved creating - and have a software background. I really resonate with the paraphrased vibe of way, way more SaaS companies. I&#39;ve been looking outside of SaaS to potentially harder science companies rather than SaaS for future endeavors.It is too easy to: splash page, Wordpress, &#34;rails new saas&#34; for a product and then try to sell via SEO / outbound, etc that the field is quite saturated - and un-discovered niches are a lot harder than say 2013."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the theory that this event is what inspired the biblical story of Sodom. It reminds me of how paleontologists use the ancient art and stories of Native Australians to figure out what Pleistocene animals looked like and how they may have behaved.In the story, Lot and his family were one of the few people to escape the city before its destruction. God told his family to not look back at the city as it was being destroyed. Lot&#39;s wife looked back and turned into &#34;a pillar of salt&#34;. Maybe this is a metaphor for the people who went back to the site and couldn&#39;t grow food there due to the hypersaline that was spread across the region by the airburst."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been wearing a Casio F-91W for a number of years now and it really is a joy. It&#39;s always there, and it always works.I&#39;ve gone down the rabbit hole with expensive time pieces but they become a burden / obligation rather than a tool - especially as the prices of certain pieces in the secondary market have gone so high - so over time I&#39;ve reverted back to much cheaper watches and find myself getting more joy out of the cheaper &amp; much better value for money brands.Very occasionally I&#39;ll take it off in favour of a dress watch for a special event but otherwise I just wear it all the time, knowing that if it finally fails I&#39;m looking at $10 to replace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a Casio watch from Amazon about five years ago, there was a deal on and it was about CAD$20. A budgetary driven decision, for sure!But it&#39;s been fascinating to see, over the years, how many times I&#39;ve been approached (in a coffee shop or some other public place) by serious Casio enthusiasts, keen to ask about my watch and to show theirs. There&#39;s so many variations, colours, limited-runs editions... I seem to have accidentally stumbled into a niche with lots of passionate hobbyists - I&#39;m sort of glad I had to replace the awful strap, which snapped, so I actually have something to contribute to the conversation. I had no idea Casio watches were such a big thing, but now I&#39;m not at all surprised there are modding projects like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also a Casio fan, having picked up a GWM5600BC Radio Controlled/Solar model in 2010. I&#39;m wearing it to this day, having never changed the battery, taken out through all manner of wet and cold situations. I did sometimes have the problem of the battery running low in winter but switched off the wrist-flick light feature which constantly misfired under-sleeve and haven&#39;t had it since. Atomic clock updates daily are the cherry on top. Here&#39;s to the next decade!"</p>

Nor is it reserved for their flagship models - the 2016 iPhone SE also gets the latest and greatest.Meanwhile, my flagship android phone from 2018, the Samsung Galaxy S9, is stuck on the last version of Android.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s funny how every society has its own way of mistreating children, yet never considers it a problem at the time. We look at the ways children were harmed and exploited throughout history and shake our heads at how our morally underdeveloped forebears could be so cruel and misguided. Then we turn around and declare that our children have no right whatsoever to privacy, and that everything they read and write should be surveilled 24/7 by teams of strangers, for their &#34;own good&#34;.I firmly believe that a hundred years, people will look back on practices like this and shake their heads at the appalling attitudes their primitive ancestors had towards children. But I imagine that&#39;s little comfort to the kids subject to this kind of abuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much harm the constant surveillance does.We are training kids that someone is always watching. That they have to censor their thoughts and hold in their feelings rather than talk about them with others for fear of it being determined to be &#39;wrong&#39;. How many of these kids will be suspended, expelled, medicated, etc for things that were harmless? I think this surveillance will cause these kids to be less independent and delay their maturation because it&#39;s safer to do what you&#39;re told, not explore questions you have, and suppress your opinions.The number of conversations I had in school that would have gotten me I&#39;m trouble today would be a lot. I would guess they would have expelled me for some of it, even though it was totally harmless.Where is the cost benefit analysis? Or is this just another &#39;common sense&#39; solution because &#39;think of the children&#39;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty outrageous. This constant need to fully control and monitor everything your kids are doing is getting out of hand and will by itself lead to severe problems and mental issues for the future generations.I mean, who didnt share or look at some porn when they were 10 years old? Would it be worth it for a whole army of teachers and consultants to descend on you and file an “incident report” and a “follow up” and “de brief” for this? What a colossal waste of resources and money. The $300k for the software could be better spent elsewhere.And yes, one suicide was apparently prevented, but then here we are again at the same argument, its like the one in the current apple/child porn case.Should we all get monitored just because of one positive but disproportionately small outcome?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is unlikely to work because of the timing delay. Suppose a member of Congress has access to inside information and trades on it. They have 45 days to disclose the trade. By the time the trade is disclosed, the market has already moved: if Pelosi or McConnell or whoever bought low so they could sell high, a month later the increase is probably already baked in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.cnbc.com/id/218.htmlThis reminds me of a study which showed that even if you bought the same stocks a month after Buffett and his holding company Berkshire Hathaway disclosed their own purchases, you&#39;d still be way ahead of the game.&#34;The market ... appears to under-react to the news of a Berkshire stock investment since a hypothetical portfolio that mimics Berkshire&#39;s investments created the month after they are publicly disclosed earns positive abnormal returns of 14.26% per year.&#34;But Buffett is a long term investor. 
I am not sure how long the Pelosis hold their stocks...But yes, insider trades :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a bit like a popular hedge fund strategy known as alpha capture. In the alpha capture strategy, funds look at the buy/sell recommendations made by analysts (for example those at the major banks). Applying a systematic approach means that they can measure the accuracy of each individual analyst and choose whether or not to follow along by trading the advice from that person. The best analysts eventually get hired into funds for their picks to be exclusive.I built something (DueDilly) that works in a similar way by monitoring the performance of Reddit user&#39;s stock recommendation and tracking how each idea performs and which users do well. You can choose to trade alongside them based on their track records.My site:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The social proof that a couch surfing reference brought was second to none. Each one boils down to this &#34;I, a stranger, stayed for a few nights in this other strangers home for free, and they were good human beings&#34;. That social proof carried to any part of the globe you visited.I cannot think of an internet app that brought people together in a more meaningful and wholesome way at scale.It was great while it lasted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Airbnb ruined Couchsurfing because it changed social expectations around hosting strangers at your house. Before Airbnb, no one really even thought people would pay for the privilege to sleep on your couch or your spare bedroom. But once Airbnb started getting popular, I think a lot of hosts on CS were thinking well, this is neat, but I could get paid doing this. And a lot of CS guests became refugees from Airbnb thinking &#34;well, if Airbnb wants me to pay for this, why do I go to CS and get it for free?&#34;I CS&#39;d only once, in Ghana in 2011. It was great, but I was too late for the trend, it died pretty shortly after."</p>

Typed my password, got it wrong. Typed it again, got it wrong. Eventually got locked out of my account, despite being extremely careful to type my password correctly. Went to IT and had them unlock my account...Went back to my PC and tried to log in again. Typed my password very carefully, letter by letter, watching each letter come up on screen as I went. When I went to type the letter p, nothing happened. I hit p repeatedly, nothing.I figured the switch for the p key on my keyboard had died or something, so I went to IT and got a new keyboard. Unplugged the old, plugged in the new. Still no p. OK, this is getting ridiculous. Clicked on accessibility tools and tried to use the on-screen keyboard to type in my password. _Still couldn&#39;t type the letter p, even with the on-screen keyboard._Ended up having to hard reset the machine, and then everything was fine and dandy. Still have no idea what could have happened. It ended up being the last straw that pushed me to Ubuntu, and I&#39;ve never looked back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN!I built this small app in my spare time to aggregate books recommended on Hacker News. I personally find books recommended on HN to be super helpful, so I think this is the way that I can contribute back.This book aggregation idea is not new. A bunch of sites have done similar things [1, 2, 3].Yet one common limitation of those sites is that they have limited recall (i.e. not able to get a comprehensive set of book mentions), and thus don&#39;t paint an accurate picture of what the top books are. They&#39;re all based on insufficient rules, e.g., looking for Amazon Links. As you can see from my app, people often do not include Amazon links when recommending a book.I wondered, why can&#39;t we just match book names? Well, not so easy. Some books have pretty short names, e.g. Meditations [4], or Steve Jobs [5]. Some book name might as well be the name of a movie, e.g. Ready Player One [6]. Simply matching the names of the books would produce a whole lot of irrelevant results.This is where Deep Learning comes into play. Recent advances in large NLP models (transformers and BERT in particular) have made machine language understanding unprecedentedly accurate. It enables me to fine-tune a BERT model on a couple thousand labeled HN comments and predict accurately whether each word in a comment is part of a book or not - a task commonly termed as Named Entity Recognition (NER).As a result, my app is able to present a whole lot more results while maintaining desirable accuracy. For example, NER works pretty well on the tough examples I mentioned ([4, 5, 6]). Compared to prior sites, my app captures 9-50X more mentions and thus presents a much more complete picture of what books are recommended on HN.Furthermore, I&#39;ve made sure that the comments are presented well in the UI because the recommendations are just as useful as the books. I highlighted the mentioned book name, and used a custom NLP-based ranking function to sort the comments. These are non-trivial improvements over prior sites, which I hope you can find useful.Nevertheless, this app is not without limitations: 1) matching book names would fail when two books have the same or similar names; 2) although not often, this approach would wrongly classify some short stop-word names [7] and 3) sometimes NER fails to see that the commenter actually hates the book. These problems can be alleviated with more Deep Learning. For 1), one can use BERT to learn the authors mentioned which can be used as a filtering criteria. 2) and 3) should be fixable with more training data (currently there are only ~4,000 hand-labeled HN comments).Lastly, I&#39;d like to especially thank my gf who helped me label ~1,000 comments, which boosted the model accuracy by 5 percent! I also want to thank the people who create and maintain the HackerNews big query dataset [8]. And of course, thank everyone on HN who recommends books to others.Hope you enjoy this app!  Feedback and suggestions are welcome :)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15169611[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10924741[3] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12365693[4] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/0/all-t...[5] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/1/all-t...[6] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/0/all-t...[7] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/12/past...[8] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19304326P.s. The amazon links are NOT sponsored. This app is free of monetization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice. The Hacker News archive contains a wealth of great information. I&#39;ve previously performed similar extractions like OP but with grep and SQL. I&#39;ve also looked for people who have accurately predicted the stock market (I did identify one pro investor. He&#39;s now into NFTs). I&#39;ve found so much cool stuff, spending whole nights looking for interesting users and reading their entire post histories and being blown away by many insightful posts. I&#39;ve been considering making a blog consisting entirely of insightful HN posts that I come across."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You mention the Amazon links are not affiliate links. As a default, that&#39;s a nice move, but I believe you are within your rights to add a toggle to enable affiliate links. The money probably isn&#39;t the point but it&#39;s nice to make enough to buy even a single beer or coffee from a side project, and honestly I believe just about everyone would toggle the option if they found the tool useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a minor counterpoint: I&#39;ve come to dread blogs and newsletters because so many of them are written by grind culture freaks who only write faux-insightful SEO&#39;d content as a way to build an audience to sell snake oil to. These days the only blogs I trust are the ones I see on the top of HN or lobsters, which is unfortunate because I have interests beyond tech and I find it very, very difficult to find good blogs I can read about those interests.I think that shows there is a problem with blogging that goes beyond just the medium. Consider that blogging is a decentralised ecosystem, so you have no central place for discovery outside of Google specifically and search generally. Being on the top of Google is an attractive proposition because it means many eyeballs and lots of ad revenue. Therefore it is natural that many new blogs exist to game the search engine, hence the term &#34;blogspam&#34;.Some of the same incentives exist with large social media sites as well, but on Twitter and the like if you mute/block enough big people and follow only those you care about, your feed will eventually become clean enough to look at every day. So I think it is much more important to solve the discovery problem with blogs if you want them to get more traction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah blogs are still here, BUT: (like email (sob) and telephone-calling (hooray)) a lot of people that once did blog don&#39;t anymore.Not in the &#34;I had kids so my blog went dark for a few years&#34; sense, but in the sense of &#34;ooh twitter was invented and now I just emit a halfassed one-sentence brainfart or 5-second tiktok cellphone video and get way more dopamine hits&#34;.I&#39;ve been reading blogs and perusing my self-curated NetNewsWire RSS feeds for 20+ years, and blogs never went away, RSS never died, Google Reader getting googled didn&#39;t really matter, etc.And there are probably technically more blogs now than ever before.But still, the blog kinda died, in the sense that it would be a lot more surprising to learn your friend&#39;s 80-year-old grandma has a blog today than it would have been in 2011.It went from an increasingly-mainstream thing to a decreasingly-mainstream thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, blogs are still very much there. I began blogging in 2006 and I still continue to write blog posts, mostly to take notes, share my thoughts, etc. I still follow my favourite bloggers via RSS feeds. I don&#39;t think the culture of blogging ever went away. The blogosphere along with its tag clouds are still very much there.I think what has changed in the last two decades or so is that a lot of new users have come on the Internet and this new generation of users spend most of their time in walled gardens thereby making the bloggers look like a small minority."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A more relevant metric to consider - monthly mortgage payment to monthly income ratio.Average interest rates in 2007 were 6.34% vs ~2.80% today. [1]* 6.34% / $2,000 monthly payment / 20% down (~$65k) &gt;&gt; $328,319 price of home* 2.80% / $2,000 monthly payment / 20% down (~$98k) &gt;&gt; $489,794 price of homeHomebuyers will make purchasing decision based on their monthly mortgage payments, instead of the home price.When interest rates fall, the home&#39;s price goes up but the monthly payment can stay the same. Therefore, increases in home (and other asset, since lower bowering costs can drive institutional investment in assets higher and non-linearly) prices can be driven higher without any change in supply / demand dynamics.Some hypotheticals to consider:* as rates approach and touch 0, what will drive up home prices then?* what happens when rates go up?[1] http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it doesn&#39;t directly affect the average person&#39;s purchasing power, the same dramatic increase is happening in other asset values as well. [0] One interesting thing to note is that 2019 EV / EBITDA values were already &#34;high,&#34; before the coronavirus was spreading.I suspect these two phenomena have different causes overall, but low interest rates are a common factor that cause all asset prices to increase.On the housing side, I suspect consumers purchase the house that their cashflow can comfortably support, not necessarily the one where they believe it is correctly valued, because the assumption that house values only increase means purchasing a well constructed house is almost never a &#34;bad deal.&#34;I&#39;m not sure what the &#34;solution,&#34; is, but knowing that voters hate when their home values fall does not give me confidence that prices will decrease in the long term.[0] https://www.statista.com/statistics/953641/sandp-500-ev-to-e..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I live in Austin TX and got one of the mailers last year.  I was wondering how you pulled it off.The handwriting on the outside does make it look personal but, once you open it, it is obviously computer generated due to the consistency of the writing.  If anything, I&#39;d say the writing in inside undermined the message because nobody is going to handwrite a letter to solicit that business.  You should test only doing the signature only and see if impacts your response rate.We also got a couple of &#39;we want to buy your home&#39; mailings.  It does feel like it impacts our open rate but I can&#39;t tell if it is just due to novelty.I think the main reason it &#39;works&#39; as a business proposition is that the City is doing blanket increases and relying on protests to catch their mistakes.  They do this (in part) because they are forbidden from using actual MLS data.  It costs me 3-4 hours to do a protest so outsourcing it makes sense if your time is valuable.  But when it came down to it, I wasn&#39;t willing to let them represent me -- something about it felt off -- and I wound up just accepting the increase.The system doesn&#39;t feel broken -- just wasteful.  How else are you going to do a property tax?  I do wonder if this goes the way of medical billing (overcharge at first because you know you are going to lose some to protests) or it creates a watchdog effect that make the City limit the increases to an amount that is not likely to draw protests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really impressive and fun to build I&#39;m sure. I bought an Axidraw last year to play around with making fake signatures of fake people and as well we were getting a ton of Etsy orders and we always write a hand written note, but we couldn&#39;t keep up at Christmas time and my wife&#39;s wrist was breaking, so it saved our bacon when we had to write like 600 notes in 6 weeks.The fact that you have to keep replacing the sheet and realigning is definitely a drag, but we made a system that worked well enough for us. Making the SVG letters is a pain and we are working on designing our own font from my wife&#39;s handwriting, but you can at least SVGize a picture of your writing and then touch it up in an editor.Gives a good excuse to buy lots of different fun pens and paper, but yeah it&#39;s annoying when a pen stops writing half a letter and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just an ink thing or a pressure thing.We&#39;ve gotten positive reviews that mention our handwritten notes at least and lots of comments on great service and such, so we think it makes a difference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; seems to compare the Firefox version number with 65 ... I’ve no idea what the purpose of this isI previously worked on JS infra at Google.  Google uses a lot of shared JS libraries that date back over a decade, and those libraries have accumulated lots of workarounds for browsers that nobody cares about anymore.  (One especially crazy seeming one from today&#39;s perspective is that there&#39;s a separate implementation of event propagation, I believe because because it dates back to browsers that only implemented one half of event bubbling/capture!)It&#39;s very difficult to remove an old workaround because1. it&#39;s hard to be completely sure nobody actually depends on the workaround (especially given the wide variety of apps and environments Google supports -- Firefox aside, Google JS runs on a lot of abandonware TVs), and2. it&#39;s hard to prioritize doing such work, because it&#39;s low value (a few less bytes of JS) and nonzero risk (see point 1) without meaningfully moving any metrics you care about.In all, how to eliminate accumulated cruft like is a fascinating problem to me in that I can&#39;t see how it ever gets done.  And it&#39;s not a Google thing.  Even the newer cooler startup I now work at has similar &#34;work around old Safari bug, not sure if it&#39;s safe to remove&#34; codepaths that I can imagine will stick around forever, for similar reasons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technically, color me impressed.Business-wise, I&#39;m skeptical:- Alternative browser engines have always fallen behind, eventually.- Open-source is a huge win for most embedded applications.- Having a big company backing something is a huge win too, since something like Webkit ain&#39;t going away.I think one possible outcome here might be an acquisition. Microsoft was forced to eat crow with Edge adopting Google&#39;s engine. This would be an opportunity for Apple, Microsoft, or Amazon to leapfrog Google. A GPU or multicore-accelerated browser could make the iPhone/Macbook/etc. much more responsive than Chrome.Another might be some open-source strategy, but I don&#39;t quite know what it might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"*Closed source browser.Flow is yet another project pulling on open source resources, and the browser market created from open browsers, and trying to privatize it. Imagine if google could just make whatever internal changes to chromium and nobody knew about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was so much worse than I imagined. It was a physical dragnet at a private safe deposit box business and the FBI is trying to claim all the customer&#39;s belongings under civil asset forfeiture because a dog smelled marijuana. Meanwhile two legitimate businesses who cannot legally transact with banks were customers and the boxes were not airtightThis is brazen overreach and needs to be reigned in"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly relevant to the article, but it&#39;s probably a public service to have this here:
If you&#39;re in the U.S., do not consent to a search! Ever!If the police ask permission to search you, your car, or your house, say &#34;I do not consent to a search&#34;. Followed by, &#34;Am I being detained?&#34; If the answer is &#34;No, you are not being detained.&#34; then leave immediately (unless at your house, in which case go inside and lock the door).Police are good at making you feel as if you have to consent. They might say, &#34;We&#39;re going to search your car now.&#34; Makes it seem like you don&#39;t have a choice and it&#39;s happening one way or another, yeah? Well it&#39;s not the case. That was your cue to say, &#34;I do not consent to a search&#34;. Saying &#34;I do not consent to a search&#34; might prevent a search or make evidence obtained during that [illegal] search inadmissible. Or it might be found that the police had probable cause or other reason to make the search legal, in which case you lost nothing.Record + immediately upload such an interaction if you can.As an aside, I appreciate like 90% of the work the police do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just to share my own setup, I&#39;ve been living in a van for the past year. I develop mostly via SSH and RDP so I found that any connection was important and total bandwidth wasn&#39;t the highest priority. Also in the US, way better coverage of 4g. Because of that invested fully in 4g and not at all in 5g.* 11 in 1 Panorama External Antenna (LG-IN2447) around $500. 4 internal cradlepoint antennas, see photo below. In retrospect would not have invested so heavily in wifi antennas and bought more 4g. I also added a little antenna lifter to make sure it has line of site of all cell towers, I wanted it to be the highest point on my sprinter van roof.* Cradlepoint IBR1700 1200M-B around $900 on ebay. Runs on 12 volt, a ton of antenna ports has 1 internal modem that supports big US carriers, came with an additional modem that does the same for carrier aggregation. A bunch of different ways to configure the router to aggregate links, mostly I switch back and forth manually, I found that if there was an issue it would be obvious and I could just switch the link. Cradlepoint software wouldn&#39;t handle issues and signal strength that well. Honestly one carrier has been plenty good for me though and between ATT and Verizon, I only have issues in the national parks where there are cell dead zones.* Verizon and ATT 4g cell plans. I added 1 line on my family plan for Verizon and the same with a friends family plan with ATT for $20 a month each. Took some phone calls into support to get it to work but after some escalations in the support chain I have unlimited 4g data. Total bill is around $50 a month.* Still room to add more sim cards and more antennas. It honestly works great though, get 20-150 mbps basically everywhere.Photo of my antenna and cradlepoint router/modem:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a pretty impressive setup. Recently I lived in an RV for a year and my setup was much more janky than this...Basically consisted of a gl.inet router that I plugged in a old Moto X4. This allowed me to get wifi from whichever campsite we stayed at (always garbage) and then I would pay for 100GB from Cricket and T-Mobile. I would swap sims when I would run out of data about half way through the month.Then I discovered I could get unlimited data on Cricket with a regular phone plan if I changed the TTL on the router. Ended up being the most stable option for the last few months."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived and worked remotely from a van in Australia for a year... in 2008. It was pretty different back then. We kitted the van out with a solar panel  and batteries. There was some 3G service available near roads, and something like CDMA a little more widely. But at times we&#39;d end up driving miles of dirt track to try to find high ground to pick up a signal. My gf would hold the 3G receiver up and look for signal. During one of these treks, trying to turn around on a narrow dirt track way outside of Tenant Creek, the side of the road collapsed like a sand dome under one wheel of the van and we began listing to the side. I had to hold it up with my shoulder so the whole van wouldn&#39;t fall over on its side. My gf got out, causing it to tip even more, and started throwing herself against the back of it, while I tried to rock it out of the ditch. It was at this point that I noticed that what I had thought was a tree branch (odd, since there were no trees around), was actually a 4-5 foot long black snake that was moving rather quickly toward us up the road. I guess that gave us the adrenaline burst we needed, because we miraculously heaved the van free and jumped inside just in time. I started it and unceremoniously drove right over the snake.Another funny story... One night camping off a road, not in a campsite, we heard a ruckus outside the van where we had our table and cooking  stuff set up under a tarp. It was pitch black out. We kept a katana under the platform bed for protection. So I opened the rear door and jumped out in my boxers and sandals, holding this sword, and found myself looking at a large kangaroo that was rifling through our cookware. I got back in the van and said, forget it, I&#39;m not fighting that thing... we&#39;ll just have to clean it up in the morning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I offer phone support for a niche accounting app (https://quailhq.com), and everything in this article rings 112% true to me -- but especially this:&gt; ...all sorts of people call you, and I’ve really learned a lot by talking with users directly on the phone.Sometimes users call me because they want to report a bug, or they&#39;ve forgotten their email address. Sometimes they want business advice (!), or they have a niche feature they want to request.&gt; This may be a virtue of the Japanese, but, basically, everyone who calls is civil and polite.Hahahaha. Haha. Hah. Ahem. The biggest surprise to me when I started offering support (first email, and then later by phone) is how _aggressive_ people can be. My app has two classes of users -- one free, one paid -- and the paying users are almost invariably polite and efficient while the free users can be really quite...hard to help. &#34;YOUR SHITS BROKE FIX ASAP&#34; is my favorite password reset request, etc.All of my users are American (or Australian), which might have something to do with it. Happily, once you break through that aggressive exterior and people realize you&#39;re just a person trying to help them out they almost invariably do a 180 and become helpful and polite, and we get whatever it was straightened out together.It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s something cultural happening in America that&#39;s making everyone assume the worst when interacting with people they don&#39;t know..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would abstract this topic to: talking to your users is important, and phone is a high-bandwidth medium.In particular, it seems like this developer recognized that phone connects them to their less technically savvy users, who - by being most different from the dev himself - can give him the most valuable outside perspective. Depending on your market, if you&#39;re trying to sell into non-techies this could provide hugely valuable insights.In general, the closer you are to the development side of things, the more you have a very specific (and I guess &#34;correct&#34;) model of how your system works. By default, all of your documentation/support forms/etc implicitly reflect this model. But if your users model the thing in their brain differently, then your help/form aren&#39;t the most helpful in educating them or eliciting their true feedback/problem.One final thing - I have seen &#39;magic&#39; where developers who chafed at tickets coming in from support staff (withdrawn, user error) would all of a sudden get excited about rebuilding something when the user themselves or even the support person, just explained in a higher-bandwidth way why the problem is real. It&#39;s easy to read a ticket and go &#34;oh that&#39;s dumb, they should just do X&#34; but on the phone/in person you go more into like &#34;oh, this is a really reasonable/nice/smart person who&#39;s trying to use my system to do something important, and it&#39;s not letting them.&#34;Gets a totally different type of results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I ran my own business I had a product in the thousands of dollars price range. Phone support for this product would almost always be an interesting conversation where I learned a lot about customer needs.I also had a $25 PDF tool with a trial version. For that product a lot of the callers had no clue what the product actually did or tried to get a $5 discount or some other nonsense. I quickly stopped taking calls for that product because it was so unpleasant.My lesson was to offer phone support only for high price, low volume items. Phone support for cheap things attracts a lot of unpleasant people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s excellent advice that many have learned the hard way...Honestly even as a non-manager it&#39;s a very bad idea. When I was a junior one of my colleagues was called to the manager&#39;s office. I assumed it would be for some mundane project scheduling or whatever, so I jokingly said &#34;you&#39;re getting fired&#34; as he was going there. And he was.This is one of these memories that come back to haunt you late at night when you&#39;re trying to sleep..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a more general advice - person in position of power should not joke about causing harm. Whether is is manager joking about firing employee, stronger person joking about beating up weaker one or parent joking about throwing child out of house when they misbehave. This kind of humor works only when it is coming from weaker position and even then only in certain situations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No one told me this prior to becoming a manager, and I did make this mistake once and immediately regretted it.It seems like obvious advice, but the circumstances where this sort of thing could happen are described very well in the article.I revert to humour in awkward situations, like a lot of people, but I quickly realised that there are some things that you can’t joke about when in this position.Thankfully I don’t think the team member took any offence by it (although how would I know) - we had a good rapport and relationship, but I immediately realised my “joke” could be taken so many different (wrong) ways that I made a conscious decision to be much more careful after that.Like many things in life, it seems blindingly obvious in retrospect but not necessarily when you’re caught up in the moment."</p>

Case in point: I recently purchased an air purifier but was worried that I would get a fake product since they are notorious for co-mingling. I ended up buying one from Target online which also has free two day shipping now. For anyone who is looking for an alternative to Amazon, it seems like the big retailers (Walmart, Target, Best Buy) have finally caught up with their online offerings.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon used to be awesome and Prime felt so worth it, you could just get stuff sent to you and skip a trip to the store.Now we call it Scamazon and you spend like 30 minutes weeding through crap, scammy duplicate looking listings and fake reviews for any signs that a single item is worth buying before you give up and go to Walmart.It&#39;s so sad that it&#39;s gotten to the point where I think Walmart has better quality and prices than Amazon.We see dollar store stuff on Amazon for like $27 all the time.It&#39;s like they let their brand erode to pure garbage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the upsetting things about this crackdown is that some of the brands mentioned in the article actually produced good products. I&#39;d have much rathered people purchase products from Ravpower and Aukey than DiHines, AINOPE, Ailun, yootech, SMALLElectric, TT&amp;C, or Amoner, all of which appear on the first page of results for &#34;USB C charger&#34;.Besides the review misconduct, I do think a lot of people&#39;s issues with Amazon stem from purchasing no-name products from unknown sellers, an action that is made horrendously easy by Amazon&#39;s UI. I&#39;ve purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of items from Amazon, and I have had a perfect experience by following two rules: (1) always buy from Amazon (not a marketplace seller), and (2) always buy a reputable brand.Others have mentioned the issue of co-mingling inventory, and while I believe it&#39;s an issue, I&#39;ve never come across a purchase from Amazon that looked anything less than legitimate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a systems guy, I find this situation quite interesting in the way in which it exposed interlocks in the car rental pipeline that were previously not visible.What I hadn&#39;t appreciated was that Car Rental companies had constructed a model where they bought new cars, rented them for a couple of years, and then resold them. The car would depreciate of course but as a bulk car buyer they got the cars at a discount on dealer cost because, well they bought more than the average dealer did. So when they depreciated they didn&#39;t lose as much value as you and I might experience if we bought a car, held it for two years, and resold it to a dealer (worst case) or another buyer (best case).So the rental agency simply tracked how much the car would &#34;lose&#34; in value over its working lifetime, plus the cost of needed maintenance (generally relatively low), and offset that with income of renting it out. So the math was something like (making up numbers here) $5,000 of depreciation loss against say 400 rental days at $50/day or $20,000 of rental income. Say $1000 for maintenance during those 2 years and you&#39;ve got $14,000 of &#34;gross income&#34; into the company, per car to pay employees and operating costs etc.Now this makes sense and it is a fine business model, but an interesting quirk is that revenue is directly proportional to the number of &#39;working&#39; cars you have out there bringing in the bucks. More cars, more income. And if you buy the car on credit there is an interest expense sure but you don&#39;t use up working capital to bulk up your fleet and boost your income.As a result, car rental companies were carrying a HUGE amount of debt pre-pandemic which was all in car investments.Then BOOM, the black swan of a pandemic hit and air travel stopped for all intents and purposes and now rental car companies are sitting on fleets of cars where they have to make the monthly payment on the debt but those cars aren&#39;t earning any income. This burns money in a hurry! So they did the only thing they could do, and sold off their fleets for the most part so that they could retire all that debt. Some, like Hertz, were already in Chapter 11 bankruptcy when they did that. Late 2020 was an excellent time to buy a car from one of the rental companies because they were really motivated to get them off their balance sheets.And this then is the fun part. So the pandemic also put a huge blip in the supply chain. And since every single car company had switched to &#34;just in time&#34; manufacturing where they don&#39;t stock parts to make cars, they expect a smooth flow of those parts from the supply chain to feed their assembly lines, had to stop making cars. They had no parts. What is more, the humans in the pipeline like truck drivers, container crane operators, container ship crews, freight forwarding staff, Etc. were quarantining or not working because of the pandemic risk and those are jobs you cannot do &#34;remotely&#34; no matter how much you might want to. So the supply of new cars dried up, and won&#39;t untwist until the entire chain is back up and running at capacity again.So now the pandemic is &#34;less scary&#34; because smart people have vaccinated themselves and they start traveling again. And those people want to rent cars. Which is great for rental car companies, except they cannot rebuild their fleets because there aren&#39;t any cars to buy.And this adds the second fun twist, if you bought a car new in 2019 (as I did), and it is the kind of car rental companies might rent (which mine is), you get letters from the dealer in 2021 offering to buy it back from you for more than you paid for it!What is more, when you see all those cars that are going to be &#39;totalled&#39; by the insurance company because they were under water in the southern part of the US or on the east coast, those cars used to be sold for pennies on the dollar in &#34;salvage sales&#34; in which salvage dealers would recover parts and/or do enough repairs to resell them with a salvage title. The bidding for those cars is much more intense given the demand by rental car companies for stock, any stock, to boost their fleets.It is a remarkable example of a system where the parts are interconnected in non-obvious ways that has a non-intuitive response to shocks to the system. As with most &#34;emergent&#34; systems like this one though, sending a shock through it does two things; it illuminates these previously unseen inter dependencies, and it tends to kill off weak players."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"City-dweller here. I was on the public transport bandwagon. Then summer 2020 came and I realized the buses were at limited capacity, Uber and Lyft drivers were practically non-existent, and the big 3 car rentals were liquidating their inventory. So I bought a used car, just in time too.I still hate car ownership: the parking fees, maintenance, shocking price of gas, insurance, etc. It&#39;s costing me $20/day to sit mostly in a garage. I was saving up for a BEV. But realized air travel is out of commission and a BEV might not be practical for road trip vacations, at least not right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty cool but why does it have to be limited to AirTag or any specific devices? It would be easy to expand it to keep track of any nearby Bluetooth device and a corresponding whitelist. (Or do AirTag devices rotate Bluetooth MACs?)Airtags are just one implementation of a Bluetooth transmitter and a long life battery but anyone could probably build a similar device dedicated to tracking with off the shelf parts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Our goal is to protect privacy and to find out how many people are opposed to tracking.Asking how many ppl are opposed to tracking is a silly question that won’t get you anywhere — it’s answer in a vacuum doesn’t make sense as it needs to be contextualized. “Are you ok with google seeing your IP so they can sell you ads to give you free YouTube” is an example of context where people see trade offs. Most people won’t understand the full spectrum of what’s going on, and if it all in the end results in just ads, many are fine with that as long as they’re getting free stuff with it.The bigger questions on societal level trade offs shouldn’t be answered by lay people but rather regulation in the name of public interest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instead of buying what they sold two decades ago for practically nothing, they should have built more supply.Open Google Maps and check Kreuzberg, a district of Berlin. South of it is Tempelhofer Feld, 355 hectares (a third of Kreuzberg), a discontinued airport next to the city only used for people to bike and do barbecues. It&#39;s an old airport so it looks bland and there are smaller parks right next to it offering the space to do barbecues and play with your dog. It&#39;s been a decade that this airport is not being used yet it&#39;s still in that state.Paris&#39; housing crisis is mostly due to the road surrounding it (le Périph&#39;) but Berlin doest not have that yet housing is getting more expensive extremely fast, faster than in Paris actually."</p>

For those who haven’t heard of them, maybe the younger members on here or anyone from outside the U.K., OS maps were the U.K. standard before GPS and Google Maps et al. We were even taught how to read them as kids at school and youth centres (eg scouts). In the days before ubiquitous GPS, it was considered an important life skill to read maps, understand grid references and all the various different markings on an OS map. To this day I still find OS maps to be the best around for clarity and information density. Though I won’t deny I also have a little nostalgia for their stylings too.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Atmospheric refraction is a thing. From where I live I have a 45 mile view to a city. And a telescope.The view varies a lot, and not just because of haze.When the seeing is clear and the light is good it&#39;s just about possible to make out tall buildings. Some days they&#39;re clearly visible above the horizon. Other days they seem partially obscured. Every once in a while they seem to float above the horizon rather than on it.Clearly there&#39;s some refraction happening. And if there was anything behind the city - there isn&#39;t, for about a hundred miles or so - I might be able to see that too.There have been a few times where I&#39;ve wondered if I can, but at that distance it&#39;s impossible to be sure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am a professional traffic engineer and I build micro-simulation models for most of the projects I am involved with. I can say that compared to software that is used in industry (PTV Vissim, PTV Vistro, and Trafficware Synchro) it looks like A/B is a reasonable toy model that can get pretty close to the real thing. I think it is great that software exists at a level for individuals without huge budgets to be able to build and play around with traffic networks. Automating the intersection setup goes a long way toward this type of tool being accessible to the lay person. All that being said, I think the limitations of any model are important to understand when interpreting the outputs. I can take any model and make traffic flow or decrease the delay per vehicle, that doesn&#39;t mean my results are realistic.Keep up the work, this is an awesome tool and I hope it can get to the point where it can easily help inform people about traffic design and simulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got hit with a ~40Gbps DDoS last week. These attacks are on the rise. Some responses to folks above: Success working with upstreams is quite varied.  Some care, some don&#39;t, and it can be difficult to get to folks that can help- even if their networks are impacted as well.  Some carriers immediately turn this into a sales opp. - buy more bandwidth, buy more services.In our case it was based on DNS reflection from a large number of hosts.  I&#39;ve contacted the top sources (ISPs hosting the largest number of attackers) and provided IPs and timestamps. I&#39;ve received zero responses.Geo-based approaches yielded no helpful reduction in source traffic.Also, during this event we discovered an upstream of ours had misconfigured our realtime blackhole capability.  As a result, I&#39;m going to add recurring testing for this capability and burn a couple IPs to make sure upstreams are listening to our rtbh announcements.Very concerned about the recent microtik CVE, as that is going to make for some very large botnets.Personally this all is very disappointing because it creates an incentive to centralize / de-distribute applications to a few extremely large infrastructure providers who can survive an attack of these magnitudes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since this is HN, it’s 2021 and DDoS’es are still a thing:  why are they still a thing? Is there some fundamental “anonymity” to the Internet that makes it impossible to structurally prevent DDoS attacks? Apart from CloudFlare-like approaches, are there any R&amp;D in the pipeline that may kill this type of attack once and for all?To me it’s incredibly infuriating to see the damage that still happens with these extremely simple techniques. Will it ever end?Edit: to elaborate, I know that there are tons of insecure Internet devices and whatnot. I’m more interested in standards, and core protocol improvements that can fundamentally rid the world of these types of attacks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very much not a network engineer, but I&#39;d like to understand the magnitude of this issue because my intuition is wrong:250 Gbps seems like it would definitely be a lot for a server or website but it also seem like a drop in the bucket for an ISP providing broadband for many customers.Clearly I&#39;m wrong because it is an issue here. I&#39;d like to understand why I&#39;m wrong, and I hope that here, on HN, that&#39;s taken in the spirit of curiosity intended and not negativism.So, what am I missing? Maybe Belgian broadband is lower capacity than what I&#39;m used to in a US metropolitan area? Maybe this particular ISP served a population too small to have a... um... &#34;fat pipe&#34;? I&#39;d like to understand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems great for language/library knowledge. As an experienced polyglot, the languages are not where I&#39;m hitting the wall these days though. It&#39;s the tooling. I can learn new language basics faster than I can figure out the ecosystem/tooling.For example, my current conundrum is how to deploy an Elixir Phoenix/MQTT app. Writing the app was a fun curve to climb. And I could use techniques like described here to learn from others in the actual programming. But how to build an executable I can wrap in a systemd process running on a different machine? Those are actions people do, not expressed so much in code I can look at. The few blogs I can find on the subject are mired in deep CI toolchains.I want the blog that discusses the secret sauce to learn to acquire the knowledge to work the raft of ever evolving tools we have to work with now days. The &#34;materials&#34; (the languages) are the easy part now days. It&#39;s the massively automated complicated machinery we&#39;ve built around the language of ideas that are my personal pain point of entry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey, author here. Surprised to see this on the front page of HN since I wrote it 5 years ago.I&#39;ve always been fascinated with talent acquisition and skill development and would probably different recommendations today after having more experience and reading Ultralearning by Scott Young."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two things I did and always do: Code things that solve real problems you want to solve. The harder the problem, the better you&#39;ll get in the language and as a programmer in general.Second, look at existing open source, well written code that, again, solves a problem you&#39;re interested in. I always emphasize this: Things you&#39;re passionate about. That way you can master any language/framework. By master here, I mean you can code anything you want in the technology efficiently. Your final app will be: Easy to modify/enhance, easy to understand in terms of code. Memory and CPU efficient in terms of runtime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here in Mexico we have an opposite view of this: The majority of developers have spent their professional life doing &#34;consulting&#34; jobs in outsourcing firms. Few devs have experience developing a product and taking care of it 2 or 3 years later.The difference shows in the type of code they do, the &#34;ownership&#34; and engagement they have: Those with a consulting mind will do something and then have the notion that once its &#34;done&#34; they don&#39;t have to care about it. Those that have been  bitten by their own code from the past have a better notion on how to write maintainable code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I completely disagree.Consulting is not for everyone and like everything you get out what you put in.Why I went into consulting
- I was working hard as ever, it’s my nature and I love what I do.
- My pay was average
- My projects looked amazing but in reality sucked and were driven by people in ivory towersMy concerns with consulting
- we had a newborn and worried about health insurance. In the US this is highly coupled with your jobThe outcome
- I am still busy as ever and love it.
- I am a seasoned 14 year dev with a lot to offer.
- health insurance because of Obama care is amazing. We pay about $150 more per month but it’s actually better health insurance.
- here is the kicker, last month I made 50k profit. Consulting is extremely lucrative and makes me feel like I was wasting my time as an employee before.Will I go back to working for someone? Oh yeah in a heartbeat. But I must be valued according and can enrich the company as I do now with consulting for my clients.What’s sucks about consulting
- billing / payroll for other devs that help me as 1099 when needed.Take away - consult for the right reasons. You will learn a lot but you can learn a lot as an employee as well. Let it happen naturally. Don’t force yourself to consult. You may be a completely happy employee and don’t let anyone tell you different and anyone worth being a human won’t discriminate against you for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent more than half my career in digital consulting for mid-size (500-5000 people) that did full service product development (strategy, design, tech, marketing). Eventually working my way up to director level that meant doing sales and writing contracts.We did some crazy stuff. Delivered some gigantic ambitious projects with pure chutzpah. Dove into tech we didn&#39;t know anything about. Go sell a project to an airline, read everything about the airline business, then walk in like experts. It felt like fraud at times but we pulled it off so well you just start to feel invincible. It was a meat grinder but also thrilling. The kind of stuff I feel privileged to have been part of but never want to do again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seed creator here. For some context, I now code all my websites in HTML, CSS, and targeted JS (ie no frameworks or dependencies). Writing this was a great way to learn the ins and outs of DOM manipulation!Overall, I&#39;m happy with the way the Seed API turned out, but could never get the performance or package size to a good place.That said, I love coding in Rust, and use it all the time for embedded!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos to the author for making this framework.I am using this for my personal project: https://www.biblemaze.com which is a Bible trivia game.Here are some things I like about Seed:1. The Elm architecture seems to flow nicely in Rust.2. The way of defining the elements on the page is more Rust like rather than html like. I initially tried Yew which is another similar framework, but since I am a more backend developer, I found writing in a more Rust style more comfortable than writing in a more html-like dsl. Other with different experiences may be more comfortable with more html-like syntax.3. Very easy to perform REST API calls. I am using Actix for the backend, and I have a shared library that declares the types which both the backend and frontend use. This is one big advantage for using Rust for both backend and frontend, in that you never have to worry about your types getting out of sync.4. In general as to why Rust for the front end, apart for being able to share types, for more complex algorithms, for me, having a compiled language with an emphasis on safety and that tries to ensure correctness as much as compile time (and especially pattern matching) makes writing complex code more enjoyable for me.5. Excellent documentation on the Seed website. There are lots of examples and walkthroughs of basics as well as examples of how to do stuff like integrate with Javascript libraries.Anyway, thanks again to the authors for making and supporting such an awesome library."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My most sincere thanks to the author(s) for “Why Not” section.   This level of self awareness and transparency makes me so happy; it takes so much guess work and unnecessary back and forth out of the discourse.  Again - kudos!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: I&#39;m a founder of Authzed (YC W21), a productized form of ZanzibarI&#39;d like to reiterate that Policy Engines and Zanzibar-like systems are orthogonal and can be used together very successfully. However, the article claims that ABAC cannot be done with ReBAC systems which is false[0] and it claims that Zanzibar systems do not support the concept of &#34;public&#34;, when the system at Google does[1]. The availability of Zanzibar-like systems outside of Google is still relatively new, so the user experience can be greatly improved. For example, the Authzed Schema Language[2] is a vast improvement over Zanzibar&#39;s raw userset rewrites.That being said, I think the Oso UX is quite nice in comparison to many products in the space, but architects should always spend the time to figure out what&#39;s best for their requirements. If you&#39;re just starting to explore AuthZ, this article is a pretty good primer for the problems in the space and why you&#39;re unlikely to design something great on the first go if you build it yourself. It&#39;s really hard to write about this subject in a digestible fashion, so props to the team!I especially liked the quote &#34;[...] authorization is a topic as cool as moving to Kubernetes!&#34;. Considering almost all of our team is ex-CoreOS and has deep ties to Kubernetes, we truly believe authorization is cool enough to stop working on Kubernetes ;)[0]: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-43936-4_...[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mstZT431AeQ[2]: https://play.authzed.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We have been enjoying Casbin (ABAC):- technically: embedded in your DB, so not another infra problem  + can stay in-DB for hotpath queries (ex: view all). As db-native RLS etc keeps maturing, my bet is this is where a lot will end up anyways. This is orthogonal to their discussion of service vs monolith - it enables working at the data tier vs app tier.- governance: our app does not depend on an outside companyAt the same time, it was surprisingly slim pickings for such a core thing, so more diversity the better!Edit: For context, we have been thinking a lot about authorization recently and investing here, so a recent post on &#39;The Sharing Paradox&#39; on how we view it as an important way to grow successful team use, esp with modern features like friendly ABAC UIs: https://www.graphistry.com/blog/100x-sharing-paradox"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maybe lithium-ion batteries in mass-market vehicles aren&#39;t such a good idea. We may need a battery technology that can survive poor maintenance less than perfect battery construction, and low-cost vehicle designs. Tesla had to put a titanium plate under their battery. That&#39;s not a mass-market solution.BYD is converting over to lithium iron phosphate, which is much better behaved when damaged. Toyota is working on solid state batteries, which hopefully don&#39;t catch fire.The NYFD reports over 55 electric bike and scooter fires so far this year.[1] Two deaths, 60 injuries, including 18 firefighters.  Fires destroying electric bike shops are a thing, with one fire expanding to all the batteries around. All we need now is for a cascade auto battery fire in a parking lot.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The automaker told Bolt owners to limit the charge to 90 percent, plug in more frequently and avoid depleting the battery to below about 70 miles of remaining range.Tesla&#39;s approach here would be to issue an OTA update that told your car to treat 90% as 100% and 25% as 0. I can&#39;t decide if I like that better or worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s insane. For (probably) a majority of owners it makes the car unusable if you adhere to that restriction.If I had one then I would have nowhere to park it. Certainly not at work. And at home with once car in the driveway and another in front of the house they couldn&#39;t be 50 feet apart. In tightly packed houses even one driveway to the next isn&#39;t 50 feet apart.If you went shopping and we&#39;re lucky enough to manage to find a space 50 feet away, there&#39;s no guarantee someone wouldn&#39;t park closer, though I can&#39;t even think of a place I go where finding such a spot in the first place is at all likely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"World&#39;s longest lab experiment still going strong, via webcamIn 1927, a physics professor named Thomas Parnell launched an experiment on viscous liquids. 85 years later, we&#39;re still waiting for his results. It all began with a funnel, a beaker, and some melted tar pitch. Parnell, a professor at the University of Queensland in Australia, was hoping to demonstrate that brittle tar pitch actually behaves as a liquid when kept at room temperature.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m grateful to GitLab for providing an alternative to GitHub, and an open source one. It&#39;s an open core product with the community edition providing a lot of value. Here are some community hosted instances: https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/List_of_Community-Hosted_GitL...The CI system is quite powerful, and Travis CI&#39;s struggles before and after acquisition has shown that it&#39;s hard to host a major CI platform.I hope the company and the open source product will continue to thrive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t personally had a compelling enough reason to move from GitHub to GitLab, so I mostly just use it to mirror a couple of my repos there in case people prefer to browse various open source projects via GitLab. Regardless, I think competition in the space is a great thing.GitLab has come a long way and there are certain things I really like about the company. For example, I love how they tend to do everything &#34;in the open&#34; and have most of their development work and business documents public. It&#39;s a great resource for aspiring entrepreneurs. I have been a bit concerned about some of the architecture of GitLab lately, with quite a few security fixes resulting in unusual edge-case bugs. My only other complaint is that they tend have a very wide but shallow pool of products. They have ambitious goals with their platform, but I hope they are able to build real value and add features to the existing core products.Congrats to everyone on the GitLab team. Keep doing good work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at MailChimp for a few years. I most recently worked at a company that went through an IPO that I had equity in. When deciding to join my recent company, equity was the largest factor in my move.MC’s benefits are great and at the time were top-tier in Atlanta. They are cash/401k heavy and offer great profit sharing incentives. They also make it abundantly clear that they don’t offer equity and when I negotiated my non-MC offer that I ended up accepting, they were clear that they could not match my equity. They even acknowledged that if I was willing to take a risk with the equity it would likely be the advantageous move to make.Nonetheless, during my time at MC Ben/Dan repeatedly boasted about turning down offers to sell and repeated they were never intending to go that (or the publicly traded) route. This ultimately factored into my decision to leave, as it never appeared I would have a personal stake in the company. I hope other employees interpreted this in a similar manner and I do believe everyone had abundant opportunities to do so.In the end and in hindsight, I’m happy with my decision to leave and it did pay out. Nonetheless, I do still believe MC is a great company and despite the founders somewhat selling an incorrect vision, are still acting in good faith. I don’t believe they “withheld equity” as they made it explicitly clear it was never offered, or was ever going to be, but I do see how the boasting of never selling out could be interpreted poorly now in hindsight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly it could be worse, I worked at a company that gave equity and years later it came out that the founders never intended to sell or take VC money.  In that case employees “took below market salaries” thinking the stock is worth something but in reality it’s worthless.  At least in this Mailchimp situation if you’re not getting equity I assume you’re happy with your cash comp, I’d you’re not, that doesn’t make sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maximise the video and watch the left hand HUD pane from 0:10 to 0:11.The dotted black line coming from the front of the car (which I am assuming is the intended route) quickly snaps from straight ahead, to a hair pin right, to a normal right turn.Ignoring the fact that the right turn happened to be into a pedestrian crossing with people on it - what was the car even trying to do? The sat-nav shows it should have just continued forwards.I am astounded that software capable of these outputs is allowed on the roads. When could crossing a junction then taking a hairpin right back across it, ever be the correct thing to do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, the original creator of the video has since made it private. FSD beta testers are carefully handpicked — a lot of the Tesla “influencers” are given access for some free marketing. I wonder how many FSD bad driving videos are not uploaded to YouTube at all because they don’t want to say anything negative about Tesla and possibly lose influence/ad revenue.This is on top of Tesla classifying FSD as level 2 system (while promoting as “level 5 soon”) so they don’t have to share data with CA DMV. Only reason not to be transparent like the others is if you’re not confident in your system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is near the infamous monorail where previous versions of FSD would kamikaze into the giant concrete pillars. Presumably in response to the monorail failure Tesla updated their obstacle avoidance to handle unclassified objects.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1437322712339423237?s=21From the nav you can see the car is trying to go straight but swerves around some invisible obstacle. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a failure in their new “voxel based” collision avoidance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let me share a small fun story (of making an application in an hour, not months).At one large insurance company in my role as an architect I have tried to convince people we need Elasticsearch to speed up free-form queries to our database containing information about hundreds of millions of people and their contracts. That database was Oracle and so not really amenable to completely arbitrary queries.I was immediately shot down that the project will take huge amount of time and effort to complete and so is completely off the table.So I came up with fun plan. I set up an hour-long meeting which was supposed to be my last chance to pitch the project.Rather than present slides and extol virtues of Elasticsearch, I decided to WRITE THE APPLICATION DURING THE MEETING, FROM SCRATCH.And that&#39;s what I did. I came to the meeting, set my laptop, connected projector, put some music on, and I wrote the entire service from scratch and had time to spare to present how it works.I cheated a little bit, of course. That 1h meeting was well rehearsed. I spent entire week preparing, finding better ways to do stuff and retrying entire process dozens of times.I used JHipster to generate 90% of the service and the rest was just tiny bit of well thought glue code.Unfortunately, this did not sit well with couple of people whom I made complete mockery of. I had to leave soon after."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s an excellent talk by Rich Hickey (I believe it&#39;s this one[1]) where he points out an obsession with how quick something is to understand immediately and be productive in—he gives the example of building websites in a single day, and contrasts it to musicians learning and mastering instruments over much longer periods of time.While it&#39;s very intuitive to see the appeal in low barrier to entry, there&#39;s something to be said about tools that optimize for the long-term. Instruments aren&#39;t made for beginners, they&#39;re made for people who know how to play them.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCZ3YgeEUPg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a UI prototyping tool, and a potentially good one at that. It does not develop what a HN audience would call production ready applications. That being said, &#34;Production Ready&#34; as used by this author is very different than what &#34;production ready&#34; as used by the HN audience means, a look at the end of the linked video where he claims a checklist with drag and drop support and cookie-derived sessions next to is &#34;Production Ready&#34; should sufficiently demonstrate that.And that&#39;s okay! It doesn&#39;t need to have replaced the entire Web Developer career field, it can just be a cool UI prototyping tool. But I might suggest to the author to reduce the scope of their claims a touch, as it would engender more positive discussion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t understand this social platforms.Covid stuff and fake news aside, I reported maybe 20 times obvious scam videos, or posts with extreme hatred and threats of violence against a group of people and similar stuff where 99.99999% of us would agree that it should be removed without question, and only once they did remove it. All the other times I get a message that they reviewed my complaint, that it does not go against their standards/tos/bla bla, and that I can block the video/post/channel for myself.And taking into account how many random stuff they ban proactively, it just does not compute in my logic board in the brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author conflates two things. The right to biohack at home and Youtube&#39;s alleged obligation to let him broadcast his material.The first one is okay, as long as we&#39;re not talking about experiments that may be dangerous to the public. (which he seems to categorically reject for some reason, while home made bioterrorism is a real threat), the second one just doesn&#39;t follow at all.Youtube has no realistic way to tell whether someone producing home-made science on youtube is a phd ex-nasa biohacker who follows best practices or just a complete quack who tries to sell dangerous fake remedies to vulnerable people. In practice the incentive to promote the latter probably far outweighs the former in number given the huge, generic audience on Youtube.77% of the Youtube audience in the US are 17-25 years old, it&#39;s not some niche forum for engineers and the notion that they can read scientific papers and weed out legitimate science created at home from misinformation is absurd. The correct platform for something like this is a separate forum or community where enthusiasts meet with some barrier to entry, not the mass media.I immediately question the motive of someone who promotes individual science or &#39;hacking&#39; and seeks the largest mass media audience. I think the motive is much more straight forward. The author has a company that sells genetic engineering kits to people and by banning him from Youtube that impacts him financially. I personally think Biohacking and eccentric science is cool, but the appropriate audience for the kind of things he did, like treat himself with CRISPR or replace his entire microbiome to treat IBS is probably a community more self-selected than HN, not Youtube, which is mainstream television for young adults."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Democratizing genetic engineering won’t suddenly unleash bioterrorism upon the world.&#34;How sure is he of that, and why? As a comparison, nuclear power has been of great utility for many countries, but I sure would not want to see it &#34;democratized&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"i live in the american south, where everybody owns guns. i own a gun for hunting. but for self defense, i have pepper spray and bear spray instead of guns because i don&#39;t want to kill somebody regardless of their intentions. i&#39;d be curious to see the stats of self-defense/firearms, because it seems like self-defense gun owners are LARPing over imagined intruder situations. they&#39;re definitely not about to take up arms against the state, and if they think they would do that, then they&#39;re certainly LARPing and live in a fantasy world.exceptions to this rule, especially in the american south, are civil rights leaders and similar political activists. Martin Luther King preached non-violent protest but owned guns for protecting his home against the very real threat of violent racists. (there&#39;s some interesting writing about this if you look it up. google something like &#34;martin luther king guns malcolm x&#34;)the bigger risk is accidentally killing somebody with a gun, like an &#34;intruder&#34; that is actually somebody you know. or a kid accidentally firing the gun and killing themselves or somebody else, or somebody intentionally killing themselves.edit: added &#34;but&#34; in front of dependent clause &#34;for self defense&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent.  There&#39;s no reason defensive gun buyers should be demographically different from the general population.  It&#39;s understandable that gun sales for hunting or other activities might show differences, but we all have the same personal security needs.Side note: I&#39;m one of the people here with a large collection of firearms.  One thing to realize when you see the statistic that the US has more firearms than people is that only a percentage of them are really combat worthy/capable.  Most of my collection, for example, are collectable historic pieces, or dedicated target/sporting firearms.  Some of these could feasibly be pressed into service if you had absolutely nothing else, but they would be extremely sub-optimal for the task."</p>

In your search engine, I got wikipedia, followed by academic talks, chapters of books, and long-form blogs.  All extremely useful resources.When I search on google, I get wikipedia, followed by a listicle &#34;8 Reasons Why Rome Fell&#34;, then the imdb page for a movie by the same name, and then two Amazon book links, which are totally useless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah so this is my project. It&#39;s very much a work in progress, but occasionally I think it works remarkably well for something I cobbled together alone out of consumer hardware and home-made code :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried a few searches.&lt;&lt;javascript pipe syntax&gt;&gt;: none of the search results appeared to have anything to do with Javascript pipe syntax. (Which doesn&#39;t exist yet, but it&#39;s under discussion.) Google gives a bunch of highly-relevant results.&lt;&lt;hans reichenbach relativity&gt;&gt;: first result is a list of books about relativity, one of which is Reichenbach&#39;s &#34;Philosophy of space and time&#34;; good, but there&#39;s no real information there. Second is about Reichenbach but nothing to do with relativity or even, really, philosophy of science. Third is about philosophy of science and mentions some of Reichenbach&#39;s work but not related to relativity. Fourth mentions Reichenbach&#39;s &#34;Philosophy of space and time&#34;  as part of a list of books relevant to a seminar on &#34;time and eternity&#34;. None of this is bad, but it&#39;s not great either. Google gives a couple of online philosophy encyclopaedia entries, then a journal article on &#34;Hans Reichenbach&#39;s relativity of geometry&#34;, then the Wikipedia article on Reichenbach ... much more informative.&lt;&lt;luna lovegood actress&gt;&gt;: I thought this would be an easy one. It was easy for Google, which gave me her name in large friendly letters at the top, then her IMDB entry, and a bunch of other relevant things. Literally nothing in the Marginalia results was relevant to the query.I guess maybe popular culture is just too monetizable, so no one is going to write about it on the sites that Marginalia crawls? Let&#39;s try some slightly less popular culture.&lt;&lt;wilde &#34;a handbag&#34;&gt;&gt;: First result is kinda-relevant but weird: it&#39;s about a musical adaptation of The Importance of Being Earnest. It doesn&#39;t mention that famous line from the play, but one of the numbers in the musical has the words &#34;a handbag&#34; in the title. Second result is a review of a CD of musicals, including the same work. Third is a bunch of short reviews of theatrical items from the Buxton Festival Fringe, one of which is a three-man adaptation of TIOBE. Next four are 100% irrelevant. Next is a list of names of plays. Last one is actually relevant; it&#39;s an article about &#34;Lady Bracknell through the decades&#34;. Google puts that one first (after, sigh, a bunch of YouTube videos which look as if they might actually be relevant).I really like the idea of this, and many of the things it turns up look like they might be interesting, but it isn&#39;t doing very well at producing results that are actually relevant to the thing being searched for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"RIP Sir.I was gifted the 48K when I was 6 yrs old - it changed my life. I am here because Sir Sinclair built a machine whose setup instructions said:Now that you have set up the computer, you will want to use it. The rest of this
booklet tells you how to do that; but in your impatience you will probably already
have started pressing the keys on the keyboard, and discovered that this removes
the copyright message. This is good; _you cannot harm the computer in this way._
Be bold. Experiment. If you get stuck, remember that you can always reset the
computer to the original picture with the copyright message by taking out the &#39;9V
DC IN&#39; plug and putting it back again. This should be the last resort because you
lose all the information in the computer.&#34;You cannot harm the computer in this way.&#34;That single sentence started a life long journey. I doubt I would have been bold enough at that age to mess around with one of our most valuable possessions."</p>

It focuses on the rivalry between Sir Clive Sinclair (played by Alexander Armstrong), who developed the ZX Spectrum, and Chris Curry (played by Martin Freeman), the man behind the BBC Micro.(Sinclair didn&#39;t exactly like it though.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at a company that had unlimted PTO when suddenly one day they revoked the policy because they said some people were abusing it. The new policy was still very generous (6 weeks PTO per year) so no one complained. Fast forward a year later and we were hearing things from executives and managers like, &#34;you know you don&#39;t have to use all you&#39;re PTO, right?&#34;. I&#39;d ask, oh, it will rollover to next year? The reply: &#34;No, it won&#39;t. But that&#39;s really the wrong way to think about it.&#34;So it turns out people were taking much more time off now than when PTO was unlimited. They started denying request and making up trivial rules, like 2/3 of your team must be available at any time (regardless of the team size), oh, and those rules weren&#39;t in the official policy. Good luck trying to get specifics in writing.Eventually they changed back to an unlimited policy but secretly told managers they should start denying requests after x number of days have been used. I think it was five weeks, which again is still generous but it bothers me because the intent is to hide that number in hopes that people will use less. I also get no tracking for how many days I&#39;ve already taken unless I go through my requests and count the approved ones myself.The unlimited policy is definitely a scam at many companies. Most of my team has been denied requests for reasons that don&#39;t exist in the written policy, like, &#34;you recently had PTO already.&#34; Honestly I&#39;d rather have a policy that only allowed 3 or 4 weeks with a minimum mandatory that each employee is required to take at least two weeks off per year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll accept that what the author posted is the truth. Atlassian did not give him what he wanted or needed. And now this battle is public, he will never get anything else from them.  The proverbial glove has been thrown down and they will fight you on all fronts.To everyone else, If this happens to you, I implore you to get legal counsel ASAP, and keep it quiet.  Find out all your options and strike a quiet deal with your employer. That is the best you&#39;ll ever get.Almost any large company has much deeper pockets than you do and their reputation is more valuable that their ethics.  You&#39;ll rarely win in the court of public opinion and you&#39;ll probably never get hired anywhere again.  I say this even if you were 100% in the right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recent ex-Atlassian employee here. No part of this article matches with my experience. It&#39;s one of the better companies I&#39;ve worked for. I usually took 3-4 weeks of PTO a year, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. We didn&#39;t even have to register our time off in a payroll system or anything like that. Yeah you couldn&#39;t take 6 months off and expect to keep your job, but I felt like 3-5 weeks of PTO was the norm there. I also had female managers who took 3-4 months of maternity leave. It wasn&#39;t a big deal. This article complains about being at a job for 2 years without a promotion. That&#39;s the mark of an entitled person. P4 is still a great position with solid pay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m longing for the return of the mailing lists.Sure, the format is slow and somewhat complex, but then it seems like all the places are devoid of non-immediate conversations.Companies are moving to the Slack, informal groups to the Discord. I&#39;ve been using IRC for years and I still love it but with recent adoption of Slack it seems everyone wants to push all the communication there and I don&#39;t think it works. It&#39;s hard to search for stuff (usually it takes me 3-4 queries to find thing _I know_ is there) and then it&#39;s in lengthy conversational format that takes a bit of time to replay. You might lose window of opportunity to provide important info just because you aren&#39;t present at the moment and since Slack is perceived as a low impact tool, those conversations can happen in late evening hours.And yet all the places that (in my opinion) were better to have more fruitful, thoughtful and searchable conversations are slowly winding down. Newsgroup are long dead, mailing lists are perceived as archaic, forums are closing down one by one. It might be me, but I start to get feeling that even on StackOverflow conversations aren&#39;t what they used to be. Only e-mail is left - in some places at least, because some organization start to have &#34;why send an e-mail while you could send Slack message&#34;. Thankfully those organization usually bless users with capability of installing Slack on their private phones /sToo bad Google Wave didn&#39;t pick up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate that everyone is using Discord not just because of searchability but also because it&#39;s difficult to have multiple identities with Discord. It&#39;s frustrating to be looking for help with using some library and seeing in the readme a link to join their Discord server. I don&#39;t want to join those with the same identity I use in gaming Discord servers so I usually just give up at that point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s just me (30-something year old male, big into gaming), but I love when I see forums on Discord. I think it&#39;s way better to use a system I am already signed up for. I don&#39;t want to sign up again for a million different forums like the old days. I also love the new threads feature by Discord to keep convos more concise and isolated. That has helped forums on Discord a ton. It&#39;s also nice that I can join a server, get my answer, then leave that server with no lingering email sign up for some one-off forum that I&#39;ll never visit again, and then I get bombed with emails after I&#39;m done. And when I leave, it&#39;s worth noting my comments/questions are still on the server for those to find via search if they join after I&#39;m gone [1].I know a lot of people in the comments seem to hate Discord for this, but I personally love it. I guess I&#39;m just saying this as a reminder that there are always others that do enjoy the other side. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯[1] It&#39;s worth noting that I guess this is a Discord server specific setting, so that could vary I suppose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;If high prices held you back from building, you are in luck, as the tables have now turned&#34;Except... many builders will find some other reason/excuse where prices are high to keep prices high.  We were looking at building a house - talked to builder last November and... looking at $470-$480k range (ballpark estimate).  Lumber was going higher, but we&#39;d reduced the house plan size.  Lumber kept going up... and up... Then... no parts were available (IIRC certain trusses were unavailable for months, that&#39;s just one that stuck out).We regrouped a bit later.  House was now going to be min $620k, but... no guarantee it would be $650k or $700k.  Builder has been working on spec homes in the $700k-$900k range last few months, whereas exact same size houses 1 block away they were building and selling in the mid-$400s 14 months ago.Before we cancelled the project, we asked why we couldn&#39;t build something smaller and target a time in a few months, as lumber was coming way down to where it was 18 months ago.  &#34;Everything else has skyrocketed...&#34;  which... I know things have gone up some in the last 18 months, but I think there&#39;s simply some &#34;get high prices while you can&#34;.When talking to some home finance folks, they&#39;re all saying &#34;watch out for HELOCs in 18-24 months - people will be clamoring for HELOCs as they won&#39;t be able to sell these $700k houses they&#39;re buying, because they won&#39;t have appreciated at all, and the homeowners will be trapped&#34;.There may be &#39;blowout&#39; prices on lumber itself, but around here I&#39;m not seeing any &#39;blowout&#39; prices on new construction in the short term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been following these prices closely for most of the year and what’s striking to me is just how wrong nearly all the industry experts were throughout the year. I don’t recall reading a single opinion that was anything other than “prices will remain very high for the foreseeable future.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think prices are &#34;cratering&#34; so much as just returning to normal rather than price gouging.Now if I could just buy a GPU for a normal price..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The UniFi Protect integration is awesome. Turn on outdoor lights on motion, disable loud doorbell ding when the dog is sleeping, change privacy zones, send critical notifications to bypass silent mode on iOS devices when a person is detected while away… really amazing stuff.The HomeKit Controller integration is also neat. All kinds of HomeKit compatible devices can just work with Home Assistant. Honeywell Lyric is the best example: PIR sensors with local push for lighting automation or special alerts when gates open to prevent the dog from escaping the backyard.Edit: More useful things!I have my washer and dryer in a garage. Can’t hear the machines inside. The Z-Wave light switches around my house have status LEDs, so one LED is dedicated to the washer and dryer status based on power draw from the outlet. Works really well. The same status LEDs are shared for all light switches around the house, so
it’s a good ambient notification.The Mac app can provide webcam or mic status as a sensor, which turns on a key light when I join video calls and turns on an LED on the light switch outside my office to signal when I’m on a call.I also get a push notification on my computer and a LED light on the light switches when the Roomba is full. It fills up a few times during its typical run while I’m working.I also have the door status (open/closed/locked) from the Lyric as LEDs on the light switches. Very easy to tell if something is unlocked or open at a glance while walking around the house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see HA getting some love on HN. A colleague recommended it to me about 3 years ago as an alternative to Domoticz. I&#39;ve migrated back than and haven&#39;t looked back since. I consider myself a real Home Assistant enthousiast. I&#39;ve contributed some small amounts to the project, created and maintain my own add-ons and love to share my configuration with others.Although most of the things currently just work, especially with the (migrated) UI integrations. Some things still feel very unfinished, like blueprints. Which was a terrific idea, but maintaining and keeping those up to date is an absolute nightmare and you will have to that yourself [1]. Same with battery powered devices. When they work, it&#39;s all great, but having to watch their battery level is just a hassle. You can create your own automation to do that for you, but it seems unnecessary.For me the community also sometimes feels very hostile. For instance, you can have a Portainer add-on, but installing other Docker images makes your system &#39;unsupported&#39;. Same with some blacklisted images [2], which break Home Assistant Supervisor. Or when the maintainer of one of the add-ons completely ignores a breaking issue after a day [3].1. https://community.home-assistant.io/t/reload-automations-aut...2. https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor/blob/main/super...3. https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adguard-home/issues/1..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember that story about Zachary McCoy.
This whole thing continues to get worse quick and will continue to get worse. I know people say we need legislation and regulation on data privacy and tech companies which we do. But before that gets taken seriously (at least in the US) it&#39;s going to take something real scandalous done by tech companies and actually affect the common folk where they actually start to care.Right now the average user does not care at all about security and privacy except the small niche groups of us on HN, Reddit and other tech/Geek forums. The regular average user will continue to still use Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple etc. As long as the average user keeps using their services and vote with their data and wallets I doubt much will change anytime soon.Until we get some real data privacy laws and regulation we just have to matters into our own hands. I don&#39;t use Google search unless I need to, and always have my VPN on (Mullvad).Edit: Then again, once we did get data privacy laws and regulation could we actually trust the companies and politicians and LE. Probably not. That&#39;s why I also feel the laws and regulation needed for tech is more of like a &#34;The public thinks we did something&#34; type of situation. There will still and always will be under the table deals.If the regular user can realize eventually how they feed these companies with their data and what happens with their data it could also hinder or start to hinder data collection at the government level (NSA, GCHQ, Project Raven and so on)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"mullvad has a long history of proving itself as being a good faith actor in the space. it&#39;s also first to step into new technology and infrastructure because they are truly interested and ideologically invested in what they are doing.they don&#39;t use accounts or collect email addresses.they accept cash in the mailno matter what you think about crypto they were probably one of if not the first companies in the world to start accepting bitcoin in 2010 and have always self hosted their infrastructure, not offloading it to bitpay or whatever other company that just funnels right into chain analysis companies. back then bitcoin was on the super fringe and the only people interested and involved in it where people that were ideologically aligned with it&#39;s vision.They started funding wireguard before it was cool and before anyone else gave a shit about wireguard.They are the backbone for mozilla&#39;s vpn.You can never REALLY be sure, but from what I can tell mullvad is the most honest and sincere vpn company in the space and I wouldn&#39;t even consider going anywhere else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been a Mullvad user for a while now and it’s a really great service. Good speeds, good apps for mobile and desktop, and the flexibility to use wireguard yourself if needed.I stopped using privateinternetaccess when their ownership stuff became really sketchy. I’d highly recommend Mullvad to anyone else looking for a good VPN provider.Side note, Mozilla VPN uses Mullvad’s network under the hood."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Mullvad VPN is here to stay, and we are not interested in ever selling itYeah we don&#39;t want another Kape Technologies acquisition[0]. Kape already own Cyberghost, PrivateInternetAccess and Zenmate. If they bought Mullvad, I would immediately stop using Mullvad since Kape is Israeli and could possibly be tapped by Mossad (I keep an open mind about that however).[0] https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/kape-technol..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was pretty excited when ICANN opened up a bunch of new domain extensions, but it does sometimes feel like &#34;all these extensions are great if you don&#39;t plan on using them&#34;.It was pretty cool that I managed to buy a bunch of domains like &lt;my last name&gt;.&lt;new-tld&gt;, but to be honest I really don&#39;t see myself using my .blackfriday domain for anything.  For that matter, I think that (somewhat ironically) `my-last-name.email` would not be taken very seriously for a primary email address.I use a `.app` domain for my personal email, which has its issues, but if I owned a business, there is no way on earth that I would be using anything but .com."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Windows 11 is half-baked.But it isn&#39;t just half-baked because it was rushed out while ignoring all the feedback (although it absolutely was). It is also half-baked because Microsoft&#39;s management has no particular strategy or plan for what they want Windows to be.So Windows 11 just feels like an &#34;and kitchen sink&#34; where someone picked up an iPad, noted down a bunch of random features without rhyme or reason and then told the people below them to shove them into Windows for some reason.Then you step back and realize that very &#34;101&#34; features on Windows are still incomplete like the migration to Settings, Windows Search being objectively worse than the Power Toys Run (let alone Google Desktop Search RIP or FileLocator Pro), and UI elements that haven&#39;t been updated since Windows 2K.As cliché as this sounds, Microsoft needs someone with a vision for Windows at the helm, someone they trust enough to go hands off and let them materialize that vision. Regardless of what that vision is, at least then Windows would be a something, rather than a whole host of competing ideas and contradictions i.e. a mess.PS - Ironically the &#34;Windows 11 PC Health Check&#34; app symbolizes Windows 11&#39;s problems: Released in a half-complete state, pulled, then re-released as a &#34;Preview&#34; also in a half-complete state. The app to check if you&#39;re ready for Windows 11 is a &#34;preview&#34; less than 30 days before the FULL retail release of Windows 11... It is almost too perfect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to agree, even though I have plenty of pro-Windows comments.To me Windows 11 feels like Vista, and to everyone that got burned with the rewrites on the WinRT side, just using plain Win32/MFC/Forms/WPF feels liberating.Multiple teams are fighting UI politics over WinUI, MAUI on top of WinUI, React Native with WinUI, and classical UWP is not going away (Windows 11 Store is written in it), then ASP.NET team is pushing Blazor everywhere including on Web Widgets.I will just wait for Windows 12, whenever it comes up, the UI war will be settled by then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ive been using win 11 on my laptop for a couple months now.I like the new UI, it feels simpler and less gaudy. The drop down menu expansion thing is fine. I also prefer the redesign of the settings app. I find casting my screen and bluetooth works better. Windows has been missing something decent window snapping features forever and although it&#39;s a bit clunky I appreciate that it&#39;s there.The only thing that has annoys me is the taskbar not disappearing when its supposed to, leading to it covering the bottom of maximized applications. Most of the time its not there but sometimes it&#39;ll just stick after coming up.I didn&#39;t know about the android apps feature but I might give it a shot when I go home. Widgets I just haven&#39;t used at all despite being aware of them.I still have win10 on my desktop. I don&#39;t remember the switch being painful when I went to the rolling release windows insider on my laptop. Frankly win10 is fine too, so unless there&#39;s an android app I want to play around with I wouldn&#39;t bother switching."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very typical of Apple, using opaque approval procedures. They&#39;re acting like bullies because they didn&#39;t get what they wanted and because they have the money/power to do so. Apple wanted to buy FlickType but they didn&#39;t agree on the price or Eleftheriou didn&#39;t want to sell (I doubt it), and so from then onwards started the downhill ride. I fully support Eleftheriou on this just for the principle, but if I were in his place I would have agreed at a very large sum from Apple (even lower from what I had in mind) just so that we could all be happy right now ;-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meh. The problem is FlickType requires network access during use. The App store licensing is ok with keyboards, it&#39;s not ok with keyboards that get network access. This, Apple perceives as a major privacy issue-- one for the possibility of keylogging, but also for the broader possibility of the always-on logging that the weather apps are infamous for.edit:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an incredibly well produced podcast episode on these ex-NSA engineers working for the UAE that came out a couple of years ago. Check out Darknet Diaries Ep47: Project Raven [1].Synopsis is that the UAE hires ex-NSA employees as &#34;penetration testers&#34; and when they enter the country for cybersecurity work, some are pulled aside to be briefed to an opportunity called &#34;Project Raven&#34; to assist Emirati intelligence with targeting, allegedly in the interest of counter-terrorism. The thing is, only Emiratis have &#34;hands on keyboard&#34; while the US engineers sit beside them and guide them, which supposedly dodges any legal concerns. Those who Jack interviewed decided to leave Project Raven when it became clear they were targeting dissidents, human rights activists, and later, Americans. As you might imagine, ex-NSA employees who target US citizens for a foreign government are breaking the law. I do wonder if it&#39;s these ex-Project Raven engineers that have led prosecutors down the road to where we are now.[1] https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/47/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Co-founder here. It feels incredible to be sharing Replay with all of you. It&#39;s been a labor of love the past five years!Replay started off as a simple experiment in what would happen if we added a step back button and rewind button to the Debugger. We quickly realized two things. First, nobody uses breakpoints. Second, being able to share is so much more powerful than being able to rewind.Here’s how Replay works today. Somebody on the team records a bug with the Replay Browser and shares the replay url with the team. From there, developers jump in and add print statements. The logs appear in the Console immediately so you don’t need to refresh and reproduce a thing.Over the past year we’ve talked to hundreds of users, recorded 2.5 million replays, and worked incredibly hard to ensure Replay would be fast, secure, and robust from the get go.Want to check it out? You can download Replay today. Can’t wait to hear what you think!Interested in learning more, here is our announcement blog post https://medium.com/replay-io/launching-replay-the-time-trave..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a JavaScript framework author, and was one of those fortunate to get early access and honestly it is the most useful tool I&#39;ve ever used in the debugging space.Sometimes things are complicated. Often there is a need to do digging to uncover the issue. Being able to move forward and backwards and even jumping between seemingly disjoint parts of the timeline are all at your disposal with Replay.Replay has saved me hours of time. And that isn&#39;t hyperbolee. On a couple occasions due to laziness and familiarity I&#39;d do stuff the traditional way and be stuck still after hours (sometimes days) on the same bug. With Replay I was able to shorten that time to about an hour on even the trickiest of bugs.So stoked to now have Replay available to others to help record reproductions of their bugs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a programmer, I’d prefer a combination of the two:Dr Johnson kicked a large rock and said, as his foot rebounded, “I refute it thus.”.as I think it’s weird that a punctuation mark inside a quote can end the sentence that contains the quote.I’d argue like this: in the above case there are two sentences, the quote and the sentence that contains the quote. Both need to be terminated with a period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses, much to the dismay of American editors. Thus, if “Jim is going” is a phrase, and so are “Bill runs” and “Spock groks”, then hackers generally prefer to write: “Jim is going”, “Bill runs”, and “Spock groks”. This is incorrect according to standard American usage (which would put the continuation commas and the final period inside the string quotes); however, it is counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings with characters that don&#39;t belong in them. Given the sorts of examples that can come up in discussions of programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading. When communicating command lines or small pieces of code, extra characters can be a real pain in the neck.— http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/writing-style.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got in a heated debate about this with a technical writing instructor. Namely, I was ending a question with a quote along the lines of&gt; Why did Jake believe the AI was “going to kill us all”?The instructor wanted me to put the question mark of the outer sentence within the quotation marks despite the quoted text not containing a question mark.&gt; Why did Jake believe the AI was “going to kill us all?”I felt like doing so changed the meaning of the quote, and it felt like a misrepresentation. This being the “correct” way to do it has always irritated me.I ended up rewording the sentence so it wouldn’t end with the quotation, and have just actively avoided ending sentences in quotes ever since."</p>

It reads like it was written by a bot not a human.In the sentence &#34;With the theory physicists Gregory Breit and John Wheeler were able to prove that when two high-energy photons collide, a positron and an electron arise, i.e. matter is formed&#34; shouldn&#39;t the word be &#34;predict&#34; not &#34;prove&#34;?A more flagrant example of a strange word choice for a human science writer to make is &#34;A direct conversion would require a laser that emits gamma-ray photons in a highly concentrated steel.&#34; Shouldn&#39;t the word &#34;steel&#34; instead be &#34;beam&#34;?  This seems like the sort of thing an uncomprehending bot might do, conflate those two words.Are my the nits I&#39;ve picked, above, unfounded? Does the author of the original paper have any information which might suggest that an actual human wrote the &#34;Science News&#34; piece?If not I would suggest that we&#39;ve got a bot on the loose!  Eeek!Further, I think I&#39;m seeing rather a lot of &#34;content&#34; floating around recently which smacks of machine origins.Also, to Daniel... Great paper.  Amazing stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was surprised because I thought the Breit-Wheeler Effect has been demonstrated already. It just looks like what they mean here is single photon (or really, two photon), not the so-called strong field Breit-Wheeler that was demonstrated at SLAC and with powerful lasers for decades now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had this mental question about &#39;what time is it when photons collide&#39;.  Given that a photon could have been travelling for a million years colliding with one that has only been travelling for a microsecond, and from the photon perspective there is no passage of time and no distance.I then kept reading things that tell me photons don&#39;t interact, which saddened me because I like the question.  This now appears to not be the case, is there a specific condition under which photons can interact like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitLab team member here. I&#39;d like to add some additional context to my previous comments [1][2].Due to a security concern in which a profile containing a file extension would not load [3], we do not allow usernames that end with file extensions (ex: .mov). As noted by many folks here, these are associated with a MIME type but are not MIME types themselves. It is not related to preventing an injection or any such attack vector.The error message for this check incorrectly included MIME type rather than file extension. This has been updated [4].Additionally, there was an issue with how the actual check as it did not include the leading dot. The leading dot was added to the check in a subsequent MR [5].Thanks for all the feedback.1 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=285357392 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=285381663 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/262954 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/70374/...5 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/65954"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One more quick tip: unlike box-shadow, the filter property is hardware-accelerated in Chrome, and possibly other browsers.In Firefox, everything is hardware-accelerated. And the `will-change` property is largely obsolete. (I personally wish they had stuck to the old translateZ(0) hack which was obviously a hack rather than defining will-change, since WebRender—what lets Firefox do all the rendering on the GPU—was already well underway and had demonstrated that something like will-change wasn’t necessary, though it was still a few more years before it was stabilised in Firefox.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is way beyond what I expected. Josh consistently illustrates and explains these concepts extremely well. I really enjoy it.I hadn’t considered the idea of colour matching to simulate raytracing. It looks great, but I’m not sure when I’d have a product to work on which would be complimented by this treatment. Maybe I work on boring stuff. Perhaps if it was done with enough subtlety I could get away with it.I also wonder if it could become troublesome if you had nested ColourWrapper components. I suppose the most recent wrapper would take precedence, or it could be designed as such. Maybe I’ll give it a shot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking not to this study in particular necessarily, I strongly agree with the general point. Science has really been held back by an over-focusing on &#34;significance&#34;. But I&#39;m not really interested in a pile of hundreds of thousands of studies that establish a tiny effect with suspiciously-just-barely-significant results. I&#39;m interested in studies that reveal robust results that are reliable enough to be built on to produce other results. Results of 3% variations with p=0.046 aren&#39;t. They&#39;re dead ends, because you can&#39;t put very many of those into the foundations of future papers before the probability of one of your foundations being incorrect is too large.To the extent that those are hard to come by... Yeah! They are! Science is hard. Nobody promised this would be easy. Science shouldn&#39;t be something where labs are cranking out easy 3%/p=0.046 papers all the time just to keep funding. It&#39;s just a waste of money and time of our smartest people. It should be harder than it is now.Too many proposals are obviously only going to be capable of turning up that result (insufficient statistical power is often obvious right in the proposal, if you take the time to work the math). I&#39;d rather see more wood behind fewer arrows, and see fewer proposals chasing much more statistical power, than the chaff of garbage we get now.If I were King of Science, or at least, editor of a prestigious journal, I&#39;d want to put word out that I&#39;m looking for papers with at least one of some sort of significant effect, or a p value of something like p = 0.0001. Yeah. That&#39;s a high bar. I know. That&#39;s the point.&#34;But jerf, isn&#39;t it still valuable to map out all the little things like that?&#34; No, it really isn&#39;t. We already have every reason in the world to believe the world is drenched in 1%/p=0.05 effects. &#34;Everything&#39;s correlated to everything&#34;, so that&#39;s not some sort of amazing find, it&#39;s the totally expected output of living in our reality. Really, this sort of stuff is still just below the noise floor. Plus, the idea that we can remove such small, noisy confounding factors is just silly. We need to look for the things that stand out from that noise floor, not spending billions of dollars doing the equivalent of listening to our spirit guides communicate to us over white noise from the radio."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article:Ernest Rutherford is famously quoted proclaiming “If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.”“Of course, there is an existential problem arguing for large effect sizes. If most effect sizes are small or zero, then most interventions are useless. And this forces us scientists to confront our cosmic impotence, which remains a humbling and frustrating experience.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the weird thing is that a bunch of people in tech understand this well _with respect to tech_, but often fall into the same p-value trap when reading about science.If you&#39;re working with very large datasets generated from e.g. a huge number of interactions between users and your system, whether as a correlation after the fact, or as an A/B experiment, getting a statistically significant result is easy. Getting a meaningful improvement is rarer, and gets harder after a system has received a fair amount of work.But then people who work in these big-data contexts can read about a result outside their field (e.g. nutrition, psychology, whatever), where n=200 undergrads or something, and p=0.03 (yay!) and there&#39;s some pretty modest effect, and be taken in by whatever claim is being made."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The FTC has been asleep at the wheel with tech companies in the 21st century and consumers have suffered as a result. Apple&#39;s locking consumers into their platform, Google&#39;s steering traffic towards its sites, Amazon&#39;s forcing its merchants to give them preferential treatment. These companies have too much power and we need a government who&#39;s willing to take bold steps to curb them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Schiller comes across as needy and with a very low confidence in their own product. Some other company shows that their product works equally well on both Android and iPhone, and his response is that it&#39;s not fun to watch?Also, this should be shown to everyone that says they prefer the Apple ecosystem because &#34;it just works&#34;. You really can&#39;t get more user hostile than this, where you care more about extracting money from transactions that you&#39;re not a part of than making life easier for your paying customers.Apple let Amazon sell books using their own payment system because Amazon sold a lot of books on their own Kindle platform that Apple wanted users to be able to read on iPhones, but as soon as Apple&#39;s platform was the biggest one they altered the deal to squeeze more money out of it. Like a monopoly would do."</p>

Still not a huge fan, but you can still see the tendrils of his influence that still affect today&#39;s world (adobe flash EOL last year, this stuff by not allowing you to buy books on the kindle/amazon app on iphone, continuing to control hardware and software experience). And you can see how it&#39;s gone (4 different ipads, etc)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://archive.is/egPlc“The research that we’ve seen is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a congressional hearing...“We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,” said one slide from 2019, summarizing research about teen girls who experience the issues.
“Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” said another slide. “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.”From what researchers said in a March 2020 slide presentation posted to Facebook’s internal message board."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it Facebook / Instagram&#39;s fault or us as a culture? As a culture we adore beauty, wealth, power...Facebook seems to be just a platform where our natural desires can have a play. Facebook hasn&#39;t created this impossible beauty ideal, it was created long long ago by Hollywood and the fashion industry. Facebook just makes it super easy for people to become obsessed with something by &#34;connecting&#34; with it. 
It used to be that 40 years ago you watched some supermodel in a commercial for 20 seconds and she was gone. The novelty with the internet is that now you can follow this supermodel and get dozens of alerts a week about her.
If it&#39;s not Facebook it&#39;s gonna be TikTok or something other platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t blame Facebook (or Twitter, or any particular company) for this.We can only blame scale. Some things are much more scalable than others, and &#34;beauty&#34; scales. And the &#34;occurrence of beauty&#34; does, too.Before the advent of scale on almost every aspect of our lives, a local musician or theatre group found easy income.Now, since after the invention of gramophones, more people can listen to less and less musicians, i.e. numerically.One movie is seen across the world and then millions of times on streaming services, while your local theatre group starves.Just like that, before, some people were considered more beautiful than others as it is done now. But one beautiful girl could only make, say, 20 girls jealous and anxious.Now, with the advent of Instagram, and internet-driven scale in general, one beautiful girl makes 20,000 girls jealous. So the anxiety and jealousy is numeracally widespread. This is where beauty scales.Also, before, one average looking girl felt threatened by the beauty of one beautiful girl in her area. Now, there is the &#34;feed&#34;, where she sees hundred girls more beautiful than her. This would not have been statistically possible in earlier times. This is where &#34;occurrence of beauty&#34; scales. Where, hundred years ago, a girl would see maybe 3-4 girls better looking than her, now she sees 300.____- I don&#39;t believe in a set standard of beauty. I don&#39;t believe that beauty is objective either. In this comment, I use &#34;beauty&#34;, &#34;beautiful&#34;, etc. as a short and logistically convenient way to represent &#34;perceived beauty&#34;, &#34;seemingly beautiful&#34;, etc. I hope this won&#39;t be an issue.- I am also aware of other sources of anxiety, one simply being money- money buys new clothes more frequently, and people in new clothes and/or makeup look more pretty. Cosmetic surgery is in similar line. Here what scales is display of wealth.- Filters, editing, etc. also might play a big part. People know this. Hence the popularity of the &#34;Instagram vs. Real Life&#34; meme format."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So here&#39;s a potential business model for this: salvage rights.When ships sink, the owner generally still retains ownership of any property. Sometimes the location of the wreck is known. Sometimes it needs to be found. It can cost a lot of money to find a wreck and recover any property.So salvage rights are a principle of maritime law such that whoever does this is entitled to a reward commensurate with the value of the goods recovered (eg 10%).I imagine there are orbital slots that are essentially unusable because of space debris (eg Project West Ford [1]). If orbital slots are sufficiently scarce then these could have value. At some point it may become commercial to spend the effort cleaning up an orbit and making it available. Companies could then be compensated for the value they create this way.I do believe this will still require a dramatic decrease in launch costs, as in orders of magnitude more. But we&#39;ll see.My personal belief (and hope) is that the future of getting into orbit is orbital rings [2]. If so, that completely changes the game because cleaning up an orbit essentially becomes a problem of just holding up a giant &#34;paddle&#34; (for lack of a better word) that is fixed to a point on Earth (essentially) and just letting the debris hit it.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_West_Ford[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very skeptical of the technical challenges associated with this problem (business model and financing aside). The amount of delta-v required to perform maneuvers to repeatedly &#34;dock&#34; with different pieces of space junk, and then again to de-orbit is very high. You MIGHT be able to de-orbit on the order of magnitude of ~10 pieces of low-earth orbit debris per mission. Maybe. If you&#39;re really good. And low-earth orbit junk isn&#39;t the major issue since it will de-orbit naturally in a reasonable time-frame. Higher orbit junk is what really matters, and will require much more delta-v to reach, and then again to de-orbit after &#34;docking&#34;.Allow me to blindly speculate here: a space-junk company is going to take one of the two following paths:1) Perform low-earth orbit missions to de-orbit a few pieces here and then there, use the good PR to drive funding (let&#39;s just assume they can make the finances work via getting governments to pay for it or something). It will technically work, but it will only deorbit pieces that would naturally decay anyways at a meaninglessly low-volume. But the PR will be good and regulatory capture will ensure their investors get paid. The real problem will remain.2) Go after the really big pieces in higher orbits. These pieces tend to be well-tracked and aren&#39;t really a large problem, but all the same outcomes in option 1 will occur. Investors will get paid, and of course, the real problem won&#39;t be solved.Maybe I&#39;m being pessimistic, but I see space-junk removal companies largely relying on the general public&#39;s lack of knowledge on how orbits work to drive PR. Maybe Kerbal Space Program 2 will go viral enough to fix that problem? We can only hope"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Stripe cofounder.)Ugh, apologies. Something very clearly went wrong here and we’re already investigating.Zooming out, a few broader comments:* Unlike most services, Stripe can easily lose very large amounts of money on individual accounts, and thousands of people try to do so every day. We are de facto running a big bug bounty/incentive program for evading our fraudulent user detection systems.* Errors like these happen, which we hate, and we take every single false rejection that we discover seriously, knowing that there’s another founder at the other end of the line. We try to make it easy to get in touch with the humans at Stripe, me included, to maximize the number that we discover and the speed with which we get to remedy them.* When these mistaken rejections happen, it’s usually because the business (inadvertently) clusters strongly with behavior that fraudulent users tend to engage in. Seeking to cloak spending and using virtual cards to mask activity is a common fraudulent pattern. Of course, there are very legitimate reasons to want to do this too (as this case demonstrates).* We actually have an ongoing project to reduce the occurrence of these mistaken rejections by 90% by the end of this year. I think we’ll succeed at it. (They’re already down 50% since earlier this year.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Edwin from Stripe here. (OP, I&#39;ve just sent you an email and we can talk more over there—I&#39;m terribly sorry for the trouble.) I can&#39;t get into too many specifics about an individual business publicly, but unauthorized charges have high potential to be disputed in the near future—and while Stripe itself doesn&#39;t have a dispute threshold, the card networks require businesses to keep disputes low.Although that email in the post was admittedly a template, a human did review the transaction activity and actively sent the email. We&#39;re digging more into exactly what happened here to prevent the confusion from happening again. Over the past few weeks, we&#39;ve been overhauling how we work with businesses in situations like these and are rolling out some meaningful improvements soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through the same thing.
Some ML algorithm at Stripe randomly classified my business (bog standard WooCommerce/WordPress e-Commerce store selling a single product in low volumes) as a risk and I found that the process for escalating it was Kafkaesque and slow.Switched to Pin Payments[1] shortly after that experience and have never looked back.  Of course, we live in the 2021 century and algorithms will flag issues automatically (I ported my phone number and changed my bank account on the same day, which was fun!), but they&#39;ve always made sure to contact me and resolve the issue within minutes instead of cutting access.  The few times I&#39;ve contacted them, a competent person has both understood the issue and responded to it appropriately and promptly.[1]https://pinpayments.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m gutted on hearing this. I’ve been on one of my regular Norm YouTube binges, and was watching a ton of them just last night. His dedication to comedy was legendary, and his complexity was intriguing.Norm’s fake late gift to Conan for The Tonight Show, given after Conan was leaving, is a great example of his sort of expectation-bending humor.https://youtu.be/uarJj-K4XH4His appearances on The View are legendary examples of his ability to be uncontrolled and play the dumbest guy in the room at the same time while actually being the sharpest. His intentional subversion played off as uninformed is a seemingly one of a kind talent. There are videos of interviews where he describes some of the background to things he did on the show.https://youtu.be/a4ageUPHgnohttps://youtu.be/Z3PP_SWHUQQ“Not everything has a point” just gets me. It’s amazing how the hosts just want to jump from talking point to talking point and just refuse to let the guest actually talk, which Norm really plays off of.And lastly, the moth joke remains a shining example of his anti-jokes.https://youtu.be/jJN9mBRX3uoHis monologues at roasts, awards shows, and the correspondents dinner were examples of not being afraid of anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;If you die, the cancer also dies at exactly the same time.  That to me isn&#39;t losing a battle, it is a draw.&#34;He was one of the funniest people ever and there is probably no one who was a more entertaining talk show guest.  I can spend hours just watching whatever comes up after plugging &#34;Norm Macdonald talk show&#34; into Youtube."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I literally gasped when I heard this. There is something uniquely sad when one&#39;s favorite comedian passes away.There were many things that made him special, but one thing stands out right now:I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a comedian pursue Truth so rigorously. So much of his comedy was him shining a light on a given topic and giving 100% unflinching attention toward it, even if everyone else wanted to ignore it or &#34;move on&#34;. This often made the &#34;joke&#34; the audience, in that we found ourselves laughing when we thought we shouldn&#39;t be. But why shouldn&#39;t we be laughing? Why shouldn&#39;t we be discussing this? Wait, why is this uncomfortable in the first place? Have I thought about this enough?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awhile ago I wrote a Python library called LiveStats[1] that computed any percentile for any amount of data using a fixed amount of memory per percentile. It uses an algorithm I found in an old paper[2] called P^2. It uses a polynomial  to find good approximations.The reason I made this was an old Amazon interview question. The question was basically, &#34;Find the median of a huge data set without sorting it,&#34; and the &#34;correct&#34; answer was to have a fixed size sorted buffer and randomly evict items from it and then use the median of the buffer. However, a candidate I was interviewing had a really brilliant insight: if we estimate the median and move it a small amount for each new data point, it would be pretty close. I ended up doing some research on this and found P^2, which is a more sophisticated version of that insight.[1]: https://github.com/cxxr/LiveStats[2]: https://www.cs.wustl.edu/~jain/papers/ftp/psqr.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way to think about why we tend to use averages instead of medians is that it is related to a really deep theorem in probability: The Central Limit Theorem.But I think we can twist our heads and see in a way that this is backwards. Mathematically, the mean is much easier to work with because it is linear and we can do algebra with it. That&#39;s how we got the Central Limit Theorem. Percentiles and the median, except for symmetric distributions, are not as easy to work with. They involve solving for the inverse of the cumulative function.But in many ways, the median and percentiles are a more relevant and intuitive number to think about. Especially in contexts where linearity is inappropriate!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some things, you can&#39;t even sensibly measure the mean. For example, if you&#39;re measuring the mean response time for a service, a single failure/timeout makes the mean response time infinite (because 100 years from now the response still hasn&#39;t been received).&#34;Why Averages Suck and Percentiles are Great&#34;:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a software developer right now but I&#39;ve worked with DAWs as a producer for more than 5 years. You can&#39;t even imagine how frustrating is working with Digital Audio Workstation. One messy plug-in and you can lose hours and hours of work. Preset management is a nightmare, there are so many things that they could do to go forward, but the Sequencer market is stall and hasn&#39;t moved in years.Imagine if they applied something similar to a git versioning system to music projects.... I don&#39;t even know if the VST interface can be used or if it&#39;s licensed somehow from Steinberg.Also consider that there are no good audio drivers for Linux (like Asio for example) so you&#39;re almost forced to stay in windows or Mac...No plug-in or DAW has a CLI... I could go on for hours...I&#39;m doing some digital audio processing for a startup idea and the only thing I&#39;ve came up with is using sox trough a Python API."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"damn, the audio wave visualization on the wires in the thing that&#39;s like the Bitwig grid editor is just BRILLIANT.probably would be a bit much in a complex finished instrument but that&#39;s amazingly intuitive for the building phase, or for reading someone else&#39;s instrument.i wish there a way to translate old Reaktor library stuff into more modern synth GUIs. there&#39;s some amazing gold in there but it is nigh impossible to understand between Reaktor&#39;s uh... challenging UI and the total lack of documentation for the signal paths to try and explain them to a relative novice. you can very easily see _what&#39;s_ built, but god help you try to understand why on your own without adding a ton of scopes everywhere manually"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love to see the cultural differences between korea/japan and the West on the matter of artificial stuff. Whereas in the West people would try to hide fakeness as much as possible, people in the far East have a much more candid view of it.In the West we do understand and like artificiality, but we really want to contain it to the realm of fiction. When some artificiality spills out in the “real” world we raise red flags: “tssk, this temple is not authentic, it burned down 80 years ago and they rebuilt it from scratch”In the East, there is a deep philosophical difference that I would like to understand better - if anyone can point to any reference on that matter? It’s like people have understood that fiction and artificiality are part of our lives, cause people embellish things all the time, and we humans are happy when we believe in things. So instead of being suspicious, they let themselves invaded by artificiality, not unlike the way Western people create emotional connection with novel characters, but in real world situations.And I mean why not? In the West, we get cartoon character-based advertising, we get actor-based advertising. How is AI-based influencer (that doesn’t hide the fact that it’s artificial) is any different? If Tony the Kellogg’s tiger had an instagram account, we’d find it totally normal. Here is the same, except that we just jumped over the uncanny valley.There is a lot to talk about on the subject and doesn’t fit in a hn comment :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone with more knowledge know how much of this is BS?She has 60k followers on Instagram which (even if all real) isn&#39;t that much. Certainly not anywhere big enough to make 800k a year that the creator claims he plans on making.They say they have 100 sponsorships but this seems like a marketing statement...influencers all the time talk about how popular they are and I don&#39;t see why we should trust the creator of AI influencer more.I don&#39;t see any major brands on her Instagram though I&#39;m not South Korean so maybe I&#39;m missing something - but more likely explanation seems to be that he has partnered with a few companies for a pittance and is overhyping his creation to get more money in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://archive.is/2Jden"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s a terrible policy prescription.  If natural immunity is acceptable, what proportion of the unvaccinated-uninfected population will just take the risk? Half?  More?Millions of people will just (continue to) take the risk, get sick, go to hospital, and die (in decreasing proportions), incurring substantial personal and social costs along the way.Accepting only vaccination as evidence of protection reduces the size of that risk-taking population, and the concomitant social costs.Should there be a third policy option - accepting test-verified infection and recovery as of _now_ as evidence of protection, but discounting future recoveries?  Based on the observational studies cited all over this thread , probably yes.  Seems like associated costs would be higher though, and the only benefit would be less gnashing of teeth here and elsewhere, so its understandable the CDC isn&#39;t rushing to implement it.Should those people just be allowed to assume the risk?  Not while the costs are predominantly social. Insurance (or tax-payers) pay the financial costs, healthcare workers bear the burden of treating a preventable illness, and we all assume the risk that healthcare resources will be stretched to the point of unavailability.  While risk-takers do pay into the same system, their premiums don&#39;t yet reflect the increased expected costs of their personal choice.  While ICUs often run close to or at capacity in one hospital, rarely do they run close at every hospital in a region, as is happening in the south and will happen elsewhere.  While it would be nice if there were more doctors, nurses and facilities able to treat patients, we&#39;re at war with the army we&#39;ve got."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The answer is pretty simple - the moment authorities start saying &#34;well, natural immunity is probably just as good as vaccination, we&#39;ll accept that as equal to vaccination for passport purposes&#34;, a huge segment of the population who&#39;s on the fence about getting the vaccine might just opt to wait until they&#39;re infected naturally, or, even worse, get infected purposefully (EG, chicken pox parties). Which leads to more deaths and outbreaks.In a perfect world, everyone would understand that getting the vaccine is the appropriate choice of action and we could accept natural immunity from people who were infected before vaccines were available - but unfortunately we&#39;re forced into playing these weird games where authorities have to try to incentivize people who aren&#39;t behaving rationally - which in turn leads to further distrust from people on the fence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s amazing how far Intel has fallen.The 10nm debacle exposed how far they&#39;ve fallen behind on fabs to the point that they&#39;re outsourcing to TSMC. Like, how humiliating must that be?Intel completely missed the mobile revolution. They had a stake in that race but sold it (ie XScale).Intel&#39;s product segmentation is bewildering. They&#39;ve also kept features &#34;enterprise&#34; only to prop up high server chip prices to the detriment to computing as a whole, most notably ECC support.And on the server front, which I&#39;m sure is what&#39;s keeping them in business now, they face an existential threat in the form of ARM.Intel had clearly shifted to a strategy of extracting as much money as possible from their captive market. I&#39;m not sure price cuts here are necessarily about AMD but more than their previously captive market now has more options in general.How the mighty have fallen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have been with Intel for almost two decades, I finally moved to AMD for the very first time recently and I&#39;m glad I did. Intel is being called &#34;Toothpaste Company&#34; for a reason. It has deliberately slowed down its innovation since gained performance advantage over AMD with CORE, for over a decade now. Between each iteration, there was not many changes but kept adding fancy instruction sets such as AVX512 useless to most if not all ordinary users. It&#39;s a shame that I bought it actually. But over time I gradually realized that the only occasions I used those fancy stuffs were benching marking new systems. So those fancy things mean nothing to me other than showing off to friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intel is NOT competing against AMD only. In the past couple of years, we’ve seen a number of big tech companies developing their own chips. Focusing on AMD would be quite myopic from a strategic pov. This market is only getting more competitive. Either you compete on performance or price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It makes me sad that FF browser share has continued to decline steadily.  The past couple years of releases have been some its the best in terms of my own UX, since perhaps the Phoenix era.It&#39;s pretty fast these days, the UI is good, has a lot of great extensions and privacy features.I use Brave at work to have a better chrome-based experience with gsuite.  It&#39;s also a fast, excellent browser with good privacy features, built-in ad/tracker blocking and for the time being seems to be user-not-revenue-first.But using a non-free browser feels like a trap to me.  Just as what happened with Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Netscape before, being the middle man between the user and the rest of the internet is just too tempting for any company not to try to leverage for their own advantage.FF hasn&#39;t been always perfect, but for 20 years now they have made a browser that didn&#39;t have a shady corporate agenda.  It feels like the writing is on the wall though.  Even people I know who care about FLOSS are using Chrome as their daily driver these days.Mozilla is great and I hope they continue to focus on building a best-in-class browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to mention (once again), that Firefox on Android is a huge leap in everyday browsing experience over Chrome - and you should try it if you haven&#39;t. Due to mainly one reason: ad blocker extensions; which aren&#39;t supported on Chrome.Since that&#39;s where most users are, I hope Mozilla will be able to communicate these advantages better. Chrome is arguably better on the desktop for most users, unless they&#39;re in the tiny subset of users who care about privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact alone that FF is the best-optimized browser for uBlock Origin makes it an easy choice for me.It&#39;s interesting to me that many of my favorite/most used web technologies in the past decade or so have come from individual, non-profit developers just trying to make something useful, free and flying in the face of a lot of legal and industry norms (e.g., gorhill, elbakyan). In my experience, these tend to work best on FF + VPN, or on Tor (built from FF)."</p>
