								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Time is a flat circle, eh?But all kidding aside, web directories should be much more powerful now than in the 90s. Websites have RSS, and directory websites should be able to automatically monitor things like uptime, and leverage RSS to preview a site&#39;s most recent post.I&#39;ve considered maintaining my own directory on my personal website (a one-way webring if you will), but always stopped because the sites I linked to either died, or were acquired and became something very different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love to see this. The death of blogs and RSS is highly exaggerated. The idea that Google &#34;killed&#34; blogs by killing Google Reader is a meme that is more destructive than Google&#39;s act in itself.There are countless healthy and active blogs that you can read via RSS. There are great RSS reader apps.For us technically-minded folks we need to keep being proactive about helping people read the web via RSS, improving discovery, and continually making RSS a first-class option on sites we build."</p>

Writing good and intuitive documentation is hard, surely this must have been quite an effort.[1]: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-direction[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layou..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love flex, it&#39;s made CSS so easy. One of the things that improved my flex usage was using Penpot to draw my designs before implementing them.They have alignment properties for graphical elements that work like flex&#39;s justify-content and align-items properties so once you design a view in Penpot it becomes almost trivial to translate it into HTML/CSS using flex.It really changed my mindset from working with relative or absolute positioning, blocks, margins, padding, etc... to simply working with flex everywhere. And it&#39;s responsive automatically!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I like to think of CSS as a collection of layout modes. Each layout mode is an algorithm that can implement or redefine each CSS property. We provide an algorithm with our CSS declarations (key/value pairs), and the algorithm decides how to use them.&#34;Brilliant. The way basic CSS properties are taught often ignores the layout mode. Even MDN does not mention that &#34;width&#34; is a CSS property that is not always respected when &#34;display: flex&#34;. Making this distinction more prominent would reduce the amount of confusion/frustration when certain CSS properties appear to &#34;not work&#34;.[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Coppicing, Hedge laying, Bocage, drystone walling, wattle-and-daub are all domestic comparable ancient crafts of Europe. The point being that probably only drystone walling is valued in a way comparable to the Japanese version of Coppicing, which really has been transformed into an artform. European coppices are cut close to the rootstock and cut down far younger for use as poles, for wood turning, for hedge laying.Timber framed construction in Europe was nailless (wooden tree nails permitted) but the mortice and tenon joinery of Japan is in another league. Maybe European Gothic cathedral roofs come close, little else would.Japan modernised in the modern era, it&#39;s industrial revolution was comparatively recent and it remained feudal far longer than Europe (Russian serfdom aside)There are probably more continuous family heritage firms in Japan practising some art (brewing, soy sauce, woodwork, coppicing) than anywhere else. Can you name a European family concern doing the same thing continuously since before 1600? I can&#39;t name any Japanese ones but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were many. Institutional enterprises like Oxford university press exist since deep time, but in Japan it would be a continuous lineage of printers continuing to use woodblock printing (maybe alongside hot type or photo typesetting)Farming does remain in the family but European farming practices have modernised since forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone here is mentioning coppicing, so I suspect there will be some interest in the Low Tech Magazine articles on the subject:https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/coppicing/And since we&#39;re talking about doing cool things with trees, I just wanted to mention that LTM has more interesting articles slightly &#34;adjacent&#34; to this topic, like this one about a half-forgotten technique for growing citrus trees in climates with freezing temperatures:https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/04/fruit-trenches-culti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish there was a way to apply this technique to some of the rarer woods that have fantastic uses in production, like teak, rosewood, and grenadilla.If you&#39;re into hardwoods like musical instruments or fine furniture there&#39;s an appreciation you grow for the character of these woods. And a moral quandary with the sourcing of it. It seems impossible to find a sustainable method to source the material. A lot of what we make today will seem impossible in the coming decades.Grenadilla trees in particular are suffering due to over harvesting and poor oversight in the markets where it is sourced. It is prized for woodwind instruments - and the day is coming where it&#39;s only going to be economical to use recycled polymer composites (which have many benefits besides commercial) over true solid wood instruments. If we could sustainably turn these trees into fruit trees harvested over centuries it would be a great service to nature and the industry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there a good explanation of how to train this from scratch with a custom dataset[0]?I&#39;ve been looking around the documentation on Huggingface, but all I could find was either how to train unconditional U-Nets[1], or how to use the pretrained Stable Diffusion model to process image prompts (which I already know how to do). Writing a training loop for CLIP manually wound up with me banging against all sorts of strange roadblocks and missing bits of documentation, and I still don&#39;t have it working. I&#39;m pretty sure I also need some other trainables at some point, too.[0] Specifically, Wikimedia Commons images in the PD-Art-100 category, because the images will be public domain in the US and the labels CC-BY-SA. This would rule out a lot of the complaints people have about living artists&#39; work getting scraped into the machine; and probably satisfy Debian&#39;s ML guidelines.[1] Which actually does work"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a solo dev working on a creative content creation app to leverage the latest developments in AI.Demoing even the v1 of stable diffusion to the non-technical general users blows them away completely.Now that v2 is here, it’s clear we’re not able to keep pace in developing products to take advantage of it.The general public still is blown away by autosuggest in mobile OS keyboards. Very few really know how far AI tech has evolved.Huge market opportunity for folks wanting to ride the wave here.This is exciting for me personally, since I can keep plugging in newer and better versions of these models into my app and it becomes better.Even some of the tech folks I demo my app to, are simply amazed how I can manage to do this solo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusionHuggingFace Space (currently overloaded unsurprisingly): https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusionDoing a 2.0 release on a (US) 2-day holiday weekend is an interesting move.It seems a tad more difficult to set up the model than the previous version."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s nice but could you make it so that the rotation direction can additionally be toggled by holding down shift while clicking? I find it very irritating to always move the mouse to the bottom right corner to select the rotation direction - especially since &#34;every click counts&#34;.Other than that, I first thought that some of the tiles should start with correct orientation but soon realized that would make this puzzle just really easy, because our brains are just excellent at seeing the correct image from just a few correctly oriented tiles I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like how well this specific picture works for this puzzle. The coastline lines up perfectly with a square border. The cat&#39;s face is sideways. The two steps are the same color, so the rotation could be in one of two possible positions. It makes it just tricky enough to make the right answer not immediately obvious, but it&#39;s not so hard that there&#39;s any chance for being frustrated. Plus, it&#39;s a kitty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can attest to this and took all of my notes on paper in college. However, once I started a real job I realized that this strategy doesn&#39;t scale to all situations. In college, I needed to be able to recall all of the information I had ingested: it was low-write, high-read. In the workplace, there&#39;s much more information, but I&#39;m unlikely to need most of it: it&#39;s high-write, low-read. I need to be able to reference the information, but not necessarily recall it. Taking paper notes became too much of a burden and I moved to a wiki of markdown notes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re in charge of other people, it&#39;s worth noting that some very common cognitive problems like ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Dyslexia negate these benefits in some affected people. The cognitive load of making legible marks can become high enough to become the focus, rather than the actual content. Pressuring someone already struggling with working memory to do things like this, is counterproductive, if not demoralizing. Work style advice is great, but make sure you listen if they say it doesn&#39;t work for them rather than getting into the &#34;it worked for me so you must be doing it wrong&#34; mindset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be curious if anyone had good advice on how to improve your handwriting ability well into adulthood (I&#39;m 35). My penmanship was so bad in grade school that I attended special education classes to improve it, but it still was and remains horrible. This is a source of insecurity for me and since I&#39;ve always been glued to a keyboard it has been easy to handwave away as &#34;screw this, the world is all typing-based anyhow&#34;.But I have seen evidence before that handwriting notes leads to improved retention, and seeing it here now, I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a framework or resource that can help me feel a little bit more confident in my ability to, you know...write words with pen and paper. It&#39;s embarrassing even talking about it, honestly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wife and I are over 70. We live in the UK.It&#39;s fun to generalise, but not always helpful. No, we don&#39;t watch anything like 6 hours of TV a day. We have our evening meal, like every meal, at a table. We mostly watch one thing a day on streaming, usually well made fiction. We read news on our phones but never watch it on TV because of all the uninformed comment.Maybe we are not typical, but we do exist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question is not now much time you spend at a screen, but who is on
the other side of it.Much of the conversation so far concerns time, and the virtues or
vices of how we spend it. Not all pastimes are equal. Knitting a
jumper, taking a hike, or skateboarding are actions one performs on or
in the world. Reading a book is more of an action that the world (the
author especially) performs upon you. It is a different frame. Movies
and video gaming are somewhere in the middle. Some media forms, such
as daytime trash-TV and TiKTok are at the extreme of the
passive/receptive frame. It is a pipeline of affect directly to your
hypothalamus. Any discussion of harms or benefits must be understood
in that light."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I disliked the tone of the piece, I mostly agree with the sentiment. But this (very bitter) part just made me laugh:&gt; But please, yes, tell me again about young people and screen time and content and moral decay, and how the mobiles they’re engaging with are somehow a greater risk to their character than their own parents and their own grandparents and the family traditions they hold so dear, such as laughing in your face when you suggest shared family mealtimes around a table, a suggestion which might lead to talking to each other, listening to each other, and being present in that shared moment with each other. Tell me all about it.This sounds like something my parents would have said. We ate our meal at a table in a room without screens. Nonetheless, my spouse describes the meals I had with my family when we all lived together as “psychological warfare,” and I can’t disagree. When my parents tried to force us all to come together for anything, we laughed in their faces because we hated being together. If that’s the reaction you get from your children, look inward. And if your spouse won’t help you figure it out, then you have at least a partial answer. To this day I avoid interacting with my family as much as possible because my parents couldn’t keep the household under control. They were arbitrary with their punishments, and untrustworthy as far as confiding them with thoughts and feelings. At best nothing would be done about it. At worst, it would come back to bite you later. I didn’t want to talk to people in my family because the result was guaranteed to be extremely painful. I suspect it was the same with the author’s children and husband. It sounds like she did the right thing by getting out."</p>

The iOS App Store only comes on iOS devices, it comes on all iOS devices, and it is the only way to access a crucial feature of the device. It is, for all meaningful purposes, part of the iPhone in the same way iOS is.It would be a bit like Microsoft saying &#34;explorer.exe? Policy A only covers the OS, and that is clearly not part of Windows! - so therefore you are covered by Policy B&#34;. While Apple may be legally in the right, I strongly believe they are morally in the wrong and have betrayed the trust their users put in them to safeguard their privacy.I believe that a casual user of the iPhone would take a look at Apple&#39;s iPhone privacy policy and expect that to apply to the iOS App Store as well, as for all intents and purposes that is a part of the iPhone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Not many people want to trust an AI with spending their money or buying an item without seeing a picture or reading reviews.I wonder how much the decline in quality of Amazon&#39;s marketplace has affected other parts of the company&#39;s business including Alexa. I remember a time when, if I wanted to buy something online, I&#39;d just buy off Amazon without shopping around. They almost always had the best price, their shipping was fast, and I trusted the quality of what I received. In that world, I could see myself saying my shopping list out lout to an Echo to make things easier.But in Amazon&#39;s current free-for-all marketplace, I would never do that. Now I typically check traditional big box stores first, and only go with Amazon if I can&#39;t find what I need elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps a silly question, but can somebody describe how they might lose $10 billion on Alexa in one year? I don&#39;t understand the math. That&#39;s enough to pay 33,000 employees $330k a year, or some recombination of such.  I don&#39;t think the real numbers come even remotely close to that.So it presumably has to be hardware costs, but Alexa is software, and they have vertical integration of all servers which presumably would drive voice processing costs to negligible levels as well (and that&#39;s assuming 0 on-device caching/learning ability). And this is all assuming that the gross revenue generated by Alexa is $0, which also certainly isn&#39;t true. So I don&#39;t see where the numbers are coming from?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use my Alexa all the time, but 99% of it is:Alexa, time!
Alexa, set an alarm for 5 minutes!
Alexa how many minutes left?
Alexa, turn off/on all the lights!That’s basically it.  I wrote some apps for it a long time ago to do custom stuff like read me some Reddit pages, but the SDK changed or something and eventually they just died and it wasn’t obvious to me how to recreate it/not worth the effort.  I really wish there was an easy way to just put python scripts onto the device or something.  The process of going through Amazon is pretty unnecessarily complex and annoying.I know there are ways of doing this stuff with raspberry pi, but also: not really worth the effort.  If I cared that much I’d just make a PWA for my house and give that to my wife and kids."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My current employer was sold to me as a &#34;high documentation&#34; place. What it means in practice is that if you&#39;re trying to do something there are 5 outdated documents describing the decision making process for how the project was run, and no documents about how to actually use the resulting software. Occasionally if you ask how to actually do a task in Slack someone will yell at you that you should have searched for a specific, obscurely named document in Google Drive, Confluence, or Github. We&#39;ve tried a bunch of search tools which successfully surface the million product documents, design documents, PM reports, planning docs, retro docs and standup and oncall notes related to any feature, none of which are up to date."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m convinced that documentation, even for large companies, should just be an Obsidian vault of markdown files maintained via git which is just rendered on the web either using a simple static site generator or using Obsidian Publish. When I brought this up at my last company it got dismissed as being &#39;too technical&#39;.I know git can be tricky but it cannot be that difficult to teach people from non technical departments add, commit and push and then show maybe one person from each department how to solve conflicts. Alternatively, build non technical people a web interface for editing and committing but allow the devs to just use git as standard. Or there&#39;s Obsidian&#39;s built in sync but I don&#39;t know enough about it to know if it scales well in large organisations.What absolutely is definitely not the solution is Confluence. I have not met anyone who has a positive thing to say about it. The only reason it is being so widely used is because it satisfies whoever is in charge of the finances because it comes bundled with Bitbucket and Jira."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Moving to America from France, one of my biggest surprises was how poor the average engineer (person really, but engineers affect me directly at work) is at summarizing concepts clearly.I learned a little later that &#34;summary&#34; exercises are not a thing taught in school here, which surprised me. In France, &#34;le résumé&#34; is an exercise that they constantly drill into students (particularly technical ones), in which you take a 3 page paper and condense it into 100 words. I really hated doing it back in the day, but as an adult I now am very grateful I did and wished other countries made this more prevalent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN, I&#39;m Alex, at Terrastruct, where we&#39;ve been making D2. This actually popped up on HN a couple months back, though it wasn&#39;t ready, e.g. not open source yet. It is now!We also put up a site for you to compare D2 with MermaidJS, Graphviz, and PlantUML: https://text-to-diagram.com.Full disclosure, we&#39;re a for-profit company. The open-core part is that we make an alternative layout engine which we sell (Jetbrains model, i.e. your copy is your&#39;s forever if you&#39;ve paid for 12+ months). It&#39;s not packaged with D2, so you won&#39;t see it if you don&#39;t want it. D2 is perfectly usable without it, and integrates with multiple free open source layout engines (e.g. the one that Mermaid uses, &#34;dagre&#34;, is D2&#39;s default). If you want to read more about our plans for D2: https://d2lang.com/tour/future.Hope you can check it out! It&#39;s got an easy install (and uninstall) process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using PlantUML and Mermaid for my own diagrams.Mermaid is quite basic; it lacks functionalities that for me were necessary; for example, direct connection between attributes of different classes.All in all, PlantUML seems superior to Mermaid, at no cost (both languages are relatively simple to learn).Mermaid is supported by Github, which may be a necessary requirement for some. On the other hand, among the many functionalities, PlantUML&#39;s JSON is unusually good looking out of the box, and if one required the diagram it outputs, it&#39;s a great feature, because it requires no syntax knowledge.Both PlantUML and Mermaid mostly produce (Mermaid more) ugly-looking diagrams (dated, to say the least). In PlantUML, this problem is compounded by the explicit lack of layout, by design.Other warts: both (PlantUML and Mermaid) languages have limited comment support - they are only supported in specific locations of the diagram declarations.D2 could be a very welcome &#34;next gen&#34; diagramming language. However, the devil is in the details - text-to-diagram.com show a very basic functionality, so one must carefully check the requirements.Regarding text-to-diagram.com:- there&#39;s a mistake - PlantUML does support rich text (although &#34;rich&#34; is a fuzzy definition)- class diagrams are an important use case, which is currently missingEDIT: clarification about the comment limitations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently discovered Pikchr from Sqlite/Fossil [0] if anyone is looking for something in a similar vein, although it has it&#39;s own scripting/layout language rather than using go (a plus IMO, as it&#39;s not tied to a specific ecosystem).It&#39;s fantastic for making diagrams when you want more control over the layout than graphviz or mermaidjs but are looking for a similar type of tool. It&#39;s also clean C so easy to embed, and there&#39;s a WASM build for browser use.It is fairly simple in any general purpose language to output pikchr code - I&#39;ve done this previously for producing autogenerated packet diagrams in documentation.0: https://pikchr.org/home/doc/trunk/homepage.md"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For a few months now I saw a huge improvement on Linux regarding the memory management of Firefox. Previously I had to run Firefox in a separate cgroup to limit its memory usage, because it could easily deplete my whole RAM. And if I did close most of my tabs it did not release the memory back to the system. Now I never actually get to the limit I&#39;ve set before and also with Auto Tab Discard extension it is well managed. So kudos to the team for such improvements."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firefox stability is funny ... I was at Mozilla for 10+ years and used Nightly as my daily driver on my work Mac. I don&#39;t think I got more than one or two dozen crashes in total. A crash was a special occasion and I would walk to someone&#39;s desk to show an explore. It barely every happened. On Nightly. So much love for all the stability work that is happening."</p>

How did they architect the history simulation? How do they efficiently update everything on each tick?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Frontend UX developer perspective on DF: The ascii interface is actually fine and mostly a superficial complaint. The real problem is just how hard the many interfaces are to navigate and learn, and how unconventional their designs are.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Github-style rebase-only PRs have revealed the best compromise between &#39;preserve history&#39; and &#39;linear history&#39; strategies:All PRs are rebased and merged in a linear history of merge commits that reference the PR#. If you intentionally crafted a logical series of commits, merge them as a series (ideally you&#39;ve tested each commit independently), otherwise squash.If you want more detail about the development of the PR than the merge commit, aka the &#39;real history&#39;, then open up the PR and browse through Updates, which include commits that were force-pushed to the branch and also fast-forward commits that were appended to the branch. You also get discussion context and intermediate build statuses etc. To represent this convention within native git, maybe tag each Update with pr/123/update-N.The funny thing about this design is that it&#39;s actually more similar to the kernel development workflow (emailing crafted patches around until they are accepted) than BOTH of the typical hard-line stances taken by most people with a strong opinion about how to maintain git history (only merge/only rebase)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want the &#39;merge&#39; function completely deprecated. I simply don&#39;t trust it anymore.If there are no conflicts, you might as well rebase or cherry-pick. If there is any kind of conflict, you are making code changes in the merge commit itself to resolve it. Developer end up fixing additional issues in the merge commit instead of actual commits.If you use merge to sync two branches continously, you completely lose track of what changes were done on the branch and which where done on the mainline."</p>

Despite much progress in training AI systems to imitate human language, building agents that use language to communicate intentionally with humans in interactive environments remains a major challenge. We introduce CICERO, the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in Diplomacy, a strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation and tactical coordination between seven players. CICERO integrates a language model with planning and reinforcement learn- ing algorithms by inferring players’ beliefs and intentions from its conversations and generating dialogue in pursuit of its plans. Across 40 games of an anonymous online Diplomacy league, CICERO achieved more than double the average score of the human players and ranked in the top 10% of participants who played more than one game."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; With the tail-call approach, each bytecode now gets its own function, and the pathological case for the C/C++ compiler is gone. And as shown by the experience of the Google protobuf developers, the tail-call approach can indeed be used to build very good interpreters. But can it push to the limit of hand-written assembly interpreters? Unfortunately, the answer is still no, at least at its current state.&gt; The main blockade to the tail-call approach is the callee-saved registers. Since each bytecode function is still a function, it is required to abide to the calling convention, specifically, every callee-saved register must retain its old value at function exit.This is correct, wasting of callee-saved registers is a shortcoming of the approach I published about protobuf parsing (linked from the first paragraph above).  More recently I have been experimenting with a new calling convention that uses no callee-saved registers to work around this, but the results so far are inconclusive.  The new calling convention would use all registers for arguments, but allocate registers in the opposite order of normal functions, to reduce the chance of overlap.  I have been calling this calling convention &#34;reverse_cc&#34;.I need to spend some time reading this article in more detail, to more fully understand this new work.  I would like to know if a new calling convention in Clang would have the same performance benefits, or if Deegen is able to perform optimizations that go beyond this.  Inline caching seems like a higher-level technique that operates above the level of individual opcode dispatch, and therefore somewhat orthogonal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work on a game, that mostly uses lua as logic code, saddling on a c/c++ engine. One of the engine developers implemented lua jit years ago and found that for the actual performance, the interpreter/jit  was neglibable, the most expensive thing being the actual switch between luacode and c-code, which is with a large API a constant ugly background performance loss.The lua code by itself did not ran long enough to actually profit much from optimizations much.So, back then we did discuss possible solutions, and one idea was to basically notice a upcoming C-Call in bytecode ahead of execution, detect the stability of the arguments ahead of time. A background thread, extracts the values, perform the Call-processing of arguments and return pushes the values onto the stack, finally setting a &#34;valid&#34; bit to unblock the c-call (which by then actually is no longer a call). Both sides never have a complete cache eviction and live happily ever after. Unfortunatly i have a game dev addiction, so nothing ever came of it.But similar minds might have pushed similar ideas.. so asking the hive for this jive. Anyone ever seen something similar in the wild?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been working on an early design of a high-performance dynamic binary translator that cannot JIT, and have reached a very similar conclusion as the author. We have an existing threaded interpreter but it’s a mess of hard-to-maintain assembly for two architectures, and we run into funny issues all the time where the two diverge. Plus, being handwritten by people who are not scheduling experts, there is probably some performance left on the table because of our poor choices and the design making it difficult to write complex-but-more-performant code. Nobody wants to write an efficient hash for TLB lookups in a software MMU using GAS macros.The core point I’ve identified is that existing compilers are pretty good at converting high level descriptions of operations into architecture-specific code (at least, better than we are given the amount of instructions we have to implement) but absolutely awful at doing register selection or dealing with open control flow that is important for an interpreter. Writing everything in assembly lets you do these two but you miss out on all the nice processor stuff that LLVM has encoded into Tablegen.Anyways, the current plan is that we’re going to generate LLVM IR for each case and run it through a custom calling convention to take that load off the compiler, similar to what the author did here. There’s a lot more than I’m handwaving over that’s still going to be work, like whether we can automate the process of translating the semantics for each instruction into code, how we plan to pin registers, and how we plan to perform further optimizations on top of what the compiler spits out, but I think this is going to be the new way that people write interpreters. Nobody needs another bespoke macro assembler for every interpreter :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazingly brilliant work, especially given the CPU capabilities at the time. Carmack&#39;s use of BSP trees inspired my own work on the Crash Bandicoot renderer. I was also really intrigued by Seth Teller&#39;s Ph.D. thesis on Precomputed Visibility Sets though I knew that would never run on home console hardware.None of these techniques is relevant anymore given that all the hardware has Z buffers, obviating the need to explicitly order the polygons during the rendering process. But at the time (mid 90s) it was arguably the key problem 3D game developers needed to solve. (The other was camera control; for Crash Andy Gavin did that.)A key insight is that sorting polygons correctly is inherently O(N^2), not O(N lg N) as most would initially assume. This is because polygon overlap is not a transitive property (A in front of B and B in front of C does NOT imply A in front of C, due to cyclic overlap.) This means you can&#39;t use O(N lg N) sorting, which in turn means sorting 1000 polygons requires a million comparisons -- infeasible for hardware at the time.This is why many games from that era (3DO, PS1, etc) suffer from polygons that flicker back and forth, in front of and behind each other: most games used bucket sorting, which is O(N) but only approximate, and not stable frame to frame.The handful of games that did something more clever to enable correct polygon sorting (Doom, Crash and I&#39;m sure a few others) looked much better as a result.Finally, just to screw with other developers, I generated a giant file of random data to fill up the Crash 1 CD and labeled it &#34;bsptree.dat&#34;. I feel a bit guilty about that given that everyone has to download it when installing the game from the internet, even though it is completely useless to the game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BSP (binary space partitioning) was a well known algorithm, not something Carmack picked out of obscurity. It is well covered in every edition of Foley and van Dam&#39;s bible &#34;Computer Graphics&#34;. The arcade game &#34;I, Robot&#34; from Atari (1983) used BSP to render the polygons back to front -- there was no z-buffer.That isn&#39;t to deny that Carmack was brilliant. But him using BSP isn&#39;t some masterstroke of genius in itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was studying computer graphics at the time. The book we used was &#34;Computer Graphics Principles and Practice&#34; I don&#39;t recall which edition. BSP trees are covered in the book, and like the article says, had been written about more than a decade prior.What Carmack had was the ability to read research papers and translate them into working code. I can do that too, but it does seem to be a less common skill in the software world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How come these map projects still use raster tiles? Are there no open source map projects that render the OSM data to vector data, and renders that vector data on the clients GPU? Maybe raster tiles are better at something I&#39;m missing, but vector maps are easier to style[0], localize, they&#39;re sharper, easier to rotate and zoom smoothly. Maybe it&#39;s harder than I think to render it on all sorts of clients including mobile?When writing this I found out that MapTiler[1] is maintaining MapLibre GL JS[2], a fork of a Mapbox project to do just that. It would be interesting to see the difference between self hosting raster and vector maps and compare pros and cons. You can even render raster tiles from vector tiles on the server if the client needs it[3].[0] https://openmaptiles.org/docs/style/mapbox-gl-style-spec/[1] https://www.maptiler.com/open-source/[2] https://github.com/MapLibre/maplibre-gl-js[3] https://openmaptiles.org/docs/host/tileserver-gl/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blockchain was invented to solve one particular problem: distributed consensus on a sequence of transactions, where the choice of which transaction to include from a set of conflicting transactions is irrelevant.The latter property here is key to understanding where blockchain is useful. It was created to solve the &#34;double spend problem&#34;, ie. two transitions that spend the same coin but send it to different recipients (and so they conflict and cannot both be included in the canonical list of transactions). A double spend is the result of the sender either (a) making a mistake, or (b) attempting fraud. In both cases the important property is that as long as only a single of these conflicting transactions is included, the systems works.Only if your problem exhibits the above property (and it&#39;s a distributed system) does using a blockchain make sense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a real experience that perfectly reflects the research presented here (safer ledgers useful, blockchains are not).I accidentally got wrapped up in a project to automate some HR functions, and the product manager demanded that it must be blockchain because blockchains are the future.It turns out that append-only databases are well-suited for HR records, and (especially when dealing with things like background checks, immigration papers, etc.) it doesn&#39;t hurt to have a history with cryptographically-verifiable date stamps.We used an existing database that did all of the above, told everyone it was blockchain, and released the product.That was a great strategy for a few years until everyone realized blockchain was a boondoggle, and now you never need to work with anyone who still believes in it. You can just understand their mention of blockchain to be a sign that you need to avoid doing business with them."</p>

I’ll be honest, when they explain why it’s wonderful I just don’t get it. You guys got to go figure it out for us.”To me the tell is not just that Andy didn&#39;t understand.It&#39;s that all of these leaders said &#34;everyone says it&#39;s the future&#34;, but not one of them said &#34;I have this problem and here&#39;s how blockchain solves it for me.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because corporations are doing the majority of that pro-environmental advertising. I mean that both in terms of companies making changes (both real and greenwashing) and the News/Media corporations reporting on it.Telecommuting could be absolutely massive for reduced emissions, could bring down urban house prices, improve inter-family relationships, and revitalized suburban neighborhoods (e.g. more walkable areas). Plus increase wealth to relatively poor rural areas.Even some corporations are starting to realize that telecommuting isn&#39;t their enemy, but large ships move slowly, and recently we&#39;ve been seeing a lot of &#34;return to work&#34; used as a way to conduct layoffs with lower negative PR/stock tanking. This isn&#39;t a byproduct but a goal of return-to-work (e.g. see Musk&#39;s text message conversation during Twitter-lawsuit discovery)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is nothing more illogical in modern society than commuting to an office every day. Employees waste 2 of their 16 available waking hours in the non-productive commute while incurring significant financial costs (lease/insurance/fuel/energy) in order to support this patently absurd activity. Employers waste time and energy negotiating leases, re-arranging offices, purchasing AV equipment for meeting rooms, etc., in addition to paying the likely enormously expensive lease itself. The impacts on the environment, the number of hours of human life wasted in commute, the pointless buildings and associated costs to employers as well as the public infrastructure to support it (roads, trains, busses, etc.) are all incredibly wasteful. Surely, all of this could only be justified if physical presence had a dramatic impact on productivity. Yet, we cannot tell one way or the other if it actually improves outcomes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two main problems1. Middle and senior management who don&#39;t want to lose control or be rendered less effective.
2. Engineers who are not trained in written communication and largely cannot autonomously move a group towards a goal without a lot of supervision.If you solve for no 2, then that acts counter to no 1 - because middle management will be questioned - why do we need you ? If a group of engineers can function on their own towards a common goal, then the manager&#39;s role is more or less rendered redundant. Sure there may be a need for psychological support but you surely won&#39;t need the current ratio of engineers: managers.There is a deep rooted old school interest in staying physically connected. This won&#39;t go away anytime soon. I am not debating whether that is right or wrong, but the general notion that &#39;we are better if we are physically together&#39; still persists. I don&#39;t know if this is a genuine feel-good-together feeling or just a made up emotion to mask point no 1 above.I am flummoxed by how executive leadership is simply blind to these facts in most companies. I mean the CEO can declare a fully remote constraint sort of like the exact opposite of what Musk did at Twitter and drive productivity higher. The cynic in me says execs can&#39;t force this decision because the senior management simply will come back and say &#39;we cannot be this productive with a fully remote team anymore&#39;. I don&#39;t know but I for one cannot understand the irrational exuberance behind RTO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my professors in grad school was really into wine and every couple of years he would put on an after-hours wine tasting class for a semester.  One of the points he made was that there are absolutely wines which are objectively better and worse and that experts can reliably tell them apart.  He had met enough experts who could identify a vineyard and vintage blind to know there was something to it.  But sitting on top of that there is a frothy market that is driven by fads, speculation, and hype.He was of the opinion that generally speaking the quality of a typical wine increases monotonically with price up until around the $40 range with the big steps around the $5, $10, and $20 price points.  But above $50 or so, you&#39;re no longer paying for higher quality, per se.  It&#39;s more that you are paying for a unique flavor profile and reliability.  But unless you&#39;re seeking out that particular flavor profile, you can get a bottle that is just as good for $30-40 (and occasionally even cheaper).  And above a few hundred dollars it&#39;s all just fads, speculation, and hype.  (He liked to say that the people who buy those wines have &#34;more money than sense.&#34;)  They&#39;re good wines, but you can get a bottle that is just as good for a fraction of the price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at WineSpectator.com in 2012-2013. I&#39;ll say this in their favor: the wine tastings were blind. A bunch of interns would set up the wine tasting, pouring the wine into glasses and then hiding the bottles. Only after everything was setup were the editors allowed into the room. So when the editors drank the wine, they had no idea if they were drinking a $9 bottle or a $900 bottle. They had to focus on the taste and balance, and write their report. Only afterwards were they told which wine they had tasted.Having said that, I&#39;ll also mention, the way the editors struggled for new adjectives did sometimes make me laugh:&#34;a vast, hearty body, notes of blue and a hint of graphite steel&#34;&#34;a radiance similar to the sun at dawn, a strong body, notes of orange&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two scientific points to bring up about this article:1. When the author talks about Coke vs. Pepsi, he comes to the conclusion that the reason people prefer Pepsi in blind taste tests but Coke in unblinded ones is &#34;Think of it as the brain combining two sources of input to make a final taste perception: the actual taste of the two sodas and a preconceived notion (probably based on great marketing) that Coke should taste better.&#34; I&#39;ve read elsewhere, though, that the reason for this difference is actually because of the difference between &#34;sip tests&#34; vs. &#34;drinking tests&#34;. Pepsi is objectively sweeter than Coke, so if you&#39;re just taking a few quick sips (as most taste tests are set up), you may prefer the sweeter taste of Pepsi because it stands out more, but if you&#39;re drinking a whole bunch, the sweeter taste of Pepsi can feel cloying.2. The article includes this quote, &#34;the correlation between price and overall rating is small and negative, suggesting that individuals on average enjoy more expensive wines slightly less.&#34; I wonder if this could be due to Berkon&#39;s paradox, a statistical paradox that was on the HN front page yesterday, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33677781. After all, I&#39;m guessing most truly bad wines may not be rated at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wife and I use Briar for household communication because of subsidiarity rather than any direct privacy concerns. Out of all the messenger projects that we&#39;ve tried, Briar actually works for local communication. It&#39;s actually instant messaging without any client hiccups or latency (looking at you, Signal). We&#39;ve tried a ton of other options, but we keep ending up back at Briar.There are points of UX friction in the name of good opsec that are inconvenient but totally understandable given the project goals. The big ones being that you have to manually login after any reboots and notifications are intentionally sparse, so good luck using a smartwatch for reading or replying. Otherwise, the forums and blogs are great for managing household projects, IM is a dream, and as a bonus, anyone willing to install and use it probably has a large enough values overlap that we can use it as a social pre-filter for close friends.The only other option that has come even remotely close to being as functional as Briar is DeltaChat. The only issue that stops us from using DeltaChat (or email in general) is that we both have email hosting in Europe while we live in the US, so neither of us, being frugal in principal, wants to send information to Europe and back in order to tell the person 100 ft away to come help bring in the groceries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wanna say this app saved my family and I when we went on a cruise. Normally, we would had had to pay to use the chat service via the ship&#39;s paid-only Wi-Fi (since we get no phone reception on the seas). Without needing to pay for the Wi-Fi, we were all able to use Briar to communicate whilst connected to the network, which made coordinating and finding each other on the ship way easier. It was great and worked really well. So thanks, Briar!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know if I have ADHD, but if I do an online survey it says I most probably definitely do. I was never diagnosed as a child because I largely functioned as a kid and was quiet and non-disruptive, but looking back the signs were all there.Fast forward as an adult I have a number of coping mechanisms and one of them is to have something on in the background. I have never associated the effectiveness with the noise itself, but rather with something that is keeping part of my brain quiet. It prevents my mind from wandering. It is ideally something I already know. Like a show I have seen before or a podcast that I am okay not fully retaining. Not enough stimulation and I get distracted easily, too much stimulation and I shut down completely. Music doesn&#39;t usually work for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have ADHD and I straight-up don&#39;t do silence. Between restless brain and tinnitus, actual silence, or anything with a noise floor below ~15dB, just doesn&#39;t sit right with me. 20-30dB is about ideal. Especially when trying to sleep. I have some sort of fan/filter in just about every room. When I&#39;m working, I&#39;m almost always listening to music (unless I&#39;m way over stimulated).It probably started when I was much younger with much worse asthma and always had a HEPA filter running in the background. Eventually this turned into basically always having some kind of fan in my primary locations. Right now I dig the Coway air filters on low or medium.Even beyond the alleged &#34;noise floor dopamine boost&#34;, I find some kind of background whoosh really nice for masking otherwise variable sounds, such as cars, airplanes, and the wind, which are far more distracting.10/10 would recommend running some sort of air filter all the time. Plus, cleaner air (air pollution has all kinds of bad effects)."</p>

About two decades ago, I had a Via Unichrome integrated GPU and the OpenChrome project had me able to run games on Linux. It was sick. I played Unreal Tournament (which had a Linux version that worked better for me than on Windows), and I think at one point my introduction to open source was having to modify another game&#39;s source code so that it would allocate less GPU memory for a texture (the texture then kind of smeared over the rest of the screen, but it was for a UI element so the game was still playable).Love to see there are people still doing that stuff today, especially since this stuff is probably more complex than then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a modern Web Audio implementation of this Mac software from 1986 (last updated in 2004).Music Mouse - An Intelligent Instrument - https://web.archive.org/web/20220629172536fw_/http://retiary... (Archived because the original site is quite slow: http://retiary.org/ls/programs.html)It was written by Laurie Spiegel, a composer and early pioneer in electronic music.&gt; Music Mouse is an algorithmic musical composition software developed by Laurie Spiegel. The &#34;intelligent instrument&#34; name refers to the program&#39;s built-in knowledge of chord and scale convention and stylistic constraints. Automating these processes allows the user to focus on other aspects of the music in real time.&gt; In addition to improvisations using this software, Spiegel composed several works for &#34;Music Mouse&#34;, including Cavis muris in 1986, Three Sonic Spaces in 1989, and Sound Zones in 1990. She continued to update the program through Macintosh OS 9 and, as of 2021, it remained available for purchase or demo download from her website.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_SpiegelShe was featured in the documentary, Sisters with Transistors. https://sisterswithtransistors.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is probably the most intuitively enjoyable music tool I&#39;ve ever used.I&#39;m not a musician and I know very little about what makes music good, but playing with this tool felt like I was hearing a better version of my own imagination. Like those scenes in movies where people can suddenly play music and have no idea how they&#39;re doing it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By total chance, this revealed a flaw with my mouse that&#39;s been haunting me for months.My right mouse button intermittently doesn&#39;t bring up context menus, which I seemingly confirmed by recording the screen and visualizing click events in a presentation mode. It would show what looked like one right click, but no context menu, or a context menu that appeared and was immediately dismissed.But this revealed that it&#39;s actually rapidly sending multiple logical clicks per physical click. The logical clicks are fast enough that the screen recordings didn&#39;t differentiate them as separate events - which sent me in the wrong direction, making me think the OS was disregarding clicks. But here, the multiple clicks are clearly audible.So thanks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From this operations engineer&#39;s perspective, there are only 3 main things that bring a site down: new code, disk space, and &#39;outages&#39;. If you don&#39;t push new code, your apps will be pretty stable. If you don&#39;t run out of disk space, your apps will keep running. And if your network/power/etc doesn&#39;t mysteriously disappear, your apps will keep running. And running, and running, and running.The biggest thing that brings down a site is changes. Typically code changes, but also schema/data changes, infra/network/config changes, etc. As long as nothing changes, and you don&#39;t run out of disk space (from logs for example), things stay working pretty much just fine. The trick is to design it to be as immutable and simple as possible.There are other things that can bring a site down, like security issues, or bugs triggered by unusual states, too much traffic, etc. But generally speaking those things are rare and don&#39;t bring down an entire site.The last thing off the top of my head that will absolutely bring a site down over time, is expired certs. If, for any reason at all, a cert fails to be regenerated (say, your etcd certs, or some weird one-off tool underpinning everything that somebody has to remember to regen every 360 days), they will expire, and it will be a very fun day at the office. Over a long enough period of time, your web server&#39;s TLS version will be obsoleted in new browser versions, and nobody will be able to load it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This left a lot wondering what exactly was going on with all those engineers and made it seem like it was all just bloat.I was partly expecting the rest of the article to explain to me why exactly it wasn&#39;t just bloat. But it goes on talking about this 1~3-person cache SRE team that built solid infra automation that&#39;s really resilient to both hardware and software failures. If anything, the article might actually persuade me that it was all bloat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did SRE consulting work for a phase of my career... as the author points out, these systems are scaled out and resilient, but what happens next is entropy. Team sizes shrink, everything starts to be viewed through a cost cutting / savings lens, overtaxed staff start ignoring problems or the long-term view because they are in firefighting mode, it becomes hard to attract new talent because the perception is 
&#34;the good times are over.&#34; Things start to become brittle and/or not get the attention needed, contractors are brought in because they are cheaper and/or bits get outsourced to the cheapest bidder... the professional care and attention like the author clearly brought just starts to shift over time. Consultants like me are brought in to diagnose what&#39;s wrong - the good staff could write our briefs, they know what&#39;s going on - and generally we slap a band-aid on the problem because management just wants to squeeze whatever value they can out of the assets rather than actually improve anything."</p>

Gladly it was just tangential to that idea.Idea: Train an ai to construct entire threads based on the input of the title and link. There should be plenty of training material, and frankly I think it would be hilariously similar to the real threads.When new submissions are added to HN, the system will fetch the title and link, and predict the entire thread. You can view the thread on something like hnpredicted.com/?id=33680661 . When the real thread has had no new comment added for five days, it is reintegrated into the system further training the model.Possibly, the model could be trained on the actual content of the link. But I suspect just using the short title might be better. Larger concentration on the actual material there, websites contain lots of text which is useless.Now that I&#39;ve posted the idea, feel free to steal it ofcourse.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools.I know this first hand, building a developer tool startup and failing to reach any level of revenue. In the end, the tech was bought out by a larger company to recover a fraction of our VC investment.The challenge is that when you&#39;re building software for developers, they already know how it must work.It&#39;s like trying to sell magic tricks to magicians. Sell magic to regular people, and you&#39;ll see some significant revenue.I&#39;ve used Kite before. It was ok. But I am a SWE. It&#39;s entirely possible that Kite would have seen major adoption if the push was towards non-technical folks trying to get their feet wet in software. Eg: Data scientists or business.The reason why BI tools sell so well at the moment is that you have tons of C-level execs that like the appeal of a business-optimizing tool requiring little to none of any actual software development.Let that be a lesson to everyone. You can&#39;t blow away developers. They&#39;re just too damn ~~smart~~ well-informed.Edit: Another anecdote: A buddy of mine built a bespoke OCR and document indexing/search tool. He has ~60 paying clients (almost exclusively law-firms and banks) that primarily work with printed pages on paper. No Saas. No free tier. The client data resides on an on-premise Windows box, avoiding issues with sensitive data in the cloud etc.He&#39;s a solo dev with support contracts and nets something like $1000/month from each client.For your average lawyer/paralegal, the ability to locate and reference a single page from thousands of pages in under a second is magic. So they pay for it wholeheartedly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools. Their manager might, but engineering managers only want to pay for discrete new capabilities, i.e. making their developers 18% faster when writing code did not resonate strongly enough.&#34;I never used Kite, but I&#39;ve tried Github Copilot twice, and found it marginal at best (and distracting at worst - which is why I turned it off both times). If Kite was similar, the reason I&#39;m not paying is that coder AIs are not providing any value.Developers are somewhat reluctant to pay for tools but I think you can get them to pay for things that are worth it. I&#39;ve been paying for code editors for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Our 500k developers would not pay to use it. Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools.”I don’t like depending on something I could lose in a month or tethers me to the internet. I consider that more a service than a tool. I’d prefer to just buy something once that just works, but that business model might be dead too since people will pirate things that aren&#39;t tethered to some serverside component.I guess what I’m saying is that I want to buy tools, but people are only renting. Personally I’m largely holding out hope this becomes someone’s open source passion project and I can truly own my tools."</p>

Someone eventually realized that the mesh network I built to connect all the lights together and report usage statistics could also be used to track employees moving throughout the building and catch them taking unauthorized breaks in the stairwell, so that&#39;s its main purpose now.I&#39;m a lot more paranoid about privacy these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at Akamai about 5 years ago, I was involved in building the system for making their CDN compliant in China. There were two main features, and they were activated on all servers running inside mainland china (not HK, macau or Taiwan)1. Logs of the CDN were sent in real time to the ministry of technology -- there was about a 15 minute delay if I remember correctly, and they could impose fines if they were delayed. The log included the url visited, the IP address of the visitor, and a few other things. Perhaps the user agent? I forget.2. The ministry of technology had a special API to block URLs on the CDN. Basically, they provided a list of URLs that would return a 451, and of course those logs also went to the government.No other country had this kind of access at the time, but it was considered critical for the business to continue to operate in China. As I understand it, these are required to comply with chinese government regulations, and other CDNs like Cloudflare and Cloudfront have also built similar capabilities. Perhaps jgrahamc can comment on what cloudflare did?I feel quite guilty about being involved with that project, but the business was set on building it, so I did what I could to limit the blast radius. I would not be surprised if someone got arrested or was killed because of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in an Ad-tech start-up in Berlin run by two of the most evil f*kers I&#39;ve ever encountered. I built out their principal ad auction algorithm and a lot of the back-end to support it, and all they did with it was target vulnerable groups of people at particular times of the week when they thought they were at their lowest ebb.One meeting in particular really stands out still, a social media giant that everyone knows was in town meeting the founders to sell additional personalization data. Before that meeting, I thought things the start-up were doing were a bit sketchy, maybe borderline unethical. During the meeting itself, it was more like sitting around a table with Dr. Evil and a few henchmen. They were actively, unambiguously picking vulnerable groups for ad re-targeting. And that&#39;s not even the worst of it, the meeting wraps up and one of the founders says &#34;OK guys, let&#39;s go get some beers and bring some girls&#34;. Then this despicable excuse for a man promptly walked out into the office, points at a few female employees and says &#34;You, you and you, come with us now&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all, I&#39;m the author of https://devenv.sh, https://cachix.org and https://nix.dev.I&#39;ve been part of the Nix community for more than 10 years and in the last 4 years focused on making it documented, simple and accessible for any developer.After building Cachix (where you can store any software binaries with a few steps) we realized that there needs to be an intuitive interface for crafting developer environments.I&#39;m really looking forward what you build on top of devenv. We&#39;re only beginning to explore the area of what&#39;s possible, so please give as much feedback as you have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"this, devbox, and others seem to be alternatives to `nix-env shell` or the flake-based `nix develop`. spurred i think by a desire for better UX. these are excellent for any project off-the-ground enough that you’ve run `git init` or created a repo.the adjacent area i’m struggling with is the “i want to write a tiny program to verify some conjecture, and i’ll probably throw it away an hour from now”. think codegolf competitions, if you can’t relate.the environments i create for these follow similar patterns. it’s either python with numpy, pandas and plotly, or it’s Rust with clap and serde, say. i’d love a tool where i can just `cd /tmp/my-hourlong-project` and then `devenv python` to get a python shell that’ll have everything i often use (and probably more).hearing from people who use these tools, nobody has told me that any of these can do this — except that since they crawl up the fs tree looking for their env definition maybe i could just stash some definitions at the fs root and get globally-invokable environments that way. seems hacky though: i’d hope for a method that’s more officially supported."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks nice! I’m really enthusiastic about these nix based dev env systems. Recently saw devbox[0] here, tried it out and fell in love. It’s made me very interested in all things Nix!0 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32600821"</p>

The higher tiers of Workspace/Office provide this functionality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think that this move isn&#39;t so much about privacy. I think that French government is beginning to realize that these types of products and services constitute critical IT infrastructure for the country. As such, these products can not be offered by a foreign country, no matter how friendly. I suspect the government offices will be next. I am not actually sure, what alternatives are out there for MS Office and Google Docs?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see someone taking privacy a little more seriously.The cloud has it&#39;s place but I&#39;ve never been happy with the underhanded way that Office 365 &#34;encourages&#34; users to save to the cloud.  When someone pays for one service, and is continuously pushed to use another (with additional downstream costs), I wonder isn&#39;t it time to pursue antitrust?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This post really starts to show the right direction:Z-Library - &#34;the desktop app&#34;,
with built in Tor (for seeders safety), IPFS (for p2p distribution), IPNS (to download updated indexes), with local search engine (no SPOF &amp; convenience), optional at-rest file encryption, and some random pining algorithm to let users donate 1-10GB of local disk space to host random chunks of the library.It needs to be dead easy to let anyone use and contribute."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Considering the goals of IPFS, I’m surprised it has trouble at this scale. I mean, it’s supposed to be “interplanetary” but this data would fit on two hard drives. The post talks about performance problems with advertising “hundreds” of content IDs. Is it a design problem or just an early implementation problem?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m fairly sure this isn&#39;t really safe or really reliable.To my knowledge, IPFS isn&#39;t really private, in that both the nodes hosting content can be easily known, and the users requesting content can be monitored. This is bad news for something law enforcement has already taken a serious interest in.IPFS also requires &#34;pinning&#34;, which means that unless other people decide to dedicate a few TB to this out of their own initiative, what we have currently is a single machine providing data through an obscure mechanism. If this machine is taken down, the content goes with it.The amount of people that have 31 TB worth of spare storage, care about this particular issue, and are willing to get into legal trouble for it (or at least anger their ISP/host) is probably not terribly large. The work could be split up, but then there needs to be some sort of coordination to somehow divide up hosting the archive among a group of volunteers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a nurse and I find the 7th point on the post especially relevant. I will add a disclaimer that I never worked in the ICU so I can&#39;t speak for what happens in that type of unit.There is a serious issue with the flow of information in healthcare, (or at least in the U.S, I never worked elsewhere to know if it&#39;s any different). But If you find something during your shift which will be important to know later on, it will certainly be lost as soon as you are off for a few days, or even as soon as a new nurse comes on. To think of a somewhat crude example, if you find out that it is much easier to obtain a blood sample from the veins on the left arm of a patients vs the right, many nurses will still stick the right arm countless times hoping to get something.And you can leave a chart note about things like that or speak about it during report, but for the most part few people will think &#34;hm, I wonder what everybody else had to deal with.&#34; They are probably too busy handling a thousand different things happening all at once. And, even if that is not the case, from what I observed it&#39;s simply not part of how things are done. And very often patients will get (justifiably) angry, saying &#34;I&#39;ve been complaining of x thing for days!&#34; or some version of that. I think it would be much better for both patients and healthcare staff alike if there was a greater emphasis placed on focusing on the series of successes and failures that happen over the course of someone&#39;s care, not just seeing it as a single shift or a single problem happening in some isolated point in time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I noticed a lot of the same things when my dad was in the ICU.  Some additional thoughts:1. &#34;Almost every patient has delusions and nightmares&#34; I personally felt &#34;off&#34; when visiting my father.  The sounds, smells, lights and constant buzz of activity all contributed to a feeling of being in a surreal dreamworld.   Lack of sleep contributes.  I can&#39;t imagine what my father experiencing.2. Food was HORRIBLE.  One meal was a low quality hamburger on a plain, white bread bun with a slice of &#34;american cheese&#34;, fries, iceberg lettuce salad with a couple of slices of cucumber and a single slice of tomato, a container of apple sauce and glass of milk.  Lots of salad dressing and ketchup.   They wouldn&#39;t let us bring better food into the ICU and my dad didn&#39;t want to &#34;make waves&#34;.3. Family is critical.  My father got better care because I, or my brother, was there to act on his behalf.  Having obnoxious family members is worse than having none from what I saw."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There’s no sense of a scientific method, reasoning from first principles, or even reasoning from similar cases though. It’s all shooting in the dark, and most of the time I felt like I could have done just as good a job on these longterm issues...This articulates very well what I&#39;ve usually felt when dealing with doctors. It&#39;s like the story of a programmer finding that his code outputs 5 when it should be 4, and then adding...    if(return_value == 5):
        return_value = 4

...to fix it, and being satisfied. What I want is something like in the television show House. The main character is unhinged and anti-social and takes extreme risks, but at least he demonstrates curiosity to really figure out and understand the root of what&#39;s going on. To be fair, I don&#39;t actually think that doctors lack curiosity or are incapable of doing this, the medical system as it&#39;s set up just doesn&#39;t allow it. For chronic issues, I&#39;ve usually figured them out for myself, as a layperson, by persistently keeping track of things, searching the web, reading, and experimenting over months and years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being accommodative of small minorities seems to be a kind, and thoughtful thing to do.However having large majorities(95%+ of the population) make concessions in order to accommodate a small group imposes a cost (however small) born by many to the benefit of a few. My questions is how do you decide where to make that trade off? What’s the cost benefit analysis? At some point where do people say the cost of accommodating this 1/100k/1m people by another 300m+ people is not a worthwhile use of societal resources?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw this article posted earlier and was going to comment but thought “you know what, this is obviously not HN material, I’ll just flag it”. 12 hours later, loads of upvotes and hundreds of comments. Fine.HN news is discussion about technology, start ups, and creating stupid moral panics to stir up hatred against groups you want to oppress.In this case I actually have first hand experience of this topic, my wife is currently pregnant. Not once have I seen any price of advice or information that in any way has been less useful because of inclusive language. This whole article is attacking a problem - using inclusive language - that only exists if you hate the people being included and don’t want them included. Which apart from being obviously morally repugnant is also something that seems like an odd discussion to have on a tech website. I guess we’re interested in ethics in game journalism again…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s interesting that Lewis Carroll described this battle over language many years ago    ‘When I use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.’

    ‘The question is,’ said Alice, ‘whether you can make words mean so many different things.’

    ‘The question is,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘which is to be master — that’s all.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article’s main point is that AI technology has economic  potential. It goes about this by parodying common arguments against whether such AI can develop into goal-driven beings.One example of such criticism is this five year old piece: https://www.wired.com/2017/04/the-myth-of-a-superhuman-ai/ Few are skeptical about AI technologies’ economic impact. In that sense, the article misses the ball slightly, but it’s so funny that I don’t mind.To state my point in the vein of the article: The bulldozer did change our economy. It does most, if not all, of its productive work in cooperation with a human. Turning a bulldozer on and letting it run by itself is usually a waste, and may be dangerous."</p>

It served over 2,000 libraries, had 330 million titles, and had about a million users. It was efficient enough to run off my laptop, if need be.AFAIK it was one of the top five biggest library systems in the world at the time.I was asked to add some features that would have been too difficult in the old distributed system. Things like reading competitions, recommended reading lists by age, etc…I watched the effect of these changes — which took me mere days of effort to implement — and the combined result was that students read about a million additional books they would not have otherwise.I’ve had a far greater effect on the literacy of our state than any educator by orders of magnitude and hardly anyone in the department of education even knows my name!This was the project that made realise how huge the effort-to-effect ratio that can be when computers are involved…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to grow my own in Australia, as a hobby, patience is the hardest part really. 5-7 years after planting seems to be needed.At one stage I was the northern most producer of truffles (very few produced actually but I only had 40 trees and didn&#39;t really look after them to the utmost detail) in the southern hemisphere, then a guy 150km further north, and in soil that was near total sand, got some to grow. This was totally unexpected.It seems the conditions required are not quite so special as thought, and some totally unsuited conditions (as previously thought) might be good due to reduced competition from other fungi.The action of inoculating trees is simple as well, get a ripe couple of real truffles, blender them up and pour it over the small saplings in pots, if the mycorrhizal sets in you can see it as white bits on the roots. (I think you need two, but not even sure on that).A wide range of trees will work, oak, hazel, cork to name a few. There is a preferred pH range for the soil, as would be expected for all fungi pH has a strong role to play.There has been a lot of secrecy enshrouding the whole game for a long time.I refer only to Tuber melanosporum in the above, I am not sure anyone has been able to get the white truffles growing out of the wild, there will be some special condition or symbiosis with an animal or something that is needed, but not understood yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe 5 years ago I was hanging out with a buddy and we took an angle grinder to an empty propane tank. When we were finished, we smelled uniquely awful. It turns out that added to propane is a tiny amount of the odourant Ethyl Mercaptan. Now when you’re using propane you get just enough of a whiff of it to remind you that you’re using propane, but if you get a smell of the inside of an empty propane tank? Well, something about the liquid propane residue that remains, some miracle of science and chemistry, creates a density of Ethyl Mercaptan that is shocking. Room-fillingly shocking. Clothes throwing away shocking. Many showers worth of shocking.A couple years ago I had my first “truffle” experience with some truffle cheese and was like cutting back into that propane tank. Not the same in scale, but certainly in type. Tremendously similar smells. Since then I’ve been sad and thought I just managed to ruin truffles for myself. This article has given me hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m French and I live in France. Here, most of our truffles are real truffle.We do get some Tuber aestivum as well, but that&#39;s alright because they&#39;re displayed as &#34;truffe d&#39;été&#34;. No harm done.As the article said, the &#34;truffle flavour&#34; has nothing to do with the real stuff, and outside of France, Italy and Spain, you probably won&#39;t get them on the market. You might be lucky in some restaurants all over Europe. But everywhere else it&#39;s propably not the &#34;real&#34; black truffle. Especially, if they put some in ketchup..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"2038 is going to be an interesting year that’s for sure. I’m big into Final Fantasy VII modding/speedrunning and while reverse engineering the game I stumbled upon some code that actually checks if the current date is before 2038. If it’s not it refuses to run. I have no idea why they put this kind of check in the game&#39;s code, I tried to remove it but the game actually still didn’t start so there is probably some issue that prevents it from working when the date overflows.I can only imagine that a lot of other legacy software will have similar issues when we reach year 2038."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s good this came up here.  I just spent the last week or so going through the MaraDNS code base and fixing all of the little Y2038 issues.I know, time_t is 64-bit with pretty much any new Linux distro out there, so why are people seeing Y2038 issues?  It’s because the Windows 32-bit POSIX compatibility layer handles Y2038 very poorly.  Once Y2038 is reached, the POSIX time() call in a 32-bit app fails with a -1.  It doesn’t use a rolling timestamp somewhere in 1901 the way 32-bit Linux applications with 32-bit time_t do.  It fails hard, returning -1 for every call to time().Now, it’s true that Microsoft does have proprietary calls for time and date which are Y2038 compliant, and, yes, native Windows32 apps should use those calls instead of the POSIX ones, but in the real world, it’s sometimes a lot easier to, say, just use stat() to get a file’s timestamp instead of having to use CreateFile() followed by GetFileTime().This is why a lot of Windows apps are still seeing Y2038 issues.In terms of Linux apps, the Y2038 stuff is mainly seen in old 32-bit binary only apps.  Since that stuff is mainly games, where an inaccurate datestamp isn’t a serious issue, I think we will see emulation libraries which give old games a synthetic time and date so they aren’t outside of the Y2038 window.  New apps will use a 64-bit time_t even if compiled as a 32-bit binary."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of us that chuckle at it at this time, this is likely to be far far far bigger than Y2K.  The reason is because software that runs critical aspects of human life will have proliferated to a greater degree when compared to &gt;2000, and &lt;2038.Before 2000, we had software running our systems, yes.  But it was not as distributed, and not as ubiquitous, and not as deeply ingrained into human culture as it is today.  This proliferation will obviously continue past today, and while hardware and low-level OS/software mitigations (as well as a herculean effort to clean up the mess) will make up the gap, it&#39;s not hard to see that this is likely to be much more impactful upon failure because of the &#34;embeddedness&#34; of these systems.A box that has just been doing its thing for 40-50-60 years and all of a sudden fails, is likely to be more impactful than one that was 20-30 years old even."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Learning how to speak chicken is not becoming a chicken. That&#39;s a frequent misconception that borders cultural appropriation. Chickens aren&#39;t just about a few bock-bock and cockle-doodle-doos. They have a rich set of physical expressions as well (flap flaps, head kicks, grating the soil, etc) and a vibrant culture that is transmitted between generations. Their philosophy on death and their capacity to always see life on the sunny-side is both unique and deep, the fruit of seeing their children being picked for food on a daily basis. This should be celebrated. The article completely missed the point on that aspect.Pretending you became a chicken because you&#39;re now performing a few chicken-like sounds is plain wrong, an insult to the poultry community."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; rainbow palette for use in my data visualisations.Indeed for her kind of data the rainbow palette works okay. But if you have to visualize more complex / denser data, beware of the pitfalls of the rainbow color palette. It is not always the best choice.IBM did research back in the 90s on perceptually-based colormaps and how to best represent various types of data within the color dimensions of luminescence, saturation and hue [1]. For example, they found that,(1) Hue was not a good dimension for encoding magnitude information, i.e. rainbow color maps are bad.(2) The mechanisms in human vision responsible for high spatial frequency information processing are luminance channels. If the data to be represented have high spatial frequency, use a color map which has a strong luminance variation across the data range.(3) For interval and ratio data, both luminance- and saturation-varying color maps should produce the effect of having equal steps in data value correspond to equal perceptual steps, but the first will be most effective for high spatial frequency data variations and the second will be most effective for low spatial frequency variations.===[1] the original link got removed from IBMs website.

See: https://www.pstruycken.nl/EnS20.html (A computer program was used to design of the pattern being used in the paintings.)He has created many colour palettes for specific buildings and applications.

Furthermore, our journey to democracy has not been smooth - the last 10 years were marred by massive corruption.Through all of this, our constitutional rights to freedom of expression, and freedom of press, has stayed sound.  We have had multiple instances where journalists reported on some nefarious action and were intimidated or even legally threatened by authorities.  However, our courts have, for the most part, sided with our freedom of expression and press rights.  The South African government has had quite a couple of punches on the nose in our courts ;-).I have read most of the comments in this thread.  I think I understand most of the viewpoints, and I always try and have an open mind.  I am also not an American citizen.  However, like every Earth citizen I have a keen interest (possibly forced...) on USA issues.  &#34;If America sneeze the world catches a cold&#34;.This is clearly a very contentious topic, and I will reply with some specific thoughts on specific comments.  I just wanted to give the perspective of a citizen in a country where this is a serious history of government abuse.  We cannot take these things likely.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a software engineer who works on genomics. I see a lot of negativity in this thread, which mirrors my experience: in most places, you&#39;ll be paid like a researcher with the respect of a lab assistant – unless you have a PhD and a postdoc.That said, it&#39;s possible find work that&#39;s respected and pays well. Most of that kind of work is happening in the context of startups or freelancing. My favorite example of this is Robert Edgar: he&#39;s a freelance computational biologist with over 100k citations who has made a living for the past 20 years by selling licenses to his bioinformatics software (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RzVMRc0AAAAJ).To find those kinds of jobs, I&#39;d try YC&#39;s Work at a Startup, Flagship Pioneering&#39;s portfolio companies, and emailing founders of companies that have a bioinformatics component (my email is in my profile!).I think the issues with the field are because it&#39;s a new and growing space. We do need better tooling, respect for engineering, and established best practices, but that seems to have been the case in the past for other domains that moved from research to industry – including software engineering itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usually, scientific oriented companies or organizations have little regard for software as a domain, craft, etc. It’s just a thing that gets in the way, despite being vital. It’s almost just a utility to them rather than a differentiator and active component of the advanced work going on.For example, the Broad Institute is super interesting, but having applied there several times, they are esoteric, to say the least, in their hiring. They pay well below market, and their process is opaque and slow and sometimes downright non-communicative. They are also not really open to remote work, so you gotta move there and commute to the heart of Cambridge. Budgets are set by folks maybe a couple years out of a PhD program, who will also make technical decisions in terms of the software design (the latter an assumption given my experience in similar places).These organizations are also pretty traditional in their selection of stacks. Good luck trying to use a functional-first  language, aside from maybe Scala (usually lots of Java stacks), and be prepared to write lots of Python, the only language that exists to many scientists. I once saw a Python signature (function name and arguments) spill over 10-20 lines, in a file over 10,000 lines long. They had given up on another software stack because “it wasn’t working for them”.This is all painting with broad strokes, of course. But I think scientific organizations that would embrace software as a major component of their technological and scientific development would do well. There’s a lot of opportunity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked on genomics, at the Broad. Can confirm there is a ton of toxicity. There&#39;s also a lot of smart and great people, if you can find a team specifically dedicated to software I would recommend it. Also the pay is good...for a non-profit.More broadly...shortages like this aren&#39;t because SWEs just love ad-tracking and hate health improvements. People need to be willing to pay for these services (case in point; the jobs link for AWS has 3 links which appear unrelated to genomics, for Microsoft there are 2 for interns, and for Google its empty).There are a lot of opportunities in biotech for SWEs, and many firms (though not all) really do respect the power of software. Worth looking around if you&#39;re interested in the area."</p>

Basically any software released in the 90ies should run easily on the watch.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"MMM deserves all the attention it gets, but there&#39;s more!1. I&#39;ve got to track down the source of the quote (it may be the linked video), but Brooks has said that the most important architectural decision he made was to have an eight bit byte rather than the cheaper 7 bits (Edit: 6 bits) being considered for the IBM 360. To call that influential is an understatement.2. And he has said the most important management decision was sending Ted Codd to graduate school, where Codd laid the foundation for what became relational databases.3. A paper [0] he co-authored with Amdahl and Blaauw introduced the term &#39;architecture&#39; to computer hardware, later borrowed for software. From the first page:  &#34;The term architecture is used here to describe the attributes of a system as seen by the programmer, i.e., the conceptual structure and functional behavior, as distinct from the organization of the data flow and controls, the logical design, and the physical implementation.&#34;He gave an interesting talk at the 50th anniversary of the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) a few years ago, [1][0] &#39;Architecture of the IBM System/360&#39;, Amdahl, Blaauw, Brooks.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StN49re9Nq8"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My one email exchange with Brooks had nothing to do with Mythical Man Month.In the 1990s I was was the junior co-founder and, for a while, main developer of VMD, a program for molecular visualization. I wanted to include molecular surface visualization, but me being me, would rather integrate someone else&#39;s good work.I looked around and found &#34;Surf&#34;, a molecular surface solver written by Amitabh Varshney when he was at the University of North Carolina. (See &#34;Computing Smooth Molecular Surfaces&#34;, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/310720 .)Brooks, you may not know, heard Sutherland talk about using the screen as a window into another world, which got Brooks interested in VR. Back in the 1970s, at UNC, they started experimenting with head-mounted displays. Brooks worked on VR for the rest of his career.The UNC VR group worked on many different VR approaches, including haptic (tactile) feedback. As I recall, the first was a used hydraulic-powered robot arm. People had to wear a lab coat and helmet when using it because it would leak, and had a tendency to hit people.One of the experiments, the NanoManipulator, hooked up the VR and haptic feedback (not that same robot!) to an atomic-force microscope, so people could feel the surface and move nanoscale objects around. http://www.warrenrobinett.com/nano/ .Brooks felt that VR would be very useful for molecular visualization, and developed the GRIP Molecular Graphics Resource. Quoting https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA236598.pdf , some of its early achievements were &#34;the first molecular graphics system on which a protein was solved without a physical model&#34;, &#34;using remote manipulator technology to enable users to feel molecular forces&#34;, and &#34;Real-time, user-steered volume visualization of an electron density map&#34;.As that document points out, their goal was to &#34;wildcat radical new molecular graphics ideas to the prototype stage. Winning ideas are spun off to the thriving commercial industry or into autonomous research projects.&#34;Surf fit very well in those lines, as VMD was an &#34;autonomous research project&#34;.My exchange with Brooks and UNC was 1) to get permission to distribute Surf as part of the VMD distribution, and, 2) a few years later, to provide numbers about how many people had downloaded VMD with Surf."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a previous thread, I had this at &#34;more than 10 years, less than 60&#34; (yeah, that&#39;s an easy bet to make!). The core driver of the sentence is probably the guidelines 2B1.1 table, which scales sentencing levels by economic losses. She was convicted for something like $140MM in fraudulent losses, which by themselves ask for a 24-level escalation (the table maxes out in the mid-40s).By the numbers, the court was probably quite lenient here. Not to say that&#39;s an unjust outcome; the &#34;lenient&#34; option for sentencing on serious federal felonies is still quite harsh.EditI tracked down the prosecutor&#39;s sentencing memorandum; they asked for 15 years. So I guess maybe not that lenient.Later editThe PSR (the court&#39;s own sentencing memorandum, which the prosecution and defense respond to) had Holmes at level 43. I hereby claim that I called this. :PBut the PSR looks at the guidelines level table, which suggests 960 months for level 43, and instead recommends 108 months. So the court imposed a sentence higher than the PSR, lower than the prosecution asked, and all parties asked for much lower than the guideline maximum for the level.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29790880Later later editI&#39;m doing the math wrong; the guidelines range at that level is 240 months per charge (usually served consecutively). Still much higher than the ultimate sentence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maybe I have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Tailscale works, but I always feel like there is a disconnect in how it is received on HN.Usually people are pretty critical/cynical of sending sensitive data to a closed source third party server, no matter how strong their claims of &#39;being the good guys&#39; are (eg see Telegram).But somehow we&#39;re all meant to be happy giving full control of our entire network to a commercial company running a closed source command and control server?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is huge. One of the last major missing features from Tailscale IMO. I maintain a list of tunneling solutions[0]. Personally, I think the future of p2p networking and selfhosting may be through tunneled, SNI-routed TLS connections (exactly what Tailscale just announced). It solves IP exhaustion, NAT, and IP privacy at the cost of an extra hop and no UDP.The big question is going to be pricing. The current top player in this space is Cloudflare Tunnel, which is a loss-leader product that technically forbids selfhosting anything other than HTML sites.Selfhosting media can use tons of bandwidth. Any service that doesn&#39;t charge per GB is incentivized to limit your speeds.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling"</p>

The ingenuity, reliability, polish, and speed of feature delivery are unparalleled in software.I&#39;m eager to get rid of needing DDNS and open ports just for web hooks.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2015 I was working at a &#34;fintech&#34; company and a leap second was announced. It was scheduled for a Wednesday, unlike all others before which had happened on the weekend, when markets were closed.When the previous leap second was applied, a bunch of our Linux servers had kernel panics for some reason, so needless to say everyone was really concerned about a leap second happening during trading hours.So I was assigned to make sure nothing bad would happen. I spent a month in the lab, simulating the leap second by fast forwarding clocks for all our different applications, testing different NTP implementations (I like chrony, for what it&#39;s worth). I had heaps of meetings with our partners trying to figure out what their plans were (they had none), and test what would happen if their clocks went backwards. I had to learn about how to install the leap seconds file into a bunch of software I never even knew existed, write various recovery scripts, and at one point was knee-deep in ntpd and Solaris kernel code.After all that, the day before it was scheduled, the whole trading world agreed to halt the markets for 15 minutes before/after the leap second, so all my work was for nothing. I&#39;m not sure what the moral is here, if there is one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Currently software has to be built to accommodate leap seconds. They happen frequently enough that you&#39;ll find out within a few years whether your software breaks when time suddenly skips forward or backward.If we kick the can down the road such that eventually we&#39;ll need to add a leap minute, we&#39;re going to end up with software that was never written to expect time to change in such a way, hasn&#39;t had a real world test of the change for decades, and will have no one working on the software who ever had to deal with such a change.It&#39;s going to be much worse for software reliability to have a leap minute on the order of once a century than a leap second every few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hot take…Storing anything as UTC was a mistake and we should be using TAI for all storage and computation, only transforming into more human friendly formats for display to end users. This never needed to be a problem except we decided to make it harder to use TAI than UTC and so everything got built up off the backs of legacy bios level hardware supported UTC style clock behaviour, when we should have been using TAI from the start. Yes I know it would have been harder, but we got off our collective asses and decided to fix our short sighted decision making for Y2K date storage, why not this… if it truly costs as much for everyone to endure a leap second why wasn’t it just fixed from the bottom up and rebuilt correctly!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a vegetarian for well over a decade, I&#39;ve always said the same thing. Meat isn&#39;t nearly as egregiously unhealthy as it&#39;s panned if at all. Processed foods, excessive simple carbohydrates and sugars are the main evils in the kitchen, but there are a variety of reasons to eat less meat too.There&#39;s nuance in all of this. People sympathetic to American consumption patterns will probably see science and explanations like this as some kind of endorsement of their diet. Nutritional science is still in its infancy and we&#39;ll be waffling on the specifics for decades to come, especially if food companies have a vested interest in funding studies.Another data point. Just eat minimally processed whole foods as often as possible, diversify your plate and moderate your intake. I think people are too hyper focused on the &#34;super&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; quality of foods and we end up stuck in the margins bike-shedding the minutia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The partisan tone of this article is very grating and makes it hard to take it seriously. It is full of brash, opinionated statements which are not backed up by the actual study [1] the article is based on.I have to conclude that it&#39;s being upvoted here because people enjoy eating red meat and want to continue to do so, not because it has any particular merit on its own terms.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01968-z"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This title seems like clickbait. The linked article seems like mostly blogspam that&#39;s talking about a new meta-analysis with some specific claims, but it also sprinkles in a quote from an unrelated professor that makes some stronger claims.Specifically, the study it leans on most concludes:&gt; We found weak evidence of association between unprocessed red meat consumption and colorectal cancer, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease. Moreover, we found no evidence of an association between unprocessed red meat and ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. We also found that while risk for the six outcomes in our analysis combined was minimized at 0 g unprocessed red meat intake per day, the 95% uncertainty interval that incorporated between-study heterogeneity was very wide: from 0–200 g d−1. While there is some evidence that eating unprocessed red meat is associated with increased risk of disease incidence and mortality, it is weak and insufficient to make stronger or more conclusive recommendations. More rigorous, well-powered research is needed to better understand and quantify the relationship between consumption of unprocessed red meat and chronic disease.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once again I need to poin tout the shocking truth that FTX had no CFO [1]. The CFO&#39;s experience and reputation is waht gives investors and regulators confidence that the financial statements that the CFO literally signs off on are valid.Listed companies on the NASDAQ and NYSE have lots of requirements here (eg internal and external audits). Obviously these don&#39;t apply to FTX but the truly shocking thing here is the likes of Sequoia and other sophisticated investors did not require an adult in the room in the form of a CFO.They literally handed billions of dollars to a 20-something with absolutely no supervision or accountability. I would not be surprised if this lack of oversight doesn&#39;t land them in court from customers and other investors. You may think they are shielded from this through limited liability and corporate structures but that doesn&#39;t innoculate them against tort claims and you could probably make the case they are recklessly negligent or even as far as being liable in conspiracy to commit fraud (before or after the fact).SBF engaged in on-the-record messages with a reporter about this. This is how clueless this man is. He either doesn&#39;t have lawyers or he&#39;s ignoring them as any lawyer will tell you to STFU [2]. No good can come of this ans. SBF and his cohorts are facing the prospect of being on the run for the rest of their lives from US authorities or possibly even spending the rest of their lives in prison.It&#39;s that serious.[1]: https://www.ledgerinsights.com/ftx-warning-signs-no-cfo/[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgWHrkDX35o"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use scientific language models professionally. I skimmed the paper and was immediately disappointed.- They benchmarked against general models like GPT-3 but not well-established  specific models that have been trained for specific tasks like SPECTER[0] or SciBert[1]. Specter outperformed GPT-3 on tasks like citation prediction two years ago. Nobody seriously uses general LLMs on science tasks, so nobody who actually wants to use this cares about your benchmarks. I want to see task-specific models compared to your general model, otherwise whats going to happen is I either need to run my own benchmarks or, much more likely, I shelve your paper and never read it again. If you underperform some that&#39;s fine! If you don&#39;t compare to science-specific models all you&#39;re claiming is that training on science data gives better science results... thats not exactly an impressive finding. Fine-tuning is a separate thing, I get it, but pleeeeeease just give the people what they want.- Not released on huggingface. No clue why not. On the back-end this appears to be based on OPT and huggingface compatible, so I&#39;m really confused.- Flashy website.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love softcore FP (immutability, first-class functions, etc), but I always get the impression that hardcore FP, like in this article, is about reimplementing programming language concepts on top of the actual programming language used.The pipe feels like a block of restricted statements, `peekErr` and `scan` recreate conditionals, the Maybe monad behaves like a try-catch here, etc.Of course there are differences, like `map` working on both lists and tasks, as opposed to a naive iteration. That&#39;s cool. But this new programming language comes with limitations, like the difficulty in peeking ahead or behind during the list iteration, reusing data between passes, and not to mention the lost tooling, like stack traces and breakpoints.I&#39;ve written many (toy) programming languages, the process is exactly like this article. And it feels awesome. But I question the wisdom of presenting all this abstract scaffolding as a viable Javascript solution, as opposed to a Javascripter&#39;s introduction to Haskell or Clojure, where this scaffolding is the language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One take away from functional programming that I have incorporated into my Java (and C#) code: If/When possible, never (ever ever!!!) re-assign a local variable.  (Rare exception: Classic C-style for-loop iteration with mutable `i` integer variable.)  Really, really, I am not trolling / not a joke.  How / Why?  How?  All primative parameter value must be final, e.g., `final iint level`, and local variables must always be final.  Why?  Final vars are significantly easier to &#34;reason about&#34; when reading code, as compared to non-final (mutable) vars.  If you are using containers, always, always, always use immutable containers from Google Guava unless you have an exceptionally good reason.  Yes, the memory overhead will be higher, but big enterprise corps do not care about adding 4/8/16 extra GB RAM to host your Java / C# app.  Yes, I know that any `Object` in Java is potentially mutable.  As a work-around, try to make all `Object`s immutable where possible.  On the surface, the whole thing / exercise feels like a terrible Computer Science nitemare.  In practice, it becomes trivial to convert code from single-threaded to multi-threaded because most of your data classes are already &#34;truly&#34; final."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sure this is a wonderful intellectual exercise in computer science and math, but if this is to be the advertisement in favor of functional programming, I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a customer.You start out with code that will not win any beauty awards but it gets the job done. It&#39;s easy to understand by programmers of any seniority, it&#39;s simple to debug and reasonably easy to put in an automatic unit test.Next, you add all kinds of vague, poorly named meta utilities that don&#39;t seem to solve any tangible real world problem. You even mess with built-in JS methods like map. The code is now harder to understand and more difficult to debug.A massive pain is added for some theoretical purity that few even understand or will benefit from. I&#39;ll double down on my rebellion by stating that the portability of code is overrated.Here we&#39;re writing code to format notification objects. In our overengineering mindset, we break this down into many pieces and for each piece consider reusability outside this context to be of prime importance.Why though? Why not just solve the problem directly without these extra self-inflicted goals? The idea that this is a best practice is a disease in our industry.Most code that is written prematurely as reusable, will in fact never be reused outside its original context. And even if it is reused, that doesn&#39;t mean that outcome is so great.Say that the sub logic to format a user profile link turned out to be needed outside this notification context. Our foresight to have made it reusable in the first place was solid. Now two completely different functional contexts are reusing this logic. Next, the marketing department goes: well actually...you need to add a tracking param specifically for links in the notification context, and only there.Now your &#34;portability&#34; is a problem. There&#39;s various ways to deal with it, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll pick the most complicated one in the name of some best practice.After 20 years in the industry, you know how I would write the logic? A single method &#34;formatNotification&#34;. It wouldn&#39;t weirdly copy the entire object over and over again, it would directly manipulate the object, one piece at a time. Error checking is in the method as well. You can read the entire logic top to bottom without jumping into 7 files. You can safely make changes to it and its intuitive to debug. Any junior would get it in about 2 minutes.Clear, explicit code that requires minimum cognitive parsing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worked for AWS for just under a year and a half; this mirrors my experience exactly.Poorly designed, failure-prone, brittle internal tooling was a time and energy sink to the point where even the most trivial deployment change was a nail-biter. Automated tooling and tests that were ostensibly created to make life easier were the number one pain point and constantly failed in obscure ways that required cutting tickets to teams responsible for the automation.More often than not these tickets would be ignored and issues would persist for weeks beyond what&#39;s reasonable.I&#39;d actually force myself to write even trivial code on weekends to ensure my ability to develop didn&#39;t atrophy as a result of lack of use.That, paired with the awful corporate culture and constant fear of PIP/job loss forced me to finally leave.Generally a very unpleasant experience all around, sans the compensation and name on the resume."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; but also a job that made me feel more unhappy than any other job I’ve ever had.I can relate. I worked for many years for one &#34;those&#34; companies that is a household name. The pay wasn&#39;t outstanding, and the job was not one that gave me much fulfillment, but it was at a marquee brand. My business card opened a lot of doors.When that job finally ended (after almost 27 years), I started looking at working for other companies. I would have been a particularly good fit for startups, as I was financially secure (thus, didn&#39;t need to be paid too much), and have a huge arsenal of skills and experience, that can be quite useful to any small outfit that has &#34;many hats&#34; employees.What I found, is that us older folks are quite unpopular, and got tired of slamming doors and passive-aggressive insults.So I just decided that I was in early retirement.Best decision I ever made.I would have liked having the extra money, but the soul-sucking aspect would have probably killed me, by now.I am in a good position. I have enough set aside to be OK, but not at an exorbitant level, and I get to write awesome code every single day. It&#39;s basically, my &#34;dream job.&#34;I feel terrible for over-leveraged young folks, having to deal with this kind of thing, early on. I feel even worse, for the ones that have &#34;crossed over&#34; into &#34;old,&#34; and are still over-leveraged. They won&#39;t feel old, but they will be treated as such.It&#39;s really humbling and infuriating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience has been similar at other large companies (MSFT, Google). My advice is to look for founder-led teams (not companies). If there are plenty of founders still on the team, they will likely care a lot about the product and code and hold everyone to high standards which make the work easier in the long run. On the other hand when I&#39;ve been on teams where all the original founders left, it&#39;s been a constant struggle to make anyone care about anything. At that point there is no ownership and most people are there for a paycheck. Lots of sloppy code gets shipped, everyone approves anything that looks like code, and eventually adding a single line anywhere feels like playing Russian roulette. Extreme short term thinking takes hold and no one cares that in 2-3 years the code will be unmaintainable because they don&#39;t plan to be on the team by then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He&#39;s got Granny Smith in the shit category, and this just reminds me of a funny story about dogs!We had two corgis and my wife made all their meals by hand. Part of their diet was apples, but we found one of the corgis would almost always eat around the apple (usually just a cheap red apple) pieces and leave them for the other dog. Then one time Granny Smith apples were cheaper at the grocery store so that is what we purchased and provided. He ate them up!Turns out the dog just didn&#39;t like the sweeter apples and wanted the tart tang of a good Granny Smith."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now this is the kind of important tech/nerd info that I come to HN for! 10/10Notes:I&#39;m only familiar with several of the varieties on this page, but I definitely agree with the rankings. We used to buy Gala, Fuji or Juici, since there were the cheapest at the store and we didn&#39;t know better, but once we tried Honeycrisp we never went back. (Cosmic Crisp also ok but not as good. I&#39;d also rank Envy a bit lower.)Also, best cider I&#39;ve had is from Honeycrisp apples.Red/Golden Delicious are tasteless garbage. Granny Smith is ok for particular dishes so I&#39;d probably rank it a bit higher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once spent a month blind taste-testing apples with my wife to compare the apples in our supermarket.  We learned 4 things:1) Most of the Honeycrisp varietals that make it to market are good (Wild Twist and Cosmic Crisp being our favorites), but…2) The time of year makes a HUGE difference.  It seems obvious when I say it, but different varietals from different farms are best in different weeks.  Honeycrisp has an advantage here because it has so many growers that someone is keeping a batch in good condition for practically every week of the year.3) You have to go by the apples in your local market. Lists like these are hard to use because there are many more apples on it than you have available to choose from - most grocery stores only stock 3-10 varieties depending on time of year4) Your use case is critical. Obviously baking a pie requires a different apples from eating, but even if you are just eating the apples raw there are differences.  Some apples beat others in texture when cut up, but have the wrong density to eat by biting down on the appleAfter all our testing, we mostly went back to Honeycrisp because it’s so reliable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an improvement within the current paradigm of &#34;big ag&#34;, but IMHO tech is opening the possibility of a completely different way of doing things. For example, this comment which is below the linked video imagines a robot-maintained food forest, I think it&#39;s on point because I, too, believe that the future is swarms of small robots rather than a few big tractors:&gt; Imagine, a few years down the line, applying these principles to maintaining an edible polyculture ecosystem-farm. Not necessarily a big machine going through a flat field, but small drones tending to trees, vines, herbs, plants, pollinators and water features all in the location that is best for them based on local features. It could micromanage weeding and harvesting, but also composting, planting, grafting and nurturing keystone species and rare species while avoiding pesticide, nitrogen imbalance and soil compaction. A productive farm could look like the garden of Eden."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I see stuff like this sometimes I get depressed that I&#39;m building apps that just move little bits of information around the web and don&#39;t have any real demonstrable value to the world.How hard is the jump into the realm of computer vision/AI/robotics for someone with strong skills and experience building web applications? Is the coding much different? Is a company like this employing math/theroy-heavy people to develop new types of AI or are they working higher up the stack and just need people who can pipe data around?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like it should hoe each weed instead of spraying it. I guess that&#39;s a little harder to do. Maybe a lot harder.Two other things I thought were interesting in the video. One, the idea of mapping the whole field is pretty cool. There must be useful things you could do with a millimeter-scale 3D map of an entire field. Two, this is happening in California, just a few hours&#39; drive from Silicon Valley. I hope some of the engineers laid off recently find work in ag tech, because there will be huge opportunities coming with the rise of computer vision and (hopefully soon) robotics."</p>

Having said that, he really made it obvious to me as an eng that the severance is the option I would be taking.  Going &#34;hardcore&#34; on things can be fun, at the right time in your life, for the right reasons, with the right people.

So I did it for them with aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and now the key is useless:Hilarious.  Infosys is a known &#34;mass recruiter&#34; in indian colleges.  WITCH (Wipro, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, HCL) companies is where talent goes to die.  No competent employee stays in those companies (from what I&#39;ve witnessed).  Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg, because putting people with 6-12 months of programming / computer &#34;experience&#34; (that they only signed up for because of the money) in charge of major production systems is a recipe for disaster."</p>

If someone did the same based on a different attribute of a population, they&#39;d be banned.I&#39;ve worked at one of these companies but left over a decade ago. I know how we&#39;re looked at when we do client work (part of why I left). Some of my colleagues were less competent, true. But, some will wipe the floor with the client employees we did the work for.To WITCH employees: 
If you are an employee at one of these companies, remember you are not the worst. Many of you come from humble backgrounds and are just learning the ropes. The world is cruel. It is a tough place, and you will be discriminated against. This is your fuel. You&#39;ve already made great strides; keep going. You have to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I applaud any bad press on InfoSys.
I picked up contract gig through them a few years ago. Here are some of the takeaways from my short lived experience: 
 - It took them over two weeks to send me a computer.
 - They cancelled PTO for everyone. (this was the most egregious single thing they did)
 - They had absolute worst internal site for accessing HR documents and accessing personal resources. Just a maze of links. You could only access it via Internet Explorer (I swear I&#39;m not joking). Everything took forever to load. It was like stepping back into 1997.
 - When I gave my 2 week notice, they refused and said I &#39;owed&#39; them at least a month. LOL not sure how they think they can control people like that. I gleefully told them to &#39;deal with it&#39;. This happened about 45 days after I started as it became obvious very quickly how bad this company treats people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was delighted when my book showed up on Z-library!  I of course was never paid for authoring that book; indeed I paid a subvention to publish it with Harvard University Press. At some point, the rights were sold to the giant publisher Brill, which was charging $30  per chapter for a book that has no value by chapter.Luckily, some kind soul at University of Marburg   uploaded it and   Library Genesis still has it.https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/141915/https://libgen.is/search.php?req=Joshua%20Fox&amp;column[]=autho..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me and my colleagues will be affected by the end of Z library and co related projects.Here in Brazil and for sure in most second and third world countries, people don&#39;t have money to spend in books.You can argue that people can go to the library, but in most cases it&#39;s even expensive to take a bus or taxi even a Uber.I&#39;m a law student at an university in brazil. Law books are really expensive. 
Even though my university have a library, sometimes it doesn&#39;t have the books that the professors ask us to read.Since I found z library I could have access to most of books that I needed.I do know that the writers and publishers have costs and they need to make money, but I don&#39;t agree with the fact that we have to pay to have knowledge. It&#39;s more like if we don&#39;t have money, we can&#39;t have knowledge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this won&#39;t be a popular take on HN, but while I can understand and to a certain extent sympathize with pirating movies (the intentional friction and arbitrary geographic limitations on access imposed by the multinational movie-industry conglomerates), I can&#39;t see stealing some poor author&#39;s work in the same light.Sure, people get hung-up about DRM (which can easily be removed by widely-accessible tools), but e-books can be purchased pretty much anywhere in the world. I&#39;m in Sweden but buy most of my e-books from the US. But often buy books directly from publishers (hopefully they, and the author, get a better cut that way).The fact these people were trying to personally profit (some other HN:ers have documented this), while trying to present themselves as some sort of &#34;information wants to be free&#34; info-warriors doesn&#39;t make the whole thing any better.An enormous amount of work goes into producing a book - through a close friend who works in book-publishing I know a couple of authors who pretty much starve for a year or two to produce their work - and then the editing, typesetting, designing, proof-reading etc is all an enormous and personal investment.In spite of what people think, authors are not all budding J.K.Rowlings with movie-deals and a couple of billion in the bank, and if we don&#39;t buy their books, they won&#39;t be able to produce the next one for people to pirate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Most news accounts seem to portray the scale of the bankruptcy as relatively small.This is a key point.They lost $16B in customer deposits.LTCM lost $4.6B in investor funds.Enron lost $11B in shareholder capital.Interestingly, while Madoff is widely quoted as having lost $65B, that was almost all fabricated paper wealth, actual losses were around $18B and $14.4B of that was recovered and returned.All of these situations are obviously somewhat different, but if what we&#39;re starting to hear is correct, FTX may be one of, if not the, biggest financial frauds/scandals in history.  The media doesn&#39;t seem to be treating it as such."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before or after they were bribing politicians for favourable regulation for FTX at the detriment of their competitors who were not fraudulent?https://prospect.org/power/sam-bankman-frieds-multimillion-d...&gt; Crypto’s supporters in Congress are determined to ignore the massive gap in capacity between the two agencies; in fact, they likely understand that its incapacity is part of its appeal to FTX. A bill proposed by Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) seeks to grant the CFTC “exclusive jurisdiction over any agreement, contract, or transaction involving a contract of sale of a digital asset that is offered, solicited, traded, executed, or otherwise dealt in interstate commerce, including market activities relating to ancillary assets.” Perhaps in anticipation of such a move, FTX has stocked up its ranks with former CFTC officials. Former CFTC commissioner and acting chair Mark Wetjen is FTX’s head of policy and regulatory strategy. Ryne Miller, who was legal counsel to Gensler when he led the CFTC, is FTX’s general counsel. The Tech Transparency Project has also identified 14 other cases of CFTC alumni revolving into the crypto industry.Vote these people out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article spends quite a bit of time talking about SBF&#39;s risk appetite and how it might be drug related. I think that&#39;s missing a fairly obvious piece of logic.In order to decide to go into crypto trading you need to have an extremely high tolerance for risk. The crypto industry is self-selected for risk in the first place, you don&#39;t need complex explanations of why they use lots of leverage on highly volatile assets, that&#39;s literally the reason why they&#39;re there. If SBF had a low appetite for risk he wouldn&#39;t have entered crypto or started a start up, he would have stayed in trad-fi getting paid massive sums of money for some fairly basic quant work. It&#39;s not that Sam has a high risk appetite, it&#39;s that in order to get into the position Sam was in you need a high risk appetite.And that obviously poses a big problem for people who want to use a crypto exchange - because they can only find exchanges run by people with a massive risk appetite making it likely to blow up in your face."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Building and selling macOS apps is a pretty good niche to be in right now.I escaped my stressful corporate job 1 year ago and I’ve been living comfortably since then from app revenue only.I’m making between $3.5k and $9k per month with https://lunar.fyi/ and the smaller apps I create at https://lowtechguys.com/It’s not much for some parts of the world.  But I’m well enough from this that I even took the time to build a small calendar app (https://lowtechguys.com/grila) from which all the funds will go to my brother’s college costs so he can stop working 12h/day jobs.Before this I tried creating paid web services but none took off. I realized I actually don’t use any indie web product after 8 years of professional coding. I’m only using web products from big companies like Google, fly.io, Amazon etc.Desktop apps on the other hand, most that I use and love are made by single developers.With the ascent of Apple Silicon, and the ease of SwiftUI, this has the potential of bringing a modest revenue while also being more fulfilling than a corporate job.In case you’re curious how the code looks for something like that, here’s a small open-source app that I built in a single (long) day, which has proven to be useful enough that people want to pay for it: https://github.com/alin23/Clop"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coding pairs well and elevates many other side-hustles, I think.Nearly every job can benefits from automation, and if it can&#39;t, then the logical thinking that coding requires will improve it in some way.I paired coding with fiction writing and made a scifi podcast, which now represents 10% of my monthly income after two years!I wrote up my experience and advice here, if you&#39;re interested in the details https://www.0atman.com/articles/21/make-fiction-podcast"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The thought of returning to corporate working kind of disgusts me. daily meetings, middle management bs, politics, bureaucracy... im sure your familiar with the typical complaints.Have you considered working in a company that isn&#39;t like that?Things to look for:* Ownership: The owner should be the person running the business.* Size: Fewer than 20 employees. Ideally two or three; consider being the first.* Revenue: A reasonably stable revenue stream lets you take on mid-long term projects. Ad revenue from a niche content business is quite good here."</p>

It’s not just Wikipedia. There are grants that goto volunteers to increase editorship/authorship of non English Wikipedia or in countries and culture where Wikipedia does not have as many articles.Calling this culture wars and simply saying “the money doesn’t goto hosting” is low complexity thinking that fails to account for all the things the foundation does."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I diagnosed when I was like... 8 years old. From then to 17 I was on various meds, finally gave them all up. So for about 22 years I&#39;ve coped with ADHD without meds. I am a Staff Engineer and make a good living, respected in my field.Regardless of anything else, I think the key thing to remember about ADHD is that you do not need to be a high-performing human being, at all, in life. You will forget things and get distracted and not get as much done. So what. You are still intelligent and caring and dedicated and responsible and a hard worker. You probably put more effort in (when you get around to it) than many others without the condition. And you will do about as well as everyone else, on average. And this is fine. Do not put pressure on yourself to live up to what someone else can do. Only do what you can do, in your time, and be at peace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This short scene from Malcolm in the Middle is the best explanation I&#39;ve found of ADHD as an adult: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0He tries to turn on the light, the bulb is dead, unscrews it, then as he&#39;s getting the bulb the shelf in the cabinet it&#39;s in is loose.He gets a screwdriver to fix the cabinet, but the rails on the drawer the screwdriver&#39;s in are squeaky. He gets some WD-40 to fix that, but the can of WD-40 is empty. He then gets in the car, which refuses to start.Then his wife gets home, and he&#39;s underneath the car covered in motor oil. &#34;Hal, did you replace that light bulb in the kitchen?&#34; &#34;WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I&#39;M DOING?!&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was diagnosed last year at 35. I&#39;ve tried and failed to launch my own projects since I was 13.I was a classic adhd child, at a time when diagnosis and treatment was rare.Children whose dopamine regulation issues are treated early can leave medication as their brain adjusts while still plastic.In adulthood you&#39;re stuck. I&#39;ve battled addiction, terrible damage to relationships and failure to achieve my full happiness potential.Founding a company is extra hard.I&#39;m glad I&#39;m medicated now. The result has been life changing and profound.The more we talk, treat and exercise compassion about this horrible neurological disorder the better.It isn&#39;t like a broken leg or depression, the symptoms are varied and express in complex ways.Thank you to anyone talking about this with kindness and compassion"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, there it is. I was wondering when this would happen.Facebook used to be involved with the Mercurial community, but it was difficult to work with them. They always wanted to do things their way, had their own intentions, and started to demand that the Mercurial project work the way that Facebook wanted. For example, they demanded that we start using Phabricator and started slowly removing sequential revisions from Mercurial in favour of always using node hashes everywhere, arguing that for their gigantic repos, sequential revisions were so big as to be useless.Eventually the disagreements were too great, and Facebook just stopped publicly talking about Mercurial.I figured they would emerge a few years later with their fork of it. They love doing this. HipHop VM for PHP, Apache Hive, MyRock; these are examples of Facebook forking off their development in private and then later emerging with some thing they built on top of it.The Mercurial project is surprisingly still chugging along, and there are still those of us who actually use Mercurial. I doubt I&#39;ll switch over to Sapling, because I disagreed with the things that made Facebook fork off in the first place. But if others like Sapling and this manages to put the slightest dent into the git monoculture, I&#39;m happy for the change and innovation. I really hope that git is not the final word in version control. I want to see more ideas be spread and that people can see that there can be a world beyond git."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank god.I have been waiting ten years (https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stevebennett.me/2012/02...) for someone to develop a better CLI for git, someone with the scale and clout to do it well and gain mindshare. It&#39;s not that useful to learn a new workflow if no one you ever work with will be familiar with it.This looks incredible. A simple command to uncommit or unamend makes you further realise what a disaster the Git CLI is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a big fan of FB as a company, but I think their open source work is pretty impressive. Various other large companies have the problem of giant monorepos that they constantly need to onboard new developers to, but I can&#39;t think of anyone other than FB who consistently released their solutions.Sure, most people are probably fine with Git once they learned it and if they only work with small to mid sized code bases (like me). But I&#39;m still happy Sapling is out there, I might use it or learn from it if I ever run into the problems it solves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Physical books wear out in decades to centuries, computers break in years to decades. Also digital formats are constantly evolving and backwards compatibility for old formats is removed. Even without publisher/legal issues it&#39;s clear that preservation of digital media for even the next 10 years, and especially for the next 100 or 1000, is at risk.But I really wonder why is there no other major service like the Internet Archive? The way to preserve media is to distribute it and store it in many places, not just one central location. Does the Internet Archive store redundant copies in many locations? Does it use long-term physical formats?Also, figuring out what information is &#34;meaningful&#34; and which is completely useless or redundant is extremely important. Because we want to store everything with the potential to be important in the future, but we also have an incredible amount of data (hence one of the reasons why IA is the only major archiver). It may be good to strategize data collection, e.g. a shallow list of all sources and a deeper list of popular sources, a sample of various sources from every region, etc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Ever try to read a physical book passed down in your family from 100 years ago?  Probably worked well.No, it worked terribly because they hadn&#39;t been stored well and were covered in mold (even the ones from only 70 years ago) or otherwise falling apart. I couldn&#39;t search them for specific phrases I remembered my grandfather reading me as a child, and I didn&#39;t have the physical space of my own to store them all either anyway. Even making a stab at indexing them all was enormously labor intensive. I was the only one in the family interested in even trying. It really sucked.&gt;Ever try reading an ebook you paid for 10 years ago? Probably a different experience.Yes, it was excellent, since naturally it was DRM-free or I wouldn&#39;t have paid for it. I have digital stuff from the 80s, still perfectly preserved, that I can call up as I wish, when I wish, anywhere I wish anywhere in the world.I&#39;m 100% onboard with the correct argument that modern copyright and DRM go against the core bargain of IP (societal agreement for public benefit) and could use major reform. But I don&#39;t think this piece does a very good job of making that argument, the entire comparison and pretending that books don&#39;t require any sort of preservation and so on really distracts from the core issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DRM-laden digital books should be seen like the extra cheap paperbacks which fall apart sitting untouched on the shelf after a couple of years. Extremely different than the well-bound books one might think of when handling a 100 year old book.Non-DRM&#39;d ebooks in formats which are open, easily parseable, and that people care to archive should be fine for a long time. Some people here are talking about a decade as if we won&#39;t be able to parse epubs or text files in 10 years. I&#39;ve got documents &gt;30 years old already which are still easily parsed, and I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll have problems rendering them in another 30 years.I&#39;ll be utterly amazed if we can&#39;t render a basic HTML document, text-focused PDF, or hell even just ASCII text in the year 2032. I also have little doubt I&#39;ll still technically be able to load my DVDs or Blu-Rays of that data in 2032 and copy it into the holographic crystal storage devices that&#39;ll come out just before that."</p>

I do know that apps tend to convert better, if only we could bridge that gap.It&#39;s in particular troubling how much of this madness we&#39;ve internalized to just accept. The idea that you need to resubmit a 100 apps because Google decided you need to target a different internal version number is insane. It would be very bad if the SDK had a breaking change, but in this case it&#39;s just busy work: upping a number and resubmitting.And what about the rule to be able to report user generated content? Who the hell is Google to interfere on such app-specific functionality? What if my moderation workflow would only allow draft posts, each manually approved, making reporting them pointless? Does Google actually check if a report gets sent or followed up? I don&#39;t think so. So it&#39;s an invasive power grab, and then poorly regulated.These platforms and gatekeepers have become far too powerful and leveled up the arrogance that comes with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any large group representing App developers that could manage the large-scale negotiation and legal wrangling required to force Apple and Google to be more helpful when rejecting legitimate applications?When I worked in Google (Ads, then later in Recommendations for Play and youtube) people often said this was intention to avoid teaching spammers how to get around the rules.  But it&#39;s clear there are enough legitimate developers acting in good faith who are trying to change their applications without significant guidance that it seems entirely reasonable for a large-scale group negotiation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was just on the ground coordinating with 4 friends that got buried in 5+ foot of unexpected snow  in the mountains (forecast said 1&#34;-2&#34; when they went up) for the rifle opener in Montana. I wound up getting sick so I stayed home (hilariously I was the only one who got an elk) but I sent them up with my InReach.All I can say is THANK GOD that I did, because it turned into over a week long effort to get them out. Two decided to walk out and were able to text me a nav point that I was able to meet them at (took all day to get there because of the snow and mud, but I made it and was able to pick them up). The other two stayed up there, and we sent probably 100 texts back and forth coordinating what turned into like 3 solid days of fighting to get up there with snowcats and get them back down. Multiple situational changes that we would have been hosed without.In the end, I spent like $80 on texts, but it was money well spent. I think it&#39;s great for people to have SOS built into their iPhone, but there needs to be a &#34;use it now, pay later&#34; or no one is going to activate it and actually have it available when they need it. The other half of the equation is that you really need to be able to send texts. The SOS button is very expensive. Extremely expensive. That will keep a lot of people from using it. (Yes insurance exists, but hardly anyone has it). Being able to text your friends for help is substantially more useful. Being stuck on a backroad with no service, 5, 10, 20 miles from where anyone can be expected to drive by is a far more common scenario than breaking your leg at the top of a mountain and needing to be evacuated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Set backcountry search and rescue aside for a second.Seems to me this is for ordinary people doing ordinary things outside cell range, and finding they need help. A family member has a heart attack. A collision with a moose. Who knows what.Less “should’ve brought water and a jacket” and more “we’ve been on route 9 for two hours, a moment ago everything was fine, now he’s not breathing, we have no bars, and we have no idea where the nearest hospital is.”Besides, even if this feature only saves a single life, seems worth it to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a Paramedic in Northern California and am VERY happy about this feature. Even in some of our SF Bay Area counties, we have a lot of windy mountain roads with no cell service at all. Our portable radios don&#39;t even work up in the hills. To have an iPhone be able to send GPS location to the public safety access point is fabulous. Our dispatchers can at least drop a pin on a map and we can route to that location ourselves. This already happens in a lot of cases but the caller has cell service. We&#39;ve been on multiple incidents up in the hills where people have reported that they had to drive several miles down the mountain before they were able to get any reception to make a 911 call.This will save us a lot of time, and it will save lives. This is a game changing feature."</p>

And that’s to say nothing of Analogue or the MiSTer project, creating full FPGA reimplementations of the hardware.It’s a really cool example of what some very creative and passionate people can do with commodity technology. The only downside is it’s actually becoming quite pricey to get original hardware."</p>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_airline_(hobby)Not just the first VA, but one of the first few people in the VA. I was tasked with &#34;designing&#34; aircraft for use with our VA. When FS5 came out, you could modify the looks as well, so I&#39;d get the flight dynamics as close as I could and another guy would build the model of how it looked. I forget what that package was called, now. But it was a lot of fun. I don&#39;t think any of us had an idea that VA&#39;s would turn into a Thing.

If you treat PayPal like a bank, you will have a bad time.Almost all horror stories you hear about PayPal involve the user treating PayPal like they were a bank. Just do not store money in PayPal... sweep nightly if you use PayPal for business. They even provide tools to make this automated.The reason this policy exists is likely to remove super old liabilities for long-dormant accounts that have been long forgotten about.PayPal is not interested in storing funds forever... they want you to buy stuff with it or transfer it to your real bank account.This policy seems aimed at convincing people to &#34;move it or lose it&#34;..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paypal has always loved keeping money they didn&#39;t earn.  They should be treated like a crypto exchange: never keep your funds with them, only use them to transact then move funds away (if no other alternatives available)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have only ever used paypal to pay for things with a credit card. I was tricked into having the account at all by a fraudlent and misleading UI built by ebay and that&#39;s the only reason I had it in the first place. I did use it to pay for some things so I guess their plan worked.Paypal recently, after a decade or so of use, demanded I hand over multiple forms of ID. I refused and said close the account. They refuse to close the account because I have not handed over ID documents that I don&#39;t want them to have on their files because they are untrustworthy both ethically and in terms of competence as you guys know well.So the account is there ready to be hacked. I&#39;ve pointed this out to them on about 20 separate occasions and they refuse to close it.Paypal are crooks. It is in their dna. They&#39;re crooks for no reason, just from force of habit. You cannot trust them in any way. Society allowing them to have any market power whatsoever is completely insane. Yet another case of a cpu attached to a network being on the critical path of what some company is doing preventing otherwise intelligent humans from thinking a normal, critical fasshion about what they are doing and forming a minimally appropriate response, trapping the rest of us who literally cannot act at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Forgive my ignorance but it seems that one major problem with crypto-exchanges is that they don&#39;t necessarily have any assets other than the crypto that has been deposited there, which means all overheads (which I am assuming for some of these guys is $Ms/year) can only come from trading crypto unless they are charging reasonable money for the privilege of using their exchanges.In the FIAT world, banks make tonnes of money from things like loans and mortgages so they can handle some risk by holding onto cash.If this is true, how does it get fixed? Is there any reason someone would take out a loan in crypto and pay interest on the repayments?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pardon for living under a rock, but why are crypto exchanges affected by the mood in the crypto market?I thought that a crypto exchange functions like a currency market: I put an offer to sell 10,000 EUR for 1 BTC and someone else puts an offer to buy 10,000 EUR for 1 BTC. When orders cross, a transaction happens and the exchange gets a fee, whether in currency or crypto units.What are crypto exchanges fundamentally doing differently that they are suddenly losing money?Surely a drop in transactions would make them lose fees and require them to fire some staff, but I expected a &#34;Facebook-like&#34; downsizing, not a full-blown bankruptcy.What am I missing?"</p>

These are written manuscripts of african scholars which are hundreds of years old, and still exist today. Some record the history of great west african civilizations along with other things they studied (e.g. science, religion, math, literature, ect). I was never taught this history even existed but yet was made to learn the various details about asian, european, middle eastern, central/south american history. This, and the attempts to destroy/steal these manuscripts at various points in history, made it click how serious power of controlling information, and ultimately influencing beliefs can be, with respect to giving legitimacy to the various rulers/authorities.

I happened to randomly change isinf to std::isinf (it’s a random habit of mine to put std:: in front of these C functions). Suddenly the regression disappeared!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that this piece really got me thinking about is how many other crypto companies are the same ponzi scheme because they are counting made-up things as assets on their balance sheet.In other words, suppose I create token SCAMMER, and I say its supply will be capped at 1 million tokens (or 10 million, or 100 million - that&#39;s the &#34;nice&#34; thing about crypto, I can kinda choose whatever number I want), and then I&#39;m able to sell 10 of those tokens for $100 each. According to FTX math, I now have $99,999,000 of assets on my balance sheet, but of course if I actually tried to sell a lot of my &#34;kept&#34; tokens I would tank the SCAMMER price.Even better, and I think what is probably more common in the crypto industry: suppose I get my buddy to create a SUX2BEU token. I tell my buddy I&#39;ll by 10 SUX2BEU tokens for $100 each if he buys 10 of my SCAMMER tokens for $100 each. Now suddenly we can both say we have huge assets on our balance sheets! Until, of course, someone decides to pull aside the curtain covering the wizard.So many ponzi schemes on top of ponzi schemes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often joke that crypto has been run by gold bugs who were forced to &#34;smoke the whole pack&#34; on fiat currencies. So a lot of crypto is a nihilistic homage to federal reserve systems.In that way, &#34;DeFi&#34; feels the same about the finance industry.It was no secret that SBF hated traditional finance. And so I assume he refused to learn anything from it. But what he ended up creating was almost a hilarious parody of the financial system.That&#39;s at least how I can square the circle about how someone who could criticize Lehman Brothers for letting themselves get overleveraged on shady asset classes could literally have negative 8 billion dollars in &#34;Hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@’ account&#34; and then publicly go to Twitter to say they have a &#34;liquidity problem&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow! It is great to see another low code, open source platform being launched. I’ve been involved with open source for over 25 years, and I am a big believer in the power of open source to accelerate development and empower people all over the world to build amazing things. I have built a career on OSS, and millions of others have as well. It is a game changer.In full transparency, I am the Head of DevRel at Appsmith, which is an alternative tool to Open Blocks, and a source for some of Open Block’s code (https://github.com/openblocks-dev/openblocks/search?q=appsmi...).However, that is not really what I want to discuss here.As long as I have been involved in open source, I have dealt with FUD about OSS from investors, executives, and business people who don’t “get it”. These folks have usually been highly resistant to open sourcing code or making contributions because they think it will hurt the business. “Why would I want to share code that can be used to compete against us?” This could even apply to a young engineer or maintainer of a growing open-source project who’s deciding to startup and thinking whether to build an OSS company.We have seen a huge boom in open source business models, and this is a GREAT thing. But, what can we do to ensure that we don’t prove the naysayers right?My concern is that as we see a rise in competition among open source businesses, we will also see a rise in competitive businesses (open source and proprietary) that use previous work to accelerate their advantage… which is one of the central features to open source.But, in theory, open source also has advantages for those who provide code - attribution, contribution, funding, shared resources, etc. There are also different licensing models that have strengths and weaknesses. We decided to go with a permissive license so that people can use Appsmith in all environments, and sometimes this works against us because competitors can build on top of Appsmith. But hey, that’s the nature of the game right?So - what can we or should we do as a community to ensure that open source business models can be successful without tarnishing the reputation of open source in general? Should we be more clear with attribution? Should we partner and make shared libraries for common functionality? Maybe do nothing? What do you think?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m horrified by so many of the comments here that seem to lack even the most basic of human decency. Allow me to fill people in for those who have never uprooted your life and moved across the world for a job. It is a massive commitment on the part of the employee, where you sell the majority of your earthly possessions, property, cars, etc. Then you go through an immigration process which even if its handled by FAANG involves a ton of work. You get to the new country, find a place to live and start to adjust.So to do that to someone and then days later be like &#34;we actually don&#39;t want you&#34; is beyond shitty. This persons visa is dependent on their employment so now they get to go into a city they don&#39;t know and try desperately to find employment with an employer who is interested in sponsoring someone from abroad (which is a small fraction of the total employers).For all you budding Elons, here&#39;s a shorthand for it. If you ask someone to move across the world and don&#39;t need them anymore, give them three months on the books to find somewhere else that don&#39;t count against their visa. It will give them a chance to get settled and go on interviews. Or don&#39;t recruit internationally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many commenters here (presumably US/CA citizens) don&#39;t realize that the gut-wrenching feeling of being laid off whilst your visa depends on uninterrupted employment is _nothing_ like the SHTF-but-all&#39;s-ok feeling of being laid off &#39;regularly&#39;.In the USA, for most work visas, you are given a 60 day death clock pleasantly sugarcoated as a &#39;grace period&#39; to find a new employer or leave the country. Cue trying weave in that baggage in between screening calls &amp; technical interviews to explain to prospective employers how you have 47 days and 15 hours left to be hired or leave. The complication of dealing with USCIS and attaining a work visa (usually bound to your employer) is a marathon even with unlimited time, but in a puny 8 week window?...In my own experience this also happened in mid 2021 when Australia&#39;s borders were closed (to AU citizens as well...) so leaving back home wasn&#39;t even an option."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imho the real question here is, why is it that Meta keeps hiring right right until they do large layoff rounds?The kind of issue that requires large layoff rounds is not something that just materializes overnight, out of the blue.So why does their management - which should be able to read the writing on the wall, since that&#39;s part of their job - not issue a strict hiring freeze (in addition to other measures taken to try and avoid/reduce the impeding layoffs).Why do they go from hiring to firing in the blink of an eye?"</p>

So far, so good.We are still not anti-vax at all. In fact, I might go for my next booster today.The one thing that angers me is that this incident cost us $10K.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most persuasive argument for Apple as trustworthy on  privacy was weak: that because they didn’t monetize data as rapaciously as Google or Meta, there was less incentive for them to spy on users.But once they introduced new privacy controls, they seemed to suddenly start investing more seriously in their own advertising network. That, and the encryption slight-of-hand with iCloud, makes the cynic’s case for them.App telemetry, metrics, etc might get handwaved away with a sinister phrase, like “essential for improving user experience.” But placing trust in a company on privacy due to the relative lack of financial incentive seems hopelessly naive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple will probably get away with that as it is all in the fine print. But,1. Let&#39;s not forget vast majority ( if not all ) of people on the Internet, inclusive but not limited to Main-steam Media, HN, Reddit and Twitter who commented between 2017 and 2021 thought privacy meant anonymous. And before anyone disagree, very very few on HN even bother to downvote or stand up against the notion of privacy meant anonymous.2. Apple play this card, both in PR and marketing, along with media ( Submarine Article or not ) as a tool against Facebook. Or Social Media but let&#39;s be honest we all know they mean Facebook. And of course, for people from US, after 2016 Facebook is the most evil company on planet earth. Any Facebook bashing equals great.3. A lot of people were brought into the idea of privacy meant anonymous. So in other settings, Apple use the word &#34;personalised&#34; instead of Data Collection, cough, I mean tracking.4. The good thing about all of these, anything illogical will have to unfold some day. ( Just like Crypto ) Apple of course collect Data from you. Apple of course has all the Data about your usage pattern. So when some people came to realise privacy doesn&#39;t mean anonymous, I guess they aren&#39;t so happy?5. Apple&#39;s true definition of privacy is that All Apple&#39;s user Data belongs to Apple. Any data to third party are by definition &#34;Tracking&#34;. Since Privacy is a Fundamental Human Right, I guess the only choice is to give Apple all your Data?6. Most people, especially tech nerds will likely play the I trust Apple more than Google card. Because Apple are not in the Ad business! - That was 2017 to 2021 if not 2022. They have their ads business right infront of you for a long time. They have been preparing their Ads business for a long time. Most tech nerds, or Apple apologist just turns a blind eye to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Even when consumers follow Apple&#39;s own instructions and turn off &#34;Allow Apps to Request to Track&#34; and/or &#34;Share [Device] Analytics&#34; on their privacy controlsReading the description in Settings for both of these switches, we learn the following:1. Allow Apps to Request to Track specifically &#34;Allow[s] apps to ask to track your activity across other companies&#39; apps and websites.&#34; This clause clearly doesn&#39;t apply to any internal analytics process.2. Share [Device] Analytics is a bigger issue, and is the problem. The switch says that it sends information about how the user uses the operating system and Apple services. That clearly includes the App Store, so switching this off should switch off App Store analytics.Including the first point seems stupid, since it muddies the claim against Apple.A note about the App Store privacy information. It (separately) indicates that they collect the information this article alleges - so Apple IS disclosing it. However that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the Analytics toggle reasonably seems to apply to the App Store as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Mass layoffs makes the news because papers depend on sensational headlines, but it&#39;s important to put into perspective.&gt; The pandemic produced Amazon’s most profitable era on record ... Amazon doubled its work force in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.So it doubled its head count in the past 3 years and is now trimming by 3% (or 1% of global).Update: Tried to figure out whether the doubling head count was corporate employees or total. I don&#39;t have time to dig into it now but a quick search did turn up Amazon&#39;s EEO reports in which they break employees down into a number of categories including &#34;Professionals&#34; -- which sounds like it would include engineers. 77K in 2019, 121K in 2021. So it&#39;s reasonable to assume those did double from 2019 to the present. See https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/our-workforce-dat..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just the latest round of cuts at Amazon: &#34;From April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition.&#34;Also: &#34;Amazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it stopped filling more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze corporate hiring across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.$5B loss from one business line is a lot. Maybe this manner of investment inspired Zuck on the metaverse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would think about your positioning some.You’re marketing this as having “less complexity” which   first of all, isn’t going to appeal to people unless they’ve already used the other tools. But, if they had tried Trello, that’s far from complex, as you say it doesn’t have the features you think are needed, so you are more complex than that. It might be that you’re excellent at UX but that needs some comparative examples to see how you have differentiated things.Instead, it might make sense to go more with all the features you need, nothing you don’t angle. Note that I don’t think this really differentiates too much from clickup which has personal productivity options, and as you get bigger you know customers are going to ask for more and more features, because that’s what they do, and we also know that business accounts are the money makers in this market.  It also runs counter to building an “all in one” tool. If you hope to replace chat, docs, collaboration, calendar, and journaling, that’s a big change for people who stepped in just looking for task management.I did see that your prices are lower so you might try positioning based on lower prices than your competition, if you have carefully chosen those price points."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m in the same industry, and find these attempts of constraining technology through secrecy extremely naive by our legislators.
I’d wager that if you already know how to operate an SDR, you properly will have little trouble with the fairly simple  algorithm of measuring phase differences, filtering, CFAR etc. to make a passive radar. Synchronizing a bag of RTL-SDRs with a common oscillator is a trivial soldering task.The cat went out of the bag the second SDRs jumped from DARPA R&amp;D to DVB-T commodity.That aside having a passive radar breadboard is not the same as a high-end passive radar where frequency/phase stability, use of wideband multi-source emitters, ultra-low noise amplifiers and N&gt;&gt;2 channels for increased angular resolution are integrated in an operational system. These systems that actually works, should be controlled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can order a reasonably good passive radar on Alibaba right now.[1]The DVB-T/T2 Passive Radar (external radiation source radar) itself does not emit signals, but receives the echo signals of non-cooperative radiation sources (radio, television, communication base stations, etc.) reflected by the target for detection (as shown in Figure 1). The radar is composed of antenna, multi-channel receiver, and signal processor: the dedicated reference antenna receives direct wave signals, and the monitoring antenna array receives target echo signals; the multi-channel receiver amplifies the signals received by all antennas, performing frequency conversion and A/D sampling. The signal processor processes the output signal of the receiver, and outputs target information after reference signal purification, clutter suppression interference, matched filtering, target detection, parameter estimation and tracking processing. Unlike other passive detection systems, DVB-T/T2 Based Passive Radar(external radiation source radar) can achieve single-station positioning and speed measurement, and can detect more types of targets (can detect radio silence targets, such as autonomous cruise drones, birds and balloons), and is particularly suitable for applications where there are restrictions on electromagnetic radiation and high detection performance requirements.Type of Target: Low-altitude targets such as drones, balloons, paragliders, and general aviation aircraft, including non-cooperative targets with radio silenceDetection Range Directional model: 5 to 10km (DJI Phantom 4), Omnidirectional model: 2 to 4km (DJI Phantom 4)All suppressing this does is cut the US out of the market.[1] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Silent-Sentry-Passive..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;My media content had been pushed aside into a submenu while the app promotes its own streaming media and premium services instead.&#34;This is my biggest pet-peeve coming from Linux world. In Linux the music players you find bundled with different distros are simple, but they just work.However since moving to MacOS, I have to either use iTunes or Music, and in Android the default music player and the latest updates of the alt music player I installed the author problem is true; they expect me to use their services and that&#39;s front and clear, while my local music is hidden away in a menu button.This is a fairly ridiculous situation IMHO (well, solitaire in Windows getting ads/online is slightly more, but I&#39;ll never go there) since a music player that fulfills my needs is pretty easy: show a list of artists, play either the whole artist or a single album in shuffle mode.Attempt 1: https://twitter.com/FPresencia/status/1364892370509127681Attempt 2: https://twitter.com/FPresencia/status/1578720636645826560"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suppose I understand the reasons people prefer Jellyfin.  But on the small chance of liking a commercial product, Plex is truly dead simple for my parents.  They have an AppleTV.  They signed up.  I share it with them via their registered email address.  And they’re in.  It was as simple a process as I could hope for.That being said, do I like everything they’re pushing for? No.  But they at least allow users to opt out.I understand the sentiments here, truly.  I just don’t have a compelling reason to change since it does what I want, is simple to set up and use, simple to share, and gets refined all the time.This is heresy, but not all commercial software is the devil.  I suspect RMS would hate me for this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plex is one of the reasons I now always choose open source over closed source but free as in beer.  They start out great but as financial constraints creep in the compromises are made that create a very unpleasant experience.  For example, I&#39;d love to use Obsidian, which is an amazing app, but who knows what will happen to it in the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It may be  true today that calloc checks for multiplication overflow and doesn&#39;t zero memory if it doesn&#39;t need to, that&#39;s modern revisionism.  Historically, calloc did not do either of those things.eg, from the 4.4 BSD, circa 1993:https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.4BSD/usr/src...    void *
    calloc(num, size)
     size_t num;
     register size_t size;
    {
     register void *p;
    
     size *= num;
     if (p = malloc(size))
      bzero(p, size);
     return(p);
    }"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regurgitating from an older comment of mine: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13110538----The first version of UNIX to include `calloc` was Research UNIX V6, and here&#39;s how it was implemented: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc...    calloc(n, s)
    {
    return(alloc(n*s));
    }

There are several interesting things we learn from poking around V6:- `calloc` originated not on UNIX, but as part of Mike Lesk&#39;s &#34;iolib&#34;, which was written to make it easier to write C programs portable across PDP 11 UNIX, Honeywell 6000 GCOS, and IBM 370 OS[0]. Presumably the reason calloc is the-way-it-is is hidden in the history of the implementation for GCOS or IBM 370 OS, not UNIX. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t seem to track down a copy of Bell Labs &#34;Computing Science Technical Report #31&#34;, which seems to be the appropriate reference.- `calloc` predates `malloc`. As you can see in the above code, there was a `malloc`-like function called just `alloc` (though there were also several other functions named `alloc` that allocated things other than memory). (Ok, fine, since V5 the kernel&#39;s internal memory allocator happened to be named `malloc`, but it worked differently[1]).[0]: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc... (format with `nroff -ms usr/doc/iolib/iolib`)[1]: https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Researc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know if this is actually true?By that, I mean the title of this article, &#39;Why does calloc exist?&#39;. My guess would be that back in the origins of the C library:1) Few cared about automatic overflow checks, that was a job for the programmer, so it seems unlikely the creators added calloc() specifically so that it could check if m * n overflowed (after all, there are loads of libc calls that will shoot you in the foot if you don&#39;t do overflow/buffer size checks)2) calloc() is ancient, probably pre-dating many virtual memory optimisations, and back then, memory was relatively fast vs instruction execution, so adding calloc() to speed up giant memory allocations would be less impactful. But that&#39;s just a hunch, and I&#39;m often surprised by just how sophisticated early UNIX code was. Early computing was slow, every performance gain you could squeeze out of the system mattered and if there were VMs that could defer zeroing memory until it was really needed then people would probably try to do that.But my guess is, calloc() was simply a helper function, added because it was very common to malloc() some memory and then zero it straight away. Does anyone know the actual history?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author was doing the right thing with explaining it only makes sense when you know the history of how we got to where we are - but there is a bit more to it. It is all a series of band-aids. Band-aids all the way down. As somebody who has been involved with AWS since 2012 I&#39;ve seen them all get added incrementally in response to explosions in usage and complexity and customer unhappiness and frustration.Explicit allows being all you can do in an IAM policy were easy(ish) when there was a handful of AWS services and API actions. As there were more and more services and policy actions etc. they became unwieldy. Enter Permission Boundaries where you could wrap a few explicit denies around them. Kubernetes RBAC is nearly at the same place and could now really use those too - but I digress.Also, early on in my AWS journey, even two accounts (one non-prod and one prod) was only done half the time and viewed as a best practice to think about - people genrally just opened one AWS account. But when IAM wasn&#39;t enough (i.e. there wasn&#39;t enough granularity on the resources or the conditions exposed etc.) the answer became separate AWS accounts as the only, or at least the easiest, way enforce these authorization boundaries/separations with a blunt instrument you could trust. It also helped to keep your bills straight before they would do things like break them down by Tag.Then you often needed cross-account role assumptions to deal with the inevitable cases where things or people needed access between these accounts.Then the explosion in AWS Accounts led to AWS Organizations to provision and manage them all. And it built in Service Control Policies and OUs as a tool/layer to help further manage/constrain IAM policies/permissions (IAM policies, Permission Boundaries and SCPs now being in a venn diagram with each other these days).But AWS Organizations managing heaps of accounts was also too painful to use and get right and so they brought in AWS Control Tower to help make setting up Organizations easier.So, in short, this all makes sense when you understand the inability to totally rewrite/refactor important complex systems used by customers (breaking backward compatibility) and instead trying to keep solving all the challenges with an steady stream of incremental band-aids that you can announce at re:Invent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost ALL manuals for setting up something on AWS, third party tools, and sometimes AWS official tools, effectively have a step that requires admin permissions, like being able to attach arbitrary policies to an instance.At that point you can either:- give everybody Admin access- involve the same 2 or 3 trusted people in processes that they shouldn&#39;t really be involved- dig down into permissions to try to build something yourself that apparently the people writting the manuals gave up on doingLooks very bleak, anybody has a different view in this? Seems unlikely that big organizations work like this on AWS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rant: I&#39;m glad the author called out GCP as well, but the idea that it&#39;s the user&#39;s fault for granting too many permissions is absurd. Has the author tried doing this at scale? Try a super simple example: I want a user to have access to query a schema in BigQuery. Can you guess the magic combo of permissions that is going to take? Because the documentation is not going to correctly tell you. Thus after spending way too much time trying to get it done one ends up widely over-permissioning to just get the damn thing to work. You could argue their model is sound and it&#39;s just that how they aggregated permissions into roles is absurd or even just argue that they need better defined roles and I would accept that, but still it&#39;s quite frustrating as is. I mean just look at the length of the reference: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so happy to see this. It should live on folklore.org. The librarians were heroes (loved the &#34;pink slips&#34;, ha ha).I was an engineer at the time — my manager had apparently heard a little bird and told his reports that we might want to go through the Apple Library and check out any books that looked interesting ... because we would likely not ever have to return them.I grabbed Foley and Van Dam, maybe a few others. It was sad to see the library go but having only been at Apple for two years, perhaps it served to give me a taste of what Mr. Jobs at the helm would be like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every corporate librarian or archivist keeps a plan to save their archives in their back pocket. We have to. Corporate archives can come under attack at any time when someone in power—a new CEO, a legal department, the consulting firm behind an acquisition, even a random IT person cleaning up servers—suddenly doesn’t like the idea of a bunch of old stuff lying around. (If you want to know how the Hewlett-Packard Company Archives was saved after enduring a major spinoff, 6 CEOs in 10 years and a company split, read my 2020 article.)I like the idea that corporate librarians and archivists know they have a professional and ethical responsibility that supersedes what the current corporate leadership believes is their current business interest. (Think about the reasons someone would decide they don&#39;t &#34;like the idea of a bunch of old stuff lying around&#34;)Engineers could use some of this too.It is striking to me how the library staff is all smiling big on their last day of work -- because they know they saved the archives, without Steve Jobs noticing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Exported to PDF in case this get taken down by Apple.&gt;But then I read the New York Times article about Laurene Jobs starting the Steve Jobs Archive. Here’s what that article said.&gt;When Mr. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, a dozen years after he was forced out, one of the first things he did was offer Stanford University the company’s corporate archives, said Henry Lowood, the curator of Stanford libraries’ History of Science and Technologies Collections. “Stanford had a signed document from Apple’s legal department within 24 hours, allowing it to transport some 800 boxes from the company’s campus to the university.”This story wasn&#39;t made up by her. It was reported, may be misreporting, may be Apple&#39;s Submarine PR for years. And she kept the story going. ( So to speak )And then this interview [1] with Jony, Tim Cook and Laurene Jobs. I guess people can make up their own mind after watching the interview. But if anything a lot of what was being said by Tim Cook and Laurene Jobs was repeating what Steve had said publicly. Intentionally or not.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdvzYtgmIjs"</p>
