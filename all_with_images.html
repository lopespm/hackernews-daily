								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This resonates with my own experience tremendously. I&#39;ve blogged for ten years - opportunities have come out of it. I&#39;ve worked on OSS for ten years - opportunities have come out of it. Most of the time I was doing both I felt like I was doing something inconsequential that only meant something to me. That was incorrect. Reliably putting work out there and collaborating with other humans makes things happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s true, I can attest! The idea of “increasing your luck surface area” is real.You can create a lot of opportunities for yourself by being public about what you’re up to.It got me a job working with Taylor Otwell, before his businesses took off, and now working at Fly to help with Laravel adoption.My side projects have made helped people learn, given me an audience, and earn extra income."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got my first paid work writing software because I got lucky on GitHub.Back in college, I simply commented on a peer&#39;s issue made for a local hackathon. He was confused about what direction to take for a webapp, and didn&#39;t have any experience in any frameworks. I just suggested Rails, and gave a few highlights for it and pointed him towards some starter guides.Within a couple hours a well connected student (I believe he ran the CS club) saw my comment, and forwarded it to an alumni who was doing local Rails work.I actually didn&#39;t have any experience in Rails beyond the tutorials of the day, and I made that clear. But he liked the look of my GitHub and was happy to give me the job.It was pretty good money for a college student. I recall not really knowing what to expect hourly wise, and when he brought up payment I wasn&#39;t able to give an answer so he immediately said 50/hr. To me, I was truly expecting like half of that. I tried to keep cool as I accepted.  My pricing mindset was definitely anchored by waiting tables, where 50/hr is something you might get if you got a really lucky shift and required busting ass. So to get that much for _sitting down_? Oh boy.After settling on the price, he stepped out of the room for a bit. This was a shared co-working space, and I recall looking over to the guy next to us (who I could tell was paying some attention to our conversation) and saying I did not expect that much money. He happened to work for Uber - and he agreed that I got a very good deal. Not sure why I remember that detail.Anyway: yes, working in public, and even being helpful in public, certainly can pay dividends."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The drastic move to organic farming is puzzling.Any level headed person, forget a politician, would want to experiment first, see the results, gauge and then expand selectively. That is common sense.I guess when you are a dictator ish government and you rule the country with an iron first, the institutions of the state stop being anything and simply become rubber stamps.This also underlines the importance of self sufficiency in necessities. A country ought to feed its people, provide basic services like power and medical facilities on its own, without depending on imports."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But the most boneheaded, bizarre mistake that the Sri Lankan government made was a disastrous plan to shift the entire country to organic agriculture. In April of 2021 the government banned the import and use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. This devastated Sri Lankan agriculture, since, as it turns out, fertilizer is really really important. Production of tea — Sri Lanka’s main cash crop — fell by 18% in a year. Production of rice — the main food crop — fell by even more.From https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/05/sri-lanka-organic-farmi... :&gt; By 2020, the total cost of fertilizer imports and subsidies was close to $500 million each year. With fertilizer prices rising, the tab was likely to increase further in 2021. Banning synthetic fertilizers seemingly allowed Rajapaksa to kill two birds with one stone: improving the nation’s foreign exchange situation while also cutting a massive expenditure on subsidies from the pandemic-hit public budget.&gt; But when it comes to agricultural practices and yields, there is no free lunch. Agricultural inputs—chemicals, nutrients, land, labor, and irrigation—bear a critical relationship to agricultural output. From the moment the plan was announced, agronomists in Sri Lanka and around the world warned that agricultural yields would fall substantially. The government claimed it would increase the production of manure and other organic fertilizers in place of imported synthetic fertilizers. But there was no conceivable way the nation could produce enough fertilizer domestically to make up for the shortfall.You don&#39;t get anything &#34;for free&#34;, and cutting supports like this will inevitably doom a sputtering economy, when the actual solution was almost certainly more government spending, not less.The US is actually lucky to understand this at the deepest levels of policy and law making, with massive aid packages to prevent total collapse. Even Europe tried harsh austerity in the wake of 2008, and the fad lasted way too long there.The Sri Lankan leader&#39;s hostile attitude towards the Sri Lankan population is what made protesters storm the leader&#39;s home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first part of the article about how Sri Lanka would get foreign currency 
(swap, export or borrow) almost completely ignores the well documented devastation of the tourist industry, where people bring euros or dollars, due to covid19 and shutdowns of travel.Yes I suppose it falls into the category of swap, because people bring euros and exchange them for local currency to buy local goods and services. But it was a big part of the &#34;swap&#34; that vanished for 2+ years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the idea of searching a curated list of domains, but I&#39;m not sure that doing the curation yourself is the best approach considering the huge number of useful but niche websites in existence.I wonder if simply parsing all of Wikipedia (dumps are available, and so are parsers capable of handling them) and building a list of all domains used in external links would do the trick. Wikipedia already has substantial quality control mechanisms, and the resulting list should be essentially free of blog spam and other low-quality content. Wikipedia also maintains &#34;official website&#34; links for many topics, which can be obtained by parsing the infobox from the article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Somewhere I read a quote from some cranky business analyst complaining about how the low prices, quality products and high wages impact profits. &#34;It&#39;s better to be a Costco customer or Costco employee than it is to be a Costco shareholder.&#34;To which I responded &#34;That sounds like a well run company!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2005 my wife and I lived in a part of the USA that had no Costco within a half day&#39;s drive.  We soon secured jobs in a part of the USA that had two (two!) Costcos in the same city that we would live.  True story - before we even looked for housing, I went online and joined Costco.  Years later my diabetic cat even had a Costco pharmacy account (best place to buy insulin by far) and received a discount for being without health insurance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related to the story&#39;s underlying topic, as an immigrant I find significant attitudinal/philosophical differences in how I regard saving money and spending money versus, for example, my American coworkers and friends, especially younger ones who grew up around relatively well-off families.  Maybe the affection for Costco embodies that.   I&#39;m sure I sound like an old fart for saying this, like &#34;those younguns don&#39;t know the value of a dollar any more&#34;.By comparison at least, they are much freer with their money and don&#39;t have the same baggage about it.   An example especially apparent for me is their willingness to spend on clothing, where I just can&#39;t bring myself to do it.  Maybe just not having been brought up around parents who were ever dressed that nice, or allowed me and siblings to be.   Or for example, their lack of concern about overpaying for small things, which yes in the bigger picture, who cares if you&#39;re overcharged for a drink once in a while?I suppose it&#39;s because the information or concern about not having money was already passed down or imposed on me as a lesson early in life (whether intentionally or not).  Sometimes I view it as an advantage as I see that my friends (those spending freely) will encounter those lessons when they get married, have kids, etc. and need to save.   On the other hand, I wonder if I&#39;m just handicapping myself with that baggage and not allowing myself to enjoy the freedom that a good income now brings, and living too  much in the restraints of my family&#39;s past..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that is missing from this simulation is that (at least some) ant species walk straight back to their nest once they found some food. They do this (as far as we know) by accumulating each step they take into what is called the &#34;home vector&#34;, effectively integrating the whole path they took. That way they always know which way is &#34;back to the nest&#34;. There is a vast amount of papers on the topic. Some (personal) highlights:If you put the ants on stilts they will follow the same home vector, but because each step on stilts is effectively longer they will overshoot the target: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig4-Odometry-by-stride-...If the ant is placed close to the nest after gathering food, it will still follow its home vector ... away from the nest: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2004...Crazy little buggers these ants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice! There&#39;s a long history of this kind of simulation, going back to Alan Turing (or before). I used to work doing this kind of thing in the 90s, as part of the Artificial Life community. There&#39;s a lot of papers from back then if you&#39;re looking for other ideas for agent based simulations or complex systems. For that matter the ALife community itself still exists."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think I can count the number of kernel changes I&#39;ve submitted on one hand, but I work on core virtualization that involves a lot of pretending to be hardware and (these days) a lot of poking directly at hardware registers.I would say James Mickens sums things up nicely in &#34;The Night Watch[0].&#34; For example, you mention debugging with logs and metrics -- this snippet came to mind:     “Yeah, that sounds bad. Have you checked the log files for
     errors?” I said, “Indeed, I would do that if I hadn’t broken every
     component that a logging system needs to log data. I have a
     network file system, and I have broken the network, and I have
     broken the file system, and my machines crash when I make
     eye contact with them. I HAVE NO TOOLS BECAUSE I’VE
     DESTROYED MY TOOLS WITH MY TOOLS. My only logging
     option is to hire monks to transcribe the subjective experience
     of watching my machines die as I weep tears of blood.”

Mind you, I absolutely _love_ working on low-level stuff, and I wouldn&#39;t trade the time I get to spend actually doing that for anything. That said, the complexity of modern operating systems, CPU architectures, interconnects, and peripherals creates opportunities for frustration and confusion that honor no bounds of reasonability or decency.[0]: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in the kernel team many moons ago helping improve the performance and then built the .net clr later. Also worked on a NT Filesystem called Cairo. So I guess I have experienced both kernel dev and backend framework dev.Kernel code is amazing, especially the parts written by the early members like DaveC, MarkZ and others.For me the biggest part was working with a group of extremely smart people who were very nearly the best programmers in the world.I really miss that outside of Microsoft. I would imagine that you can get the same experience if you worked with the Linux kernel dev team or some of the other few places in the world like FAMGA where you can work.My suggestion is to go for it. 
After leaving MS I found peace by working with the open source community and open source software.Hope that helps, happy to discuss further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If MS or any FAANG wants to hire you for a kernel dev position, go for it; they clearly see a lot of potential in you that maybe you don&#39;t see yourself. I want to point out a couple of things that you should be prepared for:&gt; 2. Debugging exclusively via metrics and logs, since I can&#39;t just attach a debugger to a running server.You often can&#39;t do this in kernel/OS development work either. Serial printf logging is often required. It can be a real &#34;my tools to debug my tools are broken&#34; slog.&gt; 3. Designing systems in general. Some people love the challenge of distributed transactions, eventual consistency and all that jazz, but it just rubs my brain the wrong way. I&#39;m not interested at all in that problem space [1].I&#39;m not sure I understand this issue. I mean, kernels have subsystems for doing stuff; you might need to design one someday? But it won&#39;t be dull-as-dishwater web technology stacks, it&#39;ll be you writing data structures directly in C/C++ or Rust if MS goes there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The full quote for context:&gt; Ferrari and some of the other high-end car manufacturers still use clay and carving knives. It’s a very small portion of the gaming industry that works that way, and some of these people are my favourite people in the world to fight with – they’re the most beautiful and pure, brilliant people. They’re also some of the biggest fucking idiots.Their CEO is certainly not calling everyone an idiot, just that there are some in that group of people. And personally, I greatly prefer this sort of frank talk to run-of-the-mill generic PR speak that usually comes from CEO interviews.The next thing he says in the interview:&gt; I’ve been in the gaming industry longer than most anybody – getting to the grey hair and all that. It used to be the case that developers would throw their game over the wall to the publicist and sales force with literally no interaction beforehand. That model is baked into the philosophy of a lot of artforms and medium, and it’s one I am deeply respectful of; I know their dedication and care."</p>

Although if I try to take a step back I suppose this term could be used to describe any game and not just one of the lootbox-mania or idle games.However, the wikipedia article [1] states:&gt; A core or compulsion loop is any repetitive gameplay cycle that is designed to keep the player engaged with the game. ...  A compulsion loop may be distinguished further from a core loop; while many games have a core loop of activities that a player may repeat over and over again, such as combat within a role-playing game, a compulsion loop is particularly designed to guide the player into anticipation for the potential reward from specific activitiesFor some reason, all I can think of is that game from ST:TNG [2].  I&#39;d like to say that I am somehow above it all but back when I used to play FPS games, it was probably just the same thing.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The video itself was quite off-putting when I first saw it. He didn&#39;t even just kindly offer her flowers. He _tricked_ her into taking them by making it sound like he just wanted her to hold them for him. She was actually being kind to him by doing him a favor, and then he basically ran away and stuck her with them. That&#39;s not kind at all, it&#39;s pushy and exploitative. As someone who doesn&#39;t usually like to accept gifts from random strangers, I&#39;d be really put off and uncomfortable; and that&#39;s before taking into consideration the fact that it was filmed and put online for people to gawk at."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reason this act breaks a moral boundary is that it subverts a
principle of &#34;ends&#34; [1]. A genuine random act of kindness cannot occur
if it&#39;s being filmed.  Filming the act turns it into a virtue
display. It also turns the subject into an object of utility, a means
and not and end in themself.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ends"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sort of feel compelled to quote the Bible here, though I&#39;m not religious.&#34;So when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do ... to be honored by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&#34; Matthew 6"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Man, not putting Fully Qualified Domain Names in code has been such a recurring source of pain in my software life. You make so many assumptions about the way people parse domain names and all of them are wrong. Vendors do all kinds of things to &#34;simplify&#34; their workflows internally and sometimes they just parse URLs and domains in all kinds of ways that break your brain.Reminds me so much of the way &#34;smart&#34; telecom engineers bastardized SS7 to ship new features onto legacy telco infrastructure. SS7 is like 20M lines of C. You can&#39;t really change it without breaking it in many other places, AT&amp;T used to have a metric which was something like &#34;for every 10 lines of code you alter in SS7, you create 8 bugs in other parts of the code.&#34; So &#34;smart&#34; telecom engineers would take existing fields in the SS7 logic and use them for different functions inside of their telco. A billing field could instead be used as a feature flag for some sort of customer state, but only inside of the telco&#39;s network (and re-written back to the compliant SS7 standard when the data was headed out of the network). This was called encapsulation and wrapping and un-wrapping packets just in time was the source of many many problems in my telecom life.Just in time editing of network packets at the boundary is always fun. Most of the problems that would happen would come from forgetting to rewrite back to SS7 and transmitting the internal codes out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks Justine, you&#39;re doing the Lord&#39;s work here.One of the best introductions I&#39;ve seen to pledge() is Kristaps Dzonson&#39;s writeup on it that you can find here [1]. The whole website in general is furthermore a guide on how to write webapps in C, which may sound like a crazy idea to some people who have written it off as everything from an elaborate joke to a security nightmare that nobody should ever consider doing [2], but for people like me who end up having to write that kind of code in constrained execution environments it&#39;s been extremely enlightening and I really appreciate knowing how to do it more securely. If pledge is something I can access in Linux it really helps me out for things in the future going forward, I hope to create some cool things with it![1] https://learnbchs.org/pledge.html[2] https://learnbchs.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh god yes please. If pledge() makes it into the mainline kernel, we OpenBSD-type people seem less weird when submitting patches for some syscall &#34;nobody uses&#34;.Many OpenBSD ports contain pledge() support. Steal all you can. OpenBSD does &#34;hoisting&#34; in many userland programs, meaning all the open calls and such take place at the very start but isn&#39;t actually parsed until after we have locked ourselves in with pledge() and unveil(). I hope this also means many non-base programs are redesigned in this manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi jart,I noticed that you&#39;re missing the sendfd promise. Is there a reason for that omission? Also you&#39;ve added a number of extensions that perhaps should be documented as such.Also there&#39;s a pretty significant undocumented difference between your implementation and OpenBSD, in that promises are by inherited across exec in yours, and not on OpenBSD.OpenBSD experimented with that by specifying the second argument as execpromises, but discovered that it was extremely difficult if not impossible to write meaningful execpromises in the parent for potentially unrelated programs, it&#39;s also happening too early before dynamic linking, and before the program has had an opportunity to &#34;initialize&#34; or &#34;do privileged stuff&#34; and call pledge(2) later itself with more accurate knowledge of what to self-restrict. As such, no calls with execpromises set to anything but NULL/0 exist today. I&#39;m curious how to reconcile those differences."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"About a decade ago, I briefly worked for a company with the same business model. Since most Windows installers require Administrator privileges, the DLLs that they side-load will inherit these elevated privileges and can scan the user&#39;s machine for anything they are interested in.The way this software worked (as far as I can recall): The installer bundled a DLL from which only a few minor functions were exposed to display offers within the host process. Usually, the only thing the client portion of this DLL needed was a HWND. During initialization, the DLL stored a copy of itself in the user&#39;s temp directory. The host application unknowingly then used rundll32 to load this copy as a separate (also elevated) process. This process would run at least as long as the calling process would. Once in place, the process would scan the user&#39;s computer for specific use patterns (geoinformation; MS Office presence; what language; etc.). In order to retrieve the latest advertising &#34;offers&#34;, the DLL called home with this information over a secure pipe and checked for updates. This data was stored and referenced if the same user invoked the DLL again at some point. Only at this point would any actual targeted ads be displayed in the client application&#39;s window.Things may have changed since then - these were the pre-Windows 10 days - but if it&#39;s anything like this, it&#39;s wise to avoid the Unity installer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All of this makes me ask the question of, &#34;How does a company go public without losing themselves? Is that even possible?&#34;This type of going public and chasing shareholder, share selling, cash infusion (sorry for the word salad, I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to put it) - which is often needed for growth past a certain point - how does a company not compromise their vision and bow to the shareholders once they go public, when their directive then becomes &#34;Maximize stock value for the shareholders&#34;?NOTE: I&#39;m an engineer who graduated with an art degree, so this is way out of my wheel house. I&#39;ve always built things, and have not been privy to the business side of the show. It&#39;s a bit foreign to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like there may be a typo with the estimated year of deployment in Ontario: the estimate is likely for 2028, not 2018.The article was published on July 11, 2022, but opens with: &#34;Saskatchewan and Ontario have each chosen GE-Hitachi as the supplier of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), which could be deployed in the Prairie province by the 2030s and in Ontario by 2018.&#34; Then, the article concludes with: &#34;GEH and Ontario plan to construct up to four 300 MWe small module reactors, with the first coming online by 2028.&#34;A separate source by The Canadian Press [0] also reflects an estimate of 2028 for Ontario: &#34;The governments of Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Alberta have put forward a nuclear plan that they say will transition them toward cleaner energy. The provinces’ energy ministers agreed today to a joint plan for small modular reactors, with the first 300-megawatt plant to be built in Darlington, Ont., by 2028.&#34;[0] https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/renewables/onta..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that nuclear is pretty well loved in Ontario. Around 2/3 of our energy is coming from it already.https://www.ieso.ca/power-dataNuclear is the base load, alternatives supply what they can, and hydroelectric dams and gas plants act as the variable load supply.If we can just lose the gas plants, we&#39;d be pretty close to zero carbon. And I think that achievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They looked at the price tags of these reactors vs solar and wind, and chose the lowest number, fine.  But I&#39;ve never heard of a nuclear project coming in at under multiple times its original estimate, and taking a decade or more longer than expected.    Has any new nuclear power come online anywhere since Fukushima?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a very nasty case of insomnia 7 years ago. Without going into details of my associated illness, I went 2-3 months with almost no sleep due to hypnic jerks/sleep starts. When I told people I couldn&#39;t sleep, they assumed I just had difficulty falling asleep, but I literally could not fall asleep. It is terrifying. For whatever reason, whenever I miss a significant amount of sleep (one or two nights) I get very bad sleep jerks to the point I would start to fall asleep 30+ times a night and then wake back up immediately. The only two ways past it I found was a benzo sleeping pill or alcohol and both were hit and miss (just to inhibit the jerks - I had no problem starting to actually fall asleep). Even then, my body seems to build up massive adrenaline after sleep deprivation, so I would wake up 1-2 hours later in a cold sweat and have to start all over. The more sleep I miss, the worse it gets, and after you miss several nights in a row you get VERY &#34;sleep anxious&#34;, and so the cycle continues. Once I&#39;m caught up, I&#39;m fine and the jerks disappear completely, but it takes a while. I just had another case of the jerks this year for the first time since then but I was able to get over it in about 3 weeks this time. Still, it freaked me out as I had considered myself past that and had gotten a little bit careless.The point of this long winded intro: Don&#39;t take sleep for granted. If you sleep well, cherish it. Ever since this time I keep immaculate sleep hygiene. I go to bed on time, at the same time, get daily sunlight, don&#39;t eat before bed, and 9/10 times I&#39;m asleep in minutes and sleep great. I still have occasional early wake insomnia, but for the most part sleep well.Occasionally I think about things like mentioned in this article and what the long term effects will be, but mostly I just don&#39;t worry about it. There isn&#39;t anything I can do about it at this point except try to sleep as best I can from this point forward."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like no one read the entire article, and it&#39;s partially the fault of traditional newspaper writing style for sticking the juiciest stuff up from, but the article concludes there&#39;s no consensus on what chronic sleep deprivation does to humans.&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists said that the new research should not be cause for panic. “It is possible that sleep deprivation damages rat and mouse brains, but that doesn’t mean that you should get stressed about not getting enough sleep,” said Jerome Siegel, a sleep scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who did not contribute to the review.&gt; Dr. Siegel noted that neural injury comes in degrees, and that the extent of sleep deprivation’s effect on the human brain is still largely unknown. He also expressed concern that undue worry about the long-term effects of sleep deprivation could lead people to try to sleep more, unnecessarily and with medication.The opinion of a single review paper on effects in mice is not conclusive science. So, in other words, there&#39;s no news here."</p>

I totally get it, handling payments, curating, etc. are a huge task... but man, I&#39;m a coder, and I don&#39;t have the funds to pay an artist or a musician full time. Being able to just go buy a pack of trees for $20 or something is a huge timer saver.- Animation re-targeting. It seems like there&#39;s a 3rd party plugin for this but it also seems like it hasn&#39;t been updated in a year. In unity I can buy a big pack of animations for pretty cheap and reuse it on almost all my humanoid characters. That&#39;s huge. I think this can be done in Blender or Maya, but it&#39;s so seamless in the engine compared to using a 3rd party tool."</p>

The asset pipeline is simply not as clean as Unity&#39;s. The ability to drop a .blend file in the project in Unity is so underrated. In Godot FBX imports are unreliable, texture imports misbehave frequently, and rigging goes wrong even in the recommended file formats. There&#39;s a lot less clarity around the path to getting real assets in game, which can be a major pain point for solo devs.2. Along the same lines, there is no equivalent of Unity&#39;s mecanim. With Unity, if you can model and rig a character in Blender, you can pull free mocap or other animations from the asset store and get to work. In Godot you&#39;re still best off authoring your own animations for each character. This drastically increases the amount of time spent making assets.3. Godot is in a weird spot version wise for anyone who wants to use C#; the beta version of 4.0 is rapidly approaching, and guarantees to break any project you start in 3.x --- but 4.0 still doesn&#39;t come built with C# support. Hopefully this gets resolved soon."</p>

( at least what most of us think Unity still is, but it&#39;s not )The technology was always more or less &#34;fine&#34;. Unreal Engine didn&#39;t &#34;kill&#34; Unity and it will not in the future.For the better part of a decade, Unity tried to become not-sure-what but way more than &#34;just a game engine&#34;, and that&#39;s the problem, I don&#39;t know exactly what and neither do they.To be clear, Unity is not &#34;dead&#34; and will not be dead for a while, but the writing is on the wall with this &#34;merger&#34;.I&#39;m not sure how is Boeing and who is McDonnell Douglas but I already wrote the off my mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If you don’t know ironSource, they bring a proven record of helping creators focus on what creators do best – bringing great apps and user experiences to life – while enabling business expansion in the app economy. ironSource’s suite of tools and solutions provides the majority of the world’s top games and many of the leading non-gaming apps with the monetization, marketing, analytics, and discovery capabilities they need to build and run scalable app-based businesses.I&#39;m sorry. I must be dense. I still don&#39;t understand what IronSource does. I thought, from the name, that it was like Perforce, but that is obviously not correct."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love this idea. I also thing there is a great use case here for people in sales, customer support / onboarding. Listening as a skill is very important for roles like this, and anything that can help people be a bit more conscious about this is great.A top bar icon for this could also be useful, so not to take up too my screen real estate, e.g. for example if you are giving a sales demo, you may want to hide the application, but still see visually how you are doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey there, great app.By way of feedback:* The play icon with the strike through is not meaningful to me. I recommend a popover on hover to explain what this means. You probably thought about a log of different icons but might be worth polling for a few or letting the user pick one of a few a preference (At first I thought it &#34;wasn&#39;t working&#34;)* It would be nice to be able to add meta to the session, i.e. &#34;1:1 with joseph&#34; that automatically gets timestamped for start and end. Then be able to show the graphs from a day of meetings stacked.* Analysis would be good. Being able to say how many others are in the meeting so it makes more sense when there are longer gaps.* Someone mentioned additional recommendations, that would be awesome if it had a guidance mode where I could fit a template over this thing and have it help keep the meeting on track. 5 mins introductions / waiting for quorum, 5 mins agenda, 10 mins topic 1 etc.I realize the idea for this is to be a simple private app and its great at that. If necessary, I&#39;d suggest offering something more complex that might require greater buy in privacy wise so it can do more.I&#39;d still recommend requiring zero network requests as you&#39;ve done on this version, even though the analytics might be useful.I use an network filter and manually allow connections from apps.Starting with this high level of privacy is how you get someone like me to be comfortable allowing your app to run on my machine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “If there is the infrastructure, if there is the channel by which police can request footage without a warrant or consent of the user, under what circumstances they get it is out of our control. I worry that because it’s decided by the police and by somebody at Ring, there will be temptation to use that for increasingly less urgent situations.”Many people (I would argue anybody with common sense) predicted Ring would get used as a surveillance tool. This quote correctly states the nearly-inevitable next step, which will also be ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO the primary utility of Ring is for Amazon to surveil their delivery contractors, without a doorbell cam it’s trivial for a delivery person to set the package on the porch, photograph it as “proof of delivery”, and then walk away with said package.So the deterrent effect is good for the consumer in that it prevents theft, and good for Amazon because they can contract out to just about anyone to deliver packages, no trust required (or, “trust but verify”)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My next door neighbor (we share a wall) had their bicycles stolen twice, so they installed Ring (floodlight) cameras in both the backyard and the front porch. After a year, the cameras have yielded no added security, or caught any &#34;bad guys&#34; as far as I can tell and from what they told me.What I realized, is they use it to keep track of their kids, funny cat videos that trigger the recording, and most importantly, as a 2 way radio to talk or listen to the kids. That last point, well, I found out they can also listen to my conversations an my kids.I asked them to point their front porch camera so that it doesn&#39;t record my front driveway, just theirs. and they lost their shit. They confirmed they record audio and video. They asked if there was a problem. I said no problem with them. I&#39;m not comfortable with the audio/video recording me or my friends conversations if company comes over to talk to me on my porch or driveway.I really didn&#39;t need to tell them anything, it&#39;s self evident why someone wants a camera point away. Needless to say, after I asked them in the winter, one of them refuses to speak to me and crosses the street and avoids me.These people use surveillance to supervise their kids, and don&#39;t care about the fact that their neighbors (me) could be recorded, and they could be hacked or footage access by random people, because Amazon isn&#39;t exactly the king of privacy.I believe these cameras haven&#39;t decreased crime. They also don&#39;t really add more security. It&#39;s a shame though they are everywhere, with disregard for privacy right on people&#39;s property. So yes, I&#39;m biased. I have no love for Ring."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This period has been very special because of the 401k, which is itself part of the growth story of the corporate legal structure. I think this is coming to an end. Corporate boards and officers no longer represent the best long-term interests of the companies and shareholders they represent. It’s also a very precarious legal status as an arbitrary judicial ruling can make or break a company. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the corporate bubble is based on arbitrary tax codes that both advantage corporations and push worker savings into the stock market.Even if these conditions continue unabated, the cash flows from working class into the stock market will eventually hit equilibrium with capital extraction from the owner class. If the extractions return to the same markets, then things stay in equilibrium. They won’t, however, because the tax advantaged assets are different for them. They may seek hyper-volatility, or government bond shelters, but will generally avoid the assets on the working class tax treadmill.There are fundamentals to financial assets that have nothing to do with “number go up”, and these will ultimately dictate reality, with the caveat that “the markets will remain irrational longer than you will remain solvent”.  Rationals get wrecked too, except every once in a while when one gets lucky on their timing and makes so much money that they become a hero and we make movies about them. We cheer because it gives us hope that our intuition will serve us too. Unlikely.This is all to say that such charts are using an inductive hypothesis to predict an inherently anti-inductive phenomenon. People tithe and sacrifice to their church for a promise of rewards in the afterlife. The stonk religion is the same; well worth the price for your peace of mind. True or not, you’d be a mess without it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having all lines normalized so they start from a common point at x = 0 would be helpful. That would allow reading the total returns as percentage of the initial (1987) investment and compare them.Similarly in the drawdown chart, if it starts at 1987, it makes no sense to start the dollar at -81%. If I am looking at a chart from 1987 to 2022, I want to see how the dollar did compared to other assets in that time period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the goal is to demonstrate relative performance over time, wouldn&#39;t it be useful to use a normalization such that all lines either start at the same point (e.g. simulating investing X amount) or ending at the same point (showing requirement to get to X final amount)?"</p>

Basically every other tool I tried worked better.However, Slack isn&#39;t that much better. It still gaslights Firefox users and tells them their browser is not supported. What a nice way to put it, that after friggin&#39; years, they still have not managed to implement voice chat in a standard conform way. Discord and others have had this for years! Only Slack and Teams (in browser) seem to have incapable development teams behind them, who are comfortable with gaslighting unsuspecting users into using Chromium-based browsers, furthering web mono-culture.There are so many issues with Teams, that I am wondering, what they are even working on. Surely they cannot be bugfixing all day, if so many bugs remain after years. We&#39;ve had 2-3 years of pandemic now. What the heck are they doing!? They could have made the business. Instead they shove this broken thing down our throats and time will come, when people will just run away screaming, just like they did with Skype.

Additionally leaving `` block sometime doesn&#39;t work &lt;wtf&gt;Cool software doesn&#39;t do crazy shit with Clipboard and Links__________lack of Push2Talk option (not mute/unmute btn) is tragedy, did those people ever play some video games with teams/guilds?Ventrilo had this feature in probably 2003, Discord uses it too, but enterprise communicators struggle to figure this simple feature despite being so good, especially when everybody was WFH and had people in the house talking.____________On the positives side - calendar and its integrations are unparalleled and meetings are decent."</p>

Special characters &#34;&#34;&#34; (quotation mark), &#34;;&#34; (semicolon), &#34;,&#34; (comma), &#34;:&#34; (colon) and &#34;\&#34; (backslash) should be escaped with a backslash (&#34;\&#34;) as in MECARD encoding. For example, if an SSID were &#34;foo;bar\baz&#34;, with quotation marks part of the literal SSID name itself, this would be encoded as: WIFI:S:\&#34;foo\;bar\\baz\&#34;;;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; A serious take on a contract-based languageAda has design-by-contract as part of the language:https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada/chapters/cont...Since Ada is used for safety-critical systems programming you could argue that it is very serious about it.&gt;&gt; And tool integration! One of the coolest things Eiffel sorta did was use contracts to infer tests. If you have contracts, you can use a fuzzer to get integration tests for free.How about tools that extend design-by-contract to formal verification?https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-spark/chapters/01...SPARK is limited to a subset of Ada, so it is not without limitations, but  it can be very useful depending on what you are trying to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a little surprised that nobody has pulled off the &#34;VB6 of javascript&#34;. I don&#39;t mean one of the purely no-code products, but like a literal &#34;create a new page, drag a button, then double click it to hop into the code for a new route and a new component and go straight into the onclick handler&#34;.Maybe that&#39;s harder than I can imagine, or it exists and just isn&#39;t a very good idea in practice (how would you even do responsive?) so it&#39;s not that popular.VB was a garbage language by modern standards but I always liked that they gave you a visual builder, but didn&#39;t try to hide the coding from you too much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depending on if you count it as a serious programming language, Racket has pretty much all the contract stuff. It has dedicated syntax for contracts, tight integration with the module system, and contract-random-generate attempts to generate a value satisfying a contract so writing an auto fuzzer wouldn&#39;t be too hard. In fact, I think Racket&#39;s system predates Clojure since there was the 2002 paper &#34;Contracts for Higher-Order Functions&#34; discussing it and Clojure first appeared in 2007.The only reason I would ever use Clojure instead of Racket would be if I needed to work with the JVM ecosystem or the browser via Clojurescript (which are compelling reasons).Totally agree about a good calculator language."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sounds like the same anti competitive behavior that MS was punished for two decades ago. Making it a requirement to only boot software approved by them excludes a whole range of competitors from using the same hardware. Making that a condition for OEMs to even get a license is the problem here.Lenovo is otherwise known for supporting Linux on their laptops. And yes I know you can jump through hoops and fiddle with scary (for ordinary users) bios options to &#34;fix&#34; this. The point is that you shouldn&#39;t have to and this is a bit too convenient for MS to keep competitors off laptops.Basically, what is needed here is a neutral certificate authority not controlled by a single company with a reasonable process for independent operating systems to get a certificate.I recently ran into this trying to boot linux on my old imac. Ubuntu actually works but forget about arch, manjaro, and a whole lot of other distributions. Imacs have no off-switch for secure boot that I know off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Digital-locks like UEFI signing have a singular flaw, in that it only truly offers security to the people holding the signing keys i.e. a firm that did not pay for the computer, shouldn’t be tying unsolicited services to other peoples businesses, and should be classified as an adversarial threat vector.If Libreboot wasn’t such a pain to install, it would have saved a lot of grief."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HP should open OS/8 and RT-11, the two big influences on CP/M.  OS/8 is kind of remarkable, running on a system arguably less powerful than the first 8-bit home computers (I would say they are closer to PIC microcontrollers, but with more RAM):https://www.pdp8online.com/os/os8/index.shtmlPDP-8 memory is heavily paged.  There are 128 word pages- direct addresses can only reach within the current page, and literals (immediate data including addresses to other pages) have to be allocated out of this current page along with the instructions.  Second, there are 4K-word fields.  So you need to use far jumps and returns to access outside the current field.  This is just like PIC microcontroller pages.OS/8 reserved only two pages for itself.  Things like the command interpreter were swapped out to disk or DECTape.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECtapeIf the application needed device drivers, it got to choose which pages the drivers would occupy- meaning the device drivers had to be written as position independent code.  Also I think each driver was limited to two pages.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In high school in 1980 we had Commodore PETs. They had no tangible OS, just a BASIC interpreter in ROM. There was an easter egg that made it say Microsoft or wasn&#39;t it spelled MicroSoft? Either way a company nobody had ever heard of.CP/M had the aura of being something for real pros. Read some journal articles and it looked really complicated. But without suitable hardware I had never any chance to touch it.In 1983 I went to university where beginner courses happened on VAX/VMS and my definition of &#34;pro&#34; got shifted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember, when I was a kid, having a CP/M diskette for the Amstrad CPC. It was provided with the machine. Every now and then I would try it out, not really understanding what it was about.Years later I learned, reading about it, that it was some sort of &#34;professional&#34; OS on which productivity software would be used.Does anyone actually used that OS on CPC or any other 8bits machine of the 80s to do anything remotely useful? Genuinely interested."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the professional (or former professional) astronomers among us, I will make my somewhat amused observation that what people are most paying attention to is not really the distinguishing features of JWST.People seem most impressed by the apparent increase in resolution of the images, which is not from a certain point of view the hardest thing to do .  HST might have done that if its instruments had been of different pixel size or imaging array size / focal length.   Ok, the much larger mirror is an achievement.   But anyway, the resolution of the images is often not what really is the limiting factor for photometric observations.  Yes it is sharper/higher resolution, but that wasn&#39;t the key selling point.The new thing is observations in the IR, which is somewhat a technical footnote in many gushing announcements of these images (or some discussion here too).   And the general public knows little about that detail&#39;s importance, especially since the images are stylized / colored anyway to look just like RGB images that we are so familiar with.   But everyone can easily appreciate a sharper image.Anyway, still a momentous achievement.  And thank god we have a scientific field where stunning images was enough to get the public to support a $10B project.**Edit to add: I did not mean to detract from or diminish anyone&#39;s appreciation of the images and accomplishment at whatever level they are enjoyed.   And of course many here are technically knowledgeable about the IR aspect.   I just write to point out that for the most headline-grabbing images and newspaper writers, the sharpness of the images over the actual IR frontier is what grabs the attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a backyard telescope versus Webb: https://twitter.com/AJamesMcCarthy/status/154694183270093209...More comparisons on Twitter, some zoomed in:- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546899241880240128- https://twitter.com/Batsuto_/status/1546900387931766784- https://twitter.com/JBWillcox/status/1546881033597075457- https://twitter.com/jason4short/status/1546626672488632321I&#39;m not a physicist, so I&#39;ve only recently learned about redshift. Hubble&#39;s deep field images were very dark red/orange because further objects appear redder (into infrared) before they disappear to the observer. Webb&#39;s sensors are more red/infrared-sensitive than Hubble&#39;s, so along with extremely fine, super-cooled optics using exotic materials to align and capture every single photon, its red sensitivity allows Webb to peer deeper, further, and dimmer than we&#39;ve ever been able to before.And I&#39;ve read that the &#34;spikes&#34; coming off the brighter stars are generally from stars in our own galaxy and they&#39;re not lens flares. They&#39;re caused by the edges of the telescope. Hubble&#39;s stars would have 4 spikes in a cross; Webb has 6 in a snowflake because of the shape of Webb&#39;s mirrors having 6 sides. Or something like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Question for anyone who happens to be an expert: Is there any way to quantify how much better Webb is independently of the amount of time used to take the exposures? Like, could Hubble achieve the same quality of images as Webb if it was given 100x (or whatever) more time exposure?I&#39;m trying to understand how much the improvement is &#34;speed of convergence&#34; vs. &#34;quality of asymptotic result&#34;. (Though... is that even a valid way of trying to understand things?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching the livestream i was more than surprised, that color correction actually happens in Photoshop.Also, there seem to be multiple layer-masks involved for specific regions and objects.I get that you can shift and composite color, based on hue, apply filters etc, but: Photoshop?Curious if anyone can explain, that what we see is actual science or some touched up version of objects in our universe.p.s.: What struck me the most is the absence of noise, especially for the deep field photo. Hubble took many exposures over weeks, which normally would allow for reliable reduction of noise, webb took some shots over the course of hours and there’s hardly any noise to see. Weirdest part is seeing them just “healing brushing” away some dots - how is the decision process on altering images like that?(edit for typos)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the NASA stream online was a disaster. Choppy video and it seemed like nobody had prepared anything.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Meta - I am honestly surprised, and sightly appalled at the general attitude in these comments (and also in yesterday&#39;s thread).Uber has essentially not just broken laws, but outright exploited workers/drivers... and people comment &#34;Aah but the local taxi mafia was bad&#34;...??!? I&#39;m sorry but that does not justify exploiting workers. That does not justify using political influence to enter/gain markets. This isn&#39;t some messiah coming to save us all from the &#34;horridness of local transport&#34;.I&#39;m not saying that having Uber as a player is necessarily bad, mind you. But it&#39;s possible to have some positive benefits for some people while hurting a lot of others. I sincerely doubt too many HN users have driven taxis, but my conversations with Uber/regular taxi drivers hardly painted a favorable picture of Uber. (Nuance - please note that my taxi drivers doesn&#39;t represent all drivers. There will be happy and sad drivers, my point being it&#39;s not always sunshine and rainbows... which the article speaks about too.)I wonder if this being a YC owned communication platform affects/biases users (some of whom I&#39;m sure are YC founders etc themselves), however the ratio of apathy/&#34;taxis were already bad&#34; to &#34;Uber shouldn&#39;t exploit workers, nothing justifies it&#34; is disappointingly low.(I know this is a particularly ranty comment and I had kept quiet on the last thread but seeing the same type of comments here pushed me.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personnal experience.
I come back from a trip in romania - bucharest.
At first I didn&#39;t take Uber but tried for the regular Taxi from the airport.
All of them requesting ~40USD.
At the end I go with one who put the meter and indeed arrived to 200 Lei (~40 USD). I payed in euro because I didn&#39;t have enough local currency, hopefully I had some and the driver accept.Taking some information it&#39;s way too much, but would I have argue with how the meter was operating anyway?Now, I need to comeback to the airport at 4am.So instead, I reserve a airport transfer from the airline itself, pay in advance something like 30 USD this time.And... no one show up at 4am. Mobile phone of the transfer is not answering... I never heard of them *So I install Uber, hopefully it&#39;s working, enter my visa (from my country, no need for local currency at all), after 10 minutes, someone very nice take me and I just paid like 15 USD to get to the airport, at 5 in the morning, with the invoice by mail.How do you compete with that? Taxi business need to reflect. And every country is the same strangely, it&#39;s as universal than taxes: you can&#39;t escape!* Edit: In fact I know what happened, and there is nothing to do, because I looked at the invoice and on the third page of the voucher PDF there, it&#39;s said that I needed to call 24h before to confirm the transfer... They don&#39;t call, you have to call. Even after the first confirmation I already did for confirming the pickup address some days before, I wasn&#39;t feeling paranoid enough. So you can&#39;t say nothing because I didn&#39;t read the last page, but it&#39;s a dumb heavy process, do people changes their mind and decide to live forever in the country frequently?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shocking stuff like this, weaponising drivers against city governments to do Uber&#39;s bidding to lobby:&gt; MacGann insists that Uber drivers were seen by some at the company as pawns who could be used to put pressure on governments. “And if that meant Uber drivers going on strike, Uber drivers doing a demo in the streets, Uber drivers blocking Barcelona, blocking Berlin, blocking Paris, then that was the way to go,” he said. “In a sense, it was considered beneficial to weaponise Uber drivers in this way.”&gt; The files show MacGann’s fingerprints on this strategy, too. In one email, he praised staffers in Amsterdam who leaked stories to the press about attacks on drivers to “keep the violence narrative” and pressure the Dutch government.Uber was weaponising their workers (while fighting as hard as possible to not call them workers and pay for workers&#39; benefits) against local governments, they were behaving like a tech-mafia, a mob with sprawling power across the globe.What the actual fuck?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the interesting aspects of giving a shit is that it will lead sometimes to you doing things which are not in your short-term selfish narrowly-defined &#34;best interest&#34; but because you give a shit you&#39;ll do it anyway.  Some of these lead to long-term value that is very significant but you can&#39;t know at the time.I was once asked by a client (bank) to take a call with one of _their_ clients (a pretty important hedge fund). I did this as a courtesy even though I thought our product wasn&#39;t appropriate for the hedge fund.  Anyhow I get on the call and it&#39;s the COO, the Chief Investment Officer, the CTO and a couple of other _very_ important people at this big fund. (ie a much more senior call than I really expected).  Anyway, because I give a shit, I told them our product wouldn&#39;t really be right for them and explained why.  They thanked me and I heard nothing more of it.Until a couple of years later where I offered a job out of the blue because one of the people on the call had been impressed by how I had dealt with it, and by pure coincidence his partner was a recruiter who was tasked with headhunting for a CTO role and he said &#34;hey you should check this guy out&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone saying it doesn&#39;t scale is missing the point.Scaling is a winner-take-all, venture capital mindset. The article is about service businesses, which do not need to hit web scale! We are talking about services here not your web startup.Even beyond services, giving a shit and building saas is not impossible. In fact, I wish more tech companies started small and stayed small. I absolutely want to run a digital small business and I want to give a shit, it makes the building feel purposeful instead of this product-led growth at all costs bullshit.I hope we see a software middle class grow in the next decade. Middle class tech companies are going to be coming from the bootstrapper + founder focused funds (TinySeed / Calm) and they are going to have a distinct advantage if they understand their strategy/context in their chosen verticals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Giving a shit has many personal benefits that go beyond the question of financial sustainability.Career-wise, if you give a shit about your work and your colleagues this does add up to a reputation. When you do things &#34;right&#34;, don&#39;t gossip or backstab, act with integrity and honesty, people notice. You&#39;ll be seen as trustworthy, a pillar to fall back on.The thing is though, the person screwing everybody over and job hopping before the damage becomes visible may actually get more out of their career, financially. It&#39;s a rather philosophical question as to which character type you want to be.Another reward of giving a shit is the gratitude people show, because it has become a rare behavior it seems.For example, I&#39;m running a web community (photography), non-profit, as a hobby. One particular user, an old Australian guy, is very much not tech savvy and recently I spent two nights in a row to get him onboarded again. He struggles with the simplest things but it&#39;s all good now.To a calculating mind, this is a ridiculous investment of scarce free time with virtually no gain. The last part is where that mind couldn&#39;t be more wrong.The man was almost in tears from gratitude. He&#39;s alone, struggles and nobody bothers to explain him anything, not even his family, most of which live far away. He got helped, by somebody he never met, for no particular reason but giving a shit.I will remember that gratitude a decade from now. By comparison, a stranger could now send me 10K and it would mean absolutely nothing to me. I don&#39;t need it, I have my stuff. You can&#39;t buy deep and memorable human connections  and moments, they are by definition a result of giving a shit.Look at how little it takes and how giant the impact is. A company put genuine effort into a customer&#39;s table needs, and here we are."</p>

Worse, we&#39;ll cemenent the current duopoly of browser engines, because we&#39;ll make it (again) so complex that no-one can create an alternative.We shouldn&#39;t have GC, Exceptions or Tail calls in WASM, as long as the compiler can provide them.What we should have is multi memory support and memory read permissions, because without them WASM lacks basic security primitives.[1]Reference types maybe. But I&#39;ve yet to see a convincing argument as to why they are absolutely necessary.Everything else (as long as it can be done by the compiler) is just bloat.1. https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentat..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;As an experiment, I went through a list of holiday weekend sales, and opened all the sites. They all — all, 100% — interrupted my attempt to give them some money.&#34;This is a good touchstone to use for &#34;you&#39;ve overoptimized your site, tone it back&#34;. I am also taken aback every time I&#39;m on a site, I&#39;ve got something in my shopping cart, I&#39;m headed for the &#34;check out&#34; button, or I&#39;m even on the checkout page, and some stupid interstitial pops up. Dude, I&#39;m trying to enter my credit card information! Back off! Especially stupid for a &#34;sign up for our newsletter&#34; popup; we all know that unclicking the &#34;yes, we can email you every 17 seconds from now until the heat death of the universe with valuable offers from &#39;our affiliates&#39; which we define as &#39;anyone we share a species with&#39;!&#34; box on the checkout form is mandatory, and if we don&#39;t see it immediately we&#39;d best go hunting for it. You&#39;ve already default populating the checkbox to &#34;yes&#34; on this very screen, get out of the way!Less unbelievably stupid, but related, is when I&#39;m examining product X and just after I scroll down a bit to read more you pop up something related to... well... anything other than product X! I&#39;m signalling interest in product X as hard as I can, and you&#39;ve AB tested that this is a great time to jangle your keys over there instead? Your AB testing is stupid and can&#39;t possibly fail to be some stupid statistical fluke or other terrible error. What fisherman goes out on his boat, hooks a fish, and then rushes to throw another completely different lure out to the hooked fish and get them on that hook instead? This is another good touchstone for being &#34;overoptimized&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve talked about this on HN but I&#39;ll say it again.A couple years ago, after being an Android fan for the better part of a decade, I finally bought myself an iPhone and pried myself away from Google&#39;s ecosystem wherever I could. And Apple didn&#39;t even need to do any work for me to make this decision. It was the years of abuse from Google that you experience when you decide to use a Google product or service. And a big part of that was the constant A/B/C/D/E/F testing. I never felt like I was using a complete product, everything felt like a constant beta that could be changed or rearranged at any point, and I was just doing free testing work for them while they harvest all my data.Every app update was a risk of the app rearranging itself, or features appearing/disappearing. Eventually it didn&#39;t even come from app updates in the Play Store, and new interfaces would just appear one day when a server somewhere marked your account as being in the group that gets the new UI. This app that you were familiar with could at any point be rearranged when you open it on any given day. Then maybe a week later you open it and it&#39;s back to how it was before. A button you thought was here suddenly isn&#39;t, and you question whether something actually changed or if you&#39;re losing your mind. It&#39;s a subtle gaslighting that eventually I couldn&#39;t stand any more.To me, A/B testing means you don&#39;t respect your users. You see them as just one factor in your money machine that can be poked and prodded to optimize how much money you can squeeze out of them. That&#39;s not to say a company like Apple is creating products out of the goodness of their heart, but at least it feels like it was developed by humans who made an opinionated call as to what they thought was the right design decision, and what they would want to use. And in my 2 years of owning an iPhone, I&#39;ve never opened my reminders app to find out that it&#39;s completely unrecognizable, or my messages app has been renamed or rethemed for the umpteenth time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with AB testing is that it&#39;s a short-term strategy. For example, if a news site runs AB testing with headlines, they&#39;ll find that bullshit clickbait headlines get more pageviews than concise, accurate headlines, but the constant use of clickbait headlines will over time destroy overall traffic to your site. More frustratingly, sites run by smart people tend to fall into a balance where the worst articles get the most alluring headlines."</p>

When I read this story I basically thought &#34;ok, but you&#39;re going to spend a load of money pumping but there&#39;s no way there&#39;s liquidity for you to actually perform your dump&#34;. But if you look up DOCK today you&#39;ll see its market cap is $14m and it&#39;s daily traded volume is $1.5m. I would get it that you could move some of these coins using a few bill boards and some sponsored ad reads if they were tiny volume traded, but the implication of this is that millions of dollars are moving back and forth every day on a coin that has absolutely nothing going for it. Who is doing that? There can&#39;t possibly be retail moving in and out of this stuff. Really I kind of assume this all has to be wash trading right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d never seen this. So cool!After an image loads, you can resize your browser text (Ctrl + / Ctrl -) to instantly reveal a different image with each resize event. By sweeping through very small and very large zoom levels, you can make peoples&#39; fingers trace out a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right as the registered point moves with the underlying voronoi canvas as it scales up and down.Side note: how hard would it be to reduce the time delay between identifying a point and displaying an image? Could this be made realtime by preloading all images? The flicker would be terrible but I&#39;d want to try it at least briefly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not a historic low, but a definitive low. There are several reasons for this.- in time of a crisis, the world seems to ralley around the dollar, as it is backed by the strongest economy and the strongest military.- this crisis has hit Europe hard, as it is not only close to the war, but of course, too dependant on Russian oil and especially gas.- there was a lot of inflation internationally, the US federal bank was the first to raise interest to combat inflation. The EU lags behind and is limited in action due to the fear of destabilizing some of its member countries with too high of a debt.Consequently, there is a lot of good reason for the Euro to be weak at these times. However, if the energy crisis can be solved and the war contained, a weak Euro also is also pushing exports from the EU. So there is a lot of reason for this trend to be stopped, if not reversed, until the other extreme is reached again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bad for Europe because our salaries (before tax) have already been lower than US salaries. Additionally we pay much more taxes than you guys on salaries (up to 50%) and on VAT (~20%).Means at the moment until salaries get inflation adjusted that we pay a premium price for everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PepsiCo Inc (PEP, Nasdaq) isn&#39;t merely a beverage company - as explained in this strategy document - it is a space company. The Pepsi Universe, with respect to its 8 light year characteristic length, reflects the scale of the total addressable market (TAM) that PepsiCo can expand into.Noted short-seller and equity valuation skeptic Jim Chanos once described the TAM of space companies as infinite, because space itself is infinite. This pessimistic take anchors our low-end fair value estimate of PEP to $infinity / share. Since PEP currently trades at around $170 / share, we believe there is considerable upside to the long term buy and hold investor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can someone explain why this won&#39;t result in a renaissance for peer to peer and e2e encrypted chat/forums/social media etc.? When government or industry makes it nearly impossible for consumer needs to be met we inevitably see a grey and black market spring up to meet those needs. My prediction is that if legislation like this becomes widespread we&#39;ll see a freely distributed application rise to prominence among a gaggle of others, it&#39;ll dominate the chat and social market until even grandma is using it and the establishment will have a right proper freak out as other social media giants implode and everyone is communicating anything they want with zero oversight from the government or industry. This is roughly how I remember the Napster affair going when DRM was pushed hard by the recording industry, it eventually collapsed but not before dealing a massive blow to the status quo and forcing a transition to streaming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If UK government really cared about children, and not about surveillance and censorship, they would solve the problem another way.The only way protect children online is to ban them from Internet. Children should not have access to normal laptops and smartphones, instead they should use &#34;kid phones&#34;. Such phones would allow children to communicate only with people approved by parents or teachers and visit only approved sites. This way they will enjoy perfect safety which this Bill fails to provide.Every site which wants to become approved, must fulfill all the requirements from the Bill and indicate this with a HTTP header. Kid phones and laptops should allow only to visit such compliant sites.Kid-oriented phones and laptops must be visually distinctive: for example, have a shape of a cute animal. In this case teachers, parents or police will be able to instantly spot and confiscate illegal devices.This is a win-win plan: kids would be safe and adults would be safe from government overreach. Obviously no government will agree to such plan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With respect to the politicians not turning up, it&#39;s worth noting that at least some of the candidates for PM are against the Online Safety Bill and want to scrap it. So for them, campaigning to become the next leader may actually be a more useful way to spend time than hearing what they already know.It appears the OSB has become a victim of incoherent requirements specifications. It&#39;s grown enormously during its gestation period and is now trying to do way too much, including things that are self-contradictory. Some politicians recognize this, for example Kemi Badenoch:https://order-order.com/2022/07/11/watch-badenoch-slams-onli...but I recall others saying similar things. I just can&#39;t find the references right now."</p>

Kovid puts in an extraordinary amount of work (nearly 80 hours a week) into Calibre - of which most is for free, in the name of open source software. Anyone who has spent a decent amount of time on the mobileread forums will also know him as a remarkably intelligent, dedicated, and all-round fantastic guy. He&#39;s very patient and kind with beginners, responsive to feedback, and rarely loses his cool with anyone. His only &#39;crime&#39; was being blunt with a bug report around eleven years ago, and I&#39;m struggling to see why people are so myopic as to turn that into their entire perception of him. Add to the fact that he eventually fixed every bug in that thread as well as second-language difficulties that he likely experiences, and the vitriol that people have for him is undeserved.The proof of the pudding is Calibre itself, which is a joy to use. It is hands down one of the most useful programs on my computer. It&#39;s rarely buggy, fast, logical to use, very feature-rich, and rather customisable. I&#39;m perplexed as to whether some of the people in this thread and I are using the same software. It&#39;s very easy to set up, as all you do is either point to a pre-existing library of files or create a new one. Adding books is trivial, as is editing metadata, and the reader itself is splendid. That&#39;s really what most people need out of e-book software, but Calibre really does go above and beyond any e-book software on the market right now. The only close competitor is Foliate, which is not cross-platform like Calibre, and even then it simply lacks many useful features that I rely on with Calibre, despite having a much cleaner UI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kovid Goyal, the developer of Calibre, is a very responsive, very gentle person. Whenever I needed help, I have gotten help from him. [1] - Calibre is an indispensable tool for me to manage my digital library with close to 800 books.I support him regularly. Consinder doing it as well if you appreciate the app. Go to https://calibre-ebook.com/ , there’s a support link on the top right.[1] This is the forum dedicated to Calibre

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Calibre does its job so well it&#39;s downright essential for anyone thinking about dealing with ebooks. Glad to hear that full text search is added in this version, using it with a bunch of reference books saved will be so useful. It might be worth splitting out the fiction books I have to clean up the results. Maybe it works with tag filtering, I&#39;ll have to check."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great! Gcc support opens up more platforms, more targets, and the opportunity to more easily integrate with the various common embedded toolchains that are built around gcc.And it&#39;s free software, for those that care, this matters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have mixed feelings about the idea of a GCC frontend for Rust.On one hand, having frontend diversity for a language helps bring new people into the language; think of the groups who can&#39;t use Rust because it doesn&#39;t support certain targets or can&#39;t integrate with their existing toolchain. There is a lot of talent that could be brought into Rust just by virtue of them being able to be included and the less barriers of entry, the better.But on the other hand, I don&#39;t want to have to think of implementation specific behaviors, bugs, quirks, et cetera. Having an ecosystem built with thousands of people wrestling with that problem seems like a recipe for buggy software and burnout. People say that a spec would help with this aspect but I&#39;m sceptical; a spec doesn&#39;t prevent divergence from happening, it just gives you a frame of reference for what is correct. You also don&#39;t need multiple implementations to have a spec either!I fear that the way this is going to pan out is that we&#39;ll have multiple frontends for Rust, but the vast majority of engineers using the language will only ever think about &#34;true&#34; Rust: the current mainstream implementation. Issues in crates that primarily affect &#34;alternative&#34; Rusts will go unacknowledged, be tossed out, or have hacky patch jobs. We&#39;ll end up with either a) two separate, but high quality, ecosystems or b) one shared, lower quality ecosystem that is constantly fighting itself. I hold Rust in really high regard and it&#39;s my favorite language at the moment, so this thought is scary to me.Though, there are a lot of smart people involved so maybe it doesn&#39;t have to be so doom and gloom. A couple of years ago I thought that cross-platform software was really messy and hard to get right but languages like Rust have the proper language features to make things like this much easier (though not perfect!). It could be that the emergence of multiple frontends could necessitate features and tooling for the Rust itself which makes all of that I said a non-issue. Maybe. Hopefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am the author of this feature.  The background here is that the SQL standard was ambiguous about which of the two ways an implementation should behave.  So in the upcoming SQL:202x, this was addressed by making the behavior implementation-defined and adding this NULLS [NOT] DISTINCT option to pick the other behavior.Personally, I think that the existing PostgreSQL behavior (NULLS DISTINCT) is the &#34;right&#34; one, and the other option was mainly intended for compatibility with other SQL implementations.  But I&#39;m glad that people are also finding other uses for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great! I have multiple places in our code where I&#39;ve had to define multiple unique indexes (with conditionals) to get around this. It&#39;s definitely confusing behaviour the first time you encounter it.Honestly I think SQL already breaks it&#39;s own standard of &#34;NULL = unknown&#34;. One example: If you do a LEFT OUTER JOIN and the joined data is missing, you get NULL in the resultset. But in that case, it&#39;s not &#34;unknown&#34; whether there are records that can be joined to, the answer is that there are definitively no records there.NULL is univerally considered by most programming languages to equal &#34;not present&#34; vs &#34;unknown&#34;, and in many cases by SQL in practice. The ship has probably sailed on actually changing the default behaviour, but optional flags like these are a good step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is amazing. We moved from Oracle to Postgres after being on Oracle for 15+ years. That was a huge move that took 2 years. One of the biggest hurdles was rewriting thousands of sql queries. One of the biggest things we had to change was accounting for how oracle handled nulls versus how Postgres handled nulls. However, we missed this nuance about how Postgres treated nulls and unique. It wasn’t until about 2 years into using Postgres, and running into so many issues, that we finally stumbled upon this nuance in the documentation. Crap. That required making a bunch of more changes to account for this. At this point I’m firmly convinced that null handling is the hardest part of database work ;-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Per the article this came in response to questions raised by a Columbia faculty member critiquing the university&#39;s data. I thought that report[1] was actually more interesting than the original article.As per the quote at the top of the report:&gt; Rankings create powerful incentives to manipulate data and distort institutional behavior for the sole or primary purpose of inflating one’s score...It would be shocking to me if Columbia was the only institution that fudged its numbers a bit in pursuit of a higher US News ranking. Given how important that ranking has become in US culture, I wonder if it&#39;s time for the methodology to change to require audited/auditable metrics rather than continuing to allow self-reporting.1: http://www.math.columbia.edu/~thaddeus/ranking/investigation..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For context, U.S. News and World Report used to be a trusted periodical that reported national and international news. In the 80&#39;s they started ranking colleges and selling it as a separate publication, which turned out to be pretty profitable, so they repeated the trick by ranking hospitals (1990), cars (2007), and then states (2017). The news business went online only in 2011, then shuttered in 2015. Since then they&#39;ve just been a rankings company, but they kept the name to trade on their reputation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You are describing the hedonic treadmill. Essentially, you become used to your surroundings, and while they are objectively great, from the perspective of inside your own head, this is now normal and you / your monkey mind wants more.There have been a lot of post floating around the internet with various solutions, the most popular being Stoicism &gt; Positive Psychology / Happiness research &gt; Buddhism / Meditation. I&#39;ve dabbled a little in all of them and they all have something to offer.Essentially, you are experiencing a disconnect between how it feels to be you and how you expected to feel. As someone only a little older than yourself, I would say this: your job will never love you back, and especially in the software realm, it may not be as fulfilling as something like woodworking or therapy. It does pay the bills, though.The above mentioned happiness research / positive psychology suggests that having multiple, meaningful social roles that you can fulfill outside of work will allow you to shoulder more responsibility and find meaning in your life.What I&#39;m trying say is that in the second half of life, it is our job to give back. So start there.Also, this is in my morning bookmarks to revisit:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some advice from someone a bit further down the career path:* If you want to try something, try it! Save up some runway, do your own thing. Try some other projects right now, don&#39;t wait. (You won&#39;t be able to devote full time effort to them, but can still make progress.) You may find that what you dream about isn&#39;t all that, or maybe it is. Either way you can take steps forward.* I learned to be happy with my life after I&#39;d taken a few alternative paths. Nothing like jumping to a situation, realizing it wasn&#39;t what you thought it was, and then jumping to a different situation, then realizing it wasn&#39;t all that great, then jumping to a different situation... After I did this a few times, I learned that I needed to create happiness where I was, not try to find it elsewhere. YMMV.* It is a cliche, but kids are only young once. Enjoy that time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was there 5 years ago. My psychology was getting worse by the month as everything I did seemed more and more futile.I quit my job, travelled to some bucket list destinations like Japan, Fiji, Galapagos, machu piccu, then went on a 5 month backpacking trip across both islands of New Zealand with my (ridiculously) supportive wife. I immersed myself the whole time in zen philosophy and tried to lose my egocentric placement in the universe.It was a great reset for my depression, but did nothing to erase the fundamental feeling that all of reality and my actions within it are pointless.For the first year I took my passion projects seriously, devoting almost a full work week of attention to them. At a certain point, I stopped those too. I realized I was merely creating my own flavor of the distractions I&#39;d tired of.Now the only things that bring me real joy are improving my home environment, the health of my family, and getting out in the sun and playing sports. That kind of &#34;out there, just around the corner&#34; abstract life satisfaction I was chasing seem as ridiculous to me now as participating in US politics. It is all ephemeral."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being the same vintage as Jim, much of this brought back memories.There really wasn&#39;t any such thing as a tech stack - our company would produce software for various Unixen and, especially, Vax, and the language was alway C, with some Pascal on the Vax side (as, I was told, the Vax Pascal compiler produced far more optimal code than the C compiler).Being a software engineer was like being a furniture-maker. You had to master a small number of tools - the saw, the chisel - and then craftsmanship consisted of discovering an affinity with these tools and a love of getting ever more skilled at using them. This path wasn&#39;t for everyone, which was fine - plenty of management and other non-tech roles for those folks - but if you grooved with your tools it was a real joy to be able to move from chair- to table- to cabinet-making and carry and refine your skills as you went.This idyll could not last, however. Before too long it became uneconomical to make furniture this way, so for your chair making project you instead had to learn how to run a chair-making machine. When you moved onto a tables project, the machines there were infuriatingly dissimilar to the chair-making ones you&#39;d just mastered. Worse still, moving back to chair-making after a year or two, you discover that the old machines you knew are now obsolete and you have to re-learn how to run their replacements. This stops being fun, or interesting, after a while, and yet sadly it&#39;s all that most younger software engineers know.Occasionally, there is the need to make some shim or gizmo that the machines don&#39;t cover, so out come the trusty saw and chisel of yore - much to the amazement of the young&#39;uns, who are astonished that an old-timer can still wield these antiques so effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thing I hear from a lot of software engineers from the time-frame of 1980-2000 is how much software engineering - to engineers at least - was about the craft. It was all about the craft of making good software. People invested real energy into trying to do it right, and treated it as such. This is of course likely colored by experience and &#34;rose tinted&#34; glasses, however, I think we as an industry have let this go, especially since the rise of bootcamps. It just isn&#39;t about the craft anymore, its all about &#34;hustle&#34;. There is some truth to the fact that engineering in this time there was more caring about it as a craft, caring about performance, caring about shipping quality etc.I like thinking about things as a craft, I don&#39;t always like the &#34;hustle&#34; aspect that is pervasive now, it guarantees shipping too early and never taking quality &amp; craftsmanship seriously, I feel like.I want to work somewhere again that sees engineering software as a craft again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Even if we did see then (and we mostly didn’t) that small, frequent releases were better in a whole bunch of ways, we couldn’t really do it. It was expensive to ship on physical media, and disruptive to our customers to have to do frequent installs.It&#39;s still disruptive to customers. As a software engineer I love CD/CI. It makes the entire process much smoother and more efficient.As a customer / end-user, though? Nope. I absolutely hate it. Maybe I&#39;m just getting old but I&#39;m extremely nostalgic for the days where I got to decide if I the upgrade was worth it to me or not. These days things will change and move you on without any notice or opt-in what-so-ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This area of finance is utterly, completely backwards and seems like one of the most (evil)successful bits of proper-burden reversal in existence. The entire concept of &#34;identity theft&#34; as it exists now is 100% pure industry propaganda. Nobody is cloning bodies and transplanting brains or something. It&#39;s not that anyone is &#34;stealing my identity&#34; it&#39;s the financial institutions don&#39;t bother to verify it and then somehow have managed to make a system where this is my problem. If I haven&#39;t chosen to have a business relationship with a given financial institution or credit bureau, and they choose to give somebody else financial services, it shouldn&#39;t matter if that person used my name or widely circulated information about me, anything less then full biometrics/video for signup and establishing mutual certificates and cryptographically signed interactions thereafter should be presumptively invalid. If Person M lies to a Bank A about their info claiming to be Person A and tries to escape their commitments sure they&#39;ve committed fraud, but if the Bank A then tries to go after Person A then the bank are literally accessories to fraud and should face criminal prosecution or at the least massive financial penalties (with both expenses and punitive fines paid to Person A). If the banks want to have private credit bureaus to help them with scaling, abstracting and reducing bias in the risk aspect sure; there are reasonable arguments for that. But said credit bureaus should have no role in identity verification, and if they are lying about people (claiming financial things about them which are not true) that again should be on them, with serious statutory penalties.All the burdens are completely backwards, in turn massively perverting the incentives. And it&#39;s eternally infuriating. Some rando applying for a credit line on the opposite side of the country should be Not My Problem, 100% of the time, whether they have my name or address or a random symmetric 9 digit number some government assigned me. All the tools exist for financial institutions to manage their risk/convenience tradeoff, but they&#39;re the ones who have the power, information and should have the incentive to do so. They are externalizing onto the general public instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s shocking to me that this type of email change swapping still works. I might have to write up a blog post explaining how to fix it permanently.It&#39;s a fairly simple process though.1. Create a table that tracks every email address change on the account. It can&#39;t just be a single field because once compromised, people have learned to just change the email address twice.2. That table should contain fields for: user_id, email_from, email_to, confirm_key, reversal_key, created_at, confirmed_at, reversed_at, created_ip, confirmed_ip, reversed_ip3. When an email change is initiated, an email should be sent to the new email address with the confirmation_key to have them verify the new email address before making the change.4. Once verified, an email should be sent to the OLD email address notifying them of the change and including a link to the reversal_key to use if they did not make this switch, including the IP address and approximate geolocation of the IP address for some context.5. If the user clicks the reversal link it will clear the confirmation and reversal links of every email change that came after the link that was clicked,  ensuring that the original change can always be reversed no matter how many changes were made afterwards, revert the email address change and force the user to update the password. This password change screen should warn them that their account was likely compromised and strongly recommend they enable MFA (if available on the site) to prevent it from happening again.I spent a year working on a site that dealt with a TON of fraud and phishing against the user base. This was one of the biggest issues that we dealt with, but this approach completely resolved the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Moderately tangential, but I just had my Uber account hacked today. I also used a strong, unique password managed by a password manager. As far as I can tell, my email wasn’t hacked (Google Workspace account backed by a physical security key). My best guess is they scammed support, but I am just taking a stab in the dark.The worst part is, you can’t even talk to Uber support chat unless you put in the account’s current email, phone number, and last 6 digits of the credit card on the account. I have the attacker’s email address, but not the phone number, so I couldn’t even chat with support. They have an “email support” form, but it asks for the same info. I put in what I knew, but I haven’t heard back from support since the attacker took my account this afternoon, and I fear I’m not going to get it back."</p>

While these titles are completely riddled with DRM and screw you over after X years.Publishers need to come clean, and after years of milking the cow, they must have a plan allowing paying customers to play the title they&#39;ve been enjoying all these years. Otherwise, they should be forced to include the verbiage at release date &#34;This title will stop working as of &lt;date in the future&gt;&#34;.This kind of nonsense only promotes cracked games."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Still a million times better than what it replaced. About 20 years ago I was working with the Australian taxi cab industry. The hq of the regulatory authority shared the address of the main payment system. The regulatory authority was made up of representatives of each taxi cab company that each had one vote. There was one taxi company (the one that controlled the payment system allowed) with 200+ subsidiaries that made up that organization. If anyone tried to get into the taxi industry they&#39;d use their 200 votes to say they are not allowed by regulations. This was a company making 2billion a year in one state of Australia alone (NSW). It was so incredibly fucking corrupt and i am thankful to Uber Lyft and all the other incumbents for managing to get their foot in. It required dirty dealing to get past this corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Uber isn&#39;t the most ethical company for sure but here in Brussels the taxi industry is pretty shady as well.Getting a taxi license costs an exorbitant amount of money and it&#39;s done through all kinds of dodgy deals.There&#39;s 1-2 companies that have a monopoly on the whole industry.There&#39;s weird rules about which types of taxis can &#34;serve&#34; the airport, akin to what mobsters are responsible for collecting trash in what areas.You&#39;ll often get &#34;sorry the payment terminal is out of order, cash only&#34; BS.A study a few years ago showed the main taxi company, according to their tax documents, earned a ridiculously low amount of money per day (= obvious dodging of taxes).They clearly refused to innovate for years. When you called their number you&#39;d get some unintelligible voice on the other end that would give you about 10 sec to state your details before they&#39;d clearly run out of patience.You could only request pickups at specific addresses that would then be connected to your phone number / profile. So &#34;pick me up on this street corner&#34; was impossible.The last time we called one for a ride to the airport they didn&#39;t show up at the agreed time so we got an Uber. Taxi company called us many times screaming insults down the phone, followed by an offensive email with an invitation to pay and threats of small claims courts.In light of all that, I have zero problems with someone else moving in fast to break things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually joined a political party in my country, because they had the intention of protecting Uber.Some people wonder, but why? Why protect such scummy company?Well, it was literally to save lives, as much illegal Uber behaviour is, what they were trying to replace was worse, MUCH worse.Where I live &#34;Taxi Mafia&#34; was a thing, not just in the usual sense people imagine, like blocking competitors using regulations, but people were murdering others, there were beatings, assassinations, theft, high level government corruption, the Taxi Mafia was evil and destructive as any other &#34;&lt;drugs/guns/slavery&gt; Mafia&#34; you can imagine.A lot of people claim Uber is evil because they say their workers are contractors and not employees. Well, before Uber if you wanted to be a driver, you had to purchase your own car, open your own company, and then give 50k USD to the local mafia boss, and promise to join combat whenever called. Combat? Yes, combat, gathering up drivers to kill a competitor was a thing, one infamous case for example: out of town driver parked near airport to deliver someone, a client in a hurry got on his cab as the other client was leaving, the local mafia didn&#39;t like this happened, so they surrounded the car and invited the driver for a &#34;walk&#34;, took him under a nearby bridge, and they all kicked him until he was a mangled mess, and then they kicked him some more to make sure he was dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Google makes $40bn...If I can create something that just a tiny fraction of people find useful, then I can create a huge amount of value.You conflate two meanings of value: monetary value, and intrinsic value. Search engines are intrinsically but not monetarily valuable to users. Search engines are monetarily, but not intrinsically, valuable to advertisers. You can get into trouble when you conflate these two meaning of &#34;value&#34;.In fact, right here is the pivot on which the internet goes from an idealistic shang-ri-la for geeks, to a commercial hellscape for the unwashed masses. It is surprisingly easy to create intrinsic value with computers! You see it all day every day on HN: some geek had a thought, spends a weekend making it, and then deploys a solution.It is surprisingly hard to extract monetary value from an intrinsically valuable solution. In fact, I believe that creating artificial scarcity is the hardest part of building an internet business, requiring invention on par with the intrinsically valuable part - and yet its the very thing that idealists rail against.(And making something artificially scarce does seem morally repugnant. And yet I don&#39;t see any other way to pay developers. Full stop. Open source software + consulting fees is a good way to go, but that can&#39;t apply to hosted search for the public. Well I guess it could, you could teach businesses how to game your own engine!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps a better approach would be building an open source www index or even a full current cache - as an enabler for people to build their own search engines?Right now it is extremely difficult to build your own web crawler that would compete with Google. And that is not because of the technology, but because multiple sites will prevent your bot from accessing them if you&#39;re not Google or Bing - either through robots.txt, or through directly banning your IP if it&#39;s trying to crawl and it&#39;s not a confirmed google-bot.Having a non-profit, open source, crawler that keeps an up to date index (or web cache) of the web would help competition spring up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I work for Google, though far away from Search.Regardless of search engine design, there&#39;s HUGE money in SEO. Any successful search engine will be gamed. Do you have the developer power to go red-queen against all the large companies in the world?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(disclaimer: lead brand manager, been at the table of a lot of the meetings where these logo changes happen.)There&#39;s a few different reasons (especially depending on the company) why that these happen, but I personally think it boils down to two unintuitive quasi-psychological reasons.- When suits are fumbling around looking for a new shiny project that&#39;ll give them a sense of &#34;legacy&#34; and their fingerpints all over (that won&#39;t affect immediate profits), somewhere in marketing and brand is usually the first place they&#39;ll grab.  If wins, fantastic, they&#39;ve secured their legacy both in a career-spanning sense and at the company itself with a bonus. If it fails disastrously, easy enough to quietly switch back to the old and to save face by tackling a different project.- Sort of relatedly, a lot of marketing suits hate feeling &#34;left out&#34; of trends; it&#39;s something I loathe about the industry, the hyper-focus and optimization of being at the crest of new trends (when arguably they&#39;re usually shittier than the previous ones). Oftentimes their entire salary / sense of purpose of being at the job is tied into with presenting the latest and greatest, and insecure designers will be too happy to be enablers.(My opinion may be a minority of the industry itself as if it were me, we&#39;d be back to 90&#39;s era logos for the sheer zany quality.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is confused about the difference between a logo and a word mark, which is what they are showing. Big brands are super pedantic about how and where logo marks and word marks are used. You shouldn&#39;t be seeing these word marks in contexts that are not already dripping in branding for the company.Look at the Pinterest Brand guidelines (https://business.pinterest.com/en-au/brand-guidelines/) and you well find them saying: &#34;Only use the Pinterest badge (please don’t use our word mark)&#34;. The Pinterest badge is the exact same stylised letter P from the old wordmark. So, almost everywhere you encounter a Pinterest logo it will be the stylised graphic. They can do that because enough people recognise the brand that they can drop the &#34;interest&#34;.The Facebook logo is an even weirder example because they are comparing the old Facebook app word mark with the newer Facebook-the-company word mark. That logo was specifically designed to look different from the app. Now that Facebook is now Meta, that uppercase logo has been retired.Microsoft, Facebook, Pinterest, Spotify and Airbnb all have stylised logo marks. eBay and Google use word marks, but are brightly coloured and immediately recognisable 99% of the time they are seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These are just the word marks, not the full logos.I mocked up a comparison of the logos (Microsoft/Airbnb/Spotify/Pinterest rarely use their word marks without the accompanying icon) and they start to retain a _little_ more personality, at least for the tech comparison.https://imgur.com/a/v5yKD3oIt still seems fair to say they&#39;re more bland than past iterations, though. The theme is ”[optional icon] + sans serif word mark”, and it&#39;s a good example of “small m minimalism” — a kind of unthinking collective march toward an absence of detail — touched on by The Cultural Tutor in this thread:https://twitter.com/culturaltutor/status/1538211892707086338&gt; Perhaps minimalist design is so prevalent because we no longer have anything to say.&gt; You don&#39;t need me to explain what the Gothic cathedral says, for example.&gt; But the skyscraper? It doesn&#39;t say anything, really. It&#39;s just... there.&gt; And suddenly everything, everywhere starts to look the same.&gt; Absolute neutrality. No detail. No identity.&gt; What does that say about us?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lichess is amazing given how little they receive in funding. The interface is miles ahead of commercial competitors.They also handle guest plays much better. I&#39;ve faced less cheating bots and no annoying pop ups on lichess when playing as a guest compared to chess.comCan anyone point me to how they handle cheating detection? I would love a high level overview of how it works especially when you have no data on the player.fun nugget: HN users hosted tournaments on lichess at the start of the pandemic [0]0] https://lichess.org/team/hacker-news"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always excited when chess pops up on HN once a month or so. As someone who picked it up as a hobby in December, I can attest that lichess is a great app and site for folks looking to get back into the game or get started (I’m also a premium chess.com member as I use both products).For those of you thinking about picking up chess, I’d highly recommend watching the Chess Brah “Building Habits” series on YouTube. Watch the first five or so videos, and just start practicing those habits in rapid games (recommend 15 minute with 10 second increment on lichess, which shows up as 15+10). Embrace the losses, and just keep working on not hanging your pieces for free.If you’re intimidated by playing other humans, you can try the “Maia 1” bot on Lichess. It’ll likely beat you up for a while if you’re a beginner, but it’s a bot designed to play more like a human, and it’ll help you get the reps to feel more comfortable playing other humans.From there, just enjoy yourself. Chess can be frustrating because by design you always lose about 50% or your takes, but once you learn to accept the losses, it can be a great mental exercise to keep your brain sharp."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes! The front-end code for Lichess is what got me to learn Mithril years ago. Really clean code for such a complex application. Here’s a great example:https://github.com/lichess-org/lichobile/blob/master/src/ui/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the past few weeks, I&#39;ve been collecting and refining prompting tricks for getting GPT-3 to emit and understand various types of non-prose output. Many of these are discussed in the Twitter thread the OP links to, but I&#39;d like to highlight a few of my favorites here too.- GPT-3 can produce simple SVG diagrams (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545883023719239689) from an English description, or incrementally modify a given SVG diagram (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545888869207400454).- GPT-3 can produce diagrams using Graphviz dot notation (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545109709035900928), including diagrams that incorporate real-world context (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545112039147847682) not given in the prompt.- It can emit and understand HTML and Markdown, including table markup — e.g., &#34;Produce an HTML table giving the members of the Beatles and their instruments&#34;- It can accept/emit multiple named files, with arbitrary content, simply by embedding those files as values in a larger JSON/YAML document. Here, (https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1545848754883919872) I demonstrate completing the file tree of a trivial Python package given a README.md.- It can understand the raw JSON file contents of .ipynb files, successfully following directions given to it in markdown cells, emitting multiple code cells, etc.While all this is fun, as many people have pointed out the model has a bad habit of &#34;hallucinating&#34; — producing highly specific, wrong output.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fascinating use case that wouldn&#39;t have occurred to me at all, quite cool, even if it &#34;doesn&#39;t know anything about anything at all&#34;.It even does pretty good with Verilog, which I assumed it would have issues with, admittedly some of this is just &#34;google-able&#34;, but even so. It can even create a reasonable attempt at a testbench (even though it doesn&#39;t quite get it right), which is crazy to me.*Explain this code:module my_module(a,c,y);
 input a,c;
 output y;
 assign y= c ? a : 1&#39;bz; 
endmodule*This code is a Verilog module that defines three inputs (a, c, y) and one output (y). The output y is assigned to the value of a if c is true, otherwise it is assigned to 1&#39;bz.*What is 1&#39;bz ?*1&#39;bz is a Verilog constant that represents a bit value of &#39;z&#39;, which is used to indicate a high impedance state.*Why is high impedance used ?*High impedance is used in digital circuits to allow multiple drivers to share a single bus without contention. When two or more drivers attempt to drive the same bus at the same time, a contention can occur and the bus voltage can become undefined. By using high impedance, drivers can avoid contention and allow the bus to remain stable.*Give me a testbench for this module*module testbench;
  reg a;
  reg c;
  wire y;  my_module dut(a, c, y);

What you are doing is copying the html/css of a website and then exporting it to an autogenerated react component(s).2) It would be great if the demo video showed the React component generated.  Is all of the html thrown into 1 component?  Is the resulting html clean?  Or is it cluttered with html attributes that aren&#39;t actually needed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just biology. It&#39;s basically every subject in high school. The amount of knowledge in the world has exploded in the last 100 - 150 years, yet our school system refuses to adapt and pretends we&#39;re still in the early 1900s. Back then you actually could get a good and reasonably in-depth overview of what makes the world work before going to college or work.But those kinds of aspirations are completely futile these days. People in the ministries of education and other responsible bodies will argue that high school&#39;s purpose is not to educate on a subject in depth but to give a broad overview of many subjects but that&#39;s completely besides the point. Because the point is that the only way that they are able to &#34;give you a broad overview&#34; these days is by force-feeding you ever more facts and knowledge in sliced up classes, compressed into ever more shallow and boring text books and then letting you puke it all out in brain dead exams, many times a year for many different subjects, in parallel. Bulimia learning.Which is beyond sad, because basically every subject can be the source of wonder and amazement if taught the right way and with enough time to explain and explore. Which is why we need to let our kids choose the subjects they are interested early in school and get comfortable with the fact that they won&#39;t have any knowledge about other subjects when they leave high school. There simply isn&#39;t any other way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had been putting off quantum physics and time was running out. I was worried forth semester physics at MIT was going to be tough, but then through some miracle of providence the EE department decided that a solid state chemistry chemistry class plus Into to Biology could be substituted for quantum physics.Because I had already taken a solid state chemistry class, all I had to do was take a basic introductory biology class; how difficult could that be? It turns out that biology is hard, very hard.The other students that filled the large lecture hall weren’t ordinary first year students; they were pre-med students. Instead of relaxing by the swimming pool reading a colorful text with pictures of jelly fish and beetles, it felt more like I was taking swim lessons with a few hundred sharks.The lectures by Professor Luria were great (he had won the Nobel prize four years before) but the number of facts seemed impossible to remember. My fellow students were writing down literally every word written or uttered during each lecture. There wasn’t any mention of jelly fish or bugs or pea plants, but there were complex diagrams depicting even more complex biochemical pathways. I was accustomed to math classes and engineering classes and computer science classes. Biology was very different, more facts and less study of how to apply fundamental principles to prove some theorem or solve some engineering problem.I survived the Biology class, but it would have been a lot easier for me to take the physics class."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During the first part of the pandemic I watched the lectures for the Introductory Biology course [1] from MIT OpenCourseWare. I cannot recommend those highly enough!Almost every lecture brought up and highlighted something really cool and fascinating. Like how RNA sequencing over the last couple of years has gone from expensive to almost free, and what its uses are. Or time-lapse of bacteria adapting to antibiotics. Or just the first lecture showing a video of someone sticking a syringe into a cell. There were even some labs that could be done via a normal web browser.For me this was so much more engaging than the biology I was thought in high school, where we mostly learned things from outdated books.[1]: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-016-introductory-biology-fall-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This exact thing happened to us. We have a store located in Puerto Rico and Shopify would randomly stop payouts every 3-4 months or so because they needed to re-verify our owner address information. Apparently, most of Puerto Rico is not verifiable by their shitty address verification API, so it triggers the freeze every time it retries the verification. It was one of the most frustrating experiences I&#39;ve ever had and cost us thousands of dollars.Stripe also did the same exact thing for very similar reasons and at one point we had over $300,000 USD frozen with them, which was basically our entire monthly payroll expense. We had to explain to our bank why our accounts were suddenly drained. This one was worse than Shopify&#39;s since we actually never received any communications notifying that this was going to happen. At least we got an email from Shopify that we just hadn&#39;t noticed.They&#39;re all broken. And Know Your Customer needs to eat shit and die."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This problem seems endemic to big tech platforms, particularly when money is involved. I remember hearing similar stories about PayPal a decade ago (still do for what it’s worth).While I can understand the desire to not interact with a user of the platform (shopify, google, PayPal, etc), because of the cost, and because many are likely to be bots or actually fraudulent. It’s precisely at these edge cases when computers and automated performs the worst.These are the situations where the scenario is imperfectly modelled in the system. Maybe the engineers didn’t think of the edge case, or an ML model never had training data to cover it.Point is, it doesn’t matter. People problems need people solutions. Remediating edge cases involving people’s livelihoods strikes me as most likely a people problem.When you’re asking a person or company to trust them in a business relationship into the future, such as by being their shopfront, there’s only so many you can destroy before word gets around. I haven’t used or recommended businesses to use PayPal for a decade, because I saw them time and again inflict pain and financial stress with no recourse.As another example, look at the general sentiment around Google Cloud. Would you build a business on top of it? Does that include an exit strategy to multi-cloud, because you’re unsure if they’ll support the service you use?If you can’t scale to provide a human to help other humans caught in the edge cases of your own system, then you need to acknowledge you’re causing harm.A dog food company that kills a puppy every week, is really a puppy killing company that sells dog food.It’s a matter of perspective yes, but if you got into it to help feed dogs, surely the last thing you would want to do is harm them?And if you became aware your killing puppies, would it not be the top priority to ensure it never happens again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shopify should be scrambling to do a public post-mortem right now. They &#34;Fixed&#34; the situation within a few hours of the tweetstorm, showing that they know they f&#39;d up. Shit happens - but how does shopify assuage small businesses that this won&#39;t happen to them next? A public apology, post-mortem and steps to make sure this never happens again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article says Musk agreed to buy Twitter mostly as a joke. I think there&#39;s a far better explanation. This wasn&#39;t a joke for Musk because after agreeing to buy Twitter he proceeded to sell billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA stock, supposedly to finance the purchase. Even for the richest man in the world that&#39;s not a joke.I think a better explanation is that Musk offered to buy Twitter as a cover for selling billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA.Look at this story: https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-sells-billions-of-dol...
The headline is: &#34;Elon Musk Sells $8.5 Billion of Tesla Shares After Deal to Buy Twitter&#34;Why does he need a cover? Because TSLA is way too overvalued. He has to know that it is overvalued. Tesla&#39;s market cap is double of Toyota, VW, Mercedes, BMW, GM, Honda, Ferrari and Volvo all combined! [1]. If you sell stock while knowing your company&#39;s stock is way too overvalued, you&#39;re fleecing unsophisticated investors. Pretending to buy Twitter provides a convenient cover.Musk pretended that TSLA valuation is reasonable. Musk even called out Gates for shorting TSLA stock [2]. If he didn&#39;t have a cover then Musk would look like a hypocrite for selling TSLA.In reality, both Musk and Gates sold TSLA, the only difference is that Musk sold stocks he owned, but Gates sold borrowed stocks. But Musk used buying Twitter as a cover, so he gets to pretend to be morally superior. Even though both men sold TSLA, according to Musk, Gates&#39; sales means that he isn&#39;t serious about climate change [3].[1] https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers...[2] https://nypost.com/2022/05/31/elon-musk-calls-out-bill-gates...[3] https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-shorting-tesla-wo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much noise here and ill-informed comments fail to give a broader understanding of  what&#39;s going on. Elon bought up Twitter shares early in the year for a reason, because he wanted more control over Twitter. He bought up so much Twitter shares that when it was announced via the SEC, Twitter offered a board seat under the clause that he wouldn&#39;t acquire too much % control over the company. He obliged, but then left when he realized he couldn&#39;t make the changes he desired at the company. Plus, people on the board at the time, specifically Dorsey, was nudging him to buy out the company as a whole. So he did, hastingly. That was an ill-informed decision and obviously a mistake made with respect to doing due-diligence. In hindsight, before the market crash that price may have made sense. But fast forward today with looming recession talk, it&#39;s pretty clear he realized it&#39;s overvalued (we know this from tweets about twitter deal being repriced). And so he needed an escape hatch, hence the issue with bots and the unverifiable mDAU was a great talking point. In fact, he may as well be right on the issue as Twitter doesn&#39;t want to reveal how they calculate it. What he&#39;s trying to do right now is pretty clearly force the board to give a better deal. He&#39;s not sold any stock and likely won&#39;t unless he&#39;s actually out for good. But given the amount of effort and thought he&#39;s put into it and making it clear that he should pay a lower price depending on the bot issue, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much doubt he&#39;s not actually leaving Twitter. Whether the courts will force an acquisition at the current price however, is a looming question. My bet is they settle at a lower price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not knowing anything about glyphosate, I went to the article before reading the comments. I’ll just put this here because it was clear the researchers wanted to be sure people see it. From the first paragraph of the article—&gt;&gt; In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer determined that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen” (IARC, 2015). However, the European Food Safety Authority and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Meeting on Pesticide Residues (EFSA 2015, FAO/WHO 2015) determined that glyphosate is unlikely to be a carcinogen. The US EPA concluded that “available data and weight-of-evidence clearly do not support the descriptors “carcinogenic to humans,” “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” or “inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential” (US EPA 2017a). Controversy and concern that the rising use of glyphosate may have adverse human-health effects exist (Myers et. al., 2016)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in the field for many years and I see the EU on the forefront of public chemical safety, both in terms of legislation and enforcement.
ECHA is transparent about glyphosate [1]. It is not even labelled as CMR on REACH Annex III [2], and that&#39;s saying a lot.
If you follow the developments, you will find that there is no way to prove a chemical as &#34;safe&#34;. All it takes is one bloke on record to develop any health condition which can be linked to a chemical, and it will be scrutinized six ways to Sundays. Often leading to the introduction or decrease of an OEL, or a classification of this substance. As new humans are born all of the time, and diagnostics and analysis methods are still being improved, the likelihood of any given chemical to be &#34;harmless&#34; asymptotically approaches zero.
1 in 2 people develop cancer during their lives [3]. There are currently &gt; 23000 chemicals on the EEA market at &gt;= 1 t/a [4].1 https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/glyphosate

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most insane part of this article was the below quote from the bill sponsor:&#34;Kavanagh said it is important to leave this buffer for police to protect law enforcement from being assaulted by unruly bystanders. He said “there’s no reason” to come closer and predicted tragic outcomes for those who do, saying, “Such an approach is unreasonable, unnecessary, and unsafe, and should be made illegal.&#34;He is just happily excusing cops visiting &#34;tragic outcomes&#34; on people who get closer than 8 feet to cops. The lengths that people will go to too justify police just killing people is insane. How about we don&#39;t allow police to just wantonly murder or beat whoever they want?This same guy is an ex cop and &#34;sponsored legislation that would prohibit oversight boards of police departments unless those boards were two-thirds sworn police officers&#34; After the 2020 election he also said: &#34;&#34;Everybody shouldn’t be voting...Quantity is important, but we have to look at the quality of votes, as well.&#34;Seems like a really great guy that very much deserves to be in power /shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kavanagh_(Arizona_politic..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like a great way to prevent recordings by having one officer move towards onlookers and force them an arbitrary distance away"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I was cop, I would certainly want to know that there is a physical boundary in law that bystanders cannot cross. For my own safety, and for theirs. I see nothing unreasonable about not allowing people to cross this boundary. The law does not prevent recording. It says you cannot record closer than 8ft. Why would somebody need to get closer than 8ft to an officer doing their job, when you have no involvement in the situation at hand? Adding more people to the situation simply increases the stress of all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the early 2000s someone (drunkmenworkhere is what I remember) made a blog post generator that you could sign up for, add some names, some interests, and it would generate blog posts with Markov chains and some other magic. I signed up, not fully understanding how it worked, added some friends and family as names, played around with it, it wasn&#39;t what I thought it was and moved on. Meanwhile it kept generating entries about me and my family doing fantastic things.At some point my then ex-wife (we&#39;ve since reconciled) was google-stalking me and came across these entries. At some point they became outlandish enough that she contacted me to ask what was going on in my life. There was a very confused conversation where I had no idea what she was talking about and she was somewhat concerned about my health and safety. It wasn&#39;t until I talked to a relative and started googling myself with some specific terms that I came across the entries and was able to figure out what was happening. I emailed the individual running the project and asked to end the entries and if possible remove them from the internet to avoid further confusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I first learned about Markov chains in the early &#39;00s, I found and hacked at a simple IRC bot, and deployed it to a number of rooms found in the mIRC defaults.  It would sit in each channel and learn, only replying when DM&#39;d.I did give the bot a few hard-coded replies, namely to &#34;ASL?&#34; with &#34;[random integer 20-30]/f/cali&#34; and &#34;pic?&#34; with a random link to images from Google Image search. Otherwise it would happily barf up random Markov walks from all of the other conversations without any consideration of context.In the span of one weekend at least five hundred unique users attempted to chat with it, some for hours on end. I only have a few logs left, but the conversations generally progressed from horny to irate or bizarre."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a nice article. Summary is they wanted lighter cars so accel/decel would require less power and the gas/brake system would be lighter/smaller. So then the wider gauge is helpful to increase lateral stability (to prevent tipping over) since the cars are so light.In my opinion these kinds of historical mechanical/civil engineering stories are quite interesting. Would love to see more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good to know it was for steadiness against the wind given its light construction and the original intent to have if go on (under?) the GGB deck.I’d like to know why the tracks are flat and not angled  and require regular grinding down to even out the washboard effect this causes… which results in that high pitched sound whenever it enters a curve due to slippage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Despite the District’s claim, I still wonder if the Southern Pacific had a hand in the choice of a non-standard gauge, to help make sure they’d never be ordered to take over BART and bear its operating losses. That risk might seem slight today, but it would have been more of a concern in that era, years before Amtrak, when railroads were being required by their regulators (ICC and CPUC) to operate other unprofitable passenger services.As the posting concedes, “The pamphlet does not specify why only the wide gauge of five-feet-six inches was tested and not others.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; she used the Yamaha CS-80 as her main composition instrument. She seemed to favour it particularly for its touch-sensitivity, and it was one of the few synths that offered the feature at the time.This undersells the CS-80. It had polyphonic aftertouch, which most synths don&#39;t have today.Most have velocity sensitivity, meaning each note transmits how much initial force you applied. And most have aftertouch, meaning they transmit how much force you continue to apply after hitting bottom. But for most it&#39;s just channel aftertouch, meaning it transmits the aftertouch of the key you&#39;re pressing the hardest.The CS-80 transmitted aftertouch of each individual key, and had nice controls to to adjust how it used that information. A lot of synths can use polyphonic aftertouch but only a few new ones actually have poly-AT keyboards. The ones I know of are the Hydrasynth (out for a couple years now), the Behringer UB-Xa, and the Iridium keyboard (both introduced this year).Vangelis was also a huge CS-80 fan and used it on the Blade Runner soundtrack. Incidentally, a boutique synth that replicates the CS-80 pretty well (without keyboard) is the Deckard&#39;s Dream. It&#39;s $4000 but that&#39;s way less than a vintage CS-80."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone already probably knows this, but if you search &lt;Song Name&gt; acapella or &lt;song name&gt; isolated vocals on youtube you can get the vocals to songs you want to cover. Sometimes its the original isolated, but sometimes its just someone singing it. I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun with Reverbmachine&#39;s Legends bank and vocals from youtube. Eurythmics Sweet Dreams for example.On a tangent, when I was in prison my mom died, and Kate Bush was her favorite music. Also in prison as a coping mechanism I created my own superstition that music on the radio was a message for me (I know it isn&#39;t but I needed a way to just get a little space to breath). Like Tom Petty meant the the day was going to turn out ok. So I programmed myself to be super receptive to Kate Bush being popular again and it&#39;s been amazing for my mood and productivity. Programming little positive things into my makeup has been really important in getting through stuff, be it addiction or just day to day difficulties."</p>

The formatting structs (and most cell related ones) are so tightly packed and the byte code VM for the formulas is pretty neat.I wish I could have met duanec, that guy wrote probably 10% of the code for Excel. Sadly he had retired 2 years before I started working on Excel.Fun fact: when they were about to ship Excel 1.0, they didn’t know what to name it then so they had an internal poll. The name that garnered the most votes was “Mr Spreadsheet”. Needless to say, marketing vetoed it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The filed letter (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922...) isn&#39;t the knockdown argument I would be expecting.Musk is saying, you haven&#39;t demonstrated your numbers are accurate.  But having signed the merger agreement and waived due diligence, I think he needs to demonstrate that they are _not_ accurate.  Complaining Twitter rate-limited his API access (which would be very foolish on their part) or that their bot measurement standards are &#34;arbitrary&#34; doesn&#39;t seem to get there.The letter complains that Musk asked for data allowing him to &#34;independently verify Twitter&#39;s representations regarding the number of mDAU&#34; -- but where does the agreement provide for that verification as a condition of the deal?  Maybe Twitter didn&#39;t provide sufficient information for Musk to &#34;independently verify&#34; that number -- that means nothing without showing Twitter had a duty to provide that information, or that Musk had a right to his own verification.  (Any lawyer agreeing to the other side&#39;s verification of such a thing probably isn&#39;t a very good lawyer.)The last paragraph, complaining about firings and hiring freezes and departures, seems positively desperate.  Who seriously cares about this stuff?&#34;I relied on your numbers but now they seem soft&#34; is different than &#34;I relied on your numbers but now they are clearly wrong&#34;.I have enormous respect for his engineering and business skills, he&#39;s accomplished some remarkable things.  But he doesn&#39;t seem so great as a dealmaker.  Perhaps he&#39;s badly advised, but hey, he chose his advisors.I would think Twitter will sue for specific performance, and they probably have a case.  And Musk is liable for their full market cap, and any trial would depend on a legal team that has a hard time writing a clear letter.  I think Musk is in trouble here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chancery courts will compel performance of this transaction absent a showing of an material adverse advent.  Very, very high bar.  The buyer is a highly sophisticated investor and the grounds that he is alleging form the basis of the breach of contract were and are public information that has not materially changed nor been alleged to have materially changed since the signing of the merger agreement.  Moreover, and most critically, it is not being alleged that spam accounts have any substantial impact on the earnings of Twitter.  Thus, the courts will obligate Musk to buy the business as he agreed to in April."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone thinking he can pay the 1B$ termination fee and walk away, it&#39;s not that simple.The 1B$ is a &#34;reverse breakup&#34; fee, and applies when an outside force (like SEC or financing) prevents the deal.  That 1B$ has nothing to do with any choices on either side, and is unlikely to factor into this process.At this point they&#39;re clearly going to trial, and it&#39;s not unlikely that the cost to Elon will be somewhere in the neighborhood of the difference between the fair current market value (~20B$?) and the purchase price (~44B$).My guess is it&#39;ll end up being ~10-15B$."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The utterly inefficient and overpriced Canadian telecoms exist only because we allow one specific behavior:1. A new local player comes to town, builds their own infrastructure (e.g. connects one building to fiber) and starts offering competitive service.2. Rogers/Shaw/Bell/Telus immediately offer better terms for the residents of that building.3. The competitor runs out of money and leaves.4. The telecoms revert to their usual pricing.This hurts competition, this hurts customers, this hurts long-term infrastructure resilience, but not a single politician ever comes close to even admitting the problem. I understand you cannot do it on the federal level where both major parties are on the telecoms&#39; payroll, but it could be a very low-hanging fruit for someone running for a municipal position to address. But nope, identity politics, words, feelings and fighting climate change with paper straws seem to be what the electorate wants instead. Sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in other countries probably don&#39;t understand just how powerful - and depended upon - the big telecoms are here in Canada.They have no presence outside the country - they are so bloated and inefficient they couldn&#39;t compete - but they are omnipresent here.There are lots of people who depend on Rogers for home Internet, home phone, mobile phone, TV, and home security, not to mention business services that consumers also depend on, like the payment networks that are down.Plus their media properties, which probably come in useful when the government starts to think about allowing more competition or decreasing the taxpayer money being funneled to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of people noting the lack of communication and updates from Rogers.To me it would be shocking if they were providing updates. Canada’s telecommunication monopolies are not known for their customer service and, even worse, they seem to have internal corporate cultures of entitlement and arrogance that drive an “F U” attitude in general when it comes to external communications and accountability. So you won’t see a post mortem. You won’t see timely updates. You certainly will never see some kind of status page!I’m sure Rogers will be forced to do a post-mortem for large commercial clients where contractually required, but I highly doubt we will hear a word from them about the cause of this or what was/is being done to rectify it. They probably have an ETA but feel no obligation to share it.Rogers isn’t alone. I would expect the same behaviour from Bell or Telus. Canada has serious issues when it comes to its big telco carriers and it represents major risk to the Canadian economy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder what the ramifications of this will be considering Japan is/was having elections in 2 days.RIP Abe, you weren&#39;t the greatest but nobody deserves to go that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first thing that pops into my mind is &#34;Abenomics&#34;:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomics&gt; IMF affirmed that Japan&#39;s nominal GDP contracted by $1.8 trillion during 2012–2015 while real GDP contracted at an annual rate of 6.8 percent[58] in the second quarter of 2014, after the Consumption Tax hike came into effect in April. This fall is the worst since the devastating earthquake and tsunami disaster[59][60] hit Japan in the first quarter of 2011 when the GDP shrank by an annualised 6.9 percent.So, his economic policy might have been as bad as an earthquake + tsunami.That said, he was not the only one supporting this policy, and nobody deserves to die for a mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This video has the cleanest angle if anyone curioushttps://nitter.cz/yamaneko2011/status/1545297780562096128The guy straight up walks behind him but misses the first shot. Keeps walking but Abe turns around and then the 2nd shot hits him point blank"</p>

You&#39;re not getting any praise from me. Sorry dude.I&#39;ve been eating your home-made cookies for years and still can&#39;t figure out why you make them so dry.  It&#39;s complete BS.  All I want is a little moisture in the middle of my cookies.  I do NOT understand why you have them crunchy.  It makes no sense.I have had it, and will move on from trying to understand your thinking.  Your cookies used to be nice, but now they&#39;re a massive piece of garbage, maybe you should check out the cookies in a supermarket.- Your neighbour"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is genuinely funny on Don&#39;s part, but I&#39;m sure he gets much worse emails. It&#39;s one of the &#39;joys&#39; of running a public facing product on the internet. Over the years of running PortableApps.com I&#39;ve been threatened with death, rape, abuse, doxxing, DDoS attacks, character attacks, you name it. My personal favorite was a user claiming that my donation of a kidney to my Dad - 4 years before creating portable apps - reflected badly on me and I had only done it so I could gloat about it and use it make money from users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sympathise with the author. Why should one have to put up with mails like this? I understand the argument of being professional, but it&#39;s very draining to have to absorb personal attacks and ill-mannered outbursts while never being able to respond in kind.Given that the sender didn&#39;t provide constructive feedback, is seemingly not contributing financially, and can simply choose to not use the application, I don&#39;t see why a response in kind shouldn&#39;t be given. To me, Don&#39;s response was mild."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"By default, China considers all ethnic Chinese to be Chinese nationals.&gt;In regards to the de facto practices of the Chinese government, Kris Cheng wrote in Foreign Affairs that &#34;Beijing presents nationality as an elaborate legal question, but in practice the answer is simple. Only one rule applies: If you have ever held or could have held Chinese citizenship, you are a Chinese national unless Beijing decides you are not. And even if you were born abroad but you&#39;re of Chinese descent, Beijing still feels as if it owns you.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_nationality_lawChina also requires all Chinese nationals to spy when asked.&gt;As long as national intelligence institutions are operating within their proper authorities, they may, according to Article 14, “request relevant organs, organisations, and citizens provide necessary support, assistance, and cooperation”.https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corpo..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"By this point in humanity&#39;s development, their brains had developed the ability to automatically block the parts of reality screaming for their attention, results of an economic system based on coercive consumption. Attention grabbers bifurcated into subtle, nefarious actors intent on slipping past in-brain ad-blocking and the shouters, turning up the volume and animations to make ads impossible to not see. People were subtly crippled, partially blind, now. Yet it was, after all, the mind&#39;s defense mechanism against an increasingly hostile environment trying to rob it of its most precise resource: attention.That was, of course, until they banned psychic violence in the &#34;Goddamn, get out of my brain&#34; amendment in the late 21st century."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The explanations like banner blindness, etc. make sense to me, but I think there&#39;s still a problem in our society or species in general that people simply do not read things thoroughly. And when confronted with a problem, instead of going back and reading things thoroughly, they blame someone else.How many of us software engineers have had this exact experience: Someone runs into an issue with your software that can&#39;t be papered over because of inherent complexity, and they report the problem to you. You tell them the solution, and they tell you it should be documented. You tell them it is documented, and you even tell them where. They tell you it should be more prominent.I&#39;ve had this happen where the warning was in bright red, bold letters at top in a separate box that said &#34;WARNING!&#34; but even after I sent them the link telling them it was documented, they still didn&#39;t see it.I&#39;m sure this banner could improved. I&#39;m not sure the problem could have ever been avoided or solved entirely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“‘There is a game of puzzles,’ he resumed, ‘which is played upon a map. One party playing requires another to find a given word — the name of town, river, state or empire — any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident.’”—From “The Purloined Letter” (1845) by Edgar Allen Poe"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Update from NHK:The apprehended suspect is identified as Tetsuya Yamagami (41), a Nara resident. According to sources from the defense ministry, he was employed by the Maritime Self-Defense Forces for ~3y until 2005. Weapon seems to be homemade.No updates on Abe&#39;s status since a 13:30 update from the local fire department. He&#39;s injured in chest- and neck areas, has internal bleeding and did not show vital signs.14:40: PM Kishida arrived at the PM residence by helicopter ~10minutes ago and is currently in discussions. A press conference is expected soon.14:46: Police: Suspect Yamagami says he was frustrated with what ex-PM Abe was doing and approached him with the intent of killing him.14:49: Live announcement from (a doubly understandably very sweaty and intermittently sobbing but surprisingly composed) PM Kishida: Abe is in critical condition. Hopes and prayers. Elections are ongoing. Unforgivable act. Doctors are working hard to save Abe. Not appropriate to address the political situation at this moment and I am not comfortable to do so. Cabinet members convening in Tokyo and work to be ready for any outcome. I do not have full information to be able to make any further detailed comments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wrote Hacking Healthcare for O&#39;Reilly, created ClearHealth/HealthCloud open source EMR, managed health systems for 15+ years, blah, blah, blah.It is very good there is are the transparency regulations. It is worth briefly explaining some of the reasons why many facitilities are having a hard time complying. There are some bad actors, absolutely true. However &#34;Hanlons Razor&#34; -- never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity -- definitely applies.Many health systems are a lot more like &#34;medical malls&#34; than they are single monolithic enterprises. Lots of health systems use really, really old technology and also a lot of it from a company called &#34;Epic&#34;. Epic does what it wants, when it wants and there is basically nothing anyone can do about it. There is rarely one central consistent mechanism and source of truth for pricing data because it gets generated from a complex web of different entities, systems, and processes. Herding all those cats is why it can take a health system a long time to comply. And also why a fine of even a million dollars can be small potatos vs the cost of actually complying in a timely manner.Just one facet, MUMPS is a widely used technology which you probably haven&#39;t heard of and which very few technologists understand. Lots of people are struggling to create new code to meet the new regulations using 1970s era technology including MUMPS.Another, a lot of health systems have been around a really long time. The insurers they work with also, (since the 1960s at least). They have Electronic Data Interchange EDI relationships built on the standard called 837. Business logic that surrounds pricing and billing is often buried in 50 years of tech debt. Everyone is deathly afraid of making too many changes too fast because when those systems break the money stops flowing and a health system will literally go insolvent. People still have hard physical lines connected to Medicare mainframes.This is a similar situation to other regulated industries like banking, airlines, etc. Modernization is hard, time consuming and very expensive. These regulations are a good driver for all that, but it takes time. Having been in some of these boardrooms there is not typically a cartel of evil executives figuring out how to screw patients. A lot of the time it is a group of relatively normal people trying to hold up a technological and business process house of cards with chewing gum, paper clips and hope.Disclaimer: I have been involved with the development of some of the fee schedules and health systems mentioned/criticized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When High Deductible Insurance was introduced the supposed concept was to &#34;give employees a stake in their costs, and therefore lower them for both employer and employee.&#34;However, even today doing so is very challenging, and before laws like this it was essentially impossible. There&#39;s no way to shop around American healthcare, with the system itself working against you at every turn (e.g. doctors prescribing named brand, and you not be allowed to switch back to generic without another $100+ appointment).You can try calling and getting quotes, but they&#39;ll just waste a bunch of time and then give you a RANGE with no assurances. Even getting the quote requires your doctor to write up the entire work-order, which itself can get pushback, and or cost money.Then you have random things like for-profit life flights, which are automatic bankruptcy machines. Imagine one minute driving down the road, then suddenly waking up in a hospital, and then getting billed $80K for just the trip to get there let alone your hospital treatment or recovery. And insurance doesn&#39;t cover it.Aside but all ambulances around me are &#34;out of network&#34; and don&#39;t work with insurance at all. So I guess I should shop around by moving cities..?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to read that only 33%-50% of hospitals comply with the law and post their prices.  If there&#39;s one thing this country needs to do it&#39;s demand transparency everywhere.Especially our government.  Spending.  Salaries.  It all needs to be public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better formulation of DRY is SPOT (Single Point Of Truth). Definitions (code, data) that represent the same “truth”, i.e. when one changes all have to change to represent a consistent truth, should be reduced to a single definition.  For example, if there is a rule that pizzas need at least one topping, there should only be a single place where that condition is expressed, so that when the rule changes, it isn’t just changed in one place but not the others. Another example is when fixing a bug, you don’t want to have to fix it in multiple places (or, more likely, neglect to fix it in the other places)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I read an article like this, &#34;why &lt;often cited best practice&gt; is overrated&#34;, I think, yeah you are right in theory. But most places I have worked, these best practices were not overused, but underused. If you have the problem that your coworkers create unneccessary abstractions, I envy you, because I have so often had the opposite problem. Maybe this is not the case if you work in a great software development team. But if you work somewhere where they do software development on the side (science, hardware, etc..) it is the main issue.People not able to factor out functions or structure their code in a readable way. Variables are called v1, v2, v3. Unit testing seen as a waste of time. CI seen as a fun toy. They lack the experience to even notice the difference.Maybe I&#39;m becoming a curmudgeon, but I think many people would be well served by just googling &#34;&lt;my programming language&gt; best practices&#34;, learning the acronyms like DRY, and just following them. And when you have gained some experience, sure, then you should question the wisdom and not follow it blindly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  Instead of our code being architected around the concept of how pizzas are made in the abstract, its architecture is tightly coupled to the specific needs of these two pizzas that we happened to be dealing with. The chance that we will be putting this code back the way it was is extremely high.Mistake 1: Switch from DRY to premature optimization.&gt; You might think that legit reasonable developers but would not actually do something like this and would instead go back to the existing invocations and modify them to get a nice solution, but I&#39;ve seen this happen all over the place.Mistake 2: Assumption of incompetence to support your argument.&gt; . As soon as we start the thought process of thinking how to avoid a copy paste and refactor instead, we are losing the complexity battle.Mistake 3: Strawman argument. DRY does NOT lead to over-complicating things.
Overcomplicating things leads to overcomplicating things.Now, i wasted 5 minutes, so you can waste some more to reply to this comment, instead of completely ignoring this dumb random blog post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The maritime coverage map shows coastal coverage around countries with inland coverage right now, i.e. they are bouncing the connection via one of their satellites to a nearby groundstation.Starting in Q4/2022 they want to cover mid-latitudes around the globe. That might mean that they plan to enable inter-satellite links then? (This is a bit surprising - on one hand, this step extends coverage towards higher and lower latitudes but on the other hand not as much as they already have inland-coverage (cf. Brazil). It also extends longitudinally around all of the globe?).Coverage above mid-latitudes requires satellites in polar orbits to join the network. (Their non-polar orbits have an inclination of 53° which means that satellites go no further north or south than that (plus a bit whatever their range is)).https://api.starlink.com/public-files/maritime-coverage-map...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always described myself as a person with zero ability to multitask.  Always have been, always will be.  Every time I cook, my wife about has a panic attack watching me fumble around, forgetting things, looking for things, oh god that&#39;s burning, etc.Back on topic, I absolutely cannot listen to music with words when I code.  I&#39;ll intermittently type lyrics instead of what I was intending to do.  Anyone else cursed with such a thing?If anyone cares, I actually like a lot of the vaporwave/outrun/whatever it&#39;s called now stuff when coding.  Techno is a bit too jarring, and while I love classical, it either puts me to sleep or carries me away in thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of my go-tos are Solar Fields and Infected Mushroom. Both are electronic; former is calm/ambient focus, latter is energetic/driving focus. Both have huuuge discographies that you can just put on shufflehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ldYxgJQG_Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQmvPQ0MmiYSolar Fields actually did the Mirror&#39;s Edge game soundtracks too, if you&#39;ve played those. Really nice mix of ambient, almost meditative sounds. Often there&#39;s a super long, repetitive, pulsing buildup to a brief higher-energy section at the end of a trackInfected Mushroom is a wild mix of heavy Israeli dance-electronica, trance, and even rock, with a dash of metal here and there"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just quickly scrolled through my collection and here are some random, but fantastic instrumental albums I&#39;ve used while &#34;in the zone&#34;:  - Miles Davis: In a Silent Way
  - Brian Eno: Ambient 4: On Land
  - Godspeed You! Black Emperor: F♯ A♯ ∞ (one of my favourite albums. listen with your best headphones. HD650s are good)
  - Aphex Twin: Selected Ambient Works Volume II
  - Mozart: Requiem (my first proper introduction to classical. I was absolutely blown away)
  - Boards of Canada - Music Has the Right to Children
  - Sun O))): Black One (extremely experimental doom metal. the musicality of it is questionable at times but it&#39;s fantastic to study to)
  - Sleep: Jerusalem (occasional vocals but trust me they&#39;re not distracting)
  - Tim Hecker: Harmony in Ultraviolet
  - Bill Evans: Sunday at the Village Vanguard

The worst part about these sorts of things is that 30 seconds after posting I&#39;ll remember all the awesome albums I forgot and kick myself for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very nice, I thought it was a basic wrapper around SQLite but then realized it actually had more features then that, such as it&#39;s own admin dashboard. Then I realized you built multiple auth designs into the system, then I realized there was a javascript SDK to interact with it, then I found your beautiful documentation site, then I realized there is an actual product inspiring it&#39;s development (https://presentator.io/)Each of these is another encouragement to use pocketbase. I went from &#34;eh, I&#39;ll just keep my own wrapper&#34; to &#34;pocketbase has a lot of promise, I should try it&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PocketBase is a small open source project that I&#39;ve been working for the last couple of months.You could think of PocketBase as a lightweight Firebase/Supabase alternative.In short, it is an open source Go backend (framework and app) consisting of:- embedded database (SQLite) with realtime subscriptions\- backed-in files and users management- convenient Admin dashboard UI- simple REST-ish APIAnd all of this compiles to a single portable binary.It&#39;s still a little rough around the edges, but you could give it a try and share your feedback."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks very nice.One thing I noticed is you are using server sent events for subscriptions.  SSE have a lot of nice properties but do have one nasty limitation (from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent...):&#34;Warning: When not used over HTTP/2, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be especially painful when opening multiple tabs, as the limit is per browser and is set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as &#34;Won&#39;t fix&#34; in Chrome and Firefox. This limit is per browser + domain, which means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to www.example1.com and another 6 SSE connections to www.example2.com (per Stackoverflow). When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).&#34;This can lead to some weird bug reports from users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roblox is horrendous. It is as dangerous as any dark corner of the Internet, except that it appears child-friendly to parents. It _seems_ to have controls, and _seems_ to restrict bad behaviour, but it does not, and cannot. My daughter was roped into an online paedophile ring when she was 12. The initial contacts and grooming were made through Roblox... almost right under our noses. Every time we, as parents, looked at what she was doing, it seemed okay. We could have dug deeper, but did not. Luckily we caught it before it progressed too far, but some damage was done.Wherever you can, tell parents to flat-out block Roblox.Edit: Because people are asking how it works.Roblox is a lot about bragging rights for individuals. You gain skins, trade for rare items, buy Robux for real money that can be used to buy items. Players flock around those that that have rare or expensive items. My daughter had a &#34;super super happy face&#34;. I just googled, and it is current selling for $350. It makes them feel wanted and important. So just like fornite and skins in other games.The groomers feed the celebrity, sense of community and so on to engage in chat. It starts as in-game chat, which you can never see the history of, before moving to DMs. The chat has tricks to get around removed words, so they all communicate in some sort of code that they all pick up along the way. Then they are able to divert them to other platforms where there are fewer controls. My daughter was made to create instagram account and an a porn one. Then they follow up on other platform calls (or phone calls) and follow the usual grooming techniques.The trick is to identify the marks by how they behave in the game, and in the more popular, and social ones, I think that it is quite easy (in retrospect)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like Hearthstone is a good example of the maximum amount of communication two strangers can have on the Internet.  You can choose 6 pre-made things to say to your opponent; Thanks, Well Played, Greeting, Wow, Oops, Threaten.  This might be too much; I have definitely seen people get mad from their opponent using the voice lines too much.My thought is that this significantly reduces the richness of the in-game interactions (implies less engagement, implies less revenue), but doesn&#39;t need moderators to keep the game from being used for illegal sexual encounters, which is nice if your game targets kids."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the challenges here is that the incentives are misaligned.  It&#39;s well-understood in the cash-shop games industry that most of the revenue comes from &#34;whales&#34;, users that buy large quantities.  In a game targeted at children, who themselves don&#39;t have income/credit cards, it&#39;s unlikely that the &#34;whales&#34; are in the target demographic.  Rather, it is likely most of the &#34;whales&#34; are adults who are spending large in order to use the in-game currency to exploit interactions with others.Not only was this predictable, it seems nearly by design.  I don&#39;t see how Roblox can ever fix this without fundamentally changing their business model.  Their business model is essentially structured to enable commercial sexual exploitation of children over mobile platforms.On my own network I used various means to make it impossible for anyone to use Roblox, music.ly, TikTok, et al.  Services that are targeted specifically at children but provide a pathway for semi-anonymous communication are already ripe for exploitation by bad actors, the microtransactions aspect of Roblox just makes it even worse.It&#39;s ironic, but platforms intended for adults tend to be safer for children, because they don&#39;t concentrate bad actors in the same way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of taking on SOC 2 is also choosing whether you want your attitude to be &#34;Let&#39;s do the minimum to get past the audit&#34; and &#34;Let&#39;s take this framework, and figure out where we can learn from it.&#34;The post mentions background checks. On the one hand, I understand there&#39;s a real issue with these. On the other, if my PAAS isn&#39;t ensuring repeat offender fraudsters don&#39;t have access to sensitive data, that&#39;s possibly an area of concern. Hopefully the things they took from the other mentioned company do increase due diligence in vetting employees who have access to sensitive/regulated information.Use it as a framework to actually think about BCP, DRP, etc, etc, and it won&#39;t be a total waste of time.Edit:
Also adding I bring up background checks as an example of learning from vetted practices, rather than trying to attack the decisions of fly. I respect this article, especially where it&#39;s easy for people on the internet to criticize decisions, when the reality is security is a series of tradeoffs, and to function as a business means having imperfect processes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This content marketing is so good I don’t even know if I’d call it marketing: it is legit educational with a weak (in a good way) “throw some money at us” CTA. Bravo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This is the only issue we ended up having to seriously back-and-forth with our auditors about. We held the line on refusing to do background checks, and ultimately got out of it after tracking down another company our auditors had worked with, finding out what they did instead of background checks, stealing their process, and telling our auditors “do what you did for them”. This worked fine.What process did that company use instead of background checks, that you ended up doing as well?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"De-nuclearization of other European countries is a long-held goal of the German environmentalist movement and the Green party. It&#39;s understandable that France doesn&#39;t want to go with that, as they don&#39;t want to be forced down the same ruinous path we&#39;re currently on here in Germany. And honestly, good for them.It&#39;s just sad to see how little actual science is respected in Germany. I did my PhD at the French nuclear energy agency and my French colleagues would always be puzzled when I talked about German energy policies and our anti-nuclear sentiment. But here in Germany the Green party will probably never reverse it&#39;s stance on nuclear energy, as their rise to popularity was strongly fueled by the anti-nuclear movement from the 80s and it&#39;s the one thing they can&#39;t abandon without losing a large number of followers.I partially blame the highly ideological stance on the way people rise to power in politics and administration in Germany. In France, top positions in the administration are usually filled by people that are technically excellent and have gone through the system of grandes écoles (ENS, ENA, X, ...), whereas in Germany most people rise through social engineering and party politics and most top positions in the administration are filled by people with law degrees that don&#39;t have a clue about technology. In my opinion that&#39;s also a reason why we completely fail in everything regarding digitalization, lawyers are simply not good technical problem solvers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know how I know environmentalists are just dragging their feet on nuclear for ideological reasons?When we talk about a storage facility for nuclear waste, a scenario they insist you prepare for: if human civilization completely collapses to the point that any of the currently spoken languages on earth are no longer able to be read how to we keep the, whatever comes after us, from busting up the concrete and digging down deep into the earth and playing with it. That&#39;s the last gasp of someone out of obstructionist ideas. I&#39;ve had these people tell me that launching the waste into the sun would be dangerous for the sun, they aren&#39;t serious and need to be ignored.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warn..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About time. Nuclear is hardly an environmental risk even compared to the &#34;cleaner&#34; fossil fuels like gas.Hopefully this will allow the EU to return to competitive reactors designs instead of leaving China to pull humanities weight on that front.Though tbh I wouldn&#39;t be sad if we bought Chinese reactors until we are back up to speed, having Chinese nuclear &gt; no nuclear. Everyone bitching about China stealing IP finally have something to steal back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This kind of highlights a subtle interactive design or user experience component of the Trolley problem.Part of the Trolley Problem is that the choice is between an action or inaction.  But these problems, or the first one at least, have two buttons.So you&#39;re making a choice.  Yeah, some might argue it&#39;s a technicality.  But what if you put the Do Nothing choice on a timer?What if you made it an asynchronous &#34;Problem of the Day&#34;.  No action by the end of the day triggers Do Nothing, etc.Lots of cool, interesting design choices.  There&#39;s an unstated subtle ultimatum hidde. in these problems, but still cool.Sorry, geeking out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Level 20 was weird. It was a choice between letting a trolley run as normal (&#34;emits CO2, kills 3 people in accidents over 30 years&#34;) or running it into a brick wall and decommissioning it. For some reason more people picked the latter. So, they just dislike public transit? What about the emissions and death rate when everyone switches to cars instead?Goes to show how easily the context and exact wording of a question can sway people&#39;s opinions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let&#39;s not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.This is a huge step forward for iPhone users. Look, I get it. From the typical HN perspective, this potentially looks like a lot of hype. But many of you aren&#39;t looking at from a high level.In the world we are now living in; even what&#39;s happening in the United States right now, being able to protect yourself from well-funded, determined attackers for the average person couldn&#39;t come at a better time.There&#39;s a huge gap between Fortune 500 executives, government officials, etc. and regular people in terms of the resources available to them to prevent state-sponsored attackers. It doesn&#39;t take much these days to go from a nobody to being on somebody&#39;s radar.If you&#39;re a woman seeking an abortion in a state where it&#39;s illegal or severely restricted, you could be the target of malware from your local or state government or law enforcement. In Texas, you can sue anyone who aids and abets a woman who attempts to get an abortion for $10,000, which is enough to get someone to trick someone into installing malware on a phone.No, it&#39;s not China or Russia coming for you but it doesn&#39;t take much to ruin someone&#39;s life.I don&#39;t think this is virtue signaling or marketing hype by Apple; if anything, this is right in alignment with the stance they&#39;ve had on privacy for years. Even for a company the size of Apple, putting up $10 million to fund organizations that investigate, expose, and prevent highly targeted cyberattacks isn&#39;t pocket change.At the end of the day, this is all good news for user privacy and security going forward. I also suspect if I lockdown my iPhone, my other compatible devices using the same Apple ID will also lockdown. No IT department required."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am so excited about this news. I understand that some people are pessimistic, and view it as a &#34;giving up&#34; on complete security against nation-states. I think that&#39;s the wrong way to analyze the situation.The dream I have is someone making a phone that is purpose-built to be secure against state actors. Unfortunately, this makes very little economic sense, and probably won&#39;t happen (maybe if some rich person started a foundation or something?). The phone would need to have pretty restricted functionality and would not be generally appealing to mass market consumers.As it stands, securing a mass market modern smartphone, even from just remote attacks, is just intractable. We should not bury our heads in the sand and wishfully think that if they just spend a little more money, close a few more bugs, and make the sandboxing a little better, somehow iOS 16 or Android 13 will finally be completely secure against state actors. The set of features being shipped will grow fast enough that security mitigations will not someday &#39;catch up&#39;.This is the next best thing! The more we can give users the freedom to lock down their devices, the more the vision of an actual solution comes into view. This is the first step towards perhaps our only hope of solving this someday - applying formal methods and lots of public scrutiny to a small &#39;trusted code base&#39;, and finally telling NSO group to fuck off.Even this dream may not pan out, but at least we can have hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With this announcement, Apple are saying &#34;we will protect you from state actors&#34;, which is a role usually performed by states.

Security researchers talk about protections from state actors all the time, and there are tools which support that... but this is the first public announcement, and tool, from a corporation with more spare, unrestricted capital than many countries. It comes at a time when multiple nation states are competing for energy and food security; and Apple are throwing up a flag for a security-security fight (or maybe data-security). This is not just handy tech, it&#39;s full-on cultural zeitgeist stuff. Amazing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two points to highlight from this article:1. LinkedIn is an absolute godsend for bad guys, allowing easy targeting of everyone in the company with spear phishing emails and texts. I know many security professionals no longer use their real name, and don&#39;t list the real name of their company, because they know it&#39;s such a great hacking vector. Not sure what/whether LinkedIn can do anything about this.2. I wish there were more information about what the vulnerability was in the PDF in the first place. I think a lot of people would be wary of downloading a PDF from a stranger, but not from someone who you had multiple interview rounds with and who offered you a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got to say, this is an incredibly cyberpunk article.&gt; Ronin, the Ethereum-linked sidechain that underpins play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, lost $540 million in crypto to an exploit in March. While the US government later tied the incident to North Korean hacking group Lazarus, full details of how the exploit was carried out have not been disclosed.It&#39;s not in William Gibson&#39;s style, sounds more like Bruce Sterling&#39;s.&gt; Axie Infinity was huge. At its peak, workers in Southeast Asia were even able to earn a living through the play-to-earn game. It boasted 2.7 million daily active users and $214 million in weekly trading volume for its in-game NFTs in November last year — although both numbers have since plummeted.&gt; Earlier this year, staff at Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis were approached by people purporting to represent the fake company and encouraged to apply for jobs, according to the people familiar with the matter. One source added that the approaches were made through the professional networking site LinkedIn.Also gives me Charles Stross vibes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those that don&#39;t want to read the whole thing, (supposedly) the attackers reached out on linkedin to a bunch of employees asking them to apply to a fake company. One of them did it, went through a bunch of fake interviews, and then got a fake offer, in the form of a PDF.They opened the PDF and that installed a keylogger on their system (it doesn&#39;t explain how).The attackers then used that engineer&#39;s credentials to take over 4 of the 9 validators on the blockchain which they then used for their heist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the unfortunate reality of India; the government/police don&#39;t need to actually go to court. It can harass companies and executives by simply threatening to / actually carrying out unnecessary &#39;raids&#39; through the tax department.The usual process is for the a bunch of policemen and beareaucrats to just show up unannounced; seal the office so that no one can enter or leave, and seize computers / phones, files and demand random stuff like invoices for $10 purchases from three years ago and so on. This can happen regularly until all business basically comes to a halt (unless the company complies with whatever the government wants). [1]The next step is to threaten arrests and actually carry out some arrests on trumped up charge, and you can wait forever until trial (unless you comply with what the government wants). The trials usually result in acquittal after several years but the process is the punishment. The media in the meanwhile is happy to go along with the official version (that the company is question is allegedly employing shady accounting practices).The next stage is painting the company as &#39;anti national&#39;, arrange for a few mobs to harrass folks / attempt lynchings and finally actually &#39;dissappear&#39;/kill people (this last step is usually reserved for judges/writers etc since others usually comply before this step)[1]: https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/10/02/indias-government-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rule of law is a joke in India.Center has central agencies and each states has their own police department. 
So whenever there is a noticeable criticism from someone centre or state govt will send their police/agency your way. You will be detained, put through the worst conditions and false charges will be filed. Most of these charges don&#39;t hold in higher courts but the damage is done. You will suffer, a lot. 
You will not dare to speak up again.This is even so comical, sometimes centre will send agencies against another party politicians in power in a state they are not in power, and state will send police for local politicians from centre party.
(https://scroll.in/article/1027571/how-the-modi-government-ha...)Sometimes diff state police with diff party governments fight with each other.
(https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/sto...)And sometimes police will just plant evidence in your email with their work email address as backup email address. They literally jailed bunch of very old left activists with fake charges by hacking their email accounts.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More big companies that use open source should do this or something similar. The dividends to security, developer productivity, etc are probably extremely high, particularly for a company with hundreds or thousands of engineers already. It&#39;s such an efficient use of money to give it to the people who already have the expertise to do the work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such great news for ruby. Here’s hoping with these resources rubygems and bundler can add improved support for signature verification. Rubygems supports gem signing but without a good scheme for trust, key rotation, etc it is not particularly usable.  Sprucing this aspect of the ecosystem up would go a long way towards allowing ruby to maintain its historical role at the vanguard of language specific package management.Another thing I would love to see is the ability to incorporate a signed attestation that a gem was built from a given signed commit. A common dirty trick by supply-chain blackhats is to publish a gem which contains code other than that of the corresponding tag in source control.  Given that rubygems has no means to browse package contents other than downloading and extracting the tarballs for manual inspection this means that people typically reference changelog or diff links on source control hosts, despite the fact that those diffs will only be accurate for gems published by good-faith actors following platform norms.There are a number of ways to fix this and I sure hope one of them gets implemented."</p>

I tend to find the big view and small view videos with the same level ease.*Also a premium subscriber. Youtube in many ways is a necessary part of this version of the internet experience and I detest having to sit through all the ads...if I have to pay $10/month seems fair to me.
