I th8nk this line is telling: &#34;Since there are no known victims/ targets for the ransomware group, their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures remain unknown.&#34;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a risk if any great outbreak here. A bunch of scriptkiddies took some open source project and modified it with some silly instructions.Alternatively, I could see this used in one of those scam calls. They set up remote accesslike normally and then months laltrr the6 infrct their victims and the &#34;trusted Microsoft technician&#34; gives them a call to steal even more off their money. This time there&#39;s an actual piece of malware that gets removed, solidifying trust in the scammers even though they were the ones to infect the victims in the first place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I took pandemic time to learn some knots, and then forget a bunch of them that didn&#39;t offer enough distinct utility to me.  I highly recommend the Farrimond Friction Hitch: https://www.animatedknots.com/farrimond-friction-hitch-knotIt&#39;s simple and fast to tie (with a little practice for muscle memory), and with an extra turn has exceptional friction preventing loop collapse in some situations where even a bowline would have an issue.  However, by relieving tension on one side of the knot, like a taut-line hitch it can slide.I use it for its common application of tensioning, but I also find it useful for cinching. It can go anywhere a cord lock might have been useful in but a few seconds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite knot is the Zeppelin Bend: [1]It&#39;s used to tie the ends of two ropes together.It&#39;s super easy to tie, super easy to untie (when you want to), and will not untie accidentally.[1] - https://www.animatedknots.com/zeppelin-bend-knot"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like Knots3D, but there are some alternatives that made it easier for me:1. The Klutz Book of Knots (it&#39;s a book with holes around the pages so you can practice the knots next to their instructions). I think it&#39;s supposed to be a kid&#39;s book, but I bought for myself few years ago and was probably the resource I used the most.2. I find it _much_ easier to learn how to tie a knot by watching someone&#39;s hands while they explain what they&#39;re doing. KnottingKnots on Youtube is incredible at that:
https://www.youtube.com/c/KnottingKnots/I think the knots I use the most, both in everyday life as well as for hiking are (from most used to least used):  - Trucker Hitch
  - Bowline knot
  - Clove hitch
  - Figure of Eight knot (bend too but less often)
  - Sheet Bend
  - Prusik knot
  - Square knot
  - Taut line hitch"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article and great collection of links!I have taken up coding simple SVG icons by hand, and it&#39;s easier than it looks. Also, a great feature of SVG is the &lt;defs&gt; element, which lets one define shapes anywhere in an HTML page, and reuse them anywhere else (ie, not inside the same SVG).So for example one can have an SVG element at the top of the page that lists a bunch of symbols in a global defs element, and reuse them at will some other places, without loading anything externally, or copy-pasting anything.Used shapes can also be transformed: different colors for fill or stroke, scaled up or down, rotated, moved, etc.&gt; Good news, you can achieve fractional ratings with only CSS and inline SVG. Samuel Kraft explains how it works.The technique presented in that other page is overly complex and convoluted.Fractional stars can be done very simply in pure SVG with gradients. Here&#39;s an example of a grey star filled at 40% with red:    &lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewbox=&#34;0 0 60 60&#34;&gt;
      &lt;defs&gt;
        &lt;polygon points=&#34;30,0 10,60 60,22 0,22 50,60&#34; id=&#34;star&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;/defs&gt;
      &lt;linearGradient id=&#34;gradid&#34;&gt;
        &lt;stop offset=&#34;40%&#34; stop-color=&#34;red&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;stop stop-color=&#34;grey&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;/linearGradient&gt;
      &lt;use href=&#34;#star&#34; fill=&#34;url(&#39;#gradid&#39;)&#34;/&gt;
      &lt;/svg&gt;

In order to change the fill one just needs to manipulate the offset attribute of the first stop.If there are many stars it can be tiresome to attach a different gradient to each star; what I do in that case is define 8 gradients from 10% to 90% fill, and reference them as needed for each object that needs to be filled to approx. that percentage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These are great! I found out recently that GitHub supports SVGs in your profile README so couldn&#39;t resist setting up a huge animation on mine[1], you can&#39;t run JavaScript in SVGs unless they are inlined with the HTML but maybe it would be possible to setup a GitHub action to automatically generate it periodically.https://github.com/jnordberg"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"sounds like the same experience I have with pretty much every language I&#39;m not used to.I just want to try this C++, download, unzip, oh it&#39;s windows so .project file. Fine, redo on windows , oh it&#39;s 3 versions of vstuido old and says it wants to upgrade , okay. Hmm errors. Try to fix. Now it&#39;s getting linking error.repeat the same with xcode and any project in c, c++, objc, swiftokay how about ruby? oh I have old ruby , hmmm , try to install new ruby, seems to run, but it can&#39;t find certain gems or something. oh and this other ruby thing I was using is now broken ? why do I have to install this stuff globally? You don&#39;t but there are several magic spells you must execute and runes you must set in the rigtt places. Oh ... I think I got that setup but it getting this new error.....I&#39;m sypathetic it sucks but it&#39;s not unique to js"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience also. As a backend engineer trying to create a front end app, the whole toolchain of JS, bundlers, minifiers, Typescript, React... is basically; works if you have one magical init script that wires up everything, and much more than you really need since its tailored for more complex apps, but if you need just simplest thing, like run Typescript app in browser, well, good luck with that! Hundreds of tutorials (unofficial blog posts) on internents, none of them work.   
Front end dev work is broken.Also, funny experience: asked few senior FE devs how to configure React, webpack and TS manually, absolutely nobody could do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"JS tooling has come a long way in the last couple of years, Vite for example is so much better than everything that came before. Esbuild is incredible and clearly the future of all JS build tools.The trouble is that to people who are only just outside JS ecosystem it’s not very accessible. If you are a PHP, Python or Ruby developer who cut your teeth in the era of jQuery or earlier (prototype.js &amp; script.aculo.us!) it can be quite difficult to make the transition.Combining the modern JS environments with platforms like Django, Laravel or Rails often means having to install and setup from scratch a full Node/NPM toolchain in parallel with your backend toolchain. I believe this is some of the reason for such a disconnect between the the “backend” and “frontend” unless you go 100% JS. I think it&#39;s pushed a lot of devs who used to think of themselves as &#34;full stack&#34; towards the backend.I’m trying to fix this with Tetra (https://www.tetraframework.com) for the Django ecosystem, the plan is to eventually bundle a esbuild/postcss/sass/less toolchain along with built in tools for installing JS dependancies so you can completely live within the Python/Django environment. It will manage all the complexities of JS tooling for you.The vast majority of developers don&#39;t want to think about tooling, they just want to build something quickly and get it out there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was going to criticize &amp; point out how usb-c chargers at and over 100W are just so small, but there&#39;s a photo comparing it to an iphone &amp; ok, it looks adequately impressively dense! (I have a &gt;2 year old 100W charger that is 66x64x30mm, this 250W unit is 170x50x25)It&#39;s been such a great synergy. Energy efficiency has been a concern already yes, but I really view usb-c chargers as pushing the consumerization &amp; massification &amp; development of this technology to the superb, common, un-exotic levels it&#39;s come down to. We just got tired of doing less good, actively explored trying to use a somewhat harder to drive switching semiconductor, &amp; have reaped great rewards. Miniaturization mandated optimization &amp; we all win. I really think the interchangable-parts/modularity &amp; resulting competition that usb-c begot started this ball rolling.(Hoping USB-PD, with it&#39;s bump from 20 up to 48V, once again proves another huge win!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"$145 is pretty steep, and I&#39;d like to see the Vpp (also called ripple) before considering this. I currently use picoPSU (ASIN B005TWE5E6), 50W and 80W versions to power 7th and 8th gen atoms and celerons. I use a &#34;UPS&#34; style 12VDC PSU connected to a fairly large sealed lead acid battery - about 4x the volume of a standard UPS battery. As far as my measurements go with the induced noise from the PSU for radio reception work, it seems to work pretty good. I&#39;ve looked at using SBCs instead, but you&#39;re never really going to get away from buck/boost on boards, since some things need 3.3 or less volts (memory, etc). The picoPSU also have survived for years up in elevator attics with all of the machinery and dust. never had an outage caused by the picoPSU or the attached 12V UPS stuff.I wonder if it is possible to run more than one board off the same PSU. I know you can run a board off multiple PSUs, but is the inverse true? If i ever get a new batch of these 25W TDP computers racked, having 2 of these connected to two UPS and 6 computers might be cool. It&#39;s just the ATX connector that needs population, i use NVME whenever possible, no GPU, no cards, just USB and ethernet onboard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context: I’ve been working with iOS full time since a few years before Swift came out.A few startups ago we built our app using SwiftUI 1.0. At that time, while 90% of it was fantastic, 10% was either unworkable or extremely unreliable, causing for some maddening bugs. The documentation was laughable so for these reasons I chose to do the app for a subsequent startup in UIKit.Fast forward to my most recent company; decided to give SwiftUI another shot (targeting iOS 14 &amp; SwiftUI 2). I am 100% glad we did. It’s been pretty incredible; we’ve built a reasonably complex banking app at a pace not possible with UIKit. The animations in particular are crazy good to work with; we’ve got some very complex animated flows that would have taken weeks and thousands of lines with UIKit… with SwiftUI it was about 5 days.It’s definitely not without its downsides; documentation is still slim at best, but there’s plenty of blogs and resources (https://swiftui-lab.com/ is the most helpful IMO) available now. There are also still some maddening bugs that appear in production and take a day or two of head scratching only to discover it’s a bug in the framework (most recently; using #available causes code to crash on the platform it’s protecting against lol), but there are always workarounds. Still, time wasted on these has been vastly outweighed by the weeks / months of time saved.Finally, you can always use UIKit as an escape hatch through UIViewRepresentable.iOS 15 is at 85% adoption, so we plan to drop support for 14 somewhat soon, which will give us an even more robust framework as well as async await APIs. Not feasible for most companies I know, but even supporting 14+ Will be pretty reasonable when iOS 16 drops in September."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You could write an opposite article featuring people using SwiftUI that have never touched UIKit or iOS code before and it would be nothing but glowing praise.That&#39;s kinda like my story. Covid started and I wanted to learn something new so I started with Swift/SwiftUI. 2 years later I&#39;ve been doing tons of crazy custom stuff in my portfolio tracker app https://stocketa.com (not launched yet) - I kept a thread with my progress since the first day I started my journey: https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/1527288954935922688 (scroll up).This was last june but I wrote about my experience with SwiftUI at the time: https://paulstamatiou.com/getting-started-with-swiftui/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really looking forward to what comes of it, but I have chosen to do my current major project in UIKit.A couple of reasons:1) The documentation for SwiftUI, when I started (about two years ago) was awful. I was shocked at how bad it was. I believe that it has since improved.2) I knew of no major apps (even Apple ones) that had been done with it.I already knew that UIKit was up to the task, and held my nose, while I set things up. It&#39;s working out extremely well, but (of course) I&#39;d like to rewrite the whole thing (a sure sign that I&#39;m approaching ship).I like things like the MVVM pattern, but it&#39;s been my experience that it&#39;s really not such a good idea to implement it in UIKit, because UIKit was designed explicitly for MVC. I have learned that those ugly-ass UIViewControllers are really important, and I circumvent them at my peril.I&#39;m able to release fairly basic Apple apps in UIKit, in just hours, so speed of development isn&#39;t compelling.What is compelling, is the ability to design a reactive system for a complex app (like the one I&#39;m writing now). AppKit has allowed this for some time, and it&#39;s possible to force UIKit to do it (but it isn&#39;t really designed for that).I really wish that SwiftUI had been a bit more mature, when I started this system, but I would have also needed to rewrite the two server SDKs I use, anyway. It wouldn&#39;t have worked, no matter how hard I bang my heels together.But I&#39;m looking forward to it.One thing that I&#39;ve learned, is that it&#39;s really OK to wait for things to mature. Companies always screech about how we need to jump on the bandwagon, but that&#39;s all hype. I have taken OpenDoc courses at Apple DU. I also busted my ass, getting my app ready for Copland. I have scars from Apple hype.I did take a big chance, by jumping directly into Swift, but that has turned out to be a good decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing to note is that the 2021 population is an estimate, and if you are a Census buff as I am, and compare the Census&#39; 2019 estimates to the 2020 actual populations (as calculated from the census), there are often very large differences.The article also says that CA&#39;s estimate of the population decline is much smaller, and arguably CA itself would have more accurate data for this particular metric (residency and voter rolls).So while I&#39;m sure the gist of the argument is true, there is probably a larger margin of error on the calculation than you&#39;d think at first glance. I&#39;m not quite going to say the article is sensationalist, but if you look at the totality of the data (house prices, rental prices, CA&#39;s population estimates, etc), I&#39;m not sure the &#34;SF is in freefall&#34; narrative holds up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think remote work is often understated in reasons people move away. When you go into the office every day, it&#39;s pretty obvious that you have to live in whatever city you live in. But with remote work, the question becomes &#34;if I don&#39;t have to live here, do I want to keep living here&#34;. For many (including myself), the answer was a definitive NO.Sure many headlines and news segments make it seem that it&#39;s the crime, the high rent, and all these super visible indicators and while I&#39;m sure that factored into the decisions of some, for many it was that they just wanted a change and got the golden opportunity to do so.EDIT: It&#39;s not even that one may even &#34;want a change&#34;, it&#39;s when you&#39;re presented with the opportunity to make a change, the gears in your head start turning as to what options you have at your disposal. I would imagine many people that moved had previously no intention to but just got the opportunity and decided to take it while it lasted."</p>

Rent prices still hasn&#39;t gone back to pre pandemic level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the consequences of the effectiveness of click-bait titles on youtube is that searching for videos you watched historically is extremely difficult, because quite often the primary thing in the video is never mentioned in the title. The descriptions are almost universally used to store common links that are about the channel not the video and the consequence of this is that click-bait titled content is very hard to find after the fact. The other problem is quite a lot of channels are testing one title and then changing to another, the video wont then be found using the initial title and so even if you do remember elements of the title the channel may have made that impossible to use some hours or days later as another title with better performance was used.I can see a need for search in the contents of the videos but I don&#39;t want to specify the channel, I likely don&#39;t know especially since channels can also change their name."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey HN! I just launched VideoMentions Search, a free tool that allows you to search YouTube to find videos that contain specific spoken words.Here&#39;s how to quickly try it out -Let&#39;s say you want to find every video on The Verge&#39;s YouTube channel within the last several months in which &#34;MacBook Pro&#34; is mentioned. Here&#39;s a pre-populated search to accomplish that:https://videomentions.com/search?channelUrl=https%253A%252F%...If you follow that ^ link, then click the button to perform the search, you&#39;ll see all matching videos, with every single mention of &#34;MacBook Pro&#34; highlighted.My favorite part is that all the highlighted matches are timestamped. So you can click on any of them to jump to that exact moment in the video when that keyword was said!VideoMentions Search is great for these scenarios:- You want to find all videos within a YouTube channel that mention your brand, your product, or the topics you care about.- You remember watching a video where a certain topic was discussed, and now you&#39;re trying to remember which video it was to rewatch it.- You run your own YouTube channel and want to quickly find the exact moments in your videos where you cover certain topics, so you can link others to that content.I have wanted a way to search YouTube based on spoken words for a while. I couldn&#39;t find a tool that provides that capability though, so I built it!I hope you find VideoMentions Search useful! I&#39;d love to hear any feedback you have on it. Please let me know!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting tool could see myself using it a lot.Couldn&#39;t help but search the guy that uploaded 2 million vids to yt, sorry if it breaks anything.It would be cool to search for a specific quote like &#34;buddy of mine&#34; (frequently said by Joe Rogan). Also searching for parts of a word (similar to regex options?) might be difficult to implement but would be super useful as an option i.e if i searched for any word that starts with yc with a correct pattern (or given option on the UI) i could find results for both &#34;yc&#34; and &#34;ycombinator&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"And this is why Whonix is critical - because even when you pop the browser, you still have another layer of protection - the gateway VM.Tails browser on [almost anything] is one browser exploit away from beaconing out directly from your IP, and has done so rather frequently over the years.Whonix stuffs the whole browser and such into a workstation VM, which is only connected to the gateway VM - which &#34;torifies&#34; everything coming in that port.  So even if you pop the workstation and have root, you still can&#39;t beacon out directly without going through the gateway - you&#39;d have to find an exploit in that bit as well, with only network access.  Not impossible, but a lot harder.And then package all that into Qubes and use it that way, because a disposable Whonix VM set is probably the safest way to browse the web...And still disable Javascript."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s a very interesting set of findings. What is important to realize when reading this that it is a case of survivorship bias. The startups that were audited were obviously still alive, and any that suffered from such flaws that they were fatal had most likely already left the pool.In 15 years of doing technical due diligence (200+ jobs) I have yet to come across a company where the tech was what eventually killed them. But business case problems, for instance being unaware of the true cost of fielding a product and losing money on every transaction are extremely common. Improper cost allocation, product market mismatch, wishful thinking, founder conflicts, founder-investor conflicts, relying on non-existent technology while faking it for the time being and so on have all killed quite a few companies.Tech can be fixed, and if everything else is working fine there will be budget to do so. These other issues usually can&#39;t be fixed, no matter what the budget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Simple Outperformed Smart. As a self-admitted elitist, it pains me to say this, but it’s true: the startups we audited that are now doing the best usually had an almost brazenly ‘Keep It Simple’ approach to engineering.I wrote about this before that as an industry, we have made writing software complex for complexity&#39;s sake.&gt; imagine, in a world where there wasn&#39;t a concept of clean code but to write code as simply as possible. not having thousands of classes with indirection.what if your code logic was simple functions and a bunch of if statements. not clever right, but it would work.what if your hiring process was not optimizing for algorithm efficiency but that something simply works reliably.imagine a world where the tooling used by software engineers wasn&#39;t fragile but simple to use and learn. oh the world would be a wonderful place, but the thing is most people don&#39;t know how to craft software. but here we&#39;re building software on a house of cards [0]:[0] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30166677"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen most of the architectural problems in consulting - it&#39;s amazing how a team of clever engineers can take a simple thing and make it sooo convoluted.Microservices, craptons of cloud-only dependencies, no way to easily create environments, ORMs and tooling that wraps databases creating crazy schemas... The list goes on and on; if you&#39;re early, you could do a lot worse than create a sensible monolith in a monorepo that uses just postgres, redis, and nginx and deploys using &#39;git pull&#39; ..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"898 KB even without compression. Pretty good for what it is. Properly compressed, it’d be well under half that on the wire.(The server seems to be serving with only extremely mild compression, and none on the biggest part, the WASM. Feeding it all through `gzip -9` cuts it to 408 KB, of which 374 KB is the WASM. `brotli` cuts it to 352 KB, of which 323 KB is the WASM. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript are also largely unminified, and even a simple conservative pass roughly halves their gzipped size. No idea of the state of the WASM, I’m not going prodding inside it just now. I know that I’m never impressed with the JavaScript side of the bindings produced by Empscripten, Rust’s wasm-bindgen and any other such tools I’ve seen—with a little manual effort, I’ve very easily reduced 50 KB files—minified!—to under 5 KB. Optimising such things and immediately discarding the results is a strange hobby of mine.)For comparison, the similar parts of https://sql.js.org/examples/GUI/index.html are a bit under 1.2 MB uncompressed (most notably excluding CodeMirror), around 450 KB on the wire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Richard Hipp, of sqlite fame, just announced the project&#39;s new WASM-based &#34;fiddle&#34; app in the sqlite forum (https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/5cfd681451), providing a way for users to run a slightly-hacked build of the sqlite3 shell app in their browsers (with no server-side backend).(Edit: this was my first-ever HN post and i _thought_ that this comment was going to &#34;stick&#34; up top with the link to serve as an introduction/explanation. Didn&#39;t realize that it would be &#34;just another comment.&#34;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you find this useful, you may also benefit from the fact that Python compiled to WASM (by Pyodide) also includes a working build of SQLite in the sqlite3 standard library module.You can try that out in a REPL here: https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html    import sqlite3
    db = sqlite3.connect(&#34;:memory:&#34;)
    db.execute(&#34;select 4 * 5&#34;).fetchall()

Or in a full client-side WASM Jupyter notebook interface using https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/try/labI also used Pyodide to get my Datasette SQLite Python web application running entirely in the browser at https://lite.datasette.io - more details on how that works here: https://simonwillison.net/2022/May/4/datasette-lite/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well done for putting it out there!We&#39;ve worked on this about 3 years ago, plus background removal (realtime alpha-matting still not really done well by anyone), portrait re-lighting (G-Meet is now doing this) and even eye-contact (adjusting eye position to create the illusion of looking directly into the camera).Some findings:- Competing with dedicated H264/5 chips is very hard, especially when it comes to energy efficiency, which is something that mobile users ultimately care a lot about.  Super-resolution on H264 is probably the way to go.- It&#39;s hard to turn this into a business (corporates that pay for Zoom don&#39;t seem to care much).PS Also a big fan of super-tiny AI models (binarized NNs, frequency-domain NNs, etc) for edge applications.  Happy to chat!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome!A thought: now that neural compression is becoming widespread, it could be a good idea to put some kind of indicator or watermark stating the compression is neural (learned/function approximation in general). I think this would avoid liabilities and criticism around the fact that some weird things may appear (incorrect detail generation), maybe giving a wrong semantic idea. It may also be a good idea to put a mean squared error term in your objective function to help preserve general meaning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow Will was such a part of my childhood watching Star Trek. Obviously, he didn&#39;t appear often but he was memorable simply because there were so few people as young as him on the show.Sad to hear this all around. This also brought back memories of me being required to play piano growing up. I hated piano, performing (recitals), playing in general. I was terrrribbleee (still am) and was put up in lessons for 12 years. I fought tooth and nail as I got older and eventually was so bad my parents stopped at 16.Music is a very &#34;asian&#34; or &#34;chinese&#34; thing to put your child through. As well as being good academically. This part of my life was a sore spot, but not even close Will&#39;s situation.As I have young children of my own today, I&#39;m faced with these questions. What is a healthy amount of pushing vs too much? I don&#39;t need my kid to be the best at anything - I just don&#39;t want them to be lost/dead-in-the-water or unable to fend for themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now think how many children suffered the same fate, but we’ll never hear about it because they did not become famous.Reminds me of “dance moms” or “cheer moms”, “football dads”, etc.If you’re a parent, remember not to live your unfulfilled dreams through your children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my friend&#39;s daughters really, really enjoyed dancing, singing, acting, auditioning for commercials.  Her aunt had won Survivor, or American Race, or Big Brother, or whatever (they&#39;re all the same to me, I can&#39;t remember which it was) and she wanted to be just like her!   Until the day at seven years old that she had to go to an audition, she sat herself down in the middle of the driveway and said, &#34;No, no, no, no, I hate this, I hate this, please never, please,&#34; and wouldn&#39;t budge.  My friend was forced to realize finally it had been all her, and not her daughter.  Thankfully, she did get the message, was self-reflective enough to listen.What a strong little girl, I thought.  I remember years of &#34;loving&#34; horseback riding lessons and shows as a kid because I wasn&#39;t strong enough to tell my mother I hated every minute of it.  As a father myself now, I try very hard to listen and support what my kid is interested in, and not manufacture what I want him to be, and wonder if I still screw it up."</p>

Even though plate tectonic models return precise results, you should consider the plots approximate within ~100km. In my tests I found that model results can vary significantly. I chose this model because it is widely cited and covers the greatest length of time.How should I interpret the maps/colors?
The graphics that wrap the globe are provided by Dr. Christopher Scotese, a geologist who runs the PALEOMAP project.  You can learn more about the project and the creation of the rasters here [2].  You might also notice some old national borders.  I just work with what I can get!Why can&#39;t it look up my location?
Your location probably didn&#39;t exist at the time, geologically speaking.  Try switching to closer to present day (e.g. 66 Mya)Where are all the dinosaurs?
Despite the title of this post, the visualization isn&#39;t really meant to show an exhaustive list of dinosaurs or fossils (the list doesn&#39;t even show on mobile).  If you want to dig into data on fossils near you, check out the Paleobiology Database Navigator [3].[1] https://www.gplates.org[2] https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-q0WIa7ofISFHyBe4UxvN8DIPs8...[3] https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dang, wish this title was updated to be less misleading. I spent way too long looking for functionality that didn&#39;t exist. The author (not same person as poster) posted in the comments:&gt; Where are all the dinosaurs? Despite the title of this post, the visualization isn&#39;t really meant to show an exhaustive list of dinosaurs or fossils (the list doesn&#39;t even show on mobile).That said, this is a really cool visualization of how the water fill and plates evolved over time. Love it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the more interesting thing here is the fact that so much code in their repository appears to be bit-rotted or half baked, despite being documented. KASLR is mentioned all over the place but doesn&#39;t work and the answer is &#34;we know, it&#39;s there only to stop it bit-rotting&#34;. You need to patch the system to do kernel debugging because otherwise the toolchain hangs. Syscalls are documented as enforcing security rules yet the actual checks are //TODO comments (and they are still willing to assign CVEs so apparently they just forgot?!). The syzcaller tool is advertised as working with Fuschia, yet despite trying multiple different versions he can&#39;t even compile them due to API churn. Apparently downloading and executed a binary isn&#39;t even an option, despite their vision being that Fuschia is a sea of components downloaded and run from the internet.It&#39;s hard not to feel like maybe Google has lost the ability to develop operating systems. Fuschia has been in development for years now, it has no users outside of Google yet if you flick through their docs you&#39;ll notice a whole bunch of pages talking about deprecated components, migrations, etc. When I last looked at their docs, they read like it&#39;s been around for 20 years and has millions of apps, even though that&#39;s not true. Oh yeah and of course the giant BLM banners everywhere they have/used to have. Just checked, now those banners are replaced with &#34;Honoring Asian Pacific American Heritage Month&#34;, lol. Apparently their vision of a futuristic OS is one in which every page in the docs has some random totally US centric bit of virtue signalling in it. No wonder they somehow can&#39;t even finish a microkernel, a design that reduces performance in return for a much smaller syscall surface area."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My takeaway from the article is that Fuchsia exposes a capability-based interface externally, but uses the old kind of privilege-checking inside the kernel. Once a single sloppy check was found, the game was over: a privilege escalation and planting of arbitrary code into the kernel followed.Did I miss anything?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that I haven&#39;t seen brought up yet is the &#34;weird C++ vtable layout.&#34; This is actually the &#34;relative vtable layout&#34; that&#39;s first described here: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26723, and is usable in clang via the -fexperimental-relative-c++-abi-vtables option.The basic idea is that you don&#39;t need to waste a whole 64 bits for vtable entry, especially since you can usually assume that code within the same DSO will be within 32 bits of each other. So, instead, you do a 32-bit offset from a known address (the vtable&#39;s address) to get the function pointer, and in the rare case you need a cross-DSO entry, just emit a thunk for the symbol that&#39;s in the same DSO to get an address within 32 bits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have the most optimistic outlook for this having any impact, but I really hope this sets a precedent for limiting the use of dark patterns with which companies try to tie your identity to a phone number. I think the total sum for this fine is rather myopic: it ignores the long tail of possible future data leaks and the impact it might have on the people behind the affected accounts.I created my current Twitter account a few years ago and it remained dormant for a while. It was flagged as &#34;in violation of our policies&#34; despite having not made any tweets or using a handle or nickname that would cause offense to anyone. In order to resolve this, I had to enter my phone number to &#34;secure&#34; my account. I don&#39;t know what process triggered this review, but I&#39;ll be damned if it didn&#39;t smell like an easy way to associate an existing marketing profile with my Twitter account. Of course, it&#39;s vitally important to profile a service I used to keep up with industry news and post about Goban puzzles.I&#39;ve also run into similar patterns on Discord and similar platforms; &#34;Oops! Something suspicious is happening with the account [you literally just created]. Please add a phone number to your profile to proceed.&#34;Although I follow a reasonable set of practices around identity/password management, I usually architect my risk profile with a &#34;I don&#39;t care if I lose this account&#34; approach. If that statement isn&#39;t true, then I will happily apply all of the security measures available. However, it seems like the idea of creating &#34;I don&#39;t care&#34; accounts is becoming increasingly difficult as we continue to invest in user marketing analytics and lower the barrier of entry to these types of technologies that do not have the consumer&#39;s best interests in mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting part to me: &#34;[T]he new order[0] adds more provisions to protect consumers in the future: ... Twitter must provide multi-factor authentication options that don’t require people to provide a phone number.&#34;I would like to see this be a more broad-based rule.  No, I am not moved by &#34;SMS is easy&#34; or &#34;getting a number that can receive SMS is harder for scammers to do in bulk.&#34;  If you must, give users the choice but not the obligation to hand over a mobile number.0 - https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Twitter doesn&#39;t let me DM people who don&#39;t follow me because I haven&#39;t provided a cell phone number. I refuse to give it, mostly on principle. I send messages very rarely and am clearly not a bot. When did demanding a phone number become OK to access basic elements of a service? This happens even when I try to DM people whose DMs are open."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"[Borrowers: The Game]You live as tiny mouse-sized humans existing with regular humans who should never know your presence as you occupy the walls and spaces in their home. Every day you must hunt for food, which involves collecting gear to traverse spaces (paperclip + string = grappling hook and rope, matchstick = torch, plastic bag = parachute) to reach places where food is stored (i.e. the kitchen - defended by the cruel cat, mousetraps - easy to find but deadly to use, others). There&#39;s also more than one of you with time, where you can find and recruit others from outside the house, mate to create a family base of increasing members (prompting you to expand more into the walls which will increase your chance of discovery by normal humans), and most importantly - coordinate scavenger hunts with your crew (think: one Borrower leads a climb and trails a rope down, allowing others to follow, where more people == more food for the base). Due to the high death rate, there are no main characters, just Borrowers.[Extras]- Riding or rearing mice? (they can lead you to the cheese and help dodge the cat)- Stealing and riding a drone? (perhaps not such a rustic experience anymore)- Turning your tiny wall cave into a thriving Borrower city complete with electricity and beer? (might require killing the humans)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want a sort of civilization-but-for-countries.E.g. you are the newly elected president of Afghanistan/North Korea/Iraq/Other etc - now go rebuild infrastructure etc, set policies, see how the country develops as a result. E.g. do you invest in universal healthcare, or transport infrastructure?  Is transport infra required while your country is still largely subsistence farming?. What about education - save money there and spend on natural resource extraction?  How will that play out over decades and centuries?It would be nice to have direct control over city-level layout etc - demolish this neighborhood for flood defences, put in railways, major roads etc linking different parts of your country (not sim city levels of simulation, more just at the major civil engineering level of that makes sense - happy for actual city population to grow organically as a result of major works).Civ gets close, but it&#39;s too high-level and more focused on conquest.  I want to zoom in and have more control over where major irrigation canals get built, where to best build a nuclear plant, where that bridge should go or which mountains to tunnel through for a railway etc.  So instead of the grid being the entire planet, the grid would just be one country.Edit: I am specifically interested in the &#34;building&#34; aspect (so think civ-style grid with units moving around doing things), and less so on simple a-vs-b decision game model you see in Democracy et al."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A true &#34;MMORPG&#34;.Back in the day when the genre was new, people were fascinated by the potential of virtual worlds and virtual societies. Social scientists did online studies on player behavior and the interactions people had online, on spontaneous self-governance coming into existence, on how communities formed and developed, and many other similar topics. That potential was never fulfilled.Today - some twenty years later - the MMORPG has become a genre of checking off boxes and making numbers go up, along a linear way as laid out by the developers for you. Apart from PvP and maybe some forced grouping, most games would play absolutely identical mechanically, if you were playing all alone on your own private server. You&#39;d do the same quests, fight the same enemies, get the same loot. All the other players you get to meet online - they don&#39;t actually influence the game mechanics at all.You play next to each other. Not actually with each other.I&#39;d like to see a game, where the sum of players (and their interactions) are greater than just the sum of it&#39;s parts. A game with a virtual economy, a virtual society, etc. - that advance and evolve in a player-driven fashion. A simulated game world that dynamically adapts. Some glimpses of this sort of thing can be seen in games like EvE. Old games (pre-WoW) like UO and SWG had some of that magic as well - but were marred by limitations of the technology of the day. This kind of stuff has evolved very, very little since then.I would assume that with today&#39;s technology we should be able to get a lot closer to fulfilling that potential."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;I can&#39;t pretend to have derived any life lesson that applies to everybody from thisPart of what attracted me to software engineering in the first place was an interest in &#34;how things work&#34;, and being able to move between levels of abstraction (e.g. I know how IP, DNS, TCP, HTTP and JSON works, but most of the time I can just treat it as &#34;sending objects&#34;). So it was a bit of a eureka moment for me to realize that running a company is really just expanding the levels of abstraction that you operate with. It doesn&#39;t matter how well you code if people can&#39;t understand the user interface, so I got an interest in UX and usability. But it doesn&#39;t matter how user friendly it is, if it doesn&#39;t solve the right problem for people, so I got an interest in product development and customer research. It doesn&#39;t matter how good a product is if people never hear about it, so I got an interest in marketing and sales. And it doesn&#39;t matter how well I do all of that if I can&#39;t pay the bills, so I got an interest in pricing and monetization strategies.Juggling all those needs, and trying to shape the company and all its aspects into a cohesive whole is just as demanding and interesting as doing the same for a software project - it&#39;s just expanding the scope of which requirements and concerns you bring into the equation. For me at least, it&#39;s also been very rewarding to do the whole thing end-to-end, and it&#39;s felt like more of a natural extension of my ever-broadening interests than I would have expected. Bookkeeping can be as annoying as debugging, but in the end I&#39;m really grateful that I understand how each detail works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good job! I know exactly the feeling. I&#39;ll once again shamelessly plug my project, since it&#39;s vaguely relevant.I&#39;m making about 200 USD/month by selling watermark removals on https://gifmemes.io. What I&#39;ve learnt is that I&#39;m very bad at marketing &amp; design and will much rather spend hours programming useless features. For example I&#39;ve spent like 10 hours getting an wasm ffmpeg converter of gifs to mp4s and webms, which was not used AT ALL, while most of my traffic still comes from cold-writing (is it even a term) for 1 hour random people to put links on their websites or subreddits.The scene in the Sillicon Valley series, where Richards enhances the algorithm by 1 % is quite accurate.On the other hand, being the solo developer and product owner is quite powerful. My implementation of billing into the app took around 2 hours, which is probably less than a meeting about it would take in a company.Finally, I can run silly experiments. There is a button in the &#34;Buy watermark removal&#34; page that says &#34;It&#39;s too expensive&#34;, which leads to 50 % discount.  Around 70 % people still buy the full price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done! $500/mo, though not crazy money, is significant.How did you market your app and how long did it take you to build out the app?I&#39;ve built an app as well while I was doing my regular day job and recently quit the day job, mostly due to being burned out working in big tech as well.During my break from work, I decided to try to get my app sales up, but it&#39;s challenging. (During my best month, I think I got up to $200/mo but it&#39;s more like $100/mo right now.) As many others before me have found, marketing is the key, and I&#39;m still learning that game. So, $500/mo is really good stuff.That said, building the app and making my users happy is something that is incredibly gratifying, and something that was missing in my previous 9-5."</p>

My friend’s parents came from very poor backgrounds and had a lot of trash. The father had a shed full of stuff that was useful to him - he knew what was in it and how to use it. When the father died, the stuff in the shed was mostly junk to be sorted into scrap metal or put in the skip. A very few useful tools, a bunch of valueless obsolete tools, and a little antique/collectable stuff. The mother’s stuff was useful or precious to her, mementoes and knick-knacks. Plus some hoarder mentality that made sense given her background. Mostly valueless stuff to anyone else. What value is a drawer of your smalls?I want my parents to pass their problem down to me and my siblings. I think forcing parents to tidy up or downsize can be cruel. Why be selfish and needlessly make my parents sad?"</p>

In The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning, artist Margareta Magnusson, with Scandinavian humor and wisdom, instructs readers to embrace minimalism.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;The first bug that eats plastic was discovered in a Japanese waste dump in 2016. Scientists then tweaked it in 2018 to try to learn more about how it evolved, but inadvertently created an enzyme that was even better at breaking down plastic bottles. Further tweaks in 2020 increased the speed of degradation sixfold.Another mutant enzyme was created in 2020 by the company Carbios that breaks down plastic bottles for recycling in hours. German scientists have also discovered a bacterium that feeds on the toxic plastic polyurethane, which is usually dumped in landfills.&#34;Would love to see the timeline and capacity plotted on a chart. I wonder how much we need to make it practical. 6x increase in 2 years but did we go from decades to years?Hours on bottles sounds like we are getting there in speed but how much bacteria, and how quickly do they multiply and what do they do once they are done? I am asking because breaking bottles down in hours doesn&#39;t sound &#34;promising&#34;, it sounds like we are there. Just pour that on the plastic island in the ocean! If we cannot, there must be something else going on that prevents us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “The next step would be to test the most promising enzyme candidates in the lab to closely investigate their properties and the rate of plastic degradation they can achieve,” said Zelezniak. “From there you could engineer microbial communities with targeted degrading functions for specific polymer types.”John Todd has been working on ecologies (in a vat) that can process waste for over fifty years now. Among his accomplishments was developing an ecology that can break down DDT in a matter of weeks, instead of years. The main thing he does is drawing from all five of the major kingdoms together, and have them self-organize around the waste being processed. (https://www.toddecological.com/about)With the self-organization, it&#39;s not always necessary to model and engineer everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine this:Monsanto patents a genetically modified bug that eats plastic, sells it to governments and recycling plants.Then, once it gets into nature and it starts eating things that isn’t trash, monsanto patents a series of plastics that is resistant to this bug.Increasing the price of plastic bags by 10x.Repeat this whole cycle over and over again. It becomes an arms race of patented bug, then patented plastic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If it were me, and I wasn&#39;t willing to just block the traffic, I might just set a 128 kbps limit on it and call it a day[1]. Eventually, the other side will figure out that their fetchers are all backed up and work out how to do their job without burning so much bandwidth.[1] Yeah, that can be a bit of a pain to setup depending on the server settings, but some people have to pay for bandwidth and server resources, so it&#39;s probably worthwhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is still occurring? I remember the original incident and just assumed that Google had sorted it out with Drew/Sourcehut.This is absolutely shocking behaviour, and I’m mortified at the precedent that it sets."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of whether or not Drew is abrasive (I&#39;ve never dealt with him so have no opinion), this is on Google.If a single service (Go&#39;s module crawler) is doing this to multiple third parties (and it is, by design) then requiring Drew to implement a workaround is the same thing as relying on every (relevant to the issue) third party to do the same thing.  Which is bad design.This should be fixed at source or switched off.As for the workaround itself it&#39;s true that going on a crawler exclusion list will not stop SourceHut being usable, only make it a little stale, but that doesn&#39;t matter.  The problem is not at Drew&#39;s end.  And once again for this workaround to be an effective solution every (relevant to the issue) third party needs to do the same thing.  Which is bad design.As a general rule, with excessive polling the system doing the polling is the one at fault.  And as a general rule if one system impacts many fix at the originator.  If Google devs don&#39;t know this, then why on earth are they getting the salaries they do?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article strangely undersells the advantages of low tech. It&#39;s true that they&#39;re not better for everything, but they have advantages well beyond the basic things mentioned.A tactile button has far fewer accuracy issues with positioning: if you can feel the button, you won&#39;t start pressing 2/3 off and then get further and further off until you&#39;re triggering something else, as happens all the time on touchscreens.A knob provides a richer communication path between your brain and the device. With touchscreens, you can basically just poke and swipe, with some unintuitive nuances like long press or multi-fingered gestures. With a knob, you&#39;re using separate muscles and so can associate muscle memory based on the size, texture, and granularity of &#34;click&#34; feedback as you turn. We also have the ability to finely modulate the rate of twisting something—compare that to tapping frantically on a touchscreen left/right icon to control a quantity.Knobs don&#39;t share space in our muscle memory with buttons. To some extent, different knobs and different buttons are distinguishable too.Physical sliders are good for fine-grained control, but are also good at just smashing them all the way to min or max. When I try that on a touchscreen control, it might not make it all the way to the extreme, or my angle is wrong (no physical constraint to keep my hand/finger in place!) and it doesn&#39;t register at all because I veered off of the control.Even when I&#39;m looking at the screen already, using a directional pad means I&#39;ll always gradually get further and further off until it stops registering. Either because my attention is on a different part of the screen, or because my fingers are in the way of seeing the displayed pad. Not a problem with a physical stick or knob."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Modern cars seem to be moving towards all controls on a touch screen somewhere. I suppose this allows for more frequent updates, but in my experience it just leads to more bugs and more painful factory updates.Not to mention using a touchscreen to adjust the temperature while driving is incredibly dangerous compared to a dial you can feel for without taking your eyes off the road."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like a lot of people have forgotten that before the iPhone, touchscreens were widely regarded as a terrible interface only suitable for niche applications like kiosks. There were good reasons for that, and latency and lack of tactile feedback were high on the list. Touchscreens have proved effective in situations where you need a highly-flexible interface in a small space, but an awful lot of devices (like appliances) have more space and don&#39;t need the flexibility, so they end up taking all of the downsides with none of the benefits.A lot of designers (or marketers) seem to be trying to copy the look and feel of Apple devices without understanding the factors that led to their design."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I never realized that Healthchecks.io was a one man show.
I&#39;m almost ashamed to say that i&#39;ve been using the free tier for years. I moved from self hosted to the free tier when i killed off all of self hosted services, and i don&#39;t have much legitimate use for it, having it attached to a backup of a Raspberry Pi running HomeBridge in my summerhouse :)I do use it for a purpose it probably was not designed for :) In my summerhouse, one of the circuit breakers trips every now and then (1-2 times per year) for no apparent reason, and since the fridge is connected to that breaker, i very much fear arriving at a summer house where the fridge has been unpowered for a couple of weeks.The solution to that of course, was to setup a systemd timer on a Raspberry Pi (that also runs HomeBridge), which pings Healthchecks.io every 15 minutes. If it misses 2 pings it raises an alert.So far i&#39;ve had 2 notifications in the 2+ years it&#39;s been running, and both have been internet connection related, so monitoring the situation has apparently changed something :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Minor usability suggestion that literally no one will likely care about but I notice it all the time:If you&#39;re writing a blog post about your service then chances are you&#39;re interested in driving people to the main website about that service?So...make it easy for those potential users to get there. At the top of your blog have a prominent &#34;what is [service]&#34; link to the marketing home / about page or a call out box.This guy does it as a CTA after the post which is a start but many, many people don&#39;t. That then leaves me and other potential users to have to figure out how to get to the homepage. I&#39;ll do it but you&#39;ll lose many others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey everybody! I&#39;m David, the creator of YouTubeDrive, and I never expected to see this old project pop up on HN. YouTubeDrive was created when I was a freshman in college with questionable programming abilities, absolutely no knowledge of coding theory, and way too much free time.The encoding scheme that YouTubeDrive uses is brain-dead simple: pack three bits into each pixel of a sequence of 64x36 images (I only use RGB values 0 and 255, nothing in between), and then blow up these images by a factor of 20 to make a 1280x720 video. These 20x20 colored squares are big enough to reliably survive YouTube&#39;s compression algorithm (or at least they were in 2016 -- the algorithms have probably changed since). You really do need something around that size, because I discovered that YouTube&#39;s video compression would sometimes flip the average color of a 10x10 square from 0 to 255, or vice versa.Looking back now as a grad student, I realize that there are much cleverer approaches to this problem: a better encoding scheme (discrete Fourier/cosine/wavelet transforms) would let me pack bits in the frequency domain instead of the spatial domain, reducing the probability of bit-flip errors, and a good error-correcting code (Hamming, Reed-Solomon, etc.) would let me tolerate a few bit-flips here and there. In classic academic fashion, I&#39;ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to implement these extensions :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"-Back in the day when file sharing was new, I won two rounds of beer from my friends in university - the first after I tried what I dubbed hardcore backups (Tarred, gzipped and pgp&#39;d an archive, slapped an avi header on it, renamed it britney_uncensored_sex_tape[XXX].avi or something similar, then shared it on WinMX assuming that as hard drive space was free and teenage boys were teenage boys, at least some of those who downloaded it would leave it to share even if the file claimed to be corrupt.It worked a charm.Second round? A year later, when the archive was still available from umpteen hosts.For all I know, it still languishes on who knows how many old hard drives..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before broadband was widely available, TiVo used to purchase overnight paid programming slots across the US and broadcast modified PDF417 video streams that provided weekly program guide data for TiVo users. There&#39;s a sample of it on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfUgT2YoPzI but they usually wrapped a 60-second commercial before and after the 28-minute broadcast of data. There was enough error correction in the data streams to allow proper processing even with less-than-perfect analog television reception."</p>

Best Effort Service for RV Users. Network resources are always deprioritized for Starlink RVs users compared to other Starlink Services, resulting in degraded service and slower speeds in congested areas and during peak hours. Stated speeds and uninterrupted use of the Service are not guaranteed. Service degradation will occur most often in &#34;Waitlist&#34; areas designated on the Starlink Availability Map during peak usage hours. See the Starlink Specifications for expected performance of the Starlink for RV Services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been waiting patiently for almost two years to get it the old-fashioned way.  Just canceled my longstanding deposit, and ordered Starlink for RVs.  It helps that I really wanted it for my RV anyway, and just assumed all along that at some point in the not-to-distant future they were going to allow that.Fairly expensive, but it will allow me to work remotely from a very beautiful, remote location, and I intend to take full advantage of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been using CAT phones for a few years. They really are tough, work pretty well with gloves, do not care much about water, etc. Can recommend, and the infrared sensors are worth it just for the wow effect alone :). From the downsides - some of the smaller things break faster than you&#39;d like (e.g. laser meter, or rubber covers for the USB port, or the painted/glued layer on the back in one of the older models). These downsides do not invalidate the main purpose(s) of the device. Also the phones rather quickly fall out of the supported Android version range, but this seems to be a common problem with all Android phones."</p>

Kyocera DuraXV https://kyoceramobile.com/duraxv-extreme/
Sonim XP3 Plus https://www.sonimtech.com/products/devices/xp3plus/Both flip phones are based on AOSP (https://source.android.com/) and we&#39;ve had to deal with custom implementations of soft keys, and push to talk headsets. Even Kyocera&#39;s implementation varies between the ATT version (https://kyoceramobile.com/duraxe-epic/att/) and the Verizon one.This phone is made by https://bullitt-group.com/ and they very smartly license the CAT brand. We have not worked with them yet, but I&#39;m guessing it would be relatively trivial to support the phone.Without good soft-key support, these phones are unusable.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Living in France, the lie is also obvious for a very sad reason : we aldready don&#39;t do anything significant in case of a majority of &#39;obvious&#39; child abuses (sex related or not, that&#39;s not even the point).I know a fair amount of social worker whom sadly report that in a lot of child education place they know about A LOT of abuse, and a non negligible (and mental burden inducing) part of the work is to do triage, because they know they get (the number are made up) 50 report per week, but they only can &#39;investigate&#39; about 20, and even if the 20 are really worrying, they can only launch action for 3 to 5, any more would overflow the dedicated services.And that&#39;s not they are lazy, investigating is really complicated (and often not even worth, the main goal is to help the victim, no chasing culprits) and acting worse. You are pretty sure some girl in bad social context is being abused ? with whom do you send her living ? the maybe abusing father ? The probably violent alcoolic uncle or the nice but drug dealing older brother (who maybe is not ready to support her education even with a little financial help) ? That can seems parodic but I&#39;ve seen real conversations like that.The idea public services who cannot aldready read all the professionally redacted reports will suddently became omniscient because they can read my discord server private channel is funny.Hope some representative will jump on the occasion to request more social worker founds to treat the case we aldready know about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very well written article that justifies its criticism of the EC&#39;s proposal with facts and numbers. Based on this, it really does look like child abuse is merely used as an excuse for more general surveillance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I hope some experienced people in the industry can give some hope and advice. Is demoralizing to find out I spent 4 years in school just to get into a really harsh job market. First pandemic, then recession? F...Overall, I&#39;d say relax a bit. You&#39;re still in a good situation. Recessions are hard for many, but software engineers were among the best off during the last one and I expect will be this time also.&gt; I wanna know if during recessions recruiting slows down even for big profitable companies.I remember Google&#39;s recruiting slowed down in ~2008. [edit: 2009? Maybe not right at the start of the recession.] [1] So sometimes yes. On the bright side, it&#39;s rare for profitable large tech companies to lay off software engineers, so if you get in, you&#39;re pretty safe.Even at startups, I don&#39;t expect a universal freeze. I asked an external recruiter (that is, someone who recruits for a variety of startups) a couple days ago about the present situation. She told me some companies she works with have done hiring freezes, others are still desperate to hire. There are opportunities. I&#39;m not a good enough business person to give you solid general advice about which startups will be most resilient, though.If you are good enough and/or persistent enough, my feeling is there will be a place for you in tech. (Even if, for example, you freeze up during coding interviews. Some companies do these, others don&#39;t. There&#39;s enough variety that you can still be okay if you don&#39;t have your sights set on a particular company.)If you are not, there&#39;s almost certainly still a place for you as a software engineer in a stable, non-tech company or government position. Non-tech typically isn&#39;t as lucrative, but you can be comfortable. My feeling is many of these places have a tremendous need for just basic automation. Arguably more so during a recession, although they may not all realize this.I started my career not long before the last recession. I didn&#39;t have any real existing savings to lose. Then I was earning far in excess of my needs and investing much of the rest in index funds (e.g. VTI) when stock prices were low. The recession ended and stock prices soared. I feel scummy saying this about many people&#39;s suffering, but the recession worked out well for me.[1] Personally I think this was a mistake. They could have hired a lot of great people during this time. &#34;Be bold when others are fearful.&#34; They had solid financial footing for hiring, and if nothing else, they could have put a fair number of folks on efficiency projects that would have more than paid their way in machine costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their honesty should be applauded. Imagine they hired you and then had to fire you in 6 months. Keep in touch with the PM if you liked them and see how they perform in the next 12 months."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Is demoralizing to find out I spent 4 years in school just to get into a really harsh job market.I know it doesn&#39;t make your experience any better, but this is *not* a harsh job market. Yes, some companies are pulling back/slowing down/pausing hiring, but there are still far more software jobs available than people to fill them.&gt; What companies or roles will be more resilient?Those that are or can quickly become profitable. Most startups are NOT profitable because they chase growth at all costs. This may change as cheap and easy money dries up.&gt; And how as a SWE / tech industry professional, specially the ones starting their careers like me, can prepare?Don&#39;t do anything different. You had one company pull out on you. That happens all the time for a multitude of reasons. Don&#39;t be discouraged. Apply for jobs at a range of companies, from start-ups to profitable SaaS companies to companies outside the typical &#34;tech&#34; wheelhouse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This title is very misleading (and really should be changed).This is not about search. To be clear, when you load our search results, you are completely anonymous, including ads. For ads, we actually worked with Microsoft to make ad clicks privacy protected as well. From our public ads page, &#34;Microsoft Advertising does not associate your ad-click behavior with a user profile.&#34; This page is linked to next to every Microsoft ad that is served on our search engine (duckduckgo.com). https://help.duckduckgo.com/company/ads-by-microsoft-on-duck....In all our browsing apps (iOS/Android/Mac) we also block third-party cookies, including those from Microsoft-owned properties like LinkedIn and Bing. That is, the privacy thing most people talk about on the web (blocking 3rd party cookies) applies here to MSFT. We also have a lot of other web protections that also apply to MSFT-owned properties as well, e.g.,  GPC, first-party cookie expiration, fingerprinting protection, referrer header trimming, cookie consent handling, fire button data clearing, etc.This is just about non-DuckDuckGo and non-Microsoft sites in our browsers, where our search syndication agreement currently prevents us from stopping Microsoft-owned scripts from loading, though we can still apply our browser&#39;s protections post-load (like 3rd party cookie blocking and others mentioned above, and do). We&#39;ve also been tirelessly working behind the scenes to change this limited restriction. I also understand this is confusing because it is a search syndication contract that is preventing us from doing a non-search thing. That&#39;s because our product is a bundle of multiple privacy protections, and this is a distribution requirement imposed on us as part of the search syndication agreement. Our syndication agreement also has broad confidentially provisions and the requirement documents themselves are explicitly marked confidential.Taking a step back, I know our product is not perfect and will never be. We face many constraints: platform constraints, contractual constraints (like in this case), breakage constraints, and the evolving tracking arms race. Holistically though I believe it is the best thing out there for mainstream users who want simple privacy protection without breaking things, and that is our product vision.Overall our app is multi-pronged privacy protection in one package (private search, web protection, HTTPS upgrading, email protection, app tracking protection for Android, and more to come), being careful (and putting in a lot of effort) to not break things while still offering protections -- an &#34;easy button&#34; for privacy. And we constantly work to improve its capabilities and will continue to do so, including in this case. For example, we&#39;ve recently been adding bespoke third-party protections for Google and Facebook, like Google AMP/Topics/FLEDGE protection and Facebook embedded content protection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just looking at the original title, I knew this was going to be a twitter post by a Brave employee posting either hearsay, or something taken out of context.Private browsing is a small niche, and Brave does their best to drive competitors at every turn, and not by being obviously better at it. Kinda scummy, if I’m honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DuckDuckGo feels like just a front for Microsoft at this point. I once looked into buying search ads on DuckDuckGo, only to discover to my horror that DDG didn&#39;t have its own ad business. DDG is entirely reliant on Microsoft&#39;s advertising system. You have to sign up for a Microsoft account to even put ads on DDG! And it&#39;s difficult — maybe impossible IIRC? — to specifically target DDG in those ads, without also targeting other MS properties.Until DuckDuckGo separates itself from Microsoft and becomes truly independent, especially in its business model, you have to question why DDG even exists.DDG was founded 14 years ago. I can understand initially bootstrapping on MS ads, but what&#39;s the excuse now? How about separating yourself from Microsoft first, before making a web browser that gives special exemptions to Microsoft?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work for Nokia Research during the mid 2000&#39;s. I remember how hard it was to get the source code for this back then as internal employees... One of my colleagues was working on a research prototype that needed tighter integration with the system than what you could achieve with a deployed app. So he needed the source code and the build environment for the OS.And for that he needed quite a few people to agree and he had to sign an NDA (again, as an employee, not a subcontractor!). Then, of course the whole thing was pretty hard to make work on his machine.Later on I did some work with the (public) SDK as well. The build system was based on the GNU toolchain. More precisely, a windows port of the GNU toolchain, so it would only work on windows. But even on windows it had a lot of warts (because these tools were build for unix in the first place, so e.g. drive letters and back slashes were problematic). As far as I can remember, a lot of the build tools were written in perl. There was some script to generate makefiles for your project and even that, as far as I can remember had a front end script. (I remember something called MAKMAKE.BAT, but I may be wrong.)The whole thing was a pretty frustrating experience. And we haven&#39;t talked about the libraries, the OS (cooperative multi tasking, everything is a callback) or memory management (&#39;descriptors&#39; that made trivial string operations a pain). No wonder it couldn&#39;t keep up with android and ios. Now, to be fair, the OS was based on a core and concepts created in the mid 1990s to allow software development on devices with 64k of memory or something. But even with several megabytes of RAM (so the early 2000s), that programming model was obviously way too constraining."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is odd to see people talking about how Symbian was so early on, in the smartphone era.It&#39;s considerably more mature than that. :-) (For the avoidance of doubt: this is a good thing.)Symbian was a rebrand of the Psion 5 and 5MX OS, which was called EPOC32. It also ran on some other hardware, including the Ericsson MC218, Oregon Scientific Osaris, and Geofox One.The first EPOC32 device was the Psion 5 in 1997:http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/5300/Psion-Series-5/Succeeded by the 5MX:https://uxdesign.cc/psion-pda-how-does-it-look-today-327e01b...https://thenewstack.io/retrocomputing-in-modern-times-redisc...In other words, this OS was out there in the real world, in use by hundreds of thousands of people, five years before the first Symbian device (Nokia 7650)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some other dynamics that are worth mentioning here that can stand in the way of undertaking any of the steps the author recommends.  I don&#39;t think they touched on any of these things so I&#39;ll list some of them out:* Technical staff in an organization feel they have no authority or respect within the organization.  This can happen when companies become too sales-driven.* Senior technical staff feel they have no ability to delegate, either because of the previous point or because they don&#39;t trust the technical ability of less senior staff.* Those in an organization who do have authority to delegate lack sufficient understanding of priorities or lack technical knowledge.These things highlight the classic balance between technical knowledge and managerial skills.  If you don&#39;t have people that bring both to the table, you&#39;re in for trouble.  Not sure if I&#39;d go so far as to say this is what it&#39;s all about.  However, reading over the author&#39;s advice, I thought to myself, &#34;None of this could have happened at some places I&#39;ve worked.&#34;  You can come up with a good plan, but if no one will listen to you or take your advice, it&#39;s worthless.The author probably was that person who brought what was needed to the table.  As such, perhaps the plan is not what ended up mattering so much as having someone who was willing and able to push it through.  Also, having the right people from top to bottom.  My feeling sometimes is that effective teams occur almost randomly.  This might be because organizations rarely have the patience or the resources to assemble them deliberately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After the MVP is found, then the real work begins in building a company. We all understand that if everything is a priority, then nothing is, but often times, business resources don&#39;t. Support wants bugs fixed to keep customers happy and to re-sign. Sales whats features to land their whales. Engineering wants to work off tech debt, refine, and innovate. Etc.. I&#39;ve found that a formal &#34;Intake&#34; process works wonders. Engineering needs an advocate to take these disparate priorities and refine what, when and how to address. It&#39;s really that simple, and that complex. Finding someone to own it. Sometimes it&#39;s impossible depending on the Org and personalities involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Be really careful with the yellows: if there is low impact, you might be confusing work for progress. If there is low urgency, you might be overestimaging the value of your work.On the flipside, if only high-urgency projects get done, you end up becoming a 500+ employee IT service provider without a proper Identity and Access Management System (IAM), without a Privileged Access Management system (PAM), a haphazard, ad-hoc secrets store and so on.That&#39;s all fine and good for a 10-person company, you can get by like that when you&#39;re 100, above 200 maybe it starts to get icky...Yes, I understand that if really nothing progresses, you have to prioritize ruthlessly, but you cannot keep doing only high urgency projects forever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t really see which bits of web3 are meant to threaten the existing web, or are more dangerous to it than the existing threats.The balkanization of the web seems like a threat that gets bigger every year. Surveillance gets worse every year. Regulatory attempts to combat certain kinds of surveillance do so by shifting the burden of &#34;consent&#34; on to users who don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re consenting to. Fewer and fewer people have any kind of &#34;ownership&#34; of the web in the form of personal servers, privately-hosted websites, independent self-managed communities, and so on.Perhaps web3 could be a danger if it proposes unworkable solutions to those problems. Token economies and blockchains do give a kind of &#34;ownership&#34; and &#34;participation&#34;, but the sheer volatility of the pricing of the goods, services and induced-scarcity &#34;land&#34; on offer makes it impractically risky or expensive for anyone who isn&#39;t running some kind of trading strategy.There are lots of good critiques of web3, and good arguments against specific projects, features, or consequences it produces. &#34;Keep the web free&#34; is a fine idea, but I&#39;m not sure that web3 is where the real danger comes from."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lazy article that recycles common web3 hate without showing any sign of understanding about the problems with web2, and the potential of web3.I would agree that web3&#39;s potential hasn&#39;t materialized. Possibly it never will, but at least engage with some of the concepts.Further, when you use Stephen Diehl as a source, you already lost. This guy has an unhealthy obsession with hating crypto fueled by his own crypto startup failure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My mother is amazing to watch because she doesn&#39;t do anything efficiently, really: She puts about three times as much energy as necessary into everything she does. But she never spends any time wondering what to do next or how to optimize anything; she just keeps working. Her strategy, slightly simplified, is, &#34;See something that needs to be done and do it.&#34; All day long. And at the end of the day, she&#39;s accomplished a huge amount.This strategy is remarkably powerful and I&#39;ve used it to great effect in my career. Committing yourself to pushing forward every single day, even if just a little bit, and always just peeling off one single thing you can do next (even if it&#39;s tiny yet takes you all day) has a dizzying compounding effect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Recently, I came across a few old and new interviews of Donald KnuthI have developed the conclusion that reading digestive summary from original source materials is ultimately ineffective for me at this stage of the life.Unfortunately, the author did not provide links to these interviews.For anyone who is writing a summary from other source material, please do provide references. That&#39;s one of the things I learned churning out low quality academic papers in PhD study."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ...it turns up in Philippians 3:16, where the writer says that:&gt; &#34;You don&#39;t race to get to the goal; the process of racing itself, of keeping the pace, is the real goal.
When I go on vacation, I like to enjoy the drive.&#34;&gt; In Christian churches I am least impressed by a sermon that talks about how marvelous heaven is going to be at the end. To me that&#39;s not the message of Christianity. The message is about how to live now, not that we should live in some particular way because there&#39;s going to be pie in the sky some day. The end means almost nothing to me. I am glad it&#39;s there, but I don&#39;t see it as much of a motivating force, if any. I mean, it&#39;s the journey that&#39;s important.---This is Philippians 3:16: &#34;Only let us live up to what we have already attained.&#34;It&#39;s hard for me to connect that to the paraphrase given above. Furthermore, the previous few verses (12-14) of that same chapter seem to be more goal-oriented, than process-oriented:&#34;Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&#34;Also see 1 Corinthians 15:19:&#34;If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some context: The Green Party had long been diametrically opposed to nuclear, to the extent that they have twice exited a coalition government in protest of granting additional reactor permits. Over the past ten years their position has gradually shifted though, thanks to STEM-oriented Greens in particular, as it has become obvious that AGW is a bigger threat than nuclear. This in spite of several setbacks:– Obviously, the Fukushima disaster of 2011.– The fact that the Olkiluoto 3 reactor project [1], a 1600MW PWR unit, was plagued by chronic delays and cost overruns – it is only now being connected to the grid, over ten years behind schedule. OL3&#39;s fundamental problem was that the European nuclear industry simply was not up to the task of delivering a first-of-its-kind, ambitious third-gen reactor after a fifteen-year hiatus during which no new nuclear power plants were built in Europe.– Another planned nuclear plant, Hanhikivi [2], had problems finding a Western reactor supplier; after some arguably rather shady dealings, a contract was made with Rosatom, the state nuclear corporation of Russia. This received some well-earned criticism, but Finnish decisionmakers (perhaps naively) wanted to think there was no political dimension to such an agreement. After February 24, the project is now almost certainly dead in the water, never having left the planning and design phase.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olkiluoto_Nuclear_Power_Plant#...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanhikivi_Nuclear_Power_Plant"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, and hopefully it will stop the premature shutdown of existing nuclear reactors.But it&#39;s pretty tiny climate news overall. Nuclear reactors are aging out and nobody in Western Europe or the US seems to know how to build in a cost competitive way anymore.Deploying 5GW of solar and storage, or 3-4GW of wind, is far easier, faster, and cheaper than trying to build a new reactor, which won&#39;t come on line for a bare minimum of 10 years, best case. We don&#39;t have that long to wait to start replacing nearly all of our fossil fuel infrastructure, and replace the nuclear reactors that are reaching end of life.If nuclear was going to be a climate solution, then all the nuclear reactors started in the 2000s needed to complete on time and on schedule to encourage the building of more. Instead it&#39;s 2022 and we are still waiting to see how bad the financial disaster will be for them. That&#39;s not the route towards building more nuclear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funding for the source is interesting:&gt; &#34;The Alliance for Science is a global communications initiative based at the Boyce Thompson Institute, an independent nonprofit research institute affiliated with Cornell University. Our primary source of support is the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.&#34;The article does gloss over where Finland would source its uranium from.  A GW-scale nuclear power plant burns through ~200 tons of fuel rods per year, and Finland&#39;s supplier seems to have been the Russian state-owned uranium outfit Rosatom:https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/rosatoms-unit-seeks-...Finland does have plans to start mining and refining uranium ore, but it looks like they&#39;ll produce only enough for one reactor:&gt; &#34;Last year, 35% of Finnish electricity production came from the country’s four nuclear reactors, whose owners Fortum and TVO buy their nuclear fuel from other countries including Russia, France and Canada.&#34;Anyone holding ownership in Canada&#39;s high-grade uranium ores is likely going to do well by this move.  About that...https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/bill-gates-nuclear-power-wil...Regardless, countries like Finland which are solar-limited for much of the year are the obvious place for nuclear.  Whether they can make their domestic uranium mining operations &#39;clean and fossil-fuel free&#39;, and secure reasonably priced contracts for importing the rest of their required reactor fuel, remains to be seen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;What if it changes?&#34; is a reasonable question to ask. But every time you do you are walking a tightrope. My rule of thumb is that we look at what is in use TODAY, and then write a decent abstraction around that. If something is used once, ignore any abstractions. If it&#39;s used twice, just copy it, it&#39;s better. If it&#39;s used 3 or more times, look at writing an abstraction that suits us TODAY not for the future. Bonus points if the abstraction allows us to extend easily in the future, but nothing should be justified with a &#34;what if&#34;.The reason a lot of Java or C# code is written with all these abstractions is because it aids unit testing. But I&#39;ve come to love just doing integration testing. I still use unit testing to test complex logic, but things like &#34;does this struct mapper work correctly&#34; are ignored, we&#39;ll find out from our integration tests. If our integration tests work, we&#39;ve fulfilled our part of the contract, that&#39;s all we care about. Focus on writing them and making them fast and easy to run. It&#39;s virtually no different to unit tests but just 10x easier to maintain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition . https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpris...You never know when you might need to change the implementation of how the &#34;Fuzz&#34; string is returned, so you need a FuzzStringReturner.And you never know when you might need multiple different ways of returning &#34;Fuzz&#34;, so you need a FuzzStringReturnerFactory.And for SOLID it&#39;s important to separate concerns, so you want your FuzzStringReturnerFactory separate from your FuzzStringPrinterFactory.And that barely scratches the surface of what you need!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t seen anyone else point out: One of the ways you can often identify really experienced programmers is by them being able to pretty accurately separate thing-that-probably-will-change from things-that-probably-won&#39;t.Finding a good way to balance YAGNI with this-will-definitely-change-in-a-few-months-because-it-always-does is incredibly hard, and I&#39;ve really appreciated working with engineers who make that prediction correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the bad old Linux days, if you read a huge amount of data off the disk (like if you were doing a backup) Linux would try to take all that data and jam it in the page cache. This would push out all the useful stuff in your cache, and sometimes even cause swapping as Linux helpfully swaps out stuff to make room for more useless page cache.One of the great things about `dd` is that you have a lot of control how the input and output files are opened. You can bypass the page cache when reading data by using iflag=direct, which would stop this from happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Useful uses of dd(1).There remain some useful applications of dd.  These may of course be achieved by other mechanisms, but typically less conveniently.1. Read a specific number of blocks or bytes from a source:  dd if=/dev/hda of=/root/mbr bs=512 count=1

This will make a copy of, say, your master boot record (first 512 bytes of your first disk drive) and stash it in your /root directory.2. Read from specific bytes of a file  dd if=mydata skip=1k bs=32 count=1

Reads 32 bytes after the first 1024 (1k) bytes of &#34;mydata&#34;.3. Write to specific bytes of a file  dd if=source of=target seek=10k bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc

That should write 512 bytes from &#34;source&#34; beginning 10k into &#34;target&#34;.  (I&#39;ve not tested this, you should verify.)4. Create a sparse file.  Sparse files appear to have a nonzero size, but take up no space on disk, until data is actually written to them.  These are often used as &#34;inflating&#34; dynamic filesystem images for virtual machines.  dd if=/dev/zero of=sparsefile bs=1 count=0 seek=20000M # Create 20 GB sparse file

5. Case conversions.  Sure, you could use tr(1), but where&#39;s the sport?  dd if=MixEdCaSE of=lcase conv=lcase   # Convert to lower case
  dd if=MixEdCaSE of=ucase conv=ucase   # Convert to upper case

6. ASCII / EBCDIC conversions  dd if=ebcdic of=ascii conv=ascii   # ebcdic -&gt; ascii
  dd if=ascii of=ebcdic conv=ebcdic  # ascii -&gt; ebcdic


When reading to or from IBM data tapes, you might find blocking / unblocking conversions useful.  I&#39;ve done this, but it&#39;s so long ago that I don&#39;t trust my memory on that any more.  Odds are good you&#39;ll not have to worry about this.There are other useful applications as well, though these are not typically encountered very often.  Do feel free to explore and attempt these on safe media."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While there’s a lot of truth here, there are times when you can do much better than cat. A while back I tweeted:Today I found the magical dd command that causes an NVMe drive to run at almost full speed:  # dd if=/dev/nvme3n1 bs=4096k iflag=direct of=/dev/null status=progress
  959090524160 bytes (959 GB, 893 GiB) copied, 178 s, 5.4 GB/s

The trick to getting this throughput is telling Linux to do an insanely large IO (4 MiB). The drive can&#39;t do 4 MiB reads - the largest IO it can handle is 2 MiB.  # nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme3 | grep mdts
  mdts      : 9
  # echo &#39;4 \* 2^9&#39; | bc -l

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As incremental construction goes, my grandma&#39;s house in North Dakota is a pretty good example.  It went from a one story small home to a two story home with a wrap-around deck.  I&#39;m sure it was some ordered house put on a basement.  It had an outhouse in the 70&#39;s but indoor plumbing was added.  I remember sometime in the 80&#39;s putting in a support beam so they could remove some of the walls and support the second story.  It was an all-hands task of the relatives with most of my uncle and aunts.  I remember Dad&#39;s reaction when Grandma announced she had bought a wood stove to put in the house.  That was a fun install requiring the removal of a wall, brick base, and running venting.There was a bit of danger in all this expansion.  The look of utter horror on my Dad&#39;s and Uncle&#39;s face when we turned off all the breakers and the stove was still on makes me laugh but was deadly serious at the time.  Fixing that was a bit of an adventure.  Dad and Uncle traced every wire in the damn house and I learned some new insults."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The only way you could possibly measure this is just to look at the distribution of coins among wallets. This is obviously going to count crypto exchanges as single entities, which is absurd.It&#39;d be like counting JPMorgan as a single person when computing wealth inequality in the US. Analyses like these are a total joke."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several issues with using this metric to measure wealth inequality for crypto currencies, especially those with smart contracts like Ethereum.- A single address might be a contract like WETH, which can hold tens of billions of dollars worth of tokens despite all users in the network having access to it. Similar with centralized exchanges holding many tokens. Addresses are not users.- This metric often confuses “inequality of interest” with “inequality of wealth.” A user holding $10,000 of ETH and another user holding $100 of ETH may be in similar fiat-wealth brackets, but one is more interested &amp; invested in crypto than the other.- It is very easy to spin up a new wallet as it’s effectively just a random unique number. A single user might have 10-20 wallets with almost-zero tokens leftover, and all of their assets concentrated on one or two accounts, which further skews this stat.- A number of tokens in the network are inaccessible due to being locked in a contract or sent to a burn address. The standard ETH burn address has $250M worth of tokens.There is a lot of crypto disparity and inequality but this stat at face value is fairly meaningless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to see the methodology. I guarantee you they can&#39;t actually determine the claim.Beyond that, bitcoin wasn&#39;t designed to &#34;decentralize wealth and power&#34;, it is a disingenuous claim made by an agenda poster. Bitcoin was created to take a step towards a future where economic power is not synonymous with political power. The natural distribution of wealth is not at issue, so long as it&#39;s just that: natural."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; While we have informed users that there are no absolute guarantees against risksI&#39;m... uh.... fairly certain this was not the crux of their marketing which severly downplayed the underlying risk. There is also a huge spectrum between &#34;we cannot guarantee that there is 0 risk&#34; (which seems to be what the above sentence is saying), and &#34;there exists a risk that all of your funds disappears in 24 hours&#34;.It seems like there is some serious rewriting of history going on here.Question though, do the founders here have any potential criminal liability from this whole situation (including apparently lying about what they were doing with their customers funds)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m going to explain what has happened so far. What happens next entirely depends on how inflation continues and the feds reaction.1. We had zero percent interest rates. This causes the value of assets with cash flows out into the future (think speculative tech, Tesla) to accelerate.2. We had massive herding in megacap tech. These valuations are high in part because for a decade you would not have beat the index without having these names in your portfolio.3. These valuations blew up even further because of call squeezes during the 2020-2021 bull. Tesla even managed to get itself into the S&amp;P.5. Then in December, the megacaps we&#39;re squeezed further until the S&amp;P 500 had a negative return relative to price!A lot of this occured because people remained under the impression that bond yields would never normalize. Now that they have, there is a risk free alternative to stocks.Now for the next complications: Ukraine + Russia, economic war with  China, inflation, how the fed will respond, gas prices.If inflation continues and the fed becomes aggressive with hiking, all assets are dead. Bonds will be wrecked, stocks will be wrecked, cash is wrecked, even gold (depending on how aggressively they hike) will be dead because it&#39;s actually a really good deal to buy bonds when they yield north of 10% (if we get there).Say the fed decides not to hike as aggressively and inflation slows, then you&#39;ll be holding the S&amp;P 500 likely for yield than growth. In the case of a recession or further inflation, that yield may be at risk depending on the sectors you&#39;re invested in.In this context the correction in names like Target make perfect sense. The dividend was near zero at it&#39;s price before the cut. Same thing happened in a company like Newmont mining."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I would be planning to ride this thing out for at least eighteen months or more.I&#39;m betting more like three to five years.I was talking to a friend (another old guy, like me, but really rich, unlike me).We&#39;ve both been through at least two recessions (big, nasty ones, with teeth and claws). We realized that there&#39;s an entire generation of folks; many running companies, that have never seen a real bear market.It&#39;s likely they are having a shit hemorrhage, right now.The company I used to work for, was (still is) an over 100-year-old Japanese company. They lasted through a devastating war, a depression, multiple recessions, and were still around. I&#39;m hoping that they stay around. They&#39;ve made some choices that could be disastrous (I think that sidelining my team was one ;), but not the same kind a lot of companies are making now. Lots of people are leveraged to the hilt. Bad place to be, when the economy starts tanking.HODL is the word. Live cheaply, so you don&#39;t need to cash out in a trough. Don&#39;t rely on other people&#39;s money, keep debt way down, keep margins high, optimize processes, etc.Old-fashioned stuff. It worked 100 years ago, and still works today.Not everything old is bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In the early 80s, the G7 economies tightened the money supply, raising interest rates dramatically, in an effort to bring inflation under control.This article points out a similarity between the early 80s and now. So I think it&#39;s appropriate to point out a major difference as well.Consider this chart[1] which shows both the short term interest rate (Federal Funds rate) and long term interest rate (10-year Treasury yield) since 1962. Before rates started rising in the late 70s, the market was used to an interest rate between 5-10% (both long and short term), after which it rose to 15% (long term) and 20% (short term). Compare this with the current situation. Markets now have been used to 0% short term interest rates and 2-3% long term interest rates for over 10 years. The little blip you see to the far right of the chart is how much interest rates have risen so far (to 0.83% short term and 2.85% long term). If such a tiny blip (historically speaking) is the cause of the current correction, then it seems reasonable to expect that this is only a tiny part of a much greater correction that comes if interest rates get even close to the levels seen in the start 80s.[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=PIsi"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a very interesting theory, but also low-quality evidence. It merits further study, but hard to say that it merits any change in behavior just yet.As far as I can tell, the &#34;340 000&#34; person study was finally published in 2020[1]. The study was an observational analysis of 342,000 dialysis patients. There was no attempt to measure personal exposure to UV (FTA: &#34;it was not feasible to determine personal exposures to UV radiation and temperature&#34;). Rather, these exposures were approximated by dialysis center zip code.I can understand why David Fisher would say that he doesn&#39;t question the data, but doesn&#39;t agree with the implications.1 = https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.119.013837"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this article a couple years ago and it definitely influenced my thoughts on the matter.I think this is yet another case of us collectively ignoring common sense. We know that UV radiation is damaging to the skin and can cause skin cancer. Instead of rubbing chemicals on our skin to negate these effects, it is better to avoid being out in direct sunlight when the UV index is high, especially if you&#39;re super pale. If you have to go out at mid day for a decent length of time, wear a big hat and clothes that cover you up.I&#39;m on the pale end of the spectrum and if I go out at say 2pm when the UV index is at 10 it&#39;ll be physically painful within a few minutes.However, when I go for my daily walks earlier in the day or later in the afternoon when the UV index is say 3-4, I go without sunscreen and feel great. And even though I supplement vitamin D, the effects of sunlight is clearly better.Also I think it is safe to imagine that most of our ancient ancestors weren&#39;t going out in the most intense sunlight and stripping close to naked for hours to develop a nice tan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People have such a hard time with the concept of a trade-off. Life is not a video game where there is an optimal single answer for everyone every time. It’s complicated,
especially with something like biology. So place your bets: do you want possibly better blood pressure, higher incidence of melanoma, and faster aging of skin? Or do you want benefits of more sun exposure and greater risk of cancer?The answer is: it depends on your family history, your lifestyle, and a bunch of other things.I know that organizations like American Dermatology or Outdoor magazine have to water down their message so it’s digestible, but it annoys me when people expect “The Answer”. Science is constantly updating."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool pet project, admirable engineering etc.My comment is about something else: net neutrality, as someone already mentioned.I was teaching English in Laos for school kids. I was amazed that some of their families struggle with providing (nutritious enough) food for their children, yet, everyone had smartphones with always-on 4G,even in the countryside - however, no WiFi almost anywhere.The brains of these kids are like sponge. They WANT to learn, they&#39;re shy, but they want to speak, to read, to practice English. They also like to (constantly) sing (something that is badly missing from western schools), so at one point I referred them to &#34;simple English Wikipedia&#34;, where they can research their favorite singers with easy-to-process articles.Empty stares.&#34;so instead of Wikipedia.org, you go to simple.wikipedia.org.&#34;Still nothing.I had to realize later that even if they knew that this free, always available encyclopedia exists, it&#39;s NOT included in their 4G subscription.Yes, you guessed correctly: those subscriptions are sponsored by big US / Chinese corps, so all these kids had were Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and TikTok, everything else costs ~10$ which is days worth of meals for whole families there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience with in-flight message-only WiFi is that they&#39;re just really slow and the ping times are long. Some services are actively blocked, e.g. Skype wouldn&#39;t work at all even for text messages, but browsing the internet is usually allowed. My VPN wouldn&#39;t work, but I suspect it might have if I used an obfuscated connection instead of OpenVPN or whatever the default is (e.g. over SSL). I could load GMail in the browser and Wikipedia probably would have worked. It&#39;s strongly website dependent. Hacker News is extraordinarily resilient to lousy connections and generally the index would always load without any trouble. It works even on a 3 second ping over satellite internet. Very few websites are that tolerant.The flight crew (BA) knew what&#39;s up. They specifically warned us to check which package we were getting, because evidently they get a lot of complaints when people buy the message-only bundle and are surprised that nothing works.Singapore gave out free passes for single devices last time I flew with them. It was possible to rotate MAC addresses by forgetting the connection and then re-joining. The connection was quite good, you could watch YouTube in potato resolution. It&#39;s quite fun to chat to people and send them photos out of the window."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago (2012) Delta inflight wifi would allow DNS queries out without paying. Being a very frequent flyer I used to run an ip-over-dns tunnel using Iodine[1]. It was slow but worked. I wonder if they’ve blocked that hole yet.[1] https://code.kryo.se/iodine/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have tried to faithfully summarize the video here. If you notice a mistake or omission, please correct me.Rossmann’s main message: “to complain about something that is an option rather than complain about all of the options that are missing misses the forest for the trees”.Key points:1. For certain repairs, Apple’s repair program has “made availiable the exact same OEM parts and tools that they use” via rental. Renting these tools is optional and not required; Rossmann recognizes that while he (and in his opinion, most people) will likely not use these tools, their availability is a non-issue.2. Sean Hollister’s article in The Verge was highly critical of the entire self-repair process, and called out the weight and price of this completely optional tool rental. Per Rossmann, “part of the problem with tech journalism in general is… focusing on the things that are easy rather than focusing on the things that matter”.3. Rossmann reminds us that the right-to-repair fight is far from over. Board schematics and individual components are still not available even to authorized repair shops. He argues that these would enable him to more efficiently perform repairs.4. Rossmann: While the tech press’s complaints are “making the right to repair people look like… fools”, “it is important to [know] that they don’t represent us [normal repair shops and average users]”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good on Rossmann for calling out bullshit on his own side. Legitimate issues often get hijacked by do-nothing whiners, yet all too often they get ignored or even encouraged for the sake of prioritizing short term political gain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally agree with Rossmann: the more important thing is that you can lease the equipment from Apple but there is no obligation. The equipment is intended to do a job compliant with Apple standard but, if you don&#39;t care to replace the water proof sealant, etc, you can use tools you already have or more cheap from your regular sources ( hardware stores, ebay, etc). The right to repair is a serious matter, without activist like Rossmann, who spent his time to speak to the US Congress, we wouldn&#39;t even have the spare parts from Apple: this is the real vantage, not the possibility to lease the tools."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many memories. I am one of those who grew with WinXP (though I usd Win95 at school and for a few years Win98 at home), and as someone said in another comment, what else could a teen geek want besides WinXP with a bandwith connection?I still feel that seeing a XP Desktop screenshot invites to much more experiences (possibly online) than a Win10/Win11 screenshot. It may be with the fact that I associate it to different internet eras as well. With XP I used to browse websits, fansites, blogs, forums, chats, MSN messenger/Yahoo Messenger/etc, whil now everything seems to be the boring social networks where almost everything is generated/shared.Internet used to be much fun back then, and it may be the reason why most of the people have good memories about XP. I think the main reason (and I wanted to write an &#34;essay&#34; about this for a while) it&#39;s that we were offline by default in our lives, and we used to &#34;go online&#34; for a few hours durnig the day. Then you had your experience in the real world and went online to talk about them. Now it is the other way around - we live online by default, sharing photos and videos from a concert almost in real time, photos from a museum, etc. I think it took away its novelty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As of this writing, on May 20th, it has yet to regain the pegThis is misleading.

See https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/Is it trading at 0.1% lower than it was before the Terra USD collapse? Yes. Has it &#34;lost its peg&#34;?  No."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that everyone in the crypto industry is taking George Soros&#39;s approach to bubbles: “When I see a bubble, I rush in to buy it.”There is more money to be made on the gravy train of providing liquidity for trades, yield farming, etc. than in trying to short Tether and potentially bleeding out before it goes bust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t seen this before, you should definitely give it a try.  I am a big CLI person but I still find it useful, especially for displaying/visualizing metrics/performance.If you&#39;re on a RHEL or Fedora base, it might be already installed and running.  You just hit it on port 9090 with your web browser, and log in with your OS creds (same that you use for SSH).  If it&#39;s not installed yet and/or you want to also add performance co-pilot[1], it&#39;s pretty easy to do:    # Install cockpit and pcp and activate services
    dnf install -y cockpit pcp cockpit-pcp
    systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
    systemctl enable --now pmlogger

    # If needed, open port 9090 in the firewall
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=cockpit

    # Alternatively you can open it for just your own IP
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-rich-rule=&#39;rule family=&#34;ipv4&#34; source address=&#34;38.14.154.124&#34; port protocol=&#34;tcp&#34; port=&#34;9090&#34; accept&#39;

Here&#39;s the same commands in a gist if preferred:  https://gist.github.com/FreedomBen/62b348ed45045e53356aeb714...[1]:  https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/feature-pcp"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh hey, Cockpit; I remember when this was started. It was the Red Hat desktop team&#39;s skunkworks project to make an actual good server UI after the last few attempts failed; I can&#39;t find any evidence of it, but I swear there was this ridiculous project to generate a &#34;Linux API&#34; by automatically combining every other API and adding prefixes and headers. That came down from management since &#34;APIs&#34; were the hotness.The goal was to make in-roads on Windows Server-like deployments. &#34;Cattle, not pets&#34; was becoming uber-popular, but the thinking on the desktop team was that there was still a wide market for pets. People with toy servers, small businesses that just want a server inside their network, they all deserve UIs that don&#39;t require heavy sysadmin-ing.I think it turned out quite nicely, and it seems it&#39;s still going!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cockpit is an impressively robust “server in a box” frontend for homelabs or my favorite, running on a little ARM SBC with a USB Ethernet gadget exported.Why is this a cool setup? B/c I can carry around a little Radxa Zero that looks like a USB-C Ethernet adapter to my iPad, Windows laptop, etc., and gets powered by the same port, and gives me Cockpit on a known local IP, mDNS advert, etc.It’s a pretty good “hacking on the plane/train/mountain” setup, if you’re ever in the mood to try such a thing. :)Edit/P.S.: why not just run a VM? See above re: iPad or other locked-down device; also, exposed GPIOs are useful sometimes too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It turns out that the BBS also had a warez copy of Lotus 1-2-3 for UNIX. This was widely thought to be lost – I’m told it couldn’t compete with a more popular UNIX office suite called SCO Professional, so there were not many copies sold.I wonder if anyone still has a copy of Lotus 1-2-3/M? It was the port to the IBM mainframe operating systems MVS (nowadays known as z/OS) and VM/CMS (nowadays z/VM). [0] Not that I ever used it or saw it, but just I have become fascinated with it from reading descriptions of it. From what I understand, it is more different from 1-2-3 for DOS than the Unix or VMS ports were; the Unix and VMS ports work with character mode terminals (such as VT100 compatibles), which while rather different from the terminal model used on MS-DOS or text mode OS/2 (direct memory access to the  screen buffer), nonetheless are close enough that the bridge can be gapped–which (on Unix) is classically the job of the curses library (and its various descendants). By contrast, 1-2-3/M was written to work with the block mode 3270 terminals commonly used on IBM mainframes, which send to/from the terminal whole screenfuls of data at a time, rather than individual characters (somewhat similar, in principle, to classic HTML forms). This forced greater changes in the UI compared to the other ports, because a lot of things which are easy to implement with character mode terminals are essentially impossible in 3270.[0] https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ss..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That was awesome, but they skipped over the crucial part I&#39;m most interested in: how the heck did they rewrite and reroute the incompatible system calls and libc functions? That&#39;s probably the hardest task of it all.How would you go about it in the first place?EDIT: ah, their coffsyrup tool (https://github.com/taviso/123elf/blob/main/coffsyrup.c) with help from objdump (it&#39;s more powerful that I gave it credit for) does the relocation and patching. I would have loved to read more into that part of the process."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple can’t win here. If they had sent the sleek, easy to carry tools this author asked for, the author would complain about the pathetic tools they are providing.Really disappointed in The Verge on this article. Could have been a cool piece about the specific tech that Apple provides, but instead it’s framed so disingenuously that I come away not feeling particularly good about right to repair in general. It no longer sounds to me like people trying to get access to their own devices. It sounds like people taking potshots at BigCo because big co bad.By the way. The tools this guy used are common, dead-common in China. Go to any repair mall in Shenzhen and you’ll see hundreds of these.Does he actually want to repair his phone? It doesn’t seem like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading this article and the comments here makes me quite sad.1. The repair kit described here is not mandatory for anyone to rent to be able to buy the parts. You can just buy the parts alone and use whatever tools you want. If you attempt your own repair, you should use the simple ifixit style tools, and understand the higher risk of damage you are taking.2. The kit described in the article seems very decent for any kind of independent repair shop. They will probably already have pretty much the same setup.3. Right to repair is about access to documentation and parts. Nobody epects anyone to make it easy for the user to replace 512 pin BGA part. Right to repair does not mean that it should be easy to repair something, just that there shouldn&#39;t be artificial obstacles and that there should be supply of documentation and parts.4. Repairability is still an important topic and with discussing, but it is a separate issue from right to repair. E.g. I think phone makers could make replacing batteries much easier and that it would be a much smaller design compromise than some people like to claim. But that is a different topic from the baseline of right to repair.To me this seems like Apple has a good basic right to repair offering both for individuals and independent shops. This article is bad for the right to repair movement, because it doesn&#39;t understand what it is asking for.Parts. Documentation. No artificial obstacles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If made to fulfill the word of the law without actually having to follow it in spirit, this would be my modus operandi too.By designing $1200 deposit, $49 rental &amp; two Pelican suitcases of tools and manuals, while keeping the battery replacement price same at $69 (what you&#39;d normally pay in total at Store), they have entirely disincentivized self-repair without actually breaking any law.Masterstroke /s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to love fd - I&#39;m a big believer in the idea that CLIs don&#39;t have to be scary, intimidating things (see normals using Slack with /commands and keyboard shortcuts), and find has a gigantic hairball of a UI.The thing is, though, I know find well enough to not notice the terrible UI that much, and I know I can rely on it being everywhere. With fd that isn&#39;t  true.So it&#39;s hard for me to justify making the move.Same thing happens with things like the fish and oil shells - I have little doubt their UX is better than Bash&#39;s, but Bash is pretty ubiquitous.Emacs has this problem too, as an Emacs user. The UX is completely alien by current standards, but if you update the defaults you&#39;ll break a lot of people&#39;s existing configs.How do you get around backwards compatibility / universality UX roadblocks like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Civil forfeiture is a direct and obvious violation of the US Constitution and shouldn&#39;t even exist under the USA legal system and is dangerous to the US legal system:&#34;Article the sixth... The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&#34;Police under the US Constitution have to go before a judge and court and make an Oath under perjury of law describing the items to be seized. There has to be a justification and supported by affirmation meaning evidence and supporting facts. In the case of the building that was seized it was operating a perfectly legal business under state law. It had the necessary licenses and permits. There needs to be a direct challenge against this type of extra-judicial seizure in the US Supreme Court as it&#39;s a clear challenge to the entire operation of the rule of law and legal system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve long had an idea for solving the civil asset forfeiture problem.It&#39;s simply this: any asset seized must go to the general fund, not into a law enforcement fund.If a local police department seizes cash or a car, that asset goes to the state. If federal law enforcement does the same, it goes to the treasury, not the FBI or ATF or the Justice Department.This small change would remove the incentive to seize assets for any reason other than stopping criminals.We also need due-process reforms, but this would be a good start. Government departments should never profit from criminal activity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Coops is one of the structures that the author talks about in &#34;Developer Hegemony&#34;. The bulk of the book is about the inverted pyramid that modern software development houses are (with production being at the bottom, and manager on top).I really like this passage:&gt; “Consider a law firm. Do the founding partners go out and hire a Lawyer Manager to order them around, and then do they hire a VP of Lawyering to order the manager around? Do they then hire a CEO to rule over everyone and a CFO to handle the finances and a COO to schedule court dates and such? Of course not. There’s no historical precedent for all that fluff. Rather, they handle facets of the business themselves. What they can’t or don’t want to handle, they delegate to subordinates that they hire. The partners don’t specialize in finance, sales, marketing, or operations. That would be silly. But they understand enough about it to act as the boss.”...and this one:&gt; “It turns out that treating knowledge work pursuits like manufacturing operations doesn’t work particularly well. But it was the model inherited from the Industrial Revolution, and it’s been hard to shake. The thinking goes like this: if you break a complex operation down to its individual components and then have people specialize in those components, batching the work and letting people get good at tiny slices of it leads to greater efficiency. This works well for stations on an assembly line but not so much for writing software.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to see this list here on which our coop startup appears! (https://kantree.io) It is very challenging to raise funds as a coop indeed but we have managed to do it on small amounts (a few hundreds of thousands). We are one of the few product based coop and not service based.France (where we are based) is actually a very interesting market for coops. There is a very good legal framework around coops and a growing percentage of them. There&#39;s even an investment fund of tech coop as of recently! https://coopventure.fr/I think coops are a great ownership model for the future and for a more responsible economy. It is too bad that there is still very little support and recognition around it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I deeply wish this was more of a thing. If you look at the way law firms work, this is how they take their specialized knowledge and keep more of the value they create for themselves. I don&#39;t see any reason we can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t have a similar model in software engineering be the de-facto now that the field is mature enough to support it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to counter the prevailing negativity in this thread. I admire the pragmatism of this project. The developers are clearly willing to work hard to achieve what they value, such as producing a single self-contained executable on Windows. But they&#39;re also unafraid to take pragmatic shortcuts where they feel that it&#39;s OK to do so.I wonder if the fact that the original author comes from the largest non-English-speaking population in the world [1], a population large enough to have its own distinct software development culture, is relevant. I&#39;m guessing that they don&#39;t routinely participate in our English-speaking software development communities. If that&#39;s so, then they&#39;re not exposed to our norms or the constant negativity of our online discourse. Perhaps that&#39;s liberating. Perhaps we need more independent cultures, doing their own thing with no regard for what we think. In any case, for me, software developed in China, such as this project and Zoom (particularly the Windows client), provides an interesting peek into what Jimmy Maher called a mirror world [2]. It may trigger our natural discomfort with foreignness, but some of the differences from the typical American commercial software culture, such as a continued willingness to develop bloat-free native Windows apps, are refreshing.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31457771[2]: https://www.filfre.net/2017/06/tales-of-the-mirror-world-par...Edit: If anyone thinks what I said is offensive, please let me know, either publicly or privately.

Even comes with a rendez-vous system so you don&#39;t need to mess with firewalls (like you need to with VNC and such).I can&#39;t read anything on the front page though, the website shows up light-grey-on-white. Is that just me? Did the CSS fail to load somehow? Edit: never mind, the CSS sets the text color to #999 and a font weight of 200 for many elements. Apparently that&#39;s intentional. Going by the font list, I&#39;m guessing the theming was tested on macOS and made to look nice without testing if the fallback fonts were even readable in the slightest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Recycling is the most obvious way to cut down on plastic waste.I would think that the most obvious solution is to not use a material that lasts thousands of years for disposable packaging that’s only needed for a few months. Seems like these types of “revolutionary” new processes to make recycling finally work come out every year, and yet nothing changes. I can’t imagine this will be any different. As long as it’s cheaper to create new plastics than it is to recycle them, nothing will change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US sends millions of tons of trash to China, India, and other places. Perhaps it would be better for places to implement local sorting (glass, plastic, paper, etc.) and composting- as many other nations do as opposed to disposing of all trash in the same containers and shipping the problem off for someone else to deal with. But even better would be to generate less trash in the first place or at least have an attempt at transitioning to using biodegradable packaging. Packaging, which also is excessive and unecessary in the first place, like items in layers of plastic casing, plastic boxes, plastic wrapping, and so on when there are ways of distributing goods without convenient prepackaging in favor of instead refilling reusable containers or utilizing materials such as fabric, glass, or others which can be repurposed and reused more flexibly and reliably than plastic.Not even going to get into plastics being contaminated by toxic things, leaching chemicals, microplastics, affecting acquatic life, a variety of other problems relating to plastics and excessive plastic waste.I really wish people would push to decrease the production and use of plastics in the first place, seems more sustainable than trying to engineer solutions at the tail end of the issue. Seems to me much more effective to curtail the source of the problem than to attempt to implement solutions later on  although I do appreciate that some people see the issue and are working to do something about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depends on what the waste products are and how they are captured, otherwise you trade one problem for another. The plastic takes up space but if it&#39;s in a landfill you have carbon capture, best not to release that carbon into the air as CH4 or CO2."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll add my own data point into the mix. I&#39;m 49, have been married for 22 years, with kids who are either grown up, or well on their way. Throughout my life though, I have been an absolute loner in spirit. I grew up quite isolated, in the UK countryside, and learned to amuse myself early on. My first love was computers, which luckily has served me fairly well, career-wise. I haven&#39;t had many girlfriends, and felt very aware of this lack. When I met my wife, I married her more rapidly than I should have, if I&#39;m honest. I had no confidence in myself regarding my ability to form intimate attachments to women, and thought something like &#34;well if I&#39;m married, then that&#39;s that problem sorted!&#34;. Not so much.Still, we&#39;ve persevered, and made it work for 22 years. But I will soon be 50, and have chosen to view this round number as significant. I would like to start living life as I would like it, both career and relationship wise, and am currently trying to plan out what shape that might take. The stories and information in the comments here, are truly fascinating to me, the breadth of ideas being mentioned are a real breath of fresh air, and a great example of what makes Hacker News great (in my view), so thank you everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Loving families are easy to idealize from afar.How many families actually fit that profile? I’m not entirely sure.This is not a jaded attempt to say the pursuit of relationships or family aren’t worthwhile. I just want to set some context here for those feeling lonely, for those who feel like they are standing outside in the cold on the street looking through windows into warm living rooms full of people with warm feelings toward each other.I’m the only one of my siblings who has consistently been on speaking terms with either of my divorced parents. Both of my divorced parents consistently tell me they wish they could get away from their current spouses but feel it’s too late start over. Only one of my 3 siblings isn’t currently fantasizing of leaving their spouse. The mix of who in the extended family is currently speaking to whom is always in flux. Of my friends in very long term relationships that I know well enough to know if they are happy or not, about half are somewhere between resentful to  outright miserable. My grandparents divorced  when they were in their late 60s and went on to live much happier separate lives. In the hospital before my grandfather died, he insisted my grandmother should absolutely not visit him.Again, I am not saying seeking loving relationships and building a family isn’t an extremely worthwhile goal for everyone. Even given all I’ve said so far, I hope I can build one someday. It just bums me out to see people in threads like this idealizing what it means to find a partner, to have a family. It can be extremely good. It can also be extremely bad. Joining with others is not a magic spell that, on its own, fixes your life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in my mid 50&#39;s and a number of peers from different circles have all come to the same conclusion: they want to create intentional communities of friends to age with. One couple purchased several acres of land and has two friends living in a tiny house with them. Another friend is trying to raise capital to build the type of apartments/dormitories that the majority of US city-dwellers inhabitied in the late 1880&#39;s early 1900&#39;s: ones that shared a common dinner table and parlor for entertainment. Another has a B&amp;B that also serves as co-housing for 8 adults from their mid-50s to their 70&#39;s, and they share chores, which has been together for over a decade.I find this to be a uniquely western culture issue, compared to eastern asian cultures and indian subcontinent where multi-generational families mean you&#39;re never really alone.The author seems to have fallen into this void. I&#39;m sure even with everything I&#39;ve mentioned above it is still possible, but intentional or filial, the family must still grow and add new members to prevent this unique type of loneliness. I don&#39;t know how my friends&#39; intentional families will persist over the decades as they start to die, but they seem to be committed today."</p>

It is MPA when you hop between subreddits and other pages. But it shows a post on the same page when you click on it in a subreddit feed. I actually are annoyed by the new Reddit enough to switch to old.reddit.com most of the time when I end up on Reddit. Not sure why.

Why make your life harder. That is why I wrote Elder.js. Statically generate everything, sprinkle in interactivity where needed.But for internal dashboards I developed a internal framework to spit out crud apps based on nothing more than a couple graphql queries and a couple yupjs validations. It is a breeze and adding new data collection fields takes minutes so I and my team can focus on stuff that drives business value… instead of crud.As with everything picking the right tool for the job makes the job a lot easier. Don’t give into the hype one way or another."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recently a Chinese media interviewed me and I talked about a few side projects I have done in the past. I talked about the Neuralrad Mammo Screening project and Neuralrad multiple brain mets SRS platform. More awareness on radiation therapy to the general public will greatly help the community and we believe Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) will eventually replace majority of the whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in the next five years.Here is the link to the original article:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the UK the NHS don&#39;t do screening for breast cancer for under 50s because it&#39;s believed that it would do more harm than good by leading to unnecessary treatment for cancers that would never have actually caused any harm, and even where no treatment is carried out it causes great distress. Though there are arguments that the age cut off is too high, and should be set at 40.The above is with regard to a well-funded and regulated screening program that presumably has much better precision/recall than this website. I wonder what the cut off age is for this website before the diagnoses cause more harm than good? 60? 70?This is getting lots of upvotes because it&#39;s confirmation bias for the large segment of HN readers who believe that problems would easily be solved by a small number of brilliant technologists, if only it weren&#39;t for governments and big organisations with all their rules and regulations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very important caveat for all of you who are thinking, “woo hoo, no need to buy that EuRail pass! Or to buy an expensive ICE ticket!”These tickets are good for all “Nah- und Regionalverkehr,” explicitly excluding ICE, IC, EC (international) and long-distance busses (like the one between Munich and Zürich)If the train number begins with RE or RB, you’re good, but of course, those are the slow ones that stop in every village along the way.This is for the benefit of people who live here and are struggling with 2 EUR/liter fuel, not the kind of people who blithely paid 60 EUR to take the ICE. There does not appear to be any residency requirement, but remember, you’re not the target market for this (unless you live here and are struggling with fuel prices…)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would argue making it free and keeping it free would have been a cool move.
- Less/no expensive accounting
- Less/no personnel for checking tickets
- Less/no personnel for prosecuting people who don&#39;t have tickets
- Less/no ticket vending machines (and all the maintenance that comes with it)
- Less traffic on the roads since you can&#39;t beat &#34;free&#34; and hence less emissions (at least in hamburg trains operate on green energy) and less wear on the roads (might be offset by the wear on trains and busses)
- Fully non-discriminant with respect to incomeI have no idea if that would work for inter-city transport but for inner-city transport the HVV for example (the public transportation network responsible for hamburg and surrounding areas) sells 30 million tickets a year and I wonder how much it truly costs them to do that with all the relevant factors mentioned above."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context is given here: https://www.dw.com/en/germany-introduces-9-ticket-to-offset-...The ticket is part of a support package signed off by the German parliament. The will pay approximately €2.5 billion for the ticket offer, as a response to rising energy prices and the resulting high costs of individual mobility."</p>

A welcome addition!Too bad they&#39;re not using KaTeX [0] instead.It renders the maths server-side, so there&#39;s no runtime needed.An additional bonus is that the resulting math is copy-pasteable, which in the case of disply math might not be that useful (since most equations are to complex to be meaningfully copy-pasted with unicode), but it helps from inline math dissappearing when copy pasting texts.But, that being said, I&#39;m sure they had their reasons to do so.

Some of my favorites are the one on the mathematical &#34;hydra&#34;[2] and the ones on voting systems [3][4][1]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4aHmggTfFrpkPcWSaBN9g[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWwUpEY4c8o[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoAnYQZrNrQ[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhVR7gFMKNg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A channel worth subscribing. Matt (and team?) manages successfully to walk the fine line between managing the complexity of the topics they discuss (which are sometimes extremely dense), making it consumable for the population that&#39;s interested in science and physics, but doesn&#39;t pursue it on a daily basis. At the same time, they don&#39;t fall for the trap of dumbing it down to the point where the audience develops misconceptions and starts believing in pseudo scientific claims.There are some series they sometimes do, which are entertaining to follow. I also enjoy things like Journal club, where they pick a paper and deep dive into it. The audience also participates, in a way, where they pick the questions/comments from the previous video and answer them.However, it&#39;s not all academic either. There are some running jokes etc, which keep the content entertaining, while being informative, a format that I see common in some of the best Youtube channels."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot hinges on the dating of this site. How was it done?According to this article[1] (which has a nice wide-angle view of t-pillars in context), it was radiocarbon dating[1]. You find bits of stuff at the site and the isotopic composition of the carbon-containing material tells you the age based on known rates of carbon-14 decay.The actual isotopic analysis seems pretty solid.The problem is that this isn&#39;t any ordinary site. The article notes that the site appears to have been deliberately buried. This raises the question of where the samples that were dated actually came from.This critical review suggests major problems with the older-than-everything-else hypothesis for the site.[2] It notes that at least some of the samples were dated from &#34;fill,&#34; or the stuff that was used by someone at some point to bury the site. And that stuff could have itself come from sites much older than Gobeklitepe:&gt; We already discussed the problem with dating “fills” as opposed to dating “structures”. A fill’s date (no matter how confident we may fill about its actual date) in no way dates structures, as it simply can be coming from soil deposits that are either older or younger than the structure itself. You can fill your home with dirt from your yard, which could be from various geologic strata, some containing fossils from the Pleistocene. This will not make your home a Pleistocene Epoch home. Or you can currently fill a 4th century BC Temple with soil from riverbanks containing live exoskeletons; this will not render the Temple a 2000 AD structure.Even if the site wasn&#39;t deliberately buried, everything hinges on where the fill came from. The base assumption of radiocarbon dating is that no foreign material was brought in. The shakier that assumption, the shakier the claim to the ages being quoted.[1] https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14487942[2] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317433791_Dating_Go..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: I recently watched the amazing Turkish Netflix series Atiye (2019-21), in which Göbekli Tepe features centrally. The main character, Atiye, is a painter who&#39;s painted the same symbol all her life, and one day sees it in a news story about Göbekli Tepe, and feels compelled to travel there immediately. The epic story involves time travel, alternate realities, spirituality/mythology, archaeologists, academics, history, family, love etc. Also you get to see a lot of the Turkish countryside. I and the SO thought it really wonderful, highly recommended. (Warning: Season 3 is a kind of new story and loses the addictive watchableness of the first 2, but is not terrible.)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10075318/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_(Turkish_TV_series)p.s. Bir Başkadir (aka Ethos, 2020-) and Fatma (2021-) are another two excellent Turkish Netflix series.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11301642/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11961378/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"City noise pollution is a factor in all-cause mortality due to
long-term, barely perceptible stress effects on the cardiovascular
system. Unfortunately, one of the most disturbing and frequency sources
of city noise pollution is from emergency vehicle sirens.I gave a presentation at the Audio Engineering Society titled
&#34;Iatrogenic Sound&#34;, on the tragic irony of how sirens may causally
contribute to the heart attacks and strokes that ambulances are
rushing to treat.We were exploring the acoustics of urban design and the sound-design
of sirens. The sweeping &#34;wailer&#34; siren is in fact one of the worst
possible designs imaginable - all the wrong characteristics for
locatability of source, annoyance versus attention ratio, penetration
of dwellings etc. Add to that the design of modern &#34;luxury&#34; cars which
are soundproofed, fitted with anti-noise and blaring ICE systems to
block the world out.There isn&#39;t an easy solution. Most laws give police, fire and
ambulance crews &#34;discretion&#34; in the use of sirens. In the UK that&#39;s
Article 99. But here, the removal of crown immunity and insurance
pressures mean the crew now always deploy, even at times of night
when it would have previously been illegal under other laws. I expect
the same complex spheres of interest clash in NYC too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have lived in nyc for a long time both in manhattan and Brooklyn. I have never understood how these cars and bikes are allowed to roam the streets like they do openly all day and all night while police used to be so quick to arrest youngsters who jumped turnstiles or smoked weed. The asshole in the article that is quoted even has the courage to say things like they need that sound for safety of themselves and cars and pedestrians. It&#39;s 2022, ban these cars and loud bikes from city streets. Heck ban all the unnecessary cars in city centers and just use electric vehicles. The city belongs to pedestrians, not some &#34;tuff&#34; redneck gang who think they can do whatever they want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really excited about this. I live in the NYC area and I think noise pollution from vehicles is an under-appreciated problem. I think the worst impact from street noise is on sleep; even a bit of noise noticeably hurts my sleep quality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess I&#39;ll take the contrarian view here: the developer violated a reasonable Play Store policy, refused to fix the problem, and received an expected outcome.If you read the details of the Play Store complaint, you will see that they say the app was uploading information from the user&#39;s contact list without properly disclosing to the user that this was happening [1]. This is a violation of Play Store policy (a disclosure is required). It&#39;s not an unreasonable policy.You can see in the app&#39;s source code where some of this happens [2]. In short, the contact list is read off the device, email addresses associated with each contact are parsed out, and the app does HTTP requests to remote servers to get the favicon associated with each email contact domain. Note that this is the sending of information off each user&#39;s contact list (the email address domains) to those remote servers. As such, it requires a disclosure to the user.The developer&#39;s response is that he refuses to add a disclosure to the app because he is not uploading &#34;contact info&#34;. [3]. Ok... not a great response. Certainly I would expect apps to disclose whether or not they are using any information on my contact list to reach out to third-party servers, even if only domain names. In any case, it&#39;s Play Store policy.In the end, he finally removed the favicon feature. And Play agreed to allow the app back into the store. [4] But he has not yet backed down on shutting down the whole project because he&#39;s still upset.Sources[1] https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-5-0-fairemail-fully-f...[2] https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/blob/master/app/src/main/j...[3] https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-5-0-fairemail-fully-f...[4] https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-5-0-fairemail-fully-f..."</p>

I&#39;d never heard of FairEmail, but I&#39;ve definitely heard of Netguard! It was comfortably the best Android firewall &amp; had 5 million installs or so via Google Play.

The foundation of that plan is a new model called ACM Open, which asks research institutions around the world to underwrite the costs of publication for their affiliated authors. Over the past two years, nearly 200 research institutions have already signed on to ACM Open and ACM is fast approaching the first major milestone for the transition, when approximately 20% of ACM&#39;s newly published articles are Open Access upon publication in the ACM Digital Library.Source: https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/5/260362-thanks-for-the-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice - this means the May 1988 issue of CACM is freely available.

But I&#39;ve still got the dead-tree version of that issue around somewhere in storage because of another article, by Andrew Appel and Guy Jacobson, &#34;The World&#39;s Fastest Scrabble Algorithm&#34; [2].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;The policy for the first time directs that good-faith security research should not be charged. Good faith security research means accessing a computer solely for purposes of good-faith testing, investigation, and/or correction of a security flaw or vulnerability, where such activity is carried out in a manner designed to avoid any harm to individuals or the public, and where the information derived from the activity is used primarily to promote the security or safety of the class of devices, machines, or online services to which the accessed computer belongs, or those who use such devices, machines, or online services.Seems pretty reasonable.  There will be arguments over what exactly qualifies but it provides a clear guideline / reasons where someone at the DOJ can not charge someone with good reason.It hopefully side steps some of the &#34;what even is hacking / a security breach / dude just opened browser dev tools ...&#34; type questions where they can look and say &#34;He notified them of the issue, I don&#39;t think this was in bad faith.&#34;  Now you&#39;re all out of those other weeds.If anything hopefully this provides a good example to trickle down to other law enforcement agencies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"True, unless the person with the insecure internet service has lots of money or power. Then it doesn&#39;t matter. Rock the boat, even legally, and you get a not so friendly 6am visit from the FBI and they steal all your possessions, all your flatemate&#39;s posessions, and ruin your life despite no laws being broken or even an indictment.Only to return the stolen goods 10 years later by shipping them unprotected in cardboard boxes so badly packaged they arrive with parts sliding around freely and a video card sticking, literally, out the side of the cardboard box where it punched though.Basically, don&#39;t believe the Justice Dept. They&#39;re a bunch of lying assholes. And the FBI is made up of crooks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently bought a framework laptop for a daily driver when I&#39;m not on my desktop. For context I was running NixOS on an old 2014 macbook air, and I work on the glasgow haskell compiler in my day job so I do a lot of CPU heavy tasks.I&#39;ve got to say, as long as these things are being produced I&#39;ll never go back. They are just too good and I cannot recommend them highly enough. One of the things that didn&#39;t occur to me before I bought it was that _because_ of the modular design I can switch the side the power port is on. That may not seem like much but it was a revelation the first time I sat on the couch and thought &#34;huh I really wish this was over on that side....wait a minute!&#34;.I&#39;ve also had absolutely no problems with NixOS on my machine, even my apple earbuds easily connect via bluetooth, something that I never quite got working on my macbook.10/10 This is damn close to my dream laptop and I&#39;m excited a new version is on the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently received my first framework laptop after being a loyal Thinkpad user for years. I am loving it so far. I run Ubuntu 22.04 daily and have not had any issues with battery life or the lid (but I do typically leave it plugged in during lunch and overnight). The expansion cards are brilliant and the keyboard is comparable to my old t-series. The aspect ratio is great for coding and I&#39;m happy to see upgradeability is being taken seriously as promised. If I can get 5-10 years out of it like my old ThinkPads (all while upgrading piecewise along the way) I will be a fan for life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imo, Vangelis brought the synthesizer from an experimental novelty to an instrument for composition. The two sounds I associate with him are the long  brassy triangle with a steep envelope that we know from both Blade Runner and the accompaniment to the piano in the Chariots of Fire theme, and his effective use of chimes.I have tickets for Olafur Arnalds next week, and there is a younger generation of composers like Arnalds, Frahm, Richter, Tiersen, Aphex/James, and even Reznor/Ross, who could not have avoided Vangelis&#39; influence marrying the synth with classical techniques. He was a big part of what inspired me to start making synth music and more than a few of my tracks have homages to his work, and this note triggered a memory of playing the Chariots theme on piano as a really young child and it seemed to be everywhere at the time. A loss, but hard to mourn such an exceptional contribution as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He was a very unique, visionary talent. To back that up, beyond his scores, take a look at the following video to get a glimpse of how he worked.https://youtu.be/GWggDMDhwIAThere used to be some forum posts detailing the custom MIDI controllers and setup more, but it looks like a lot of it has been deleted or removed.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My memory holds that magical feeling, when in the mindnight darkness and quietness of home, suddenly heard a gentle stream of silver bells and a beautiful, maybe melancholic, melody from a tiny radio speaker... with no announcement of the author or name of the song. It was then just used as a last song of the day.Took me a veeery long time and other side of the globe to hear it again, again by chance, but with attribution in that case. Then some hours trying to locate the recording...La Petite Fille de Merhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P6qoTPhhv9wTruly as if having a chanceful glimpse of a Mermaid.Thank you for the magic, Master Vangelis.

It’s unclear how much they lost, but it’s interesting that Do Kwon’s name is still an actual logo listed on their home page.And Vertex Protocol (vertexprotocol.com / @vertex_protocol) recently raised $8.5m to launch a trading platform based on the Anchor protocol, but because their Phase 1 beta had just closed and the open launch was not planned until this summer, it looks like they may have just barely dodged the bullet?What I’m really curious about are the new and (of course) unregulated “insurance” products meant to cover catastrophic crypto depegs, as happened to Terra/Luna. Unslashed (https://app.unslashed.finance/cover) is supposed to kick in after fourteen days, I believe. We’re not quite there yet, it’s barely a week so far.

I have no experience doing what YC does and don’t claim to, but the jig here was so transparent that the smallest drop of “street smart” should’ve been enough to set off some alarms.We’re approaching a point where being passed over for “culture fit” is a compliment. Hopefully the embarrassment is enough to expand the founder vetting checkboxes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dont like the idea of replacing the time spend compulsively procrastinating with &#34;learning a new language, getting a pet, going to the gym&#34; is the right way.I see the root cause (for me atleast (used to read HN and blogs for 4 hours everyday)) is that i cant stand being with myself.During the last two months ive been trying to not panic when i&#39;m idle. And not take out my phone or read the nearest material i can lay my hands on.Instead i try to accept the necesity of &#34;falde i staver&#34; (danish for &#39;falling out of presence&#39;). When i was a kid i would often just fall into this state and just defocus with my sight and let daydreaming take over.Basically i have a war going against effectiveness. I hold unto my right as a mammal to be inefficient and sit drooling looking at trees.My advice on &#34;doing something&#34; when you have day without plans is the following:
Bike in the forrest, coffee from thermos near the ocean, read newspapers at the library, talk to people at trainstations (the frequent hangouts are always open for conversations)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like OP isn&#39;t necessarily an addict: they have ADHD.Half the article was them complaining about poor working memory, and the rest about getting stimulation/dopamine from unhealthy sources.Everyone has &#34;a little ADHD&#34;. We all occasionally, forget things, hyperfocus on things we are excited about, etc. ADHD is the disorder of having those struggles so often it&#39;s debilitating. It stems from having an underdeveloped frontal lobe that doesn&#39;t feel dopamine as well as neurotypical brains do, meaning an ADHD brain needs more stimulus to feel healthy.Because of the deficit in stimulus, people with untreated ADHD are statistically much more likely to have a substance abuse disorder (SAD); but in many cases, treating their ADHD (with medication and cognitive behavioral therapy) has the side effect of treating their SAD.Addiction, in the public consciousness/vernacular, is more abstract than SAD: it can mean anything from chemical dependence to unwanted habits. I suspect most people tend to make a false equivalence between the former and the latter. I see all the time people struggling to change a simple habit and immediately labeling themselves &#34;addicts&#34;. I think that&#39;s a unhelpful characterization.I think the point people tend to miss is that in order to change a habit, you don&#39;t just &#34;stop doing it&#34;: you must replace it with an alternative dopamine source. This is especially tricky with untreated ADHD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It scares me how much this reminds me of myself. I don&#39;t know how I was able to keep my job (and keep the roof over my family&#39;s heads) with my habit of not being able to concentrate on work at all because the minute I need to think a bit harder I immediately switch to reading news, HN or watching YouTube, only to finish my work late in the evening to save my ass (on good days)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This “default alive” advice is repeatedly shared.One thing it obviously does not address is the human element of who you cut and whether they will be “default alive” unemployed in a recession. A huge amount of YC advice in general positions founders as protagonists and employees as NPCs then are shocked people pick Google over their startup offer.Funny thing is I’ve seen this exact advice destroy a company. In March 2020 they did deep layoffs and cited the need to be “default alive.” Then their main market surprisingly quickly grew in the rest of 2020 , they wanted to capitalize on that, but they had laid off too many engineers who knew their infra and had enough outages and slow product development that they lost to their competitors and are now way underwater on their valuation.They decided to be serious and prudent and go “default alive” which ironically killed them. Of course if 2020 had gotten worse maybe they would look smart but the takeaway is there’s no easy answers.I would just like to see the human impact of layoffs at least lightly considered in these conversations which it rarely is. And it’s bad for business to as Im sure many people are hesitant to join companies that will have a gut reaction of doing 70% layoffs. If you even think about doing 70% layoffs you clearly over hired and are not making good leadership decisions leading up to the layoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dagnabit. Here we go again - this is a fantastic, pragmatic amendment to those notes -&gt;https://dalton.substack.com/p/letter-to-myself-in-late-2008?...For a taste:&#34;Doing multiple small layoffs is a form of cascading failure. Do one layoff, but much much deeper than seems correct. Do it decisively. Do it so that you get profitable. In your case that is something like a 70% cut, not a 5-10% cut. Yes you read that right: a 70% cut. Cutting once and cutting hard allows you to reassure the people that are still here that you are truly profitable and won’t need to do it again. Doing a layoff and remaining unprofitable and counting on fundraising to save you is a stupid plan.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bleak.&#34;No one cannot predict how bad the economy will get, but things don&#39;t look good.&#34;Clif notes:- Plan for the worst ... cut costs within 30 days... get to Default Alive[0]- Get money if you need it, and if you can- With or without money you must survive 24 months- VCs are people too, and subject to the same downturn. Adjust your fund raising expectations in the same direction. Expect lower valuations, lower rounds and many fewer deals.- Disproportionate impact on international, asset heavy, low margin, hardtech, high burn, long road to revenue companies- If you get a meeting, don&#39;t take that as a good sign, we still take a lot of meetings.- Future fundraises will be much more difficult than they have been in the last 5 years.- Don&#39;t expect more money until you demonstrate product market fit.- If you planned on raising money in the next 6-12 months, we recommend changing that plan, or you may be tryng to raise at the peak of the downturn- If you survive, and your competitor does not, you may pick up significant market share.[0] http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is a superficial complaint, but I found Rust syntax to be dense, heavy, and difficult to readI&#39;m a huge Rust fan, but sort of agree. First, I dislike C-style syntax in general and find it all very noisy with lots of unnecessary symbols. Second, while I love traits, when you have a trait heavy type all those impl blocks start adding up giving you lots of boilerplate and often not much substance (esp. with all the where clauses on each block). Add in generics and it is often hard to see what is trying to be achieved.That said, I&#39;ve mostly reached the conclusion that much of this is unavoidable. Systems languages need to have lots of detail you just don&#39;t need in higher level languages like Haskell or Python, and trait impls on arbitrary types after the fact is very powerful and not something I would want to give up. I&#39;ve even done some prototyping of what alternative syntaxes might look like and they aren&#39;t much improvement. There is just a lot of data that is needed by the compiler.In summary, Rust syntax is noisy and excessive, but I&#39;m not convinced much could have been done about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like I&#39;m on the minority here, but I generally like Rust&#39;s syntax and think it&#39;s pretty readable.Of course, when you use generics, lifetimes, closures, etc, all on the same line it can become hard to read. But on my experience on &#34;high level&#34; application code, it isn&#39;t usually like that. The hardest thing to grep at first for me, coming from python, was the :: for navigating namespaces/modules.I also find functional style a lot easier to read than Python, because of chaining (dot notation) and the closure syntax.Python:    array = [1, 0, 2, 3]
    new_array = map(
        lambda x: x * 2,
        filter(
            lambda x: x != 0,
            array
        )
    )

Rust:    let array = [1, 0, 2, 3];
    let new_vec: Vec&lt;_&gt; = array.into_iter()
        .filter(|&amp;x| x != 0)
        .map(|x| x * 2)
        .collect();

I mean, I kind of agree to the criticism, specially when it comes to macros and lifetimes, but I also feel like that&#39;s more applicable for low level code or code that uses lots of features that just aren&#39;t available in e.g. C, Python or Go.Edit: Collected iterator into Vec"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This is a superficial complaint, but I found Rust syntax to be dense, heavy, and difficult to read.I&#39;m not sure this is a superficial complaint. People say the hard thing about learning Rust is the new concepts, but I haven&#39;t found that to be true at all. The concepts are easy, but the combinatorial explosion of syntax that supports them is untenable."</p>

Nothing is more frustrating than working with peers you know aren&#39;t carrying their weight.Do you want to be an engineering leader? This is what you are, regardless of your official title at your company. Engineering leaders are judged by how much better they make everyone else. You may hear the term force multiplier used. Say you are really a 10x engineer, how much more effective are you if you could improve the efficiency of 350 developers by 10%? Mentor, teach, help establish culture, make systemic changes to help your peers become more effective.Regardless, I think you&#39;re a bad fit for your current company and its culture. And yes, many of us have worked in environments, like a startup, where we knew we were critical to success. Fail to deliver and a funding round wouldn&#39;t go through and people would lose their jobs. It&#39;s stressful, but I hope you&#39;re adequately compensated."</p>

You say you&#39;re big on self-improvement, but are you only focused on improving your work-related skills? All areas of life need attention, and it sounds like you&#39;ve only been focusing on the work part of work/life balance (work/life balance is so much more than just what hours you work)."</p>

But it can be easy to fall into the curse of the expert beginner: https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-th...While you can mitigate this to some extent by participating in groups (virtual and physical) for other great developers, the easiest way to handle this issue is to switch jobs.So, I&#39;d suggest you start interviewing.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I first started programming I was pretty lucky to get a job at a games company. My first lead was a veteran who had shipped a lot of AAA titles and he loved his war stories. He was personally interested in performance and he would often cite hardware timings for specific cpu instructions.One story he told a couple of times was about some grey beard who was before his time. The grey beard was once a legend in the company, often helicoptered into projects at the last minute to help them squeeze out the last bit of performance. His secret was he had a mental library of assembly language tricks applicable to the hardware of his day. But every few years his tricks were less and less relevant as hardware changed and compilers advanced. One day the grey beard was helicoptered into my leads project and everyone expected him to get them some gains. However, this was new hardware and none of his old tricks worked.I think of this story whenever I see jQuery popup on Hacker News. There is always a strong contingent of devs who swear by this library. But to me, they are like the old grey beard who didn&#39;t update his knowledge as the times changed. At one time jQuery allowed them to be the hero and &#34;Get Things Done&#34; faster than their competition. But times have changed.Argue with me if you must but take stories like this one for what they are worth. The writing is on the wall for jQuery. I was writing websites before jQuery existed, during the reign of jQuery and still today. If some candidate mentioned proficiency with jQuery during an interview I would be polite but internally I would note that the person might be out of touch. Not a red flag, but a yellow flag that I would follow up on. Nothing worse than bringing on a guy who claims to be senior/experienced and it turn out his old tricks won&#39;t work because they are no longer appropriate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangential, but sometimes I see people say that jQuery is dead/failed. While it&#39;s not as popular anymore, I think that&#39;s actually the perfect evolution for it. jQuery was making up for browser API shortcomings, and now many of those shortcomings have been addressed and been incorporated into browser APIs (not everything, but quite a bit)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Javascript has become so nice, now that browsers support modules.I use a module &#34;dqs.js&#34; for all my query needs. It contains only these two lines:    export const dqs  = document.querySelector.bind(document);
    export const dqsA = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document);

And use it like this:    import { dqsA } from &#39;lib/dqs.js&#39;;

    for (const rabbit of dqsA(&#39;#rabbits .green&#39;)) {
        ... do something with all green rabbits ...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wait until you get into the complexities of taxation.If you think you know them, pay attention to https://twitter.com/aotearoa_ben/status/1526786701750050817.That&#39;s a law that changes the tax rate if1. The purchase happens in Texas.
2. The payment cleared in a specific 2 day period.
3. The item cost &lt; $100.  The cost of shipping has to be included in the item&#39;s cost.
4. The item falls into specific categories that almost certainly don&#39;t match whatever categorization system you are attempting to use.Seriously, calling out just one example, https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/publications/98-490/scho... points out that a kit containing school supplies qualifies as long as the cost of the qualifying school supply items in it exceeds the cost of the non-qualifying items. I guarantee that you don&#39;t have a category for that in your accounting system..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working on a billing system for utility company and it was a nightmare but not for the reasons from the article.Dates are no problem, everything is billed at the end of month, quarter or year.Upgrades are downgrades are simplified, customer can legally change tariff only on predefined dates/events.Usage - yes, but exampled in the article do not even scratch the complexity of thisIdempotency is not really needed, the billing process is not continuous, it is a batch job.Cash collection is out of scope of billing software.Taxing was clear. Yes, there were multiple billable items with different tax rates, but not too complex. All customers were local.The nightmare part was:- customers can have multiple consumption locations, location can have multiple meters and customer can request to split the bill on multiple invoices or combine multiple bills to single invoice as they please- meters can be replaced at any time- meter readings are available on dates totally independent from billing cycle. Most of consumption data are mere forecasts.- when the actual consumption data is available, everything must be recalculated AND compensated (on a correction invoice showing the difference)- actual consumption data can be wrong and may be corrected at a later date, even multiple times- consumption points can be added or removed or moved to different customer at any time, but this information is only available after the fact- the prices can change mid-billing cycle for some customers but the consumption data is not available with that granularity- customer legal information (company name, address) can change mid-cycle"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at two companies in their payment systems. This post does a good job of mentioning many of the billing system challenges. I think it understates how difficult and important idempotency is to maintain at scale with multiple teams though.Additionally, it didn&#39;t mention financial regulation changes. India had changes sometime in the last few years which required whole new systems built that were specific to India customers. One example of complexity is this: does the system apply to customers who are in India or does it apply to businesses who are in India (the owners might not be)?He also did not mention fraud, which is basically uncollected spend that results in charge backs typically. If you get too many chargebacks, you&#39;ll get fined. If you get even more chargebacks, you&#39;ll get kicked off the card network and will no longer be able to accept cards within that network.Post pay (customer gets the product and pays afterwards) models are subject to more fraud, uncollected charges, etc.There&#39;s also the fun of dealing with downstream payment processors. I haven&#39;t worked with a processor or bank yet that was very reliable. Sometimes they&#39;d return 500 http codes and then process a payment, requiring manual intervention. Sometimes that happens with files of payments because most banks deal with files for transactions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well whether you add “site:.edu” or not, Google still does the thing where they just spit out a pile of extra “matches” that don’t contain your search phrase AT ALL.  Just thrown into the list, as if they have any business being there (oh wait, they do have business: Google’s business).Frankly, if it’s not reliable as a tool, it has no real value and I can’t believe it has come to this.  Imagine if every time you ran `ls` in a shell with a glob pattern, it just decided to sort of “add in” a few other files loosely based on your query (or heck, files that aren’t based on it at all)?  Oh, now imagine if `rm` did that.Sadly this happens with lots of search tools now.  Why the heck is the default state on a new Mac to funnel what you type to everything, e.g. I searched for “Chrome” and hit Return and the FIRST thing it did was throw me into the App Store and call up some not-even-a-web-browser scam app with Chrome in its name, instead of selecting the Chrome already installed on my computer and opening it?  More and more it seems that you have to turn off all kinds of poor defaults to put tools into a useful state, or there is simply no way to get them there at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nitpicky but the tire changing page doesn&#39;t actually fit your rational for choosing .edu pages&gt;Professors are paid generous salaries to share knowledge with the paying customers of the University (students). So, let’s find some paid unpaid University knowledge on how to change a tire by using our new trick!But the bottom of the page says&gt;Prepared by: [students] For Dr. Bruce Magee&#39;s English 303 (Technical Writing) Class, Winter 1997-1998.The professor is actually an English professor and the page was written by students as an assignment. I looked into this because I was wondering, &#34;what would a professor be teaching that he&#39;s writing notes on tire changing?&#34;. There&#39;s probably some professor out there that does that in an academic context, but there&#39;s probably a lot of things that no professor actually gets paid to write about. Maybe they would write about something miscellaneous like that anyway and put it online, but they would be doing so out of the culture of web savvy professors having personal pages where they upload stuff they think is helpful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not a Google problem, it&#39;s a web problem.Everything is based around SEO spam. If someone has a website, and they&#39;re producing content, their point is to monetize the browsing of the website itself, or promote their main product via the website.This incentivizes a certain kind of content, which is marketing content.These days I&#39;m back to searching social networks like Reddit or Hacker News for (at least somewhat) unbiased information.Google is a fuzzy-search address bar at this point for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since it&#39;s tangentially relevant, if you have an M1 Mac I&#39;ve created some boilerplate for working with the latest Tensorflow with GPU acceleration as well: https://github.com/alexfromapex/tensorexperiments . I&#39;m thinking of adding a branch for PyTorch now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool for a number of reasons:1.) Apple Silicon currently can&#39;t compete with Nvidia GPUs in terms of raw compute power, but they&#39;re already way ahead on energy efficiency. Training a small deep learning model on battery power on a laptop could actually be a thing now.Edit: I&#39;ve been informed that for matrix math, Apple Silicon isn&#39;t actually ahead in efficiency2.) Apple Silicon probably will compete directly with Nvidia GPUs in the near future in terms of raw compute power in future generations of products like the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, which is very exciting. Competition in this space is incredibly good for consumers.3.) At $4800, an M1 Ultra Mac Studio appears to be far and away the cheapest machine you can buy with 128GB of GPU memory. With proper PyTorch support, we&#39;ll actually be able to use this memory for training big models or using big batch sizes. For the kind of DL work I do where dataloading is much more of a bottleneck than actual raw compute power, Mac Studio is now looking very enticing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This problem is so much bigger than low-contrast pages.  Almost all technology of any kind selects in favor of aesthetics over equal access.I have moderate amblyopia and severe astigmatism.  For a frame of reference, I only barely pass the driver’s license vision test when I renew my license (don’t worry I don’t actually drive).My vision has good days and bad days.  My ophthalmologist thinks that I frequently have eye strain from looking at screens which further (temporarily) degrades my vision.Examples that I’ve run into _in the last 24 hours_.  - Why can’t I choose the colors of web sites and applications?

  - Why can’t I choose (and override) the default typefaces on mobile browsers?

  - Why can’t I change the default system font for my iPhone or my Mac?

  - Why can’t I change the font size in modern video games?

  - Why do most desktop applications fall of the edge of the screen below 1080p?

I rely on hacky tools to get by — e.g. momentarily dropping HIDPI or jail breaking devices.  No one would want to use technology the way I have to.  It sucks and it’s constantly getting worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And before we continue, let’s make it absolutely clear that we have no control of the color of the text in this very article, as it is hosted through Medium.com, which features poor visual accessibility of their site design. Further, Medium prevents their users from selecting black text as a choice. While Medium’s “Fischer-Price-simple” content creation is easy to use, it is also extremely limited, and fails in accessibility in areas beyond color. Perhaps this article can serve as a wake up call regarding this issue.So - why on EARTH are you publishing there? And for what it&#39;s worth, the areas that fail WCAG AA for colour contrast on this page are areas entirely within the control of the publication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"please stop forcing dark themes, reading white text on dark background is less readable so at least default to the user global preference cf https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pref...
I&#39;d be nice to see stats on the level of user engagement on black vs white texts, I assume the user probability to stop reading earlier when white is much higher, for me it is often a no go. Any scientific study out there?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can tell you why people still use ncurses: if you’re actually interested in accounting for all the nuanced eldritch madness that is terminal emulation implementation and history it’s a monumental effort, at least imo.Sure, if all you care about is coloring text on recent terminals, I do think just using ansi codes is fine.However, I completely disagree with the assertion that hardcoding ansi codes is somehow “more readable” than using a well-named API call that abstracts such detail away from the user. Maybe I’m alone in this, but I really don’t want to waste brain space memorizing ansi codes. Yeah I can write my own library or little macros to do this but…why? If I’m doing anything more involved than coloring text why wouldn’t I just pull in the lib I need? There’s no way in hell I want to maintain a custom implementation of terminal cursor movement for kicks. I’d much rather reach for a battle tested library that scores of other devs have already used and improved upon, whether it’s ncurses or one of the more modern TUI libs.Also, it’s become cool recently to hate ncurses for some reason. Are there things ncurses should do differently from today’s perspective? Sure. Is it’s api awkward to use in the face of modern programming features and paradigms that we’re now used to? Sure. But on the whole it’s design is really solid and it has plentiful documentation. Whenever I see rants like this I get the impression the author is a person that lacks an appreciation for history and the way technical development proceeds in general and imagines they are our technical savior, come down from the heavens to enlighten all us blindered fools about how terrible X is.If you want to educate people about ansi codes, great. A really inefficient way to do that is to wrap your advice in an obnoxious rant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a cross platform app to print &#39;pretty formatted&#39; source code [1]. I didn&#39;t want to re-invent the wheel on formatting source code, so looked at all the existing libraries. Originally I figured formatting to HTML, and then building a print-friendly HTML render would work. But this proved super challenging. I tried a dozen HTML engines (including Chromium) but none gave me enough control to render just a single page of the original source file.Then I noticed Pygments, a Python-based library for pretty formatting source code, has an option to output an ANSI formatted file. I quickly found a bunch of libraries that could render ANSI formatted text to a print canvas.In the end, I put the original source code file through &#39;pygmentize -16m -o tempfile.an` (`16m` is the 16M color terminal ANSI formatter) and pipe the `tempfile.an` through a print-optimized renderer to actually print the source code.ANSI escapes FTW![1] WinPrint - https://github.com/tig/winprint
[2] https://pygments.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems not to be aware of the recent TUI rennaisance[1]. There are libraries like termbox and blessings (python) that are a middle-ground between full ncurses and adding your own ansi codes. There are a lot of modern TUI frameworks like tui-go or tui-rs that bring common GUI conventions back to the TUI (heck there are TUI programming libraries that are designed to be similar to react) - these too tend to be a lot nicer than working with ncurses.Definitely worth checking out the full landscape these days if you&#39;re going to dive into making your console programs prettier.[1] My words, I just coined that name (although I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if others had said it too). I mean that in the last ~decade there has been a lot of TUI work in the background, with lots of new programs and some pretty stunning results. I blame unicode - once the web folks realized they could use something like font-awesome instead of sprite-sheets (or maybe as a pre-build sprite sheet?), and the &#34;icons in a font&#34; movement took hold, terminal programs got a lot prettier too. It makes sense, its the same font/font renderer provided by the system no matter if the app is a browser or terminal emulator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wowsers. This is a step change in quality compared to SOTA. I suspect that without evaluating samples as a correlated group, distinguishing between the generated samples and those recorded from a human will be little better than a coin toss.And even when evaluating these samples as a group, I may be imagining the distinctions I am drawing from a relatively small selection that might be cherry-picked. Nevertheless:The generated samples are more consistent as a group, and more even in quality, with few instances of emphasis that seem (however slightly) out of place.The recorded human samples vary more between samples (by which I mean the sample as a whole may be emphasized with a bit of extra stress or a small raising or lowering of tone compared to the other samples), and within the sample there is a bit more emphasis on a word or two or slight variance in the length of pauses, mostly appropriate in context (as in, it is similar to what I, a non-professional[0], would have emphasized if I were being asked to record these).In general for a non-dramatic voiceover you want to maintain consistency between passages (especially if they may be heard out of order) without completely flattening the in-passage variation, but tastes vary.Conclusion: For many types of voice work, these generated samples are comparable in quality or slightly superior to recordings of an average professional. For semi-dramatic contexts (eg. audiobooks) the generated samples are firmly in the &#34;more than good enough&#34; zone, more or less comparable to a typical narrator who doesn&#39;t &#34;act&#34; as part of their reading.[0] Decades ago in Los Angeles I tried my hand at voiceover and voice acting work, but gave up when it quickly became clear that being even slightly prone to stuffy noses, tonsillitis and sore throats was going to pose a major obstacle to being considered reliable unless I was willing to regularly use decongestants, expectorants, and the like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best solution to getting past the anxiety/fear-avoidance cycle is to take small, manageable actions while accepting the feelings that go along with those actions.Start with the smallest steps possible. Maybe that means opening the assignment and saving it to your computer. Then put it down and walk away. Come back in a little while and take another small step, such as reading over the assignment or making an outline of what you need to do to get it done. Often once you&#39;ve done something you will often start to feel a lot different than if you&#39;ve done nothing.Keep track of how you&#39;re feeling. It&#39;s okay to feel more anxiety at first because you&#39;re doing something instead of nothing. Those feelings tend to subside over time as you take action, but the point is not to reduce your anxiety, the point is that you are making a commitment to do something in your life, to live your life, rather than to remain paralyzed in fear. Your goal is not to get rid of the anxiety but to live the kind of life you want to live.This is the model for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. A great book on this is &#34;Get Out of Your Mind and into Your Life.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a slow process, but:1. Regular written self-reflection, i.e., keeping a journal and2. Re-framing &#34;failures&#34; as learning experiences; forgive yourselfhelped me a lot.The written part was important to me because it forced me to revisit my previous thoughts and reevaluate them in light of what had happened since last time I wrote.(2) also helped me do things with the mind-set that &#34;failure&#34; wasn&#39;t actually failure.  The goal was to try and learn from it.I didn&#39;t get around to doing this until after school, but I wish I had.  In your situation, I&#39;d try to get myself to do the assignment with a quick pass early on leaving notes for things I wasn&#39;t sure about.  Take a break, then revisit and revise.  Afterwards, write in your journal what worked well and what didn&#39;t.  Write about what you want to try next time differently if some things come to mind.Hope you find a solution that works for you.  E-mail is in my profile if you want to talk more about what&#39;s worked for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been through the same cycle for many years (I can even say decades). My recommendation is to seek help from a psychiatrist. You probably have generalized anxiety disorder and it often goes hand in hand with depression. A psychiatrist will be able to diagnose those and give you medication if you need it. She could also recommend therapy, but you need to be diagnosed first.Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a good mental health professional. You&#39;ll have to try many before finding a good one. Plus you will procrastinate of course. But you need to persist and make this task your priority. I know the pain you&#39;re going through, and nothing should be more important than ending the suffering right now. Once you get better you&#39;ll wish you had sought help sooner.From my research and my experience, there are two effective treatments for anxiety and depression backed by scientific evidence: antidepressants and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.The other comments are well intentionned but most of them are basically asking you to change your mindset and just do it. Obviously, if it was that easy you would have done it already. Anxiety and depression don&#39;t allow you to think clearly, that&#39;s why it is extremely difficult to get out of it on your own."</p>
