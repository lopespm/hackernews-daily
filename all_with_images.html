								<p class="story__comment_others">"First a pandemic and now my online home of the last 20 years being torn apart. This is really upsetting. The people of freenode are something special. I really hope the community can manage the switch without loosing too much of everything. Already the channel registration on libera is throwing established communities into chaos.I really hate that corporate shell game bullshit and attempts at monetization are being made by a dude that professes to love IRC. I wish andrew could acknowledge the hurt he is causing but it seems like saving face matters more to him at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When freenode announced that it was joining with Private Internet Access, staff were uncertain but assured that PIA was to have no operational influenceI mean, promises like that sound like obvious bullshit to me. ‘EA promises that Codemasters will continue to operate on their own like they did’. Yeah sure buds, who are you taking me for. Unless the company is a cash cow startup, why would anyone buy it with other aims than to try making it bring a bit more profit than the previous owners could manage? (Buying the team/the technology is pretty much the same, as it means the workings of the business will be thrown away.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love stories like this. I have one of my own, actually.When I was first getting into IT I started sending out CVs. Mine was terrible. I had been working in call centres for years at this point and all my &#34;experience&#34; was basically self-taught, so not really experience at all. As a result my CV was void of any actual content a hiring manager in IT would want to read, thus it was binned a lot.I applied for a job at a nearby network hardware repair place. They needed someone to look after their Cisco kit and about 30 Debian Linux systems. I was attracted to the mix of responsibilities so I applied, sending in me not-so-good CV. I was eventually asked to come in to have a chat after waiting about a week to hear back from the place.At the end of the interview, Bob (let&#39;s call him), said I was more knowledgeable than the RHCEs that were coming through his door. This was nice to hear, but then he said something that really made me smile...Apparently my CV was worse than I thought. It was so bad, that Bob literally put it in the bin under his desk. About four days later, Bob was reading through a local Linux User Group (LUG) mailing list and he saw a name he recognised: mine. So he opens the email and reads the thread in which I helped another LUG member compile a sound driver for their kernel. The instructions I gave worked.Bob was impressed but he couldn&#39;t quite remember where he had seen the name. At this point the business owner, John (heh...), was standing besides Bob&#39;s desk and noticed my CV in the bin. He pulls it out and reads my name across the top. The penny drops for Bob and I get the call to come in and have a chat.I got the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was 1992 and I was a high school senior.  My teacher got me a job at the local DPW in the electical department.  I was to work in the warehouse under a guy named Al who was an old timer and lost his hand in a forklift accident 30 years prior.  My job was to clean the warehouse, and when I was done Al told me to &#39;go hide somewhere&#39; which I did, at the top of the shelves 20&#39; in the air, which I had also cleaned.  
This got boring and so I wandered into the main office where people were huddled over a computer.  They were doing a mail-merge with quick basic to inform customers that their power would be out, and it wasn&#39;t working.
I looked over their shoulders and it was exactly what I had been doing to send out mailings to companies for free stuff as I had read in Radio-Electonics magazine.
I fix the problem, and the Chief Engineer said &#39;come with me&#39; and takes me to the (air conditioned!) sub-station and into an even colder computer room where they had just setup the SCADA system to control the towns breakers and monitor the power.  
Nobody knew how to program it, so he pointed to a 3&#39; pile of manuals and said this was my new job.  By the end of the summer we saved the town millions by siphoning power from the local college at peak power demand.  I still hung out with Al, and helped him in the mornings.  The linesmen still made fun of me, even more so when I accidentally turned off half the towns power for 15 minutes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a kind of similar story when I started studying in the late 2000s years. There was a company that had a specialized and really expensive measurement device. But the vendor went out of service. They changed part of their system but kept the measurement device only to find out it could not talk to the new system because the file system of the data was proprietary to the measurement device.I got a student job at that company and one of my first tasks (and that of several students before me) was to open measurement results on the device and type them into excel spreadsheets. I did this for an hour or so until I became totally bored so I started to tinker around. The measurement device had it&#39;s own PC that booted Windows (I think it was 95 or 98) and autostarted their software in full screen/some sort of . This was easy to bypass via the task manager and running explorer.exe. I found out that the proprietary file format was simplay an MS Access file with a different extension. I tried to open it, but the file was password protected.   
At this time I had little to none experience with programming or anything else that was &#34;low level&#34; computer stuff, but I occasionally stumbled about writeups about hacks and exploits and skimmed over them. So I was pretty sure that there had to be a hardcoded password somewhere. I started to open every file I could in a text editor with no luck. Then I got a hex editor and opened the binaries and finally, in a dll there was a password. 
The next few days at this job I spent teaching myself enough Python to read the Access files and write the contents into an Excel file.This worked and I used the free time to study/eat/sleep while getting paid for it but then one of my supervisors found out that I wasn&#39;t doing anything but still got results and wondered how I did it. He immediately put me onto another problem they had, thus starting my career as a software engineer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many of the comments on this article are so cold. I can’t believe it. When I read the original article I was imagining all the constructive ways HN readers would interpret it and hold a mirror up to their own behaviour. Some commenters are doing this. But it surprises and depresses me how many people are commenting saying “no, this list isn’t what it says it is, it’s a list showing the author has a negative mindset / is not from the Valley bubble, and that problem can be fixed by just getting over it.”. We can do better than that.As someone who has sat at some interesting class and race intersections during my career in tech, including my time at some very prestigious institutions like the University of Cambridge and FAANG, and has exhibited and noticed many of the listed behaviours and the lack there of, I can say this article had the undeniable ring of truth and made me feel sick to my stomach. Guilty for when I’ve been on the rich side and angry for the times I’ve been on the poor side.The psychology of growing up with financial uncertainty - and a risk of racial exclusion - is hard to shake and can be passed from parent to child. My life has mostly been financially blessed but you can’t buy your way out of the mindset, or snap your fingers / empty the cache / cycle the power the way the average HN commenter seems to think you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Three paychecks is a month and a half of income (rent and two car payments by my fevered calculations, which never stop)&#34;Pay attention to those last three words. This is very important. I&#39;ve been on both sides too, and to me those words are like a slap in the face: stark reality.If you&#39;re poor enough (relative to the costs of your life) you are at a constant exhausting deficit because you CANNOT stop calculating and recalculating the mechanisms of your basic survival. Even if you&#39;re not juggling bills and having to gauge what will blow up worst, you&#39;re projecting worst-case scenarios and trying to plan against adverse situations, which will come up more often for you (example: old car problems)&#34;which never stop&#34;Consider those words seriously. You can improve the quality and performance of a person a great deal by allowing them to function as they &#39;normally&#39; would, rather than in constant emergency mode."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m from a &#34;poorish&#34; family, but from Europe. Some stuff is relatable some is not:- People ordering lunch always felt weird for me, in my mind I think &#34;why should I pay 10€ for a bowl of salad, when I can go to the grocery store below the office and have the same for 1€&#34;, or even better pay 70 cents for the raw vegetables, wash them and chop them in the office and they will last 3 days- Student debt doesn&#39;t apply, the good thing of being &#34;poor&#34; in Italy is that the country pays you to go to university and not the opposite- When I got my first tech job I was like &#34;wow, I got a MacBook just for joining the company, this costs like 1 year of salary of my previous job&#34;- The part of stealing I don&#39;t find relatable, even when my bank account was empty I would never resort to stealing, must be some honour system I grew up with- The gym part is also not relatable, when I was fat and I did go to the gym everyone was very supportive, and every little progress was celebrated by everyone making you want to go more and more.A thing I notice, is that the mentality stays with you no matter your salary, I always try to avoid spending more than necessary, with a comparison with my colleagues my monthly expenses are less than 1/3 compared to them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to me that the draft was censored and mentioned a buyer, while this one only talks about control. For me, it paints the situation worse.Still sad to see FreeNode fall. This will lead to a lot of split communities and dead links.EDIT: Fuchs finds some harsher words[0]:&gt; In the past few weeks, this has changed[2], and the existance of a legal threat
to freenode has become apparent. We cannot know the substance of this legal
threat as it contains some kind of gag order
preventing its broader discussion within staff.
The democratically elected heads of their respective teams, 
development, infrastructure, projects and communities
were removed by force[3] and have been informed that they are not 
entitled to act in their respective capacity.&gt; [...] A contract in which christel, former head of staff, allegedly sold freenode, surfaced.
And while I personally think that this would have neither included any servers
or code or user data, since that did not belong to christel to sell, I am not a lawyer
and apparently some of our volunteers got pressured very hard and their personal life
could have been ruined easily should we have fought against this apparent contract.This makes it look far more hostile than the linked note. Sad to see.[0] https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently London Trust Media, the company founded by Andrew Lee and which purchased Freenode, has now rebranded under the name &#34;Imperial Family Companies&#34;. londontrustmedia.com now redirects to https://imperialfamily.com/ and it lists Freenode under Technology.Andrew Lee also claims to be the crown prince of Korea, which was no doubt the inspiration for this move: https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2020-12-0...Lee also hired Mark Karpelès (of Mt.Gox infamy) as CTO of London Trust Media. and he is still listed as CTO of Shells.com, which is also owned by Imperial Family Companies: https://www.shells.com/l/en-US/teamEdit: Comment was moved, reworded to make it work in its new context."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Giving your project to a stranger on the internet is risky, so we used escrow.com to make the transfer.I sold a website on Flippa once. The buyer put the money on Escrow.com, I transferred everything over, and they went AWOL. What I found out is that there is no straightforward way to obtain the funds when it happens. Apparently there is no way at all except via the court system. Which would mean the only real protection Escrow gives is against the buyer going bankrupt (or using false identity, I suppose).Fortunately, they came back several weeks later with some nonsensical excuse and closed the transaction, but I will never use Escrow.com again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hard to take this seriously with all the straw men and broad generalizations.Reality check: there has never been a hotter seller&#39;s market for software engineering talent.  The fact that you have not landed a job does not mean that supply is not short in general.  Rather than blowing your stack at some recruiter who you heard on a podcast interview, you might want to reflect on yourself and how you might be coming off in job interviews.As far as low pay goes, yeah, welcome to the labor market.  It&#39;s easy to write a blog post about how companies need to pay more, but hard to reconcile the reality that if they don&#39;t have FAANG cash flows, &#34;market rate&#34; for developers may not be viable, regardless of management&#39;s good intentions or lack thereof.And with regard to bad interviews, remember interviewers are individuals, with skillsets all over the map.  Once you get more senior it gets even more frustrating to be judged by someone who has a fraction of your experience.  Trust me when I say there is no value in dwelling on this or getting your undies in a bunch.  Suck it up and figure out how to play the game (read CtCI, practice on interviewing.io, ask for feedback) and land the job, then do the best work you can every day.  Angry screeds will not change anything about the industry and will not help you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This person sounded really experienced, so I looked them up on LinkedIn. 7 months at their first company. 9 months at their current company. That&#39;s it, aside from non-programming jobs before their bootcamp.The whole thing reads like inventing scenarios that didn&#39;t happen or embellishing them.&gt; A bad interview is when you ask them the definition of some specific thing in some specific framework like “Tell me what a closure in javascript is.” then treat them like they’re stupid if they don’t know.Not that believable, but okay.&gt; I once had an interviewer ask me if I was a wizard with GO, C++, Rust, and C over the phone. Then when I said I had some experience with rust, he immediately cursed at me and hung up.Didn&#39;t happen.&gt; Nobody in their right mind is going to move to San Francisco, California to be a “Lead developer” for only 70k with zero equity.Are any companies actually trying to recruit like this? And is it successful beyond just throwing up a hiring post and not getting anything? I put in a limit buy of $3000 for 1 BRK/A on a whim once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The general rudeness is ridiculous. I once had an interviewer ask me if I was a wizard with GO, C++, Rust, and C over the phone. Then when I said I had some experience with rust, he immediately cursed at me and hung up.&gt; This experience is fairly common.Is it? I&#39;ve done a fair bit of interviewing on both sides of the table, and can say with complete honesty I&#39;ve never heard a curse said in anger in any of them. I&#39;ve also never heard of it happening from a co-worker or friend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like how it trains you in noticing issues in alignment, spacing, font setting etc. But as others noted it mixes clear mistakes with highly subjective opinions around size, shape and color choices and even dark patterns while suggesting to use this test to filter out job candidates for design positions [0].While there might be some merit to this method for educational purposes I&#39;m generally wary of fully automated assessments as they often include hidden biases like in this case and just end up enabling you to hire the same kind of people all the time (which admittedly already is an issue with human assessments/interviews, so lets not make it worse).[0] https://cantunsee.space/business"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;activity indicator color&#34; one is &#34;wrong&#34; to me. It says &#34;2h&#34; by her name, meaning she was last online 2h ago, meaning that her activity indicator color should not still be green. 
Already feeling like some of these are one person&#39;s opinion, biased towards the current status quo in mobile/web. Although there are a lot of good points around padding, font, contrast, etc. Main theme seems to be around consistency.Edit: Okay, well, I got  7580

I think a lot of this was more &#34;find the difference&#34; than it was &#34;tell me what version is better&#34;. Once you are able to find the subtle difference, it&#39;s pretty obvious which one is better, mostly because one of them lacks self-consistency. I think a lot of the tracking, color, and tint differences were pretty opinionated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a big fan of 1Password. I&#39;ve been paying for it for years. A few years ago I got my partner setup in a few minutes and now they have strong passwords everywhere.  Its got great features for sharing vaults with other people so I&#39;ve got password managers setup for the kids too. My partner and I both have personal vaults, we have a shared vault for financial stuff, and a shared vault for our media accounts (that we share with the kids too)I get that people bristle about SaaS subscriptions in their personal life but the $60/year it costs is well worth it. The research shows that strong passwords and limiting re-use is extremely effective at preventing account compromises and 1Password makes this dead simple.The thing that finally made it an incredible app was when Apple finally allowed 3rd party password management in iOS.Yes there might be better password managers out there and they might have better security. However show me an alternative with a UX that is simple enough for my 6 year old to use, that works on iOS, Android, MacOS, and now Linux."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA: Note that AgileBits intentionally hides the standalone license option and pushes subscription as the only visible scheme to get the application. This is a long standing dark pattern, and though the support staff will admit on their forums or here that the standalone license does exist, you wouldn&#39;t be able to find it without some special incantations on the forums. They will keep reiterating that it&#39;s for your own good so that you don&#39;t get confused.The application UX may be great. The sync may be great. The security of the closed source application may be great (because of audits). But this single dark pattern and the condescending attitude of their team members whenever the topic of standalone license comes up are enough to avoid this company. If you can get to the standalone license purchase option within three or four clicks from the main site, do let me know.I switched out of 1Password to Bitwarden long ago. I will admit that Bitwarden is not fantastic (I find it somewhat slow and also lacking some features). But it doesn&#39;t use dark patterns like AgileBits does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting:&gt; 1Password for Linux also debuts with several features that are coming soon to 1Password for Mac, Windows, iOS, and AndroidThat should be encouraging for Linux users. It suggests that the Linux version is not just a port that will forever at best follow the other platforms. It can get pretty annoying when you have something that is available on multiple platforms, and your platform tends to always lag the others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proof of Stake is already how our current financial system works. The people with the most money make the decisions. Proof-of-Work is provably resistant to this, as evidenced by the 2017 blocksize debate where almost every large miner and bitcoin company wanted to change the protocol and it was fought off through grassroots efforts. A PoS currency will be controlled by a cabal of US financial institutions, and indirectly by the US regulatory system. Be careful what you wish for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A good friend of mine at Google is the technical lead of this project (he has a Phd Princeton, and was a professor before joining Google).I&#39;ve tried it in person and it was truly amazing.  They used some very fancy tech when I saw the demo, so I&#39;m thrilled it is finally being announced and possibly shared with a larger audience.Explanation of why it is amazing:  It totally fools your perception. No glasses or goggles--but rather an 8k display with special glass that allows your different eyes to see different pixels (a light field).They also optimize the sound, and the rest, so as all the testimonials point out, you actually feel like the person is in front of you.It also works for the &#34;cube&#34; around them, so if they hold up some object, it also feels like that is in front of you.Amazing..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, I wanted to share my amazing experience with a similar but lo-fi tech.My mom and dad for the past 2-3 years have mostly lived in two separate countries (due to work reasons) and I could tell they miss each other quite a bit.I got both of them an Echo Show 10&#34; device each and set it up for them. I don&#39;t think I can explain how our lives have changed for the better, just based on this simple piece of tech.The Echo Show is now pretty much constantly on video call for 14-16 hours a day in the living room of both houses and it has become an extension of the one another; a window into the other house. The audio and mics are good enough that at times you genuinely forget the other person is not in the same room. This has truly helped them, especially during Covid times.It&#39;s actually good enough that my parents have their morning tea together practically almost the same way they used to when they were physically together. They&#39;ve told me multiple times &#34;I don&#39;t know how we could&#39;ve lived without this Alexa thing&#34;.If Google can eventually get the prices down to reasonable levels, I really think people would be shocked at how fast this thing becomes part of our daily lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool as hell, but I have to say I feel like we&#39;re solving top-level problems when most consumers don&#39;t even seem to be getting solutions to the most basic pain-points.For me, the problem with video-calling isn&#39;t the image-quality.  It&#39;s all the much more mundane technological problems - high latency, lag-spikes caused by bad ISPs, failed noise-cancellation for people who don&#39;t use headsets for audio, bad wifi routers cutting out, etc.First thing I did when I realized we were going to be WFH long-term was buy myself a $100 gaming headset.  Next thing I did was get all my home computer stations wired with Cat 6.That stuff is far more fundamental and far less interesting than 3D telepresence, but it&#39;s the real unsexy problem that so many people are suffering through this pandemic.Even simple things like latency make simple, natural reactions agonizing.  Talkcover and crosstalk is incessent and I&#39;ve developed a filthy habit of just talking over people because otherwise it&#39;s a solid 20 seconds of &#34;you go no you go&#34; caused by awful latency.  I&#39;ve had to defuse angry reactions by co-workers who feel they&#39;re being interrupted by other co-workers and explain to them that the latency makes interruptions feel worse than they are.I&#39;ve tried to push friends to join me on my private Mumble server where the latency is near-nil and the call-quality is excellent, but there&#39;s always one person who doesn&#39;t have a working headset and wants to just use a laptop or tablet mic with no feedback-cancelling that destroys the conversation through echos (plus Mumble&#39;s auth system is needlessly bewildering).Then with video, problems are similar but less impactful - cheap cameras, poor lighting, compression artifacts, poor sync with the audio, etc.  And it&#39;s infuriating because every person has a wonderfully powerful camera in their pocket right now - and there&#39;s software to connect them but it&#39;s just too tricky for most people.Good on Google for taking an interest in the subject, but I feel like they&#39;re decorating the apex of the technological pyramid while most people are pushing stones around at the bottom."</p>

[1]  Even her documentation is made with care; when I have more disposable to spend I&#39;m definitely buying a module.[1] - https://twitter.com/micktwomey/status/1383527521744867338/ph..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great point on embedded dependencies - In theory they can be a time saver, but in Rust land, they&#39;re often too.. abstract, and full of missing features and bugs. Easier to open the datasheets, and send a few bytes down the SPI/I2C etc lines. I haven&#39;t been able to use any deps without forking. In Rust, popular abstractions tend to get in the way too, ie if a rust peripheral struct is trying to own a shared bus.Another good point, re HALs. She skipped the official HAL after finding it to be too much trouble. I&#39;ve found that a good peripheral access library generated from SVD files is all you need, and is easier to work with than a HAL that&#39;s not carefully made. Ie an API that provides named register blocks, registers, and fields, and knows how many bits go in each, which you can read from etc. (Is this what the CMSIS lib she mentioned is?)Related to the last point: &#34;I write very small, usually project-specific, abstractions over that&#34; - If you decide a popular or official HAL isn&#39;t helping you, you end up writing your own HAL!&gt; I&#39;ve chosen to avoid using the Node.js ecosystem in favor of just plain JavaScriptAlso a choice I agree with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest thing that I notice, is the extremely practical approach she takes.Decisions based on reality, limits, and resources. Despite all that, she&#39;s a remarkably capable person that makes it all work; regularly, and repeatably.I&#39;ve had to make those types of decisions all my adult life. It&#39;s how we ship."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article talks about Core Web Vitals in passing. That&#39;s the major change here. Two posts from May 2020 talk about them more- https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-ess... introduces these metrics, what they mean and how to measure them.- https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating... talks about how the search engine experience will change&gt; The change for non-AMP content to become eligible to appear in the mobile Top Stories feature in Search will also roll out in May 2021. Any page that meets the Google News content policies will be eligible and we will prioritize pages with great page experience, whether implemented using AMP or any other web technology, as we rank the results.&gt; In addition to the timing updates described above, we plan to test a visual indicator that highlights pages in search results that have great page experience.Seems like a positive change. It will mean extra work as developers improve the performance of their sites. But having clear metrics to improve will make that work tractable. Also, advocating for that work to senior management will be easier when it&#39;s so clearly tied to SEO.The upshot is that ordinary users will experience a more performant web. Not overnight but over a few years, like the shift to HTTPS and supporting mobile web versions. Both of those changes were driven in part by the desire for better ranking on Google."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This won&#39;t really do anything for availability or reducing scalper pricing. Miners are a sizeable proportion of sales but far from the majority. Gamers will be able to buy more of these GPUs but less of the non-LHR or AMD GPU&#39;s. GPU prices won&#39;t actually change.The real reason Nvidia is doing this is that when mining profitability inevitably drops, either because of a crypto price crash or Ethereum moving to Proof of Stake, the miners will flood the used market and ruin Nvidia&#39;s profits for a few quarters. Nvidia is trying to get miners to buy mining-only cards, because those can&#39;t be sold to gamers down the line. They&#39;d rather mining cards become e-waste in a few years than get resold.People think Nvidia is doing this to try to help them get better prices now, but really Nvidia is trying to extract more money from gamers in the long term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does this behavior anger anyone else on a deep level? I get that its hard to buy GPUs right now, but this seems like such an attack on general purpose computing.Hardware manufactures already segment features between consumer and busness grade parts that the silicon itself is capable of, such as virtualization, but restricting what algorithms one can run is a whole new level.I am pretty sure my next GPU is going to be AMD due to this behavior by Nvidia."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When OpenAI trained their Dota model to beat people 1v1 mid SF, they had a contest at The International (the big yearly dota tournament, RIP) like &#34;can you beat OpenAI&#39;s new bot?&#34; and had a big bucket of prizes for anyone that could.By the end of the night, the bucket was empty. People learned to cheese the bot by running &#34;out of bounds&#34;, so to speak -- normally in a 1v1, you&#39;re supposed to stay close to your opponent, since they&#39;ll be getting stronger if you leave. But the bot didn&#39;t know how to deal with it when you snuck behind it (normally an insane maneuver, almost guaranteed to cost you the game in normal play) and prevented his army (called &#34;creeps&#34;) from running to the middle lane. (All you have to do is go wave your hand at them, and they mindlessly chase you.)People did that over and over, and your own army would eventually overwhelm the bot and win. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An astonishing insert:&gt;A good example of human exploitation of the engine&#39;s failings is GM Hikaru Nakamura&#39;s defeat of Rybka in the following three-minute blitz game from the Internet Chess Club. Nakamura cleverly locks the position so that progress is impossible for Rybka, then he offers two exchange sacrifices to the engine. With the position locked, the engine&#39;s rooks have no value, but the engine thinks it has a winning material advantage. With a draw by the 50-move rule approaching, the engine sacrifices a pawn to avoid a draw, but this proves a huge mistake as Nakamura is then able to win the game, an incredible achievement!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When watching the WC games, I&#39;ve seen it happen that a move wasn&#39;t considered as a top move by the engine, but once played the engine realizes it&#39;s actually crushing. Something about the heuristics used to prune the vast search space can make it miss sacrifices or seemingly sub-optimal moves that temporarily weakens the perceived position but has a huge payoff in the end. But humans find them. Of course, given enough time and depth the engine will eventually circle back and try the move. But it has no intuition.Also, an engine without an endgame tablebase can be pretty stupid. There are certain rules one can deduct when there are few pieces left, but a min/max engine will search forever, not knowing the patterns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked with a number of brilliant people at Bell Labs through the 1980s/1990s. The most comfortably competent among them, the most productive among them, were also the least abrasive. They were also the most self deprecating.Not just one or two, but the majority of them. To the point that the aggressive geniuses stood out. And I worked for/with two abrasive ones as well, so I know the difference.The same was true for the two startups I worked at after that, and Qualcomm, and now the third startup where I work.The really productive geniuses in each situation were easy to work with, I think largely, because of their confidence in their own grasp of the subject at hand. They had nothing to prove, they knew that, and it showed. The difficult people were never stupid, far from it, but they felt like they needed to defend everything they did, every decision they made, and that made working with them less productive.With the gentle geniuses, if you thought you came up with something that was an improvement on what was being done, they would look at it honestly, and if it was not better, they would calmly explain why, and if it was better, they would acknowledge it right out and discuss how to merge that into the current work.The &#39;less gentle&#39; ones would take pride in pointing out the flaws in your idea if you were wrong, and if you were right, would fight you over whether it had any real value at all, then would stiff arm you as far as getting it accepted as a change."</p>

Sure. But the folks who truly stand out in my mind are a level higher. They&#39;re the ones at the top of their game, who know how to demand &amp; command excellence, without being jerks about it.I&#39;m reminded of this episode of &#34;The Chef Show&#34; where Jon Favreau compliments Roy Choi behind his back. He tells Bill Burr that he had followed Roy around for a full day, going to all his restaurants and food trucks, and not once did Roy raise his voice to his staff. It&#39;s pretty cool to see how much admiration one artist/leader has for the other, not because of their technical skills but because they choose to be kind.I don&#39;t think we need to settle for being &#34;fierce nerds&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since pg&#39;s essay is of a psychoanalytic nature, I&#39;ll reply in a psychoanalytic frame, for the sake of conversation, not criticism. [Protip: never psychoanalyze anyone! This likely applies even to psychoanalysts.]During the last year or two pg has written more than a few essays and tweets which appear to be of a defensive nature. People like him contribute more than other people, it&#39;s alright to to be fierce, can&#39;t speak the &#34;truth,&#34; etc.Whenever there is dichotomous thinking, cognition has moved away from clarity. If it were me, I&#39;d be asking myself, What is being defended? (This kind of question can be a multi-decade inquiry.)Although most of us are easily baited into self-justification or self-promotion, I think going down that path it is ultimately a distraction from doing real work and knowing who you are."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really interesting. Prior to this, Firefox&#39;s isolation model was much weaker than Chrome&#39;s due to only having a pool of 8 content processes. If I&#39;m reading the technical blog correctly [1], this will move to a process-per-site model without also doing process-per-tab as Chrome does, i.e. if you have several tabs open on the same site, they&#39;d be in the same process. This seems much less resource intensive than Chrome&#39;s model while still delivering similar security properties.[1] https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/05/introducing-firefox-new-si..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When Chrome was new and shiny, I used it for a time. Then, the first time I found myself needing to kill Chrome because it was completely locked up, I found myself staring at a wall of chrome processes in the task list, not knowing which one I needed to kill. At the time, I thought the idea of a separate process for each tab was silly. Though, with Firefox moving towards this model, I guess the engineers at Google were prescient in the correctness of that tradeoff.I do use a lot of tabs, so I fear I&#39;m going to find myself facing the same problem I faced with Chrome: a site misbehaves and locks things up, crap, which process do I kill? A way of tracking which tab maps to which process would be nice, so the next time I trip over a badly-coded page, I don&#39;t have to kill everything just to get my browser to respond again. Lazyweb question to y&#39;all: is there a feature in Chrome or Firefox that can do this (mapping tab/page -&gt; process), or have I just stumbled upon a side-project idea?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not really related to the article at hand, but I&#39;ve been on a bit of a Google Maps binge the past couple weeks. I learned a few interesting facts, blurry Israel being one of them.Another strange thing I found that might not be super well known (I didn&#39;t know about it) is that all GPS data in China is offset by a nonlinear psuedo-random amount. If you turn on the satellite view in Google Maps and look at various cities in China, you&#39;ll see that the road and business overlay is off by anywhere from 50m to 500m. And the strangest thing is that it&#39;s not a consistent offset from place to place.Turns out this is very intentional, and China uses a different geographic coordinate system than the rest of the world. WGS-84 is the most common coordinate system, but China uses GCJ-02, sometimes called Mars Coordinates. Part of GCJ-02 is an algorithm that obfuscates the results. So applying any GCJ-02 coordinate to a globe using WGS-84 coordinates gets distorted like a funhouse mirror.It&#39;s easy to find open source libraries to convert WGS-84 to GCJ-02 and vice versa. But Google Maps doesn&#39;t do it, for political reasons I suppose? I&#39;ve read that if you open Google Maps within China the mapping data is correct, but have no way to test that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangentially related but where does this come from and why is it so widely repeated (as in this article):&gt; ...Gaza, one of the most densely populated places in the worldI&#39;ve seen this claim (both in the &#34;one of the most...&#34; and &#34;the #1 most...&#34; forms) many times and I don&#39;t know where it comes from. What am I missing?Here[0] wikipedia says Gaza Strip has ~5,046/sqkm. I thought maybe Gaza City was meant, it&#39;s density is 13,000/sqkm[1]. Neither of these come close to ranking on wikipedias list of cities by population density[2], and I haven&#39;t been able to find any &#34;most populated places&#34; lists that list anything below 15,000 people per square kilometer, which Gaza city is well below.Is the BBC just plain wrong here or am I missing something? I hope it&#39;s me because if it&#39;s the former, that says something really bad about their fact checking and would suggest that BBC is not a reliable/trustworthy source, at least on this topic.    0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip

    2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This link title is extremely misleading to the point of being disingenuous and provocative. The title of the linked article is “Israel-Gaza: Why is the region blurry on Google Maps?”... because the entire Israel / Gaza / West Bank region is blurred in the exact same way. There is no preferential blurring of Palestinian areas. The clear answer is to prevent actors on both sides from using Google’s satellite imagery to plan attacks against one another. But please continue the breathless hot takes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the article:&gt; J Balvin said: [...] With Lossless, everything in the music is going to sound bigger and stronger but more importantly, it will be better quality. [...]There have been tests showing we cannot hear the difference between minimally lossy audio (e.g. mp3 320kbps) and lossless. But Balvin can. And it sounds &#34;bigger and stronger&#34;.The extra quality of lossless is nice when mixing/remixing the sound, as the inaudible loss of quality with minimally lossy audio (e.g. mp3 320kbps) is audible when the sound is sped up or slowed down.But, and this the article does not mention, is not what Apple Music wants you to do. The formats will be proprietary with DRM.I prefer FLAC/OggVorbis/etc when it comes to music. But then I like to be able to mix/remix."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple can add feature after feature, but if Music continues to split albums without warning, it&#39;s close to useless. I can&#39;t curate a music library when I can&#39;t rely on my music not being jumbled around. Dropping music for licensing issues is one thing, but messing with metadata is beyond frustrating.For arbitrary reasons, Apple Music will: remove songs from albums and re-add them to your library as the &#34;single&#34; or &#34;deluxe&#34; versions; split albums and intersperse tracks between both; and duplicate songs in albums.The albums usually still exist in Apple Music—I just have to go out of my way to remove the mangled music and re-add the album. Problem is, there is no warning or notification it happened.Examples:[1] https://pasteboard.co/K2kdUN3.png
This album is totally messed up. Multiple track 3 with different titles, one unavailable, missing tracks that were re-added to my library as singles.[2] https://pasteboard.co/K2keFBV.png
One song pulled out into a greatest hits compilation and duplicated[3] https://pasteboard.co/K2kfc0b.png
All tracks, except 1, removed. The album still exists in Apple Music.[4] https://pasteboard.co/K2kfBTR.png
Originally added the original version of Camp by Childish Gambino to my library—here it&#39;s split between deluxe and basic, with tracks arbitrarily mixed between both.[...and many more]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is included/no additional cost which is fantastic.I do wonder if in the longer term if Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio with &#34;dynamic head tracking&#34; isn&#39;t the next 3D TVs/3D Content i.e. a gimmick.Taking traditional multi-source audio (Dolby/Atmos/etc) and jamming it into stereo is old tech, it doesn&#39;t work particularly well but is cheap to make/consume, thus mostly harmless. The new Spatial Audio is using gyroscopes to measure head movements in order to adjust the audio accordingly, and new audio formats to make it work.This may sound interesting if you haven&#39;t tried it, but it results in: Either you keep your head stationary and get the non-Spatial Audio sound (i.e. what they optimized for 90%+ of their audience) or whipping your head around to &#34;enjoy&#34; the effect (which is largely a movement accurate degradation).It feels like cart-before-the-horse tech wherein they figured out they can do this thing, and now want to work backwards into what it may be useful for."</p>

I remove en-US in my OS and broswers, and replace it with en-CA, as well as the other languages I speak. A lot of websites and software will see en-US and assume it&#39;s &#34;just a default&#34; and then try to serve content in a language determined by your IP or geographical region.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While establishing  a &#34;cause &amp; effect&#34; here seems very hard, from my personal experience working in software field in Japan, I think the winning concept here is actually the combination of removing middleman and paying good salaries.Japan is very very behind in IT/digitalization compared to most western countries. This doesn&#39;t just mean it&#39;s behind in product portfolio and quality, but that perception of software engineer &amp; managers and still quite behind. The respect that a lot of software engineers enjoys in US/EU is not quite there yet in Japan(and salary often reflect this).The C-suite usually doesn&#39;t have a firm understanding of software/IT world, and instead ends-up hiring a lot of &#34;Scrum-experts/Agile coaches&#34; and hires software engineers from consultancy or recruitment companies for cheap.  There&#39;s ofc companies that doesn&#39;t fall in this category, but for middle-sized companies in Japan (which is the bulk of the economy), this is the true state of things. Middle-men in Japan have therefore been way more encroaching on this, and they have the incentive to not improve the respect/social standing the software engineers have.&#34;Removing managers&#34; in this article does not mean the same thing as it would in US/EU, conditions are different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Tange, 46, says his business model is an attempt to remove inefficiencies in Japan’s software industry, where layers of subcontractors take cuts on orders before passing the work to another company below.This reminds me of a role I once had back in the late nighties.I was hired on contract by a multi-national consultancy firm to help out on one of their projects. The need someone to come in with good C programming skills.When I started I was amazed to find a 70 developers and testers workforce working on the project, most of whom were straight out of university.A nice earner for the consultancy firm; they were charging their development team out at $150.00 per hour, yet only paying graduate salaries.It must have been $100+ profit per hour per developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with some of the other comments here, that while this is a very impressive hack (and this is Hacker News!) the real world value seems dubious.It looks like a very clever way of packaging an x86 fat binary for multiple platforms, without actually duplicating the code. To support ARM I assume it’ll need to be an actual fat binary, with both x86 and ARM code. At that point, unless I actually test the code myself on both architectures, how can I be confident it’s going to work properly?If you’re using very simple C constructs and not doing anything fancy, it should work, but it’s not clear to me that this approach is preferable to e.g. a Python script. If you’re doing fancy stuff, it’s a bit more chancy as C isn’t memory-safe and has tons of undefined behavior and platform-specified weirdness.Java is “run anywhere” because they’ve specified the JVM in massive detail and tried to ensure it actually works the same on all platforms. I don’t see how you can have that same confidence if you’re running machine code everywhere.I guess I just don’t see the use case where this is compelling. If I write a handy Unix utility in C, I’ll just keep the source code around, and compile it as needed.It might be handy if you need to move such a utility quickly from Unix to Windows, if you don’t have any dev tools set up. But I can’t think of a situation when I’ve needed that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a bit worried about this:&gt; Please note that your APE binary will assimilate itself as a conventional resident of your platform after the first run, so it can be fast and efficient for subsequent executions.I understand there may be no real way out, but this defeats part of the promise/purpose of PAE: assume I use a pae binary, know it&#39;s pae, and implicitly share it or copy it to a different machine. But once I have copied it from ~/bin/ it&#39;s not pae any more, it&#39;s optimized for my OS/arch!Assuming the first-run optimization step is necessary, would it make sense to provide `--deoptimize` or `--paeize` flag to the same binary, so it&#39;s easy to return to the original, without recompiling it from source? Does it lose information when it optimizes? Can that information be tucked away (with an optional flag or env variable) for this step?What happens if the binary is read-only?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super exciting to see Cosmopolitan progress further! For those wondering what it is, from the website[0]:&gt; Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to Java, except it doesn&#39;t require interpreters or virtual machines be installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn&#39;t invent a new language and you won&#39;t need to configure a CI system to build separate binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much broader audience.[0] https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It does not just feel faster, in many cases it is faster.E.g. compiling Rust code is so much faster that it is not even funny. cargo install -f ripgrep takes 22 seconds on a Mac Book Air with M1, same on a hexacore 2020 Dell XPS 17 with 64GB RAM takes 34 seconds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, they don&#39;t just &#34;feel&#34; faster. They also complete lots of real-world tasks in shorter times, often significantly shorter than the last Intel Macbook Pro."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like the consensus here is that the M1 feels faster, and is actually faster, for a lot of tasks. So, for a lot of engineers, the M1 is the better choice over Intels. (Faster compile times are a good thing for devs, among other things)In that regard, the moment feels similar to the mid 2000s, when you suddenly saw a huge uptick in Macbooks at technical conferences: software developers seemed to gravitate in droves to the Mac platform (over windows or linux). Over the last 5+ years, that&#39;s cooled a bit. But I wonder if the M1 will solidify or grow Apple&#39;s (perceived) dominance among developers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What i find weird is the extreme and very unscientific agression among certain virologist:
&#34;If you think SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in a lab, please unfollow me.  &#34;
https://twitter.com/macroliter/status/1390720308265508871Then you have other academics in the comments saying nothing is certain yet, and other prominents labs like Gupta Labs at Cambridge and Bloom Lab from Seattle saying there could be multiple explanations.I know the issue is politicised and that&#39;s wrong as Ecohealth alliance from the US sponsored this research so there is no &#34;single country at fault&#34; - no need to avoid topics.It&#39;s not &#34;chinas fault&#34; it&#39;s more like, what on earth was the US based Ecohealth alliance doing with this research, why so many previous lab leaks with little attention, what is the history if the Wuhan lab, whats the actual facts about Gain of Function research etc. All topics that the press is not looking into for some reason.On Ecohealth alliance:“ It later turned out that the Lancet letter had been organized and drafted by Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance of New York. Daszak’s organization funded coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If the SARS2 virus had indeed escaped from research he funded, Daszak would be potentially culpable. This acute conflict of interest was not declared to the Lancet’s readers. To the contrary, the letter concluded, “We declare no competing interests.””https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27071432"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not surprising at all considering Wuhan Lab scientists admitted on video they were bitten by bats and they had lax to no safety standards. https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4102619&gt; A video released two years before the start of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic shows Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) scientists being cavalier toward protective equipment and being bitten by bats that carry deadly viruses such as SARS, demonstrating a lax safety culture in the lab.&gt; On Dec. 29, 2017, Chinese state-run TV released a video designed to showcase Shi Zhengli, (石正麗), also known as &#34;Bat Woman,&#34; and her team of scientists at the WIV in their quest to find the origin of SARS. Despite the fact that the scientists work in a biosafety level 4 lab, they show a shocking disregard for safety when handling potentially infectious bats both in the wild and in the lab.&gt; From 4:45 to 4:56, a scientist can be seen holding a bat with his bare hands. Team members from 7:44 to 7:50 can be seen collecting potentially highly infectious bat feces while wearing short sleeves and shorts and with no noticeable personal protective equipment (PPE) other than gloves.&gt; Virus researcher Cui Jie (崔杰) relates his experiences of being bitten from 8:47 to 8:50. He said that the bat&#39;s fangs went right through his glove, which was likely nitrile. He described the feeling as &#34;like being jabbed with a needle.&#34; The video then cuts to a person&#39;s limb showing swelling after a bat bite.That provides a plausible origin scenario of the pandemic: In October 2019, a researcher at the Wuhan Lab was bitten by a bat, got infected (asymptomatically), went home and unknowingly infected other people in the community, and the virus spread from there.Sadly, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever know what happened. Those who were directly involved with the early stage of the outbreak will never speak up, because Beijing issued a complete gag order on what happened. Anyone that speaks about the early stages of the pandemic be charged with espionage, and if found guilty, they can receive the death penalty. https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/11/9833532bb925-chin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The trouble here is that a lot of institutions and public persons have more or less staked their credibility on dismissing the lab origin hypothesis. They had their reasons - if anything, over the last years their standing and the value of expert opinion was under constant pressure (notice I&#39;m talking about a reason, not a justification).But this makes any admission of an error and, by extension, any useful reflection on it very, very improbable. I think if the lab origin is true and at some point becomes common knowledge, it will be treated like the Iraq war. The people responsible for botching the response and the message will fail up and treat the pandemic as if it were a tsunami, rather then human error."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually like using systemd. I took the time to learn how to use it, and as a desktop Linux user, it&#39;s honestly quite nice.But the one thing that still really pisses me off about systemd-the-project was the fact that they ate udev-the-project. In my view, that decision was unnecessary and was done for purely anti-competitive reasons.If you&#39;re not familiar, udev is basically the user-facing device manager for Linux. It&#39;s what allows you to easily configure rules and permissions for all the USB devices that you plug into your computer. These devices still need kernel drivers, but udev is how you tell your system &#34;Please let user ohazi use this device, and also give it a convenient name like /dev/someDevice0&#34;By devouring the udev project, the systemd maintainers have guaranteed that dealing with USB devices on non-systemd systems was going to be a giant pain.Then came the forks -- Gentoo maintains eudev, which is a systemd-free fork of udev. But really, this shouldn&#39;t be a fork. Udev should be independent and available on all systems. If systemd wants to do something special with devices, they should use udev APIs like everybody else. In my view, this is what finally allowed systemd to win the init war, despite all the protest. Ideological arguments about how best to start daemons is one thing, but you simply can&#39;t use a modern system without a sane approach to USB.Edit: It seems that some of my concerns were overblown, e.g. you apparently can run udev without systemd as pid 1. Udev has a build-time dependency on systemd, but not a run-time dependency. The eudev fork removes that build-time dependency, and (maybe?) also papers over some other inconsistencies. I&#39;m pleased that this is the case. I&#39;m annoyed that the discourse around systemd/udev has been muddy enough to lead me to incorrect conclusions (and I&#39;m aware that the original version of this comment likely added fuel to this particular fire). Oh well... live and learn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a system where systemd decides, about half the times I boot it, to immediately unmount all of the filesystems listed in fstab literally right after having finished mounted them as part of the regular boot process. All of this with other daemons starting in parallel.It will fail to unmount most of the filesystems, since they are of course busy, but often it will succeed in unmounting /var, /tmp, /home and others. Then it will continue starting on further services as if nothing happened and even proceed to gdm. But of course without /home I can&#39;t even login.No idea how to even start debugging it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t agree with her sentiment that alpine should adopt something similar. The whole reason I use alpine is because it doesn&#39;t use systemd.I like alpine because it uses a simpler, lighter approach. It&#39;s not for everyone, and I&#39;m pretty sure alpine maintainers don&#39;t intend it to be for everyone. It serves its niche really well as it is. For those who like systemd there&#39;s many distro choices already.Edit: As detaro mentioned in another comment ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27176391 ) they are actually working on something, but they aim to solve the various issues around alpine that don&#39;t fit well with alpine&#39;s philosophy. It sounds like a good story and I&#39;m open to this idea. The main reasons I don&#39;t like systemd are its complexity and its dbus reliance, basically bringing too many desktop paradigms into all Linux systems, even servers and containers.So about my above point: I&#39;m open to it adopting a service manager but not too similar to systemd :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a Bitcoin miner (https://toom.im), while I appreciate the work put into it, this particular metric of &#34;transactions per kW&#34; might not work the way you expect.The main point that you should understand is that a PoW blockchain&#39;s energy usage is not proportional to its transactions.I&#39;ll say that a different way: the transactions themselves do not use any energy in mining.I&#39;ll say this in a third way: it takes exactly the same amount of energy to mine an empty block as it does a 1GB block of transactions, as it does a 1,000,000,000 PB block.In reality, transactions are all hashed together in a mining pool into a single numeric hash before miners ever see them.  It doesn&#39;t matter how many transactions are included in the hash.  The hashpower just has to find a magic number matching that hash.On the other hand, the #1 factor that increases a blockchain&#39;s energy usage is its price per coin.  The price of a coin is how much that coin is worth to be mined, which is the incentive for miners to dump energy into mining it.  In steady state, miners will dump energy into mining a coin until the cost of energy = the value of the coins coming out.This is why you can see Bitcoin SV at the top of the list -- it&#39;s worth the least of the Bitcoins.And it&#39;s also misleading to compute the second factor -- transactions per second -- by counting the actual transactions on the blockchain, rather than looking at the transaction capacity.  Because blockchains only cost something per transaction once they reach capacity.  This is misleading with Bitcoin SV, for instance, because that coin artificially creates bogus transactions on its blockchain in order to make it look popular and demonstrate the vision of large blockchains.  Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, can handle a thousands of transactions per second (on testnet) but doesn&#39;t clog its live blockchain with them.So, in sum, if you send a transaction on Bitcoin Cash, it will cost 0 kW of electricity, even though it says 31.3 Txs/MWh (which equates to 31.9kW/Tx) in this chart.  This is because transactions do not cost anything in electricity.  Electricity only goes to preventing double-spends.  A better metric would be &#34;energy use per double-spend that was prevented.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t this basically 1 / popularity? I&#39;m presuming other coins have the Bitcoin feature of getting harder as more powerful miners appear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting but I’m not sure of the point. PoW by design is not energy efficient. The incentive is just not in the correct place. Interesting but if the goal is to show more energy efficient coins we need to be looking at different tech such as PoS. Although this might have just been a fun project someone put together in which case nice job."</p>

Every time, I get impressed by power and simplicity of the web technologies in general. In JavaScript those are things mentioned in the article + WebComponents. For CSS those are flexboxes, grids, and animations. In my opinion, React made a revolution with hooks and contexts.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"JavaScript is a great browser scripting language because it&#39;s the only browser scripting language.  That&#39;s a whole realm of good times, and people can and should go nuts with it there.The problem started a decade or so ago with Node.  Too many people only learn JavaScript, become psychologically dependent on it, and they all collectively took it too far outside of a browser.ECMAScript is a general purpose standard, but it was invented retroactively.  Node is not ECMAScript in a server-side ECMAScript engine, it&#39;s JavaScript in a browser JavaScript engine.  That&#39;s just too much of a force fit, and has wasted too much potential for me to say anything positive about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At this one industrial customer I visit every week for a full day, my Verizon cell phone date/time time will suddenly change back by 19 years, six months, and some days (I don&#39;t have the exact value).  This has been going on for almost a year. My pet theory was that law enforcement turned on a stingray nearby back in 2020, it came up with a default date of 1/1/2001, and has been running ever since.  Steel building with warehouse plus office space. No one in the building is running one of those cell phone boosters that plug into customer internet and act as a mini tower. My newish pixel 4 and my previous Moto phone both demonstrate the problem.  I don&#39;t have the fortitude to call Verizon and work through support to get to someone who would understand the problem.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Any other theories on what it is?  (My workaround is to turn off updating date and time from the network)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"    ”There are no open source LTE stack to learn from”

That is not true, srsRAN is a opensource LTE project.
That has both cell phone and tower versions. Runs on SDR boards like the limeSDR."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, this same mechanism can be used as a fallback for GPS to determine device location.I have worked on an IoT device with builtin SIM in the personal alarm space. Often when a device is indoors no GPS fix can be found, but the GSM module can report all celltower ids in range with signal strengths. These can be used to triangulate the device location. Google has an API for this where you can pass celtower ids and signal strengths.edit: and of course similar triangulation fallbacks/methods can be applied to WiFi AP&#39;s or Bluetooth Beacons, if you have a database with APs or beacons and their location. This database can be externally sourced but also built automatically by sending celltower ids/aps/beacons along with GPS fixes. I assume this is one of the many things Google is doing with their fleet of Streetview cars."</p>

That&#39;s how humanity has innovated throughout the ages: Copy what works and innovate on top of it.None of our inventions arise from a vacuum. Cars are still as wide as Roman chariots for good reason. Power transfer uses the same base principles as were in play during the dawn of steam engines and before. Energy conversion has been an iterative process for centuries, with the odd leap and bound.Industrial espionage exists because it works, and everyone does it because it&#39;s a cheap way to come up to speed with the leading edge of human knowledge rather than unnecessarily duplicating effort.Crying &#34;No fair!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First, this is an interesting take, and I think there is some kernels to consider in it. However, the author is painting very broadly with a large brush and smudging a lot. I have been happily using PyCharm/IntelliJ since what feels like the dawn of time. It is a perfectly complex and rewarding Fancy Tool. People still use IDEs for C/C++ this whole time, etc. I think the author is taking their personal journey and experience and extrapolating a bit too much about trends in the industry. I found myself nodding along at times and then saying &#34;What?&#34; the next sentence.My thoughts:* JIRA, still heavily used in many, many places. Not even close to being replaced in them.* Evernote vs. Markdown: I have been using org mode and or plain text notes for over 20 years. Markdown was a welcome addition to the arsenal, but I tried the Evernote/Microsoft Notes back in the day... just went back to plaintext for notes+todo, it has worked forever and is good enough. Org mode is a very nice and &#34;Fancy&#34; tool on its own. But also easy to get started with.Just some examples. I don&#39;t mean to be overly critical, it is an interesting and fun article about the tools we use as technologists, but it could do with a lot better grounding all around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the big number 1 that trumps all others when building a person website is: focus on writing content.This is by far the hardest part. All the other stuff: it&#39;s just tangential. Wordpress, Blogger, Jekyll, Hugo, Medium, hand-written HTML files: IMHO it doesn&#39;t really matter if you don&#39;t have any content. Just use whatever is easiest to get started with and gets out of your way when writing. For me, personally, it would be writing Markdown in Vim and converting that. For other people, it&#39;s something else.Later, when you actually have some content going you can start focusing on tooling, layout, and so forth. Converting things to another platform usually isn&#39;t too hard. But chances are, you will never actually get any content going. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people create personal websites, write one or two things on it, and then basically don&#39;t do anything with it.I&#39;ve built some websites for various friends/non-profits over the years, and about 90% of the time they never actually wrote any content. These days I ask people to write content first, and then I&#39;ll build the website for them. Most of the time I never hear about it again. That&#39;s okay, it&#39;s really hard to write content and a lot of people (myself included, before I had more experience with this sort of thing) tend to be way too optimistic about it and underestimate just how hard this can be.And people will read your website regardless if your content is good. Is Paul Graham&#39;s website the peak of web design? Not really. People still read it. Dan Luu&#39;s website? Pretty much the most basic HTML file you can get. Still widely read.That being said, if your goal is also to learn more if you&#39;re young or inexperienced: then sure, muck around with these tools all you want. I learned a lot from building my personal website over the years in all sorts of tools (geocities, hand-written HTML, shell scripts, PHP, Python, PHP again but this time with MongoDB, back to shell script, and finally settled Jekyll) and for much of this time I didn&#39;t have a lot of content. That was okay, because I learned a lot from the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a good example of how each person’s experience guides their sense of simplicity.This person felt like Wordpress was too complicated, despite it being a system you can use to set up a site with literally no coding at all (using Wordpress.com or one of the many hosting providers with one-click installs). You can live-swap themes to see which one you like, again with just some clicking.Meanwhile he is hand-editing .htaccess files to get the URL structure he wants and switching from JPG to WebP (a change with no real-world SEO value) to try to help SEO.This is not to condemn or criticize! It’s just that when people have experience with having their hands directly on software development, they may be more likely to prefer a web stack that mimics that feel. “Easier” for a coder is going to be different from “easier” for an artist with no coding experience. Look how many artists use Squarespace or Wix for example, which did not even make the list for this effort apparently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re building a personal website from scratch in 2021 (especially a blog), I strongly recommend Hugo (https://gohugo.io) over Jekyll. I had used Jekyll for a decade and very often hit random quirks that have been completely eliminated with modern Hugo. However, there&#39;s a bit of a migration process if you are moving from Jekyll to Hugo despite both being Markdown-based blogs.If you want a more advanced framework for a personal website, I recommend Wowchemy (https://wowchemy.com/) on top of Hugo, which gives the tools needed out-of-the-box like lazy loading/SEO/object-oriented collections, albeit with a massive learning curve."</p>

It&#39;s a beautiful piece of prose that really stuck with me, thanks for sharing this again.The first year of my PhD program is ending, and I feel like I&#39;ve been adrift the whole time: floating by without much direction, not doing much more than the bare minimum. I&#39;ve been needing to reevaluate my priorities and find what I should really be doing. I&#39;ve already decided I won&#39;t end up in academia, I couldn&#39;t win the endless pile of tasks. Not sure what I need to learn from this article but learning to make the most of the rest of your life is high on my list :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this piece is really about identity, and what happens when you establish and associate so deeply with an identity that when something challenges it (e.g. the passing of a job opportunity) it turns your world upside down. The author claims to have found peace in motherhood and that the job she was seeking wasn’t even that great, and perhaps the interviewers single minded, and maybe the entire process a little absurd.What I find interesting about this is that looking through the lens of ones ego, this seems like the logical way you would cope with losing a job - just convincing yourself it wasn’t ever really what you wanted"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Eh, I can’t be bothered to care. Cellebrite hoards 0-days so they can use them to hack phones. They know about exploitable vulnerabilities but aren’t saying anything about them because they profit from insecurity. Thing is, just because Cellebrite knows about a thing doesn’t mean, say, China’s CCP or the Russian mafia or anyone else doesn’t also know about that thing. You and I are less safe just because Cellebrite wants to profit off of those vulnerabilities.I just can’t work up the ability to sympathize with Cellebrite. The law may have something to say about Moxie’s writing, but in my opinion he has the clear ethical upper ground in this argument."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I disagree with this. Signal isn&#39;t hacking Cellebrite by creating a malformed file that causes Cellebrite&#39;s software to implode.I would be interested in seeing this go in front of a court because Signal isn&#39;t directly targeting any specific person, and the files are fine until they are processed through a specific broken pipeline.If I put a fake USB port on my phone that was a USB zapper to kill the device it&#39;s connected to, it would not be illegal and it would be on the people seizing my phone to take responsibility for it. You cannot repackage vulnerabilities for police and then turn around and play coy because you&#39;re not able to keep your software up to date.In the defense attorney section, the argument shouldn&#39;t be about the PoC but the fact that the PoC shows that Cellebrite&#39;s software is outdated and could be compromised. You can specifically ask for the backup that was extracted from the mobile device to be analyzed by third party software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wouldn&#39;t find a website where professional lawyers opine on startups and programming especially compelling.I don&#39;t find HN threads where tech folk opine on what their opinion of how the law should be interpreted to be especially compelling either.This is especially true here where I note that the author of the post folks are commenting on has an incredibly notable credentials and frankly it&#39;s somewhat ridiculous for lay-folk to be arguing with someone with such bone fides:Riana [Pfefferkorn] was the Associate Director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Prior to joining Stanford, Riana was an associate in the Internet Strategy &amp; Litigation group at the law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, where she worked on litigation and counseling matters involving online privacy, Internet intermediary liability, consumer protection, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets and was actively involved in the firm&#39;s pro bono program. Before that, Riana clerked for the Honorable Bruce J. McGiverin of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. She also interned during law school for the Honorable Stephen Reinhardt of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Riana earned her law degree from the University of Washington School of Law and her undergraduate degree from Whitman College.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was a mistake to attack the business side of the oil company, because it created what could be sold as reasonable doubt to shut down the pipeline.As a result, the ransom had the optics of an attack on infrastructure. As evidenced by the coverage of Americans desperately filling up containers.This created the impetus for the US to treat this as an incident far and above the ambient ransomware activities leading up to this.It also gave the US an opportunity to show how effective it could be when it had the political cover to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The REvil representative said its program was introducing new restrictions on the kinds of organizations that affiliates could hold for ransom, and that henceforth it would be forbidden to attack those in the “social sector” (defined as healthcare and educational institutions) and organizations in the “gov-sector” (state) of any country. Affiliates also will be required to get approval before infecting victims.Statements like this seem to point to ransomware activities being far more coordinated and &#34;business-like&#34; than they often get credit for.I do wonder if ransomware is (in a strange way) a(n illegal) free-market response to what is perceived to be an under-valuation of tech skills - aggrieved people who can carry out attacks and gain access to deploy ransomware are likely to be able to earn more through this route, even factoring in their &#34;risk of being caught&#34;.If a market correction occurs (ransomware becomes a real fear, organisations rapidly start to value security skills more and pay &#34;megabucks&#34; for the skills and hire them at-scale), the risk/reward of being caught starts to mean access brokers reduce in number, and the compensation reaches a free market equilibrium (accounting for the &#34;getting caught&#34; risk of criminal activity).A lot of the time I still see people trying to hire entry-level people into live/ operational security roles, without the experience they&#39;d need. I wonder if this is partly due to a desire to cut costs, rather than accept the need to pay rock-star compensation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “There’s too much publicity,” the XSS administrator explained. “Ransomware has gathered a critical mass of nonsense, bullshit, hype, and fuss around it. The word ‘ransomware’ has been put on a par with a number of unpleasant phenomena, such as geopolitical tensions, extortion, and government-backed hacks. This word has become dangerous and toxic.”I am... flabbergasted.  What?  Ransomware has always been a brand of extortion; it&#39;s right there in the name.  Extortion has become dangerous and toxic?  You have got to be kidding me.  I wonder what&#39;s next for these folks.  A life of simple, honest, pleasant and non-toxic crime?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations!I always have great respect for Scala because itself and the community tried to adopt and push the novel idea in the industry. Take a look at the changes, they&#39;re no joke to design and implement. At the same time, they&#39;re also trying to make the language consistent and simple. (Yes, I mean simple, not easy or single-paradigmed)They are taking the hard way, and not only there are not enough people to appreciate the effort, but also attract some hatred from time to time. I hope Scala 3 would bring us and itself a bright future, and inspire more languages to move forward.(For example, there are a lot of type features added to TypeScript in most releases because it needs to do the typing on existing dynamically typed languages, it may also be a hint that dependent type actually makes sense in mainstream languages)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so psyched about this. I&#39;ve followed the development of Scala 3 for pretty much the whole voyage, and I think they&#39;ve done an incredible job bringing the community along through some pretty radical changes to the language. It has definitely not been an easy process herding a community with very big, informed, divergent opinions on the language.In the end, I think they did an awesome job. Many, many sacred cows of old Scala were confronted. I think the result is a much more approachable language, where simple things are easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing!!! Great to see Scala improving at such a fast pace!I&#39;m especially excited about union/intersection types. I think we could all witness how well they work out in typescript and I believe that every language with the concept of subtyping should have this feature. It is one of the things that make working in a statically typed language feel much more dynamic/lightweight without giving up on safety guarantees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apart from the threading model, I love Zulip for its openness.
It&#39;s quite sad Slack and Discord are often the first choice for open communities. They are siloed and unless you are deliberately searching in a specific workspace, you&#39;ll never run into the information in a search engine.In comparison, Zulip:- provides HTML export functionality https://github.com/zulip/zulip-archive#zulip-html-archive (example https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive )- URLs are nice and encode meaning (e.g. https://memex.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/279601-hpi/topic/...)
  ... compare with Slack/Discord meaningless character sequences- I&#39;m excited about https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/4817 , which would allow viewing workspaces in &#39;guest&#39; mode, without registering at all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was skeptical about Zulip when I first tried it. What is it supposed to be? A chat? A forum? Why is the UI so ugly?But after using it a while I now really dislike Slack et al, both in professional teams and for open source communities.Zulip can give you the best of both worlds. It&#39;s a regular chat. But the threading model also encourages long-form, more forum or email like discussions.Threads are easily discoverable and it&#39;s trivial to catch up on all the relevant discussions that you missed, while skipping everything that doesn&#39;t concern you.You can still have some regular chat channels for typical ephemeral discussion that no-one is expected to read. It&#39;s really a great tool.The only downside is the very subpar UX when compared to Discord or even Slack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;threaded&#34; part is key here. Slack threads are useless compared to Zulip. In Zulip you can create threads on the fly from existing messages, so if discussion starts diverging you can turn it into a new thread. It&#39;s just a fundamentally superior model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fell prey to this. Might have been the exact same website, too. Had had a drink with dinner, thought heck why not file for my EIN for an independent consulting LLC I was creating? Was using a fresh OS install where I hadn&#39;t yet installed Firefox with an adblocker. Usual defenses were weakened. Boom, $250 down the drain before I really thought it all through. Fortunately I was able to get it refunded by initiating a chargeback and telling their website support that I believed they were misrepresenting themselves as the IRS. It really was a &#34;welcome to the real world&#34; moment, though - my very first act as a new business in the US was to get scammed. This theme has continued. 90% of the business mail I get are scams masquerading as official government mail to get business licenses or whatever. These websites are run by scumbags who should all be arrested. And Google, of course, should pay actual penalties because it&#39;s been all upside for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a hard time trying to understand why governments don’t address these scams more proactively.There is a related issue when you register a new company here in Germany: As soon as the new entity is added to the company house (called “Handelsregister”), you will start to receive fake invoices from scam companies.These invoice look very similar to official ones and some even use the official seal of the state (see https://www.firma.de/en/company-formation/beware-of-fake-han... for examples).If you don’t pay close attention you can easily mistake these invoice for official ones.This scam is quite well-known and has been going on for years. To further add to the insult - the companies that send these fake invoices are usually German entities as well, not some obscure shell companies in remote islands and yet besides warnings from the government it seems that little is happening.I find it infuriating and don’t understand why it is even allowed to send another party that you never had any relation with an invoice for a service that you actually haven’t performed yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I teach everyone in my family to never trust the first few sponsored results now matter how convincing they may be. As far as I’m concerned Google know exactly what they’re doing and are actively complicit in perpetuating online scams against one family and friends. Are we seriously supposed to believe a company of their size, with their talent pool, and their money, can’t filter out such blatantly obvious crap? Sure."</p>

I&#39;ll probably be more inconvenienced by the mitigations that will surely result that make it that much more painful to actually launch a URL scheme, sadly.I&#39;ve actually never checked the &#34;Always open Slack for slack:// links&#34; or similar checkboxes, precisely out of predicting shenanigans like this would happen eventually :)I wouldn&#39;t be too offended if browsers changed the way they handle schemes: always open a &#34;how would you like to handle  this link&#34; dialog for any protocol (even if unhandled - like how Windows shows the &#34;how would you like to open this file&#34; dialog), to disguise whether the protocol is handled or not.  Not sure I have the answer for user convenience though if someone is used to things automatically opening. That&#39;s the &#34;inconvenience&#34; aspect of any potential mitigation, we probably have to get rid of that &#34;remember this choice&#34; checkbox (well, my point is that &#34;have to&#34; is debatable here)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Syncthing. I have abysmally slow home internet, so any cloud storage service simply takes too long to sync, and trying to do the first sync of 150 GB takes many weeks. Besides, none of these services (dropbox, onedrive) support ignore files, so they&#39;re constantly syncing node_modules folders, etc.Instead, I have Syncthing set to sync a half-dozen folders (Pictures, desktop, documents, audiobooks, etc.) between my phone, laptop, and desktop over the local network. In total, I sync more than 150 GB of files and it works almost instantly and seamlessly. I use the SyncTrayzor GUI for Windows and the Syncthing app for Android. The Android app occasionally needs to be restarted manually, but that&#39;s the only problem I&#39;ve had with it.Importantly, I keep local copies of everything on all of my devices, including my phone (256 GB storage plus a microSD card slot which I have yet to need). Lack of support for Syncthing on iPhones is one major reason I stick with Android, even though there&#39;s a lot to like about the platform. Once it gets too big I&#39;ll move a bunch of old stuff to backup/archive drives, but I don&#39;t expect that to happen for a while.Now, I use Google Photos to selectively share photos with others, and that&#39;s it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The recently release 1.16.1 supports the first beta of untrusted nodes, aka nodes that will sync data but don&#39;t know what it is, as it is encrypted with a passphrase you set.so drop off an old machine at your parents / buddies / exs house, give it internet connection and cron some updates + reboots + power on after an outage and boom, if your house and all your devices burn down, you can get your files via decrypting with that password you saved to your email / password manager.I love Syncthing and it&#39;s replaced Dropbox and Microsoft 365 for me. ok i keep the latter for online dictation when I&#39;m not near a pc with dragon installed on it, but still, I don&#39;t need to trust MS with my data in their cloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unsurprising, but still disappointing. Actually I&#39;m glad someone is trying to hold them accountable. It seems silly tho that we need to pass a law to uphold what&#39;s already written into the constitution. It highlights that the constitution only has teeth in some legal contexts, primarily where a court case is being heard on a citizen being prosecuted. Conditionality seems to not have any bearing on preventing agencies from violating the constitution or stopping them when they&#39;re found out, nor punishing those responsible for the violation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I still can&#39;t fathom, all these years after Bush II and then Snowden, is just how little human beings really care about mass surveillance. Yeah, the Snowden leaks made a splash, but the media cycle turned over a couple weeks later and everyone moved onto other things.It&#39;s like, if you&#39;re of a certain age, you had to read 1984 or whatever in school. You&#39;d think &#34;well, no one would stand for that sort of thing in real life!&#34; Okay, so we don&#39;t live in that society, exactly, but time after time, we&#39;re shown the breadth of government surveillance and the reaction from the broader public isn&#39;t to call for anyone&#39;s head on a pike -- it&#39;s not even to vote anyone out!Outside of little communities like this one, people don&#39;t give much of a fuck. I guess that was Orwell&#39;s real point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like how this article buries the important parts of this story. There is good reason to think that this surveillance by public info is legal currently, there was a court ruling stating that&#39;s the case.A law is necessary to codify that this practice is a violation Fourth Amendment, and Wyden is currently one of a handful of senators trying to get it passed.The story eventually mentions this, but the beginning focus on confidentiality makes it seem like they&#39;re hiding evidence of their crime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Quick summary: the biggest electricity provider in the country (ENEL) made an app (Juicepass) to find and manage their charging stations across the country. The Android Auto functionality of the app has been rejected by Google for non disclosed &#34;security concerns while driving&#34;. The antitrust ruled out it was because Google wanted to sabotage competitor apps to the charging stations finder built-in in the Google Maps app. On top of the fine Google will need to provide the SDK to integrate their app with Android Auto."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way antitrust is working in recent years is kind of ridiculous. Google in Europe is becoming a rich case study in antitrust meh.You find that adwords engages in a blatant &#34;monopolistic abuse&#34; in some specific sense. In the Adwords EU case for example, Google was both monopsonising (google search) and monopolising search advertising. But, the actual violations are specific, like exclusivity requirements and other technical infractions buried in their take-it-or-leave-it contracts with &#34;partners.^&#34;Google get a fine. They deny culpability. They pay a fine and move on. Whether it&#39;s 100m or 2bn doesn&#39;t really matter. Google are demonstrably willing to pay far more (eg acquisition, browser kickbacks, etc.) to maintain a monopolistic position. Besides minor tweaks, there&#39;s no reason for them to change.What&#39;s the point? Antitrust can&#39;t be useful as a violation-fine paradigm. These cases/fines don&#39;t affect the monopoly or free the market in any useful sense.IMO, we need some way to declare a company &#34;Big&#34; and apply special rules to them. If those rules are onerous, that might create some organic pressure to split and/or help smaller incumbents  compete.There is no point to antitrust if its totally reactive, handing out fines for moving violations. The point of antitrust is trust-busting, to affect market structure. The point if to have a competitive market.All the 1990s stuff is playing out. Just like the MSFT case, we see that operating systems, browsers (now app stores) are monopoly prone and that it&#39;s a big deal. On the other side, the 90s &#34;portal&#34; concept is fully realized now. In the digital economy, controlling the windows of consumption is everything. None of the costs, all of the profit... literally all in a lot of cases.^Newspapers didn&#39;t have the advantage search partners had in their monopoly claim, because Google doesn&#39;t have agreements with them. No contract, no abusive clauses. The take it or leave it offer is &#34;give us your content for free, or go away.&#34; Formally, Google isn&#39;t even doing business with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good thing. My business unfortunately rely on the Playstore. Every update we submit I have nightmares about a rejected update or somekind of violation. I am active since the start of the store. On average once every 2 years we have a very serious issue with an app being suspended for a a reason we do not understand. I am lucky to have some ties to people inside Google, otherwise I would probably have lost (no joke) millions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big fan of notion. Not a fan of the data lock-in or haphazard security. For tools like this, SaaS will almost always beat open source just by virtue of elbow grease and a product direction. So I’m willing to forego the open source alternatives. But I really wish Notion gave me more options for how to host my data. AFAICT they offer no “dedicated storage” or “on premise” plan, even if you want to pay for it.In fact I heard a rumor that the entirety of Notion runs on a single unsharded database. If true, combined with the fact that this API took so long to ship, I have to assume that there is a crippling amount of tech debt in their stack. Hopefully it’s growing pains and they’re sorting it out, but it doesn’t make me feel confident about the security of my (most sensitive) data.It’s maybe also a cautionary tale about what happens when you dismiss too many early decisions as “premature optimization.” You ship fast in the beginning but a few years later you’re buried in all the debt you generated.Granted, it’s a good problem to have. If the choice is between a profitable, popular company buried in tech debt, or the perfect stack with no customers, I’ll take the debt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I initially signed up for Notion, I did so thinking the API was already usable. It was used as a selling point for their premium service even though it wasn&#39;t implemented. This was a year and a half ago or so.I felt pretty burned by it and killed my subscription. Hopefully this turns out well for the people who&#39;ve been waiting for it, but that experience left a terrible taste in my mouth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve recently started using Notion and I&#39;m surprised at few things that I find incredibly annoying with it so far. Since it seems there are some Notion staff here I&#39;ll take this as a change to give some feedback to hopefully improve the product.* No read-only mode. I like to have documents default to a read-only mode so I don&#39;t accidentally typo random characters, or delete something when try copying. etc.* No floating table of contents. There is a ToC block but it&#39;s at a fixed position, where it&#39;s not terribly usable especially for long documents having a giant ToC at the top isn&#39;t great. I&#39;ve tried using columns but it just squishes the rest of the document way too much* Floating heads. When you have multiple collaborators the avatars zooming up and down the left side of the document is incredibly distracting. I&#39;d love a way to disable this completely. I don&#39;t care where in a document other people are reading.* Database/Table horizontal scrollbar. Almost every database in our documents end up with this giant scrollbar that spans edge to edge, looking like a horizontal rule, breaking up the visual flow of the page significantly. I keep thinking it&#39;s some kind of page break.These are just some of my initial impressions. I do think it&#39;s a very visually nice product and has a lot of neat features but I&#39;m pretty surprised by some basic QoL stuff missing and hope to see it further refined."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My hot-take having watched the culling from an invested position follows. Disclaimer: i hold both BTC and ETH.While the market in general is down, the major losses in this crash were Bitcoin, Doge and Shiba. Bitcoin is an obvious result given the news. Doge and Shiba have had pretty spectacular gains over the last ~30d and seeing them lose considerable value is unsurprising if you follow crypto markets much. Seemingly new money has been racing in lately (see big rises in Eth Classic and Bitcoin Cash as well), i find these dips also unsurprising given past behavior.As a somewhat meta analysis, i feel BTC could have an interesting summer. BTC plateaued at $1.1T in market cap. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been on a steady rise from 250-500B+. Talk of &#34;the flippening&#34; has returned in a way i didn&#39;t anticipate, certainly not this early on.While this news impacted the whole market (the market still follows big BTC swings to some extent), i have found my personal sentiment shifting to be increasingly bearish on BTC and bullish on ETH."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, that&#39;s incredible.  Goes to show that people do walk away from plane crashes with some regularity.  My father was a pilot[0].He sold his plane about 15 years ago (to a group of owners, one of which was a priest, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a joke in there).  A few of winters later, he was called out to Romeo Airport; the pilot flying the plane that was formerly his had crashed the aircraft a few miles short of the runway in bad weather[1].  He was traveling with his daughter, a friend and, I think, his wife.  He died, but his daughter was able to get free and make her way to a nearby farm to call for help.  Looking at the plane, the fact that anyone survived at all let alone walked to a nearby house with minor injuries is pretty miraculous.It&#39;s hard to impress upon folks who have never been in a small plane like that just how ... yeah ... how much it feels like you&#39;re hanging onto a kite.  I have no idea the kinds of structural technologies are involved in the aircraft but I know his plane was made in the 70s and was light enough that he only had a pole which attached to the front landing gear to pull it out of the hangar.  The weight is so critical that the 7-seat plane can realistically only seat 4-5 adults.  I remember being shocked that they had to weigh the paint they applied when he had the plane re-painted.[0] I&#39;ll spare the details as I have left many comments in the past about his experiences.[1] https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/43894 - &#34;Pilot Error&#34;; I recall my Dad saying &#34;all plane crashes are pilot error&#34;[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-32_Cherokee_Six"</p>

When bitcoin continues to  steadily go down, it is a significant concern because Tesla will have to take losses on the cars it sells and will have reduced gross margins, which will result in their stock price tanking.Musk smartly decided he did not want to risk his half a trillion dollar company on random bitcoin fluctuations. It is probably the right decision (although certainly covered up with false reasoning) but he should have never reached this stage. Tesla should have never taken bitcoin without provisions for automatically converting it into one of the currencies it pays its costs in."</p>

Announce TSLA will accept BTC, with the knowledge that very few people will actually do that, and public support from a major company will drive up the price of BTC.3. Sell off your BTC at the higher price. A portion was sold in Q1 for a hefty profit already.4. Rinse and repeat with DOGE?The environmental impact was well known before they bought it, so it&#39;s a little odd that they&#39;d reverse course because of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fact this was paid off, and paid off so rapidly means that targeting major infrastructure for massive payoffs is going to become more and more prominent. The next time though, it&#39;ll be $50M. I work with people in the oil fields and I know the numbers they are playing with and the fact that a single well being down can easily be $100,000 lost per hour. So obviously they want these systems back up fast.$5M for shutting down that major of a pipeline seems like too little, unless, of course, they weren&#39;t expecting the company to even pay. Now that these actors know that the oil (and quite likely other utilities) are more than willing to pay big bucks to get back online, they will be targeted far more.There are so many reasons this is very very bad."</p>

Every year there is a section for infrastructure security (factories, refineries, etc). Its always the smallest section and the least populated. But its simultaneously the &#34;most important&#34; in terms of how much damage can be done from a single attack. Every year I went and was always terrified by all the stuff I saw because all the people hosting booths were like &#34;yeah its dead simple to get in and break things.&#34; I feel like so many people could see this coming and there are just no consequences for the companies to incentivize them to do better."</p>

Call me callous but numerous federal agencies exist to issue security best practices and exploit announcements.  numerous vendors also exist.  play stupid games, win stupid prizes.Not paying the ransom would have been tantamount to complete dissolution of the company.  it would have tirggered a much wider investigation into the company with shareholders abandoning it as the outage dragged on at the hands of an incompetent leadership.Unfortunately it seems to have been a Pyrrhic victory as paying the ransom puts their shareholders at risk of serious sanctions and indictment from the US Dept. of the Treasury.https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work on a B2B app with a lot of local govt users. We dropped support officially for IE11 last summer and I was surprised by the little to no pushback.Our stance was if you needed to use IE11 for a legacy application, that&#39;s fine -- but our application required something besides IE and you&#39;re not limited to only one browser on your computer.Any stances by IT that they haven&#39;t had a chance to authorize another browser or prove that another browser was secure compared to IE11 is an absolute joke at this point. Any IT department that is telling users to use IE11 for security reasons is questionable imho."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking as one of the original three authors of Google Docs (Writely), but zero involvement in this project (I left Google in 2010): I&#39;m seeing a lot of comments asking how JavaScript-on-Canvas could possibly outperform the highly optimized native code built into the browser engines. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve really been involved in browser coding, but having written both Writely and, farther back, several native-app word processing engines, here are some thoughts.Word processors have extremely specific requirements for layout, rendering, and incremental updates. I&#39;ll name just two examples. First, to highlight a text selection in mixed left-to-right / right-to-left text, it&#39;s necessary to obtain extremely specific information regarding text layout; information that the DOM may not be set up to provide. Second, to smoothly update as the user is typing text, it&#39;s often desirable to &#34;cheat&#34; the reflow process and focus on updating just the line of text containing the insertion point. (Obviously browser engines support text selections, but they probably don&#39;t expose the underlying primitives the way a word processor would need. Similarly, they support incremental layout + rendering, but probably not specifically optimized in the precise way a word processor would need.)Modern browser engines are amazing feats of engineering, but the feature set they provide, while enormous, is unlikely to exactly match the exacting requirements of a WYSIWYG word processor. As soon as your requirements differ even slightly from the feature set provided, you start tipping over into complex workarounds which impact performance and are hell on developer productivity and application stability / compatibility.This is loosely analogous to CISC vs. RISC: browsers are amazing &#34;CISCy&#34; engines but if your use case doesn&#39;t precisely fit the expectations of the instruction set designer then you&#39;re better off with something lower-level, like Canvas and WASM. (I don&#39;t know whether Docs uses WASM but it would seem like a good fit for this Canvas project.)Frameworks in general suffer from this problem. If you&#39;ve ever had to fight with an app framework, or orchestration framework, or whatever sort of framework to accomplish something 5% outside of what the framework is set up to support, then you understand the concept.Also, as noted in many comments here, browser engines have to solve a much more general problem than Docs, and thus have extra overhead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2009, I joined Mozilla and started working on the Bespin[1] project, which Ben Galbraith &amp; Dion Almaer had brought to Moz. Bespin was built with a canvas-based renderer. Bespin was way faster than other browser-based code editors at the time.Then the Ajax.org/Cloud9 folks came along with their Ace editor[2], which was DOM-based and still very fast. We ended up merging the projects. edit to add: and switching to DOM renderingRik Arends[3] was one of the Ajax.org folks and he&#39;s been working on a WebGL-based code environment called Makepad[4], which is entirely built in Rust and has its own UI toolkit. He&#39;s complained a lot about how difficult it is to make a performant JS-based editing environment.My point in all of this is just that there are absolutely tradeoffs in performance, accessibility, ease-of-development, internationalization, and likely other aspects. If raw performance is what you&#39;re going for, it&#39;s hard to beat just drawing on a canvas or using WebGL. Google Docs needs to worry about all of that other stuff, too, so I&#39;ll be interested to see how this shapes up.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Skywriter[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(editor)[3]: https://twitter.com/rikarends[4]: https://makepad.dev"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t build extensions or work on much front end web lately but this reads like Google wants more control over their stuff. The web is becoming less open.&gt; By moving away from HTML-based rendering to a canvas-based rendering, some Chrome extensions may not function as intended on docs.google.com and may need to be updated.&gt; If you are building your own integrations with Google Docs, we recommend using Google Workspace Add-ons framework, which uses the supported Workspace APIs and integration points. This will help ensure there will be less work in the future to support periodic UI implementation changes to Docs.This is basically putting an API on top of an API as far as I&#39;m concerned. The web renders markup and executes javascript to produce experience. Putting an API on top and using canvas to render your content creates a more closed system.For those more deep in web technology, I&#39;d like to know if there are reasons to move to canvas for strictly technical merits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very nice code quality.C gets a hard time and this code base highlights some of the modern features C is missing by its use of perfectly clear workarounds. E.g. The prefix “namespacing” done here works just fine, easy to understand. The go-style visibility approach is growing on me lately and it works well here.C does deserve some of the criticism right enough, e.g. the same macros re-defined in a few places - it’d be nice if c had a better way than its version of macros although its not actually a problem here because the macros aren’t really big enough to have subtle sharp edges.Ahh a beautifully written project, just shows that maybe C is entirely workable in the right hands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The number of comments here that are negative is just staggering to me.These images are within a hair&#39;s breadth of being indistinguishable from reality. It&#39;s an enormous leap. An enormous leap from the previous techniques and an enormous leap towards photorealistic realtime graphics.You don&#39;t want your games to look realistic? Go play pacman or outrun.You want to use path tracing instead? You have no idea how much cheaper this technique is. And on top of that the neural network is also fixing up the unrealistic texture work on all kinds of things in the scene.The first games to use this are going to be from small game studios with less investment in the status quo and they are going to blow the competition out of the water."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am especially impressed by how much more realistic the lighting ends up looking despite the network probably having less information to work with than the engine! Though it ends up turning the lighting very flat. I guess that is an effect of the source images they were using.As others have said, using this directly in the engine (tuned to work with the intended art style etc) could probably produce almost miraculous results, if it can be made to work at a reasonable frame rate.That would also allow the developers to use high-quality rendered images instead of these green-tinted, low-contrast &#34;automotive grade&#34; camera images as source of truth (there are good reasons these images look like that ... but they don&#39;t look pleasant)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Impressive, but I think that photorealism is not necessarily what you would want to strive for in games, as it is not true realism. It emulates the deficiencies of the camera that we perceive it as realistic, because we are trained on thousands of photo images and video footage. I prefer visionrealism instead of photorealism in my games and don&#39;t really find that lens effects like flares, chromatic aberration, and depth of field enhances the experience of realism. It feels like I&#39;m looking through a camera rather than being there myself. For me it breaks immersion instead of enhancing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As there&#39;s a limit of 16 AirTags per Apple ID, and each AirTag&#39;s keys rotate every 15 minutes, presumably Apple can detect if anyone is abusing the system by sending more than 16 different &#34;messages&#34; per 15 minutes. They can&#39;t detect this when the fake airtags are sending, but can detect it from stored message timestamps when you query.  If they start to see this being abused a lot, they can then block Apple IDs.  To avoid Apple being able to see this, you probably need to either use multiple Apple IDs, or send less than 16 bits per 15 minutes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when I first learned to touch-type as a child, and for many years after, I would sometimes &#39;type&#39; things out on my legs, tabletops, notebooks. At first it was to practice, but after I had mastered typing I kept doing it just because it was still novel to be able to type and feel like I knew how to use technology. Doing that made me realize that typing a character is a very specific and atomic action (compared to writing by hand), as well as an automatic one (once you learn how to touch-type). I wonder if the performance of this solution could be improved by training it to detect the mental impulses that occur when a trained typist imagines typing a character, rather than when the person imagines writing out a character."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even the free-form mode 75 character per minute sounds amazingly fast for a thought interface.I wonder what it&#39;s like to use. I know there have been many attempts at this, and they&#39;re steadily improving, but I watched a talk at EvoMusArt 2007 where researchers used a smaller array of cranial electrodes to have the user control a mouse. That it worked blew my mind. But they talked about how slow and noisy it was to get the cursor from one side to the other... maybe a minute IIRC. What I remember most distinctly was the researcher said it was physically draining to do, that after 5-7 minutes of this activity they would be sweating and exhausted, without moving."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The biggest technical hurdle is the inability to run external processes on iOS and iPadOS.&gt; Apps on iOS and iPadOS must use Apple’s Javascript interpreter, JavaScriptCore.Both of these really suck because they are policy, not technical, decisions. Even setting aside the arguments of whether JIT code is a security concern (it is not unless your security model is one where codesigning exists to prevent the addition of new native code) that you cannot spawn a new process, nor can you ship another JavaScript interpreter, is really unfortunate.Allowing apps to spawn new processes is easy (I mean, just inherit sandboxing rules and resource limits…) and allows for a lot of new usecases, like robust crash reporting, web servers, privilege separation, and more. That Apple allows this on macOS and even uses it for its own apps on iOS just shows how useful this can be and how little it affects the security model of iOS.Likewise, not allowing other JavaScript interpreters is just…annoying. Regardless of your opinions of JavaScriptCore, this is an unfair limitation on an already slanted playing field. Coupled with the fact that the JavaScriptCore interpreter (which the framework uses for anything you run in-process) is literally designed for low resource consumption instead of than performance makes this even more infuriating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a different view of this than most in this topic. I am disappointed, though not surprised, that Panic is abandoning yet another of their iOS apps. They’ve done it several times before and while I am grateful they’ve continued to provide some bug fixes, feature work stopped years ago.In my view, the biggest hurdle does not seem to have been technical, but ideological/business. These old school Mac developers like Panic and Omni have had a very difficult time adapting to (or failing to) the iOS/mobile era. 
I know we all hate subscriptions, but continued app development and management requires continued labor so subscriptions seem like the only business option that makes any sense to me. Panic and Omni want paid upgrades but Apple has never, ever even hinted at providing that as an option. The option is subscriptions. Even on desktop Sketch, Adobe, and Microsoft are going with subscriptions. (We’ll see how Affinity does. They charge a lot more for their apps and seem to be in a growth phase so I imagine their sales at the moment are fast enough to make up for the fact that each sale is only a one time source of revenue).Honestly, Panic and Omni and other old school Mac developers really, really need to adapt to the modern era. They’ve had years and it feels like the runway is about to end (see Omni’s recent layoffs.) Wishing for paid upgrades and writing “only AppKit apps are real Mac apps” blog posts isn’t going to change anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a real shame that the otherwise very capable iPad cannot sustain an enormous subcategory of professional grade software, solely because of Apple’s policies.People know this going in of course, but it doesn’t make it any less of a shame, especially now you can spec out an iPad Pro with the exact same specs as the laptop I use for work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tracking units is a thing that I rarely have a use for (as a non-engineer), but when I do, I’m totally mystified by how bad almost every language is at it. F# is the only actual programming language I found that even tries. It does a pretty decent job, but even it has some disappointing holes (e.g. not being able to understand g and kg as scaled versions of the same dimension).I guess the overlap between physicists/engineers and type system/PLT people isn’t large enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I see this sort of thing I always want to know something that is seldom made clear: what is actually implemented so far?.The video begins &#34;This is Atlas, a concept for a new engineering IDE&#34;. (To me, that strongly suggests that rather little is actually implemented yet, and that what we&#39;re about to see is a lot of canned demos, because otherwise it would be a new engineering IDE, not just a &#34;concept&#34; for one.) But then most of what follows, and pretty much everything on the webpage, says that Atlas does this or that, not &#34;will do&#34;.And the trouble with &#34;concepts&#34; is that unlike actual implementations they aren&#39;t much of a guide to what you&#39;re ever actually going to get. It&#39;s easy to think &#34;X would be cool&#34; and say &#34;Atlas does X&#34;, but some Xs are much more realistically implementable than others, and how interesting Atlas actually is depends on which of those Xs are ever actually going to be implemented.But reading the page and watching the video I have literally no idea where the project is on a scale from &#34;we wrote down some things it would be cool to do and rigged up a demo that pretends to do them&#34; to &#34;everything here is already implemented, though there are a few gaps and bugs here and there&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; we settled on $11,000 per month as a baseline salary for working full-time on open source.&gt; For now, Nicolò, Henry, and Jùnliàng will all be paid a temporary rate of $6,000 per month. This doesn&#39;t solve the problem,I used to donate to Babel, before they made it apparent they are just interested in funneling the money to one developer. 11K per month?! That is absolutely bananas and same reaction I had the last time this came up, but this time I cannot do anything as a reaction as I&#39;ve already pulled my funding.But my guess is that a lot of people feel the same way, as the donations seems to be going down. 11K per month could pay for many developers if you hire people outside of Sillicon Valley, which since you&#39;re doing open source, you should really really consider.Open source is not &#34;VC fueled develoment&#34; and I don&#39;t think we should go that way either. Make your operation nimble and survive on little, otherwise you&#39;ll soon disappear. Optimize for sustainability, not for paying the one of the highest salary in the world (minus SV bubble of course).It&#39;s not wonder Babel is going the way it&#39;s going, as the economy you&#39;ve setup for yourself is nowhere near sustainable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This whole thread is basically a testament as to why the OSS model, unfortunately, is broken. Very competent people are expected to write widely used software for a salary that basically merely guarantees subsistence. It never ceases to amaze me how great software engineers allow themselves to be exploited in such a way. If you consider the societal impact that some of these projects have and the skill set that some of their maintainers have, which pretty much dwarfs the skill sets of people in other well paid professions such as lawyers or doctors, it&#39;s frankly ridiculous that they are expected to work for significantly less money. Not to mention that the abstractions some of these people wrote basically allow a significant number of people to enter the industry in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for a startup that benefits from open source.I can and do make the case for spending a lot of money on SaaS products and hiring people. But there is no way in the world I can stand in front of company leadership and ask for money to spend on something that I already get for free. I&#39;d look out of touch with the realities of running a business and the request would be roundly shouted down.If there&#39;s some value I can get then it&#39;s a much easier sell. For example, if there is a Babel job board then I can choose to use that over alternatives when I next hire. Jed Watson proposed https://budgetforopensource.org/, which puts this type of thing in the employee perk category so that I can justify it using hiring as a goal. These are things where I can make a business case for spending real dollars, rather than a philosophical argument."</p>

After Apples recent move in the same direction with their „find my“ mesh network of apple devices being used to introduce a whole new mode of operation to support their Air Tags the Question of Net Neutrality has to be extended from just ISPs to Dominant Platforms that have the ability to create derivative Mesh-Networks."</p>

This set of vulnerabilities requires a potential attacker to be physically within range of the Wi-Fi network (or user device) in order to exploit it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dr. Martin Loetzsch did a great video, ETL Patterns with Postgres. He covers some really good topics:- Instead of updating tables build their replacements under a different name then rename them. This makes updating heavy-to-compute table instant. Works even for schemas: rebuild a schema  as schemaname_next rename the current to schemaname_old then rename schemaname_next to schemaname.- Keep all the source data raw and disable WAL, you don&#39;t need it for ETL.- Set memory limitis high.And lots of other good tips for doing ETL/DW in postgres. It&#39;s here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwNi21jAm4I really appreciate having data in postgres. It&#39;s often easy to think that a specialised DW tool will solve all your problems, but that often fails to consider things like:- Developer experience. Postgres runs very easily on a local machine, more specialized solutions often don&#39;t or are tricky to setup.- Learning another tool costs time. A developer can learn postgres really well in the time it takes them to figure out how to use several more specialised tools. And many devs already know postgres because it&#39;s pretty much the default  DB nowadays.- Analytics queries often don&#39;t need to run at warp speed. Bigquery might give you the answer in a second but if postgres does it in a minute and it&#39;s a weekly report, who cares?- Postgres is boring and has been around for many years now, it will probably still be here in 10 years so time spent learning it is time well spent. More niche systems will probably be superseded by fancier, faster replacements.I would go so far as to say don&#39;t necessarily need to split out your DW from your prod DB in every case. As soon as you start splitting out a DW to a separate server you need some way to keep it in sync, so you&#39;ll probably end up duplicating some business logic for a report, maintaining some ingestion app, shuffling data around S3 or whatever. Keeping your analytics in your prod DB (or just a snapshot of yesterdays DB) is often good enough and means you will be more likely to avoid gnarly business-rules going out of sync between your app and your DW."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A new Postgres-based darling is TimescaleDB.  It’s a drop-in for Postgres.It is a hybrid row column store with excellent compression and performance.It would be interesting to see how it compares if narrator would try it out.  Benchmarks would be cool.One very neat feature I am enamored  by is “continuous aggregates”.  These are materialized views that auto-update as you change the fact table.Continuous aggregates are a great idea.  InfluxDB had “continuous queries” (but the implementation of influx generally is not so neat), and firebolt has “aggregate indexes” which are much the same thing.I think all olap dbs will eventually have them as staple, and that they will trickle down into oltp too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Avoid Common Table Expressions (or upgrade to 12)Upgrading to 12 (or 13) seems like the better option here, whenever you&#39;re able to do so. The improvements are very much worth it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The real reason they don&#39;t want their thermometers sold on amazon is because they are merely official US distributors of the Thermapen which is made by a British company, ETI.https://thermometer.co.uk/99-thermapen-thermometersYou can buy them from European distributors in bulk for less than MSRP and sell them for the same price as thermoworks on amazon and still make a profit. The only reason they were going for $179 previously is because thermoworks was buying the thermometers from sellers and reporting them as counterfeit. Thus making it difficult for sellers to sell them which keeps supply low.They have fraudulently filed copyright removals and counterfeit accusations on amazon multiple times for Thermapen listings that don&#39;t use the &#34;thermoworks&#34; name.You can see that thermoworks does not own the Thermapen trademark.https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4803:hv...Edit: apparently, you can&#39;t link to a trademark search directly, so you would need to go to the basic search and enter&#34;Thermapen&#34;.https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&amp;p_lang=engli..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We DO have carefully selected, authorized resellers.USA is a free market.  Everyone is authorized all the time to sell every safe product.  The term &#34;authorized reseller&#34; is a linguistic manipulation which benefits manufacturers at the expense of everyone else in society.&gt; We cannot vouch for the quality of products sold by unauthorized resellers, therefore, we cannot provide warranty or technical support on any products sold by unauthorized resellers.This is not true in California.  Manufacturers must honor the warranty on all products they originally sold in USA, no matter who later re-sold it.  And for products they sold for &gt;$99, they must provide technical documentation for 7 years.  I wrote about this in [0].[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24426635"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The aspect I find most interesting and internationally relevant is that as these local rulings proliferate, they kinda make it visible to what degree companies finance their operations by selling user data.  The more the business model relies on this, the more likely companies are to get hit with a ruling like this — and it&#39;s not just the ruling that&#39;s interesting, but also what Facebook&#39;s reaction will be.  If they stop offering or reduce WhatsApp services in Germany (or India), that&#39;s a great indicator that the service isn&#39;t profitable without the sale (or other commercial exploitation, Facebook is an ad company after all) of large amounts of user data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another Source - https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/facebook-...&gt; Johannes Caspar, who heads Hamburg’s privacy authority, issued a three-month emergency ban, prohibiting Facebook from continuing with the data collection. He also asked a panel of European Union data regulators to take action and issue a ruling across the 27-nation bloc. The new WhatsApp terms enabling the data scoop are invalid because they are intransparent, inconsistent and overly broad, he said."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is pretty vague. What does it even mean to ban Facebook &#34;from using data from WhatsApp users&#34;?Facebook &#34;uses data from WhatsApp users&#34; to support basic features like authentication, is that banned now? What about sending a WhatsApp message to a contact, doesn&#39;t that &#34;use data from WhatsApp users&#34;? Facebook has to look up some internal user ID (user data), then route the message to their devices, probably by device ID (also user data). How do you do that if using data banned?I suspect there&#39;s more to it but this particular article isn&#39;t telling the story in a particularly clear or helpful manner. Hopefully the actual injunction is not as vague."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the US tax payer gets a significant stake in the chip fab venture, I would be OK with this. We want to secure national security via chip manufacturing and you want billions of dollars? Give us some upside.I don&#39;t want to hear it creates jobs, it generates blah blah blah, a real equity stake and possibly repayment of the capital. Creating jobs should be a happy by-product of subsidizing an industry that is probably more well capitalized than any other in existence.According to (https://startupanz.com/5-tech-giants-hold-588b-cash-reserves...) Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft had 526 billion dollars between the four of them in cash reserves. They have over half a TRILLION dollars in cash. If this were life or death, they could afford anything.But the calculus is offload risk onto the tax payer (despite being a shareholder directly in all those companies or indirectly via mutual funds/etfs), I don&#39;t want to be left holding the bag with no upside beyond the general sentiment of &#39;national security was secured&#39; while private companies reap all the benefits."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These industries squeezed the blood out of US suppliers to compete on cost. I don&#39;t think a correct solution is the government building capacity and supply chains.IMHO a more sustainable strategy is the government taxing the environmental and human rights externalities of off-shore production."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to consider is royalty rate. If you sell 5000 copies for $20 and earn a dollar per copy, you&#39;ve earned $5,000. (This math is based on 10% royalties on the publisher&#39;s portion, which is about half of retail. And no, fiction books don&#39;t sell for $20 typically, but I&#39;m using this number to make the math easy.)Now, if you sell 5000 copies of an ebook for $20 and earn 80% royalties, you earn $16 per copy, and earn $80,000. This is the royalty rate on Leanpub (disclosure: cofounder), but with Gumroad or blog + Stripe approaches you&#39;d earn an even better percentage (if you want to run your own store).For fiction, however, the dream combination is probably publishing in-progress with subscriptions. Currently it seems that Substack is the best for that. If you can get a few thousand people to subscribe for a few bucks a month, you could do well. The people at the top are doing really, really well: https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be interesting to have a timeseries plot of this sort of information. Did it used to be easier to make a living as an author? Presumably there was some point at which the ease of making a living as an author peaked. This article suggests that time is in the past, but how far in the past? Has the absolute number of people who can make it as an author decreased, or just the relative fraction of the human population? So many questions.I do also think that the expectation/standard of a $100k/year salary is a bit high. That&#39;s almost double the US median household income, for a job that can be done (some would argue is best done) from a house in the woods. I also know that some authors are turning to Patreon. N.K. Jemisen famously started a Patreon that allowed her to quit her job and begin writing full-time. I personally have donated &gt;$100 directly to favorite midlist authors who have made a big impact on my reading life.FWIW, I used to read more, but I still buy at least three or four full-priced books a year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From what I read in the proposal the core idea of it is solid. DNS is a vital piece of infrastructure, and we should take steps to ensure it keeps working. Putting together task forces to make sure it is secure therefore sounds like a very good idea.Root servers might be out of scope to some degree for this however. Interestingly enough the root servers also aren&#39;t mentioned in the proposal itself, nor in the annex listing essential services. They&#39;re only mentioned in the lead up, which is the argument for why it&#39;s needed. It somewhat feels like they left it in accidentally, especially with the parliament immediately amending to scrap it from the lead up as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In addition, by downloading this file, every Internet service provider can run their own root server.&#34;Any end user can do that as well.The truth is, root servers are not nearly as &#34;essential&#34; as the major TLD servers, like .com, .net and .orgWhat is essential is the ability to download the root.zone file.  At least if one wants to track any changes (seldom seen).I always have a copy of the current root.zone file.  If the public root servers all ceased operation I would not see any noticeable effects.However if the .com servers went down, I would have to use a local copy of the com.zone which is a much larger file to download (via FTP, HN&#39;s favourite protocol to make fun of).An easier alternative is to keep a custom zone file with all the domains that I use regularly.  Does any single end user really need access to the entire www. How much of the www does anyone think they have really seen.For example, I have zone files with every domain that is posted to HN, so I never have to worry about being able to read what gets posted here. I can read fast without making any remote DNS lookups."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I left the game industry for FAANG and I&#39;m getting paid 2-3x more. I&#39;m happy with this situation if I consider the big picture but, at least in my case, my game job was much, MUCH better than FAANG. No matter how many fancy drinks and energy bars FAANG gives me, if the pay in the game industry was higher I&#39;d have stayed without a doubt.What this means is that FAANG is actually paying what it needs to pay to get employees, otherwise many people would simply work elsewhere.There is a myth that working at FAANG is amazing for everybody, but most people I know there are actually kind of miserable and doing fairly dull work for which they are massively overqualified. Nonetheless, these companies have money and they want the &#34;best&#34; (in their eyes) people for everything, so they pay for it... Well, it&#39;s a decent deal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is ultimately a supply and demand issue. Google pays high salaries because they have to in order to hire the talent they want. Game devs apparently do not have to, because they are able to fill their roles for lower salaries. Don&#39;t pretend like all tech companies wouldn&#39;t love to lower dev salaries, they just can&#39;t because they wouldn&#39;t be able to hire.Game companies apparently have a meaningful differentiator, which is that working in a gaming context is something people actually value and are willing to give up potential compensation for. This seems especially true at the junior level, which depresses junior salaries relative to other tech companies.Also, comparing compensation against US FAANG hiring is beyond insane. They pay ridiculous salaries due to the extremely limited and competitive market for hires that meet their caliber. This has driven up salaries, but should NOT be treated as an indicator for what &#34;reasonable&#34; pay looks like across the entire industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to have a bit of a counter argument from me, a game developer who loves games and has worked in the US games industry for the majority of my 20 years career:If your argument is &#34;You can make more at a FAANG company&#34; - well yeah, you can. You don&#39;t work in gaming because you want to make the top salary. You work in gaming because you love games and you enjoy having all your coworkers also love games and being able to talk to all of them about games and having your company culture revolve around games and gaming. It&#39;s games all the way down! It&#39;s a completely different work environment. As someone who loves games, the best years of my working career were when I was working on game teams, not at tech companies.Also, developer salaries in games is still plenty good. It&#39;s still great money. I never felt like I was losing out.Also the argument that it&#39;s &#34;grueling 80+ hour weeks day in and day out is&#34; is bullshit! The only time I ever worked 80 hours in a single week was when I was starting out in Quality Assurance and I was getting paid hourly so I was happy to make the extra overtime. As a salaried developer I don&#39;t think I was ever expected to work more than 60 hours a week, and then after the crunch was over we always got 1 or 2 weeks of extra vacation (&#34;comp time&#34;). To be clear, the normal working schedule was 40 hours per week. Crunch time is like 1 or 2 times a year, for maybe 1-2 months each time. And like I said, depending on how much you crunch, you would get extra paid time off afterwards. So for me, that was a pretty good trade. I&#39;d much rather work my ass off for a couple months and then get an extra 2 week vacation at the end of it.Maybe some game companies treat their employees like dirt and work them into the ground, but the ones I&#39;ve worked for, I never felt that way. Don&#39;t work at those terrible companies! There are plenty of &#34;good&#34; game companies out there who pay good salaries and have good working conditions.As someone who is older now with kids, my priorities are definitely different than when I worked in games during my 20s and early 30s. I would no longer be happy working those 60 hour weeks. I want a better work life balance. So I don&#39;t know if I could work on a game team like that anymore. But do I regret working there before I had a family? Absolutely not. #gamedev4life"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I stayed in a small town outside Chablis, France, many years ago. I rented a room above the only restaurant in town. There were a few businesses, mostly food-related and clothing repair. Everything just seemed slowed down. I watched a man in waders unload a dead boar he had just shot to the butcher at 9am. I watched two other men repairing brickwork on a foundation. I watched another woman tending a large garden, then go to work at a bar/restaurant. The stores were open for just a few hours. The shelves were free of random plastic trinkets and gadgets.It just seemed like it was 1/10th the normal speed, somewhat Luddite... and every task seemed oddly fundamental.I&#39;ve also encountered towns like this in Spain, Greece, Austria, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Uruguay, Thailand and Cambodia.After reading these comments, I would never have believed that so many small towns exist that seem untouched by 24-hour stores and everything cheap and on-demand. It sounds inevitable that everyone is eventually pushed into hyperinflationary always-working mode. But yet, these places persist. I might even chalk it up to depressed economies and &#34;third-world&#34; nature, but my samples include all sorts of economies.I think we choose what kind of lifestyle we want, but it needs to be done at the community level. Without going all &#34;we should all be farmers hippie dippy portland nature fetishist&#34;, it does seem like decisions have consequences and it is possible to steer away from hyperactivity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The roots of this phenomenon can be traced back to the &#39;Protestant work ethic&#39; in the 16th Century - a worldview held by white Protestants in Europe that made hard work and the quest for profit seem virtuous. Sally Maitlis, professor of organisational behaviour and leadership at the University of Oxford, says that &#34;later, the drive for efficiency that arose out of the Industrial Revolution&#34;, as well as the way we prize productivity, have &#34;further embedded the value of consistent hard work, often at the cost of personal wellbeing&#34;.The roots of the valorization of work may well have been religious, and maybe Christian (though I very much doubt it&#39;s exclusively Christian in its origin), but it&#39;s definitely spread throughout much of the world, even among the non-religious and even atheist population.I can&#39;t count the number of times I&#39;ve heard people praise others as &#34;hard working&#34;... in all sorts of contexts, in many different parts of the world, native or immigrant, hard work is praised to the heavens and one of the best things you can say about a person is that they&#39;re hard working.I almost never hear the value of working hard being questioned, except when the subject turns to burnout.  Then everybody nods sagely and agrees that overwork is bad.. the next day they go back to praising hard workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Six-day work week was standard like, what, 100 years ago? Now it just seems savage. And so will the five-day work week.I had the luck of getting a four month severance when a company closed, full salary, full benefits. I lined up a new job and just said I will start later.Let me tell you, going back into a tech job, 10 to 6-ish PM every day was no joke, after three months of not giving a fuck. It was torture. I could not understand how I did it until then. And there was that painful realization of &#34;what am I doing here for eight hours a day? I am clearly not using all of it. Give me four hours and I will do the same amount of work and go live my life&#34;.And that&#39;s when I knew that I am not going to be the guy on his deathbed, realizing that he worked too hard and didn&#39;t live, after winning the cosmic lottery of being born on such a rare place as planet Earth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roger Cicala knows a lot about lenses and pushed lens manufacturers to have better testing and quality, he created https://www.lensrentals.com/ because he got sick with low quality checks of lenses:When I started Lensrentals I had a lot of conversations with service centers that went like this. Me: &#34;That lens you repaired still sucks&#34;. Person at service center: &#34;No, it’s within specs&#34;. Me: &#34;What are the specs?&#34; Service center: &#34;We can’t tell you&#34;. One day, after I raised hell with a factory service manager, he patted me on the head and said, “testing lenses is complicated; you don’t have the background to understand.”Any of you who has ever seen a physician after someone says something like ‘you wouldn&#39;t understand; it’s complicated’ knows what happened next. I had no option but to spend a couple of years buying testing equipment, offering internships to really smart optical engineering students, and developing a lens testing center and methodology that was as good as anything in the industry.He is also capable of writing about hard topics in a way that most people can understand them.Anyone interested in camera lenses should read also his previous posts https://www.dpreview.com/members/1329131098"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a bunch of full frame lenses.Recently I looked at some very old ones I haven&#39;t used in a long time. I thought they are faulty (soft).After some diagnosing I found that it is not the fault of lenses but rather in the meantime I have started looking at images at 1:1 in Lightroom and gotten used to ridiculously sharp images from new cameras.Have you ever watched an old TV show and despaired how unwatchable it is because of low quality of image? Yes, that&#39;s the same thing -- our tastes change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a couple of other big reasons related to differences between film and digital sensors.First film is much less sensitive to the angle at which light strikes it. There are some great, sharp old lens designs from leica, zeiss and others that show heavy light fall off in the corners on digital sensors. This is a big part of why even f1.8 or 2 lenses need to be more complicated.Next film grain itself has sharp edges which effectively sharpens images a bit and also limits the resolution and generally has a pleasing effect when viewed at high magnification. With digital you don&#39;t get that and lens flaws get a lot more obvious."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of this analysis is tautological -- meaning that when you boil it down, you&#39;re just saying that things are as you have defined them to be.For instance, take a Big Five trait such as agreeableness. How do we know that a person is agreeable? Because we define agreeableness in a certain way and then measure the degree to which someone conforms to the definition. If that measurement includes questions such as, &#34;Do others find you easy to get along with?&#34; then of course there&#39;s going to be a negative correlation with loneliness, because you&#39;ve essentially defined it that way.I am the author of Correlated.org, which commits many different types of statistical errors for humor&#39;s sake, so this leaps out at me. By the way, for a surprisingly vast number of things, agreeableness is quite predictive. Food preferences, public policy positions, and even willingness to answer poll questions :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is making a subtle mistake; evolution doesn&#39;t mean like-parent-like-child.Evolution is likely selecting for, eg, people who have children at a certain ratio of introverted-extroverted.Introverted, disagreeable, high-contentious types make, for example, great scientists. A population (call it A) that produces a reasonable number of such people is at a huge advantage compared to the alternative that only produces extroverted agreeable types (call them B).Population B will be more competitive at breeding, but population A will win any conflict with B because they&#39;ll have a bunch of weirdos in the back room producing a lot of high quality science (a classic stereotype with some foundation in truth).Note that men are much more likely (something like 4x) to be &#34;completely homosexual&#34; compared to women [0]. I&#39;m betting this is because having a few men who opt out of the race to pass on their genes and focus on other stuff is a massive advantage to the society that hosts them. Look how much of a force gay men have been in culture for example.Locally catastrophic for breeding, globally optimal for society. The equilibrium isn&#39;t for all offspring to maximise their chance of breeding. The optimum is for the community to thrive.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orienta..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of all of the personality traits I have attempted to change over the years, my introversion has remained the most stubborn.  It&#39;s a shame, too.  I can briefly emulate extraversion, at an enormous cost of mental energy and feel like a dog walking on its hind legs.  Nor do I seem to be able to extract the purported benefits of it.  And the list of approaches I have exhausted is, in retrospect, more than a little shocking.  It&#39;s the one area where &#34;fake it until you make it&#34; seems to have failed me utterly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pair programming generates visceral responses due to it being introduced as if it were fact, which for me always triggers my spidey senses. People who didn&#39;t like it were told &#34;you&#39;re doing it wrong&#34; or &#34;you didn&#39;t give it a proper chance&#34;. Dismissing criticisms out of hand only furthers distrust, regardless of the actual value of the idea.I played along and paired for awhile, but now steadfastly refuse to pair, ever. I work best within my own mind, and the distraction of talking to someone breaks my concentration such that I&#39;m unable to keep the big picture in my head anymore. The irritation of being that close to someone and having to engage with them for even half an hour is draining, and I took more frequent and longer breaks because of this (much to the annoyance of my pair-partner, who couldn&#39;t work while I was away).There may very well be people who work well in pairs, but rest assured that there are those who aren&#39;t built that way. Don&#39;t disparage them, don&#39;t discriminate against them, and don&#39;t play the moral superiority game with them. Accept their diversity and be a better team for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also worked at a company where pairing was mandatory for 8 hours a day. Plan was concocted by two tech leads who, of course, didn&#39;t pair themselves.The exhaustion was visible, and productivity was very low. Since everyone vocally thought it was a &#34;waste of time&#34;, there was a Fight-club-style &#34;rule&#34; where we couldn&#39;t talk about the downsides in public or even in Scrum meetings. We missed several deadlines for an MVP, code quality was abysmal and the product barely worked.It stopped when the CEO took issue with it. He gathered the team to ask &#34;why is the productivity so low?&#34;. There was an awkward moment where a junior dev was trying to answer but a tech lead was trying to tell him &#34;don&#39;t break the rule&#34;.It was an absolutely surreal experience, but not out of place in that startup.EDIT: I also remember one of the tech leads complaining during a Sprint Retro that some of us weren&#39;t reading Slack fast enough, and we said &#34;well, I was paring, I wasn&#39;t at my computer&#34;, to which he became a bit agitated and visibly angry. It was an awful place to work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve had incredible experiences pairing.There were whiteboards, snacks, rating each other’s themes, and jokes.What worked very well was to pair for conceptional problems, like architecture and defining modules and their interfaces. Commit some types and pseudo-code.We’d then break away and work at our own speed and in our own style using the common foundation.Come together to integrate and discuss.Pairing is also worth it’s weight in gold for debugging. It’s like a rubber duck, but doesn’t feel wrong.It is of course of utmost importance that both parties enjoy it. Else it’s pain and a waste of everybody’s time. I had a colleague who hated it like the plague. In which case short code/review cycles worked best.A good tool, if employed correctly. Like most things, really. And fuck management if they force it down on me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was in library school around this time (a couple years later, actually), and I remember that Wikipedia was a hot topic: can it be trusted, and why is the answer &#34;no&#34;?Bucking that trend somewhat, I was in the cautiously optimistic camp. By that time it was already more useful to me than the Encyclopedia Britannica, and getting better all the time. The trajectory was clear.It seems like, of all the exciting things from the early web, Wikipedia has been one of the only things that actually panned out the way it was intended. It didn&#39;t get commercialized, but it didn&#39;t go broke either. It didn&#39;t become a cesspool, or try to consume all of my attention. It just does the thing it&#39;s supposed to do. If there was a fire on the internet, and I could only save one website, it would be you Wikipedia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wikipedia is one of, if not the best thing(s) to happen to the internet. It achieved basically what the internet&#39;s aim was: to democratize information.Even when I have to learn something, ANYTHING, I&#39;ll go to Wikipedia, after which I read the sources of the article for in depth research. And while I dislike their political articles a lot, the science, math, history and arts articles are genuinely incredible to read."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone prove me wrong, but I think of Wikipedia as one, if not the largest cooperation of human beings on a very specific project. Most of the criticism it recieves is true, but it&#39;s a wonder that it could remain, and even grow in the state like it is.I wish more organisational involvement would happen on the editorial level - companies, governments, or education. I wish academia wouldn&#39;t despise it. There is so much untapped potential still."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I were Apple, I would say “oops a couple security-sensitive  APIs slipped through that we forgot to open up for requests for access,” and quickly publish an expanded list of all of the entitlements they’re currently saving for their close friends. This is different, and more toxic, than all of the in—app purchase stuff — you’re telling indie developers that no matter how hard they try, they won’t be able to match the functionality of Apple’s special friends.Otherwise, well, there goes your narrative of having a level playing field. The problem with this is, the loss of trust results in a slow, unending decay that only becomes obvious in retrospect.It may not seem like it, but billions of dollars of value are at stake with little things like this. If you work at Apple, you should raise the alarm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another weird example is how Apple&#39;s own &#34;Clips&#34; app has a special private entitlement that bypasses the permission prompt for camera access.Would it hurt them so much to prompt for camera access the first time the app is started after installing it from the app store?I found that extremely worrying as it means I can no longer trust the app store to provide a safe sandboxed environment. Suddenly there&#39;s an app with this special no-cam-permission entitlement and your mugshot is uploaded when you believed the ios camera permission system would have protected you.Oh, but Apple would only ever grant that permission to its own apps? Better hope we&#39;ll never get a repeat of the PsychicPaper exploit!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what bothers me most about Apple devices and software. They probably have the &#34;best&#34; devices out there in terms of user experience. I use an iPhone and iPad every day because of it. But they keep very tight control over what software can be installed and run on it in order to safeguard their views on UX and security/privacy.This means for me as a developer that it&#39;s hard to write software and tools for my own devices without having to deal with Apple in some way or root the devices. Some things are even clearly impossible because of these private entitlements: There is no way for me to explore the CarPlay API&#39;s to experiment with my own ideas.A small part of me hopes that the Epic lawsuit and recent developments can lead to more abilities for sideloading on iDevices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Robin Hobb is one of my favorite authors. Her masterwork is a series of series (four trilogies and a quadrology) known as The Realm of the Elderlings.She published the first trilogy, which begins with Assassin&#39;s Apprentice, starting in 1995. I saw the books when they first came out and I assumed from the title and the cover that it would be a cheesy fantasy by the numbers, so I never bought it. But I kept hearing about these books from other people who liked SFF, so I finally picked up the first trilogy.I was completely wrong. It&#39;s not at all by the numbers. While it&#39;s not trope-free (nothing is), there are all sorts of interesting ideas, from the political to ecological. As you read the later series, the world opens up quite a bit, and it gets even more interesting. The final trilogy brings so many elements together, and the ending is shatteringly powerful.While this is epic fantasy, it&#39;s _not_ at all grimdark. Bad things definitely happen, but it&#39;s more hopeful and humane than something like Malazan or Song of Ice and Fire.I can&#39;t recommend these books highly enough. Even if her writing is slowing down, I hope that she&#39;s satisfied with what she&#39;s done. This series alone is an enormous accomplishment. To build a world across so many books, across so many years, and have it come together so well in the end is massively impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"70?  My animal is only 33 and is very tired.  Writing this as it lays in bed, 3 in the afternoon, because even a standard chair sounds more exhausting to it.It seems to have no motivation or energy to do much besides lay here.If I force it, it will get stuff done but at a huge cost.  It will yearn the entire time to just lay back down.It&#39;s interest in things seems to be fading quickly.  What desire it used to have to work hard and succeed, has slipped away.  It seems these days it has only enough energy to lay in bed and scroll through the internet.  Not sure what is wrong with my animal, but this is no way for it to live.I was hard on the animal in its early 20s, but no harder than the average animal.  The past 7 years or so have actually been pretty calm, good food, semi regular exercise,  stable job, etc.It&#39;s scary to imagine how the animal would feel at 70 if this is how it feels at 33.  Maybe the pandemic was a straw to its back, and the isolation has worn it down more than anything else possibly could."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Better food, more exercise, more relaxation... but I also wonder if it would have made any difference.Yes. I&#39;m only half OP&#39;s age but working out and eating well (well for me means much more) has made all the little aches I started to have in my 20s go away and made me much calmer, I can also sleep pretty much anywhere and at any time.More interestingly though,Me, and the animal I live inside.there is no animal you live inside, this is not a meat vehicle for something else, your body is you, it&#39;s not some machine you merely inhabit. Its/your gut will affect your mood, its limitations are your limitations, being physically strong will make you feel strong and keep anxieties at bay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly, there is an embedded video in that article that explains the issue specific to the automotive shortage - it&#39;s because the automotive industry cancelled a lot of chip orders in anticipation of low vehicle demand and that caused chip makers to reduce their production for the kinds of chips that go into cars, and now it takes time to ramp back up:https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/02/how-the-global-compute...It&#39;s at the 4m15s part of the videoI think a facepalm is in order."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding cars:&#34;Some carmakers are now leaving out high-end features as a result of the chip shortage, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday.Nissan is reportedly leaving navigation systems out of cars that would normally have them, while Ram Trucks has stopped equipping its 1500 pickups with a standard “intelligent” rearview mirror that monitors for blind spots&#34;I have an unpopular opinion, especially when we start to look at the increase of safety features and increase in pedestrian injuries, that we may be better off going back to smaller trucks designed for good visibility and less reliance on features.
(bias: I drive a 16 year old wagon, and feel panicked around bicycling with what feels like more trucks in the US)---&#34;Hertz said it is “supplementing” its fleet “by purchasing low-mileage, preowned vehicles” from auctions and dealerships.&#34;I find it wild that just a year ago Hertz filed for bankruptcy [0] and was selling vehicles by end of year [1].[0]: https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/business/hertz-bankruptcy/ind...[1]: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/hertz-must-offload..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of folks underestimate how fabulously complicated it is to fab a chip. Yes, you can diy it in your garage, here&#39;s a wonderful implementation. http://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/But take a look at the specialized tools they used. Heck, think about proper handling of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid and this is just a simple amp. imagine trying to make something with lots of gates?Making a single chip is _hard_. And that&#39;s just for a one off. doing that at scale requires an amazing amount of process control. And that diy chip is, according to the author &#34;5µm (1975 tech. level)&#34;Anyway, yes, you could make a chip in your garage, but it&#39;d take a lot of time to ramp up, and you&#39;d only have 1."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classically trained pianist here (since 7 years old), I like the article&#39;s advice.&gt; Use the correct fingering, dynamics, articulation, etc. from the very beginning; you are never going to get around to “fixing” it later.When I was an impatient kid my piano teachers would keep insisting I play sections slow on a first pass, which annoyed me (it was like reading a book out loud slowly), but it was only until many years later when I played pieces like Un Sospiro[0] which are intractable if you do not start practicing at something like 16 times slower than performance tempo.  If you start out correctly, the rest will follow, and IME, sight reading greatly improves as well.&gt; [...] you may reach a point where you can’t play any faster, no matter how hard you try. What is likely happening is that the hand motions you are using—which come naturally at the slower tempo you started with—simply will not work at such high speeds.This is completely true, for instance, in ragtime, the left hand makes big, quick jumps and there is often no time to look at where it will land (which one likely does when playing slowly), so repeating a bar over and over again to incrementally refine your distance estimate is crucial.This applies to things like typing on a keyboard as well, if you focus on correct finger placement (and correct use of the 4th and 5th fingers), your WPM might take a hit for a few days or a week, but in the long term it really helps.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po_a1SmZKLs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Indian classical dancer here.&gt; Do not work on this section for more than twenty minutes.This is not something I&#39;ve heard often in my field but I had to learn this over the years. Performers want to present a piece as if it was never practiced and was all made up on the spot, and yet we do have to practice a piece day after day. Losing vitality and &#34;becoming rehearsed&#34; through over-practice is a real problem.The book &#34;A Soprano on Her Head&#34; by Eloise Ristad, who was a piano teacher, really helped me with my dance &amp; acting practice. I restructured a lot based on that book (added improvisational elements, reduced forceful drill-like elements, more self-observation, less verbal cues), and my technique and enjoyment both improved a lot during covid lockdown. She also wrote a book called &#34;Bold Beginnings&#34; for teaching piano using a new method that she made up, but I&#39;ve not been able to find a copy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been learning guitar and ive been amazed at how bad lessons and education is for adult students. The apps i have used barely work and are extremely unambitious.Classes are so disorganized and i am constantly wading through material that is a mile wide but a foot deep.Yes i have seen Justin Guitar I&#39;m not a huge fan. I dont want to have to wade through content to find the exercises that are relevant to me. I think Duolingo has an interesting approach to this, where has you re-visit concepts every day and it tells you what to practice to reduce decision fatigue.I want a dashboard that is keeping track of my goals and progress akd has an opinionated way for me to measure my skill, and to direct my effort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve wondered what the effect our modern digital economy has had on consumer price inflation.Normally, an increase in money supply would cause consumer goods to increase in price, since more people are able to buy them and there is a limit on how much of any particular physical good is available.This isn&#39;t the case, however, for digital goods. If there are suddenly 100 million new people who want to buy a Netflix subscription, it isn&#39;t like we are going to see the price of a Netflix subscription go up because there isn&#39;t enough Netflix to go around. The marginal cost for a new subscriber is practically zero, so there should be no price increase caused by a shortage.It would be easy to see that inflation would be essentially zero if ALL goods people wanted to buy were digital ones... no amount of demand can eat up the supply, since supply is practically infinite.Of course, in the real world, some goods are digital and some are physical. If you gave everyone $5000, some of that would go to Netflix subscriptions, which wouldn&#39;t effect consumer prices, and some would go to buying TVs to play Netflix on, which WOULD cause inflation.I am curious how much of our current &#34;low inflation even with an increasing money supply&#34; is caused by our increasing spending on non-exclusionary goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some personal anecdotes. I grew up during the hyperinflation days in Brazil (80s, early 90s): talking about 60% a month.People would get their salary and run to the supermarket and buy everything they needed for the month, because if they waited a single day the prices would have changed. A lot of people internalized that habit and still do that nowadays (not in the sense of running to the supermarket, but buying a lot for the whole month).This was before barcodes, and every item had a price label on it. Supermarkets had people employed full time just to be remarking the items. I remember running to pick up an item on one end of a shelf while the employee was remarking the items coming from the other end, so you could buy the item at yesterday&#39;s price.I lived through 6 currency changes. Usually when prices started being in the scale of millions, the government would announce that in a very short period (sometimes that being next week), there was a new currency with a new name and 1000 OLD = 1 NEW. Until the government could replace all existing bills, the old bills would be accepted as if they were the new bills (at 1/1000 of the face value, of course). Old bills passing through the banking system would be stamped with the name of the new currency and the new value before being put back into circulation.Contracts like rentals were all indexed: there was a clause saying the price would be corrected every month using the official index that tracked the inflation. Or were pegged to the dollar. This by itself fed into the positive feedback loop that was perpetuating the hyperinflation.The government tried some bizarre measures to tame inflation. Often they would try freezing all prices, but that was never sustainable for long. The craziest one was probably in 1990 when the government simply froze 80% of everybody&#39;s money in the bank for 18 months to reduce the amount of money in the economy. This was a total disaster and even caused many suicides.In 1994 hyperinflation was finally tamed when the current currency, Real, was introduced. It was the culmination of an ingenious plan that actually worked.Feel free to ask me more, if you&#39;re interested."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It always amuses me that large cats are no different than house cats, they seem to act exactly the same including sitting in boxes [1].Only difference is when the large cat gets annoyed for unknown reasons it kills you rather than just scratching your arm up and that’s just due to a difference in size not behavior it seems.1. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/404268504021009708/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very sad I can&#39;t view the figures, which appear to include at least a couple of shots of cats sitting in things. It looks like the Kanizsa square illusion they&#39;re referring to is this: https://puzzlewocky.com/optical-illusions/kanizsa-square-and..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obfuscated Javascript didn&#39;t render here (Chromebook), found what looked like the abstract:&#34;A well-known phenomenon to cat owners is the tendency of their cats to sit in enclosed spaces such as boxes, laundry baskets, and even shape outlines taped on the floor. This investigative study asks whether domestic cats (&lt;em&gt;Felis silvestris catus&lt;/em&gt;) are also susceptible to sitting in enclosures that are illusory in nature, utilizing cats’ attraction to box-like spaces to assess their perception of the Kanizsa square visual illusion. Carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study randomly assigned citizen science participants Booklets of six randomized, counterbalanced daily stimuli to print out, prepare, and place on the floor in pairs. Owners observed and videorecorded their cats’ behavior with the stimuli and reported findings from home over the course of the six daily trials. This study ultimately reached over 500 pet cats and cat owners, and of those, 30 completed all of the study’s trials. Of these, nine cat subjects selected at least one stimulus by sitting within the contours (illusory or otherwise) with all limbs for at least three seconds. This study revealed that cats selected the Kanizsa illusion just as often as the square and more often than the control, indicating that domestic cats may treat the subjective Kanizsa contours as they do real contours. Given the drawbacks of citizen science projects such as participant attrition, future research would benefit from replicating this study in controlled settings. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first of its kind in three regards: a citizen science study of cat cognition; a formal examination into cats’ attraction to 2D rather than 3D enclosures; and study into cats’ susceptibility to illusory contours in an ecologically relevant paradigm. This study demonstrates the potential of more ecologically valid study of pet cats, and more broadly provides an interesting new perspective into cat visual perception research.&#34;Thought that might be of interest to other who, like me, couldn&#39;t grok the headline."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something like this is so sorely needed.I&#39;ve been doing some work in ag-tech for the past few years (having previously worked in ISP/telco, general SME web/mobile development, then consumer travel tech).The tools available to farmers/growers for what should be quite basic things - i.e., web-connected weather stations and monitoring systems for soil moisture, frost alarms and irrigation control are terrible.The industry is full of small players who take a look and think &#34;I know how to build stuff with [Arduino/Raspberry Pi/Zigbee etc], I can build an ag-tech monitoring/control product easily&#34;.So everyone builds a hardware product from scratch, then as a quick afterthought, a web app with an SQL database and Highcharts to show data graphs. You have an MVP within a few months, then a few paying customers in your local community, then suddenly your customers start asking for features you&#39;d never thought of, like sensor inputs you didn&#39;t know existed, or combined displays of different kinds of data you&#39;d never considered anyone would want, or needing it to be faster (SQL turns out to be really slow for this kind of data) or more reliable (bugfixing is hard when your devices are hundreds of miles away and connected via weak 3G/4G data links), and you realise your hardware and software architecture doesn&#39;t support any of this, and you&#39;d have to completely start over to actually deliver something that customers really need, but you&#39;re out of money and energy.The result is a lot of farmers/growers dissatisfied/frustrated at never being able to get the monitoring systems they need (some of them having tried 3+ different vendors), and a lot of new companies trying to build new solutions and going bust.I&#39;ve been thinking there needs to be some widely accepted open standards in the industry for hardware and software platforms, so solutions providers can avoid trying to re-invent everything and instead focus on integration of tried-and-true building blocks.If this initiative brings that about, it would be a big win for everyone in the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of interest to me because I have been doing agricultural process monitoring and production control systems for about 30 years. And most of my clients&#39; systems are at least semi-custom and re-invent wheels for no other purpose other than to do it their way; that is, silos (pun not intended). But where NDAs and IP agreements allow, I have attempted to standardize some architectures.But was disappointing to see the way the LF is organizing this - no representation from the ag industry&#39;s heavy hitters and no specific and attainable goals.Should this be done by an Operating Systems organization? Other than centralized control and logistical systems, ag engineering is not the realm of microprocessors and operating systems, and code monkeys. Ag engineering is a world of hardware, micro-controllers, FSMs, and scheduler stacks.But then, if not the LF, whom has the organization to do this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a ridiculous feature of modern C that you have to write the super verbose &#34;mask and shift&#34; code, which then gets compiled to a simple `mov` and maybe a `bswap`. Wheras, the direct equivalent in C, an assignment with a (type changing) cast, is illegal. There is a huge mismatch between the assumptions of the C spec and actual machine code.One of the few reasons I ever even reached to C is the ability to slurp in data and reinterpret it as a struct, or the ability to reason in which registers things will show up and mix in some `asm` with my C.I think there should really be a dialect of C(++) where the machine model is exactly the physical machine. That doesn&#39;t mean the compiler can&#39;t do optimizations, but it shouldn&#39;t do things like prove code as UB and fold everything to a no-op. (Like when you defensively compare a pointer to NULL that according to spec must not be NULL, but practically could be...)`-fno-strict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` gets you halfway there, but it would really only be viable if you had a blessed `-std=high-level-assembler` or `-std=friendly-c` flag."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rust gets this right. These primitives are available for all the numeric types.    u32::from_le_byte(bytes) // u32 from 4 bytes, little endian
    u32::from_be_byte(bytes) // u32 from 4 bytes, big endian
    u32::to_le_bytes(num) // u32 to 4 bytes, little endian
    u32::to_be_bytes(num) // u32 to 4 bytes, big endian

This was very useful to me recently as I had to write the marshaling and un-marshaling for a game networking format with hundreds of messages. With primitives like this, you can see what&#39;s going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why, in 2021, the mantra that C is a good language for these low level byte twiddling tasks needs to die. Dealing with alignment and endianness properly requires a language that allows you to build abstractions.The following is perfectly well defined in C++, despite looking like almost the same as the original unsafe C:    #include &lt;boost/endian.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
    using namespace boost::endian;

    unsigned char b[5] = {0x80,0x01,0x02,0x03,0x04};

    int main() {
        uint32_t x = *((big_uint32_t*)(b+1));
        printf(&#34;%08x\n&#34;, x);
    }

Note that I deliberately misaligned the pointer by adding 1.https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/5416oefjx[Edit] Fun twist: the above code doesn&#39;t work where the intermediate variable x is removed because printf itself is not type safe, so no type conversion (which is when the bswap is deferred to) happens. In pure C++ when using a type safe formatting function (like fmt or iostreams) this wouldn&#39;t happen. printf will let you throw any garbage in to it. tl;dr outside embedded use cases writing C in 2021 is fucking nuts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, this is a really cool concept and I look forward to the determination if it is true or testable.I find the &#34;double copy of other forces&#34; verbiage to be difficult to follow. Walking through a formula example would be helpful, and formaluae exist to communicate exactly this kind of clumpy-wumpy-lumpy-timey-wimey awkwardness language clods through in its quest to communicate mathematical structures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This probably isn&#39;t the right place for this question. But the right kind of people will be reading this thread so I will ask it.In college physics my teacher insisted that, despite gravity being popularly referred to as a force, it is not a force. Weight is indeed a force, but gravity is more like a field. I understood it like this: Say you have a point mass in an isolated system. There is certainly gravity all around that mass, but there are no forces anywhere in the system. Not until another mass is introduced into the system do you have any forces. It is apparent from the formula for force since then you have that new mass times the acceleration of gravity.Or is this just being pedantic and does it even matter?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Most theorists assume that gravity actually pushes us around through particlesIs this true, and if so, why? The interpretation of gravity as something that warps spacetime very elegantly yields its “gravitational force” via its effect on the action integral, and is easily understood using a path integral style framework. It seems like a particle-based framework would necessarily be a lot more complicated, although maybe it’s necessary for some reason I don’t know."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"And, in my opinion, its only going to get worse if Intel doesnt sober up and address the elephant in the room:  Hyperthreading.Without serious reform to the design of the Intel X86 chip to eliminate and refactor what basically amounts to a performance-before-safety feature, Intel is going to see the lions share of performance hits.  Eventually people will tire of writing backflip code to sidestep pitfalls in the Intel HT design and simply return the responsibility to Intel, where its existed since day one.It could be argued Intels mouthpiece has already lost its ability to convince major datacenter and cloud customers that HT is even remotely safe as a continued investment.  Intel needs a new X86."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For data center operators the choice between AMD and Intel in this space comes down to power efficiency.Ignoring the performance improvements for real workloads, the #1 driving factor is performance per watt. By going with AMD that metric improves ~2x over comparable Intel offerings.There are facilities where physical space to expand is available but the building has effectively run out of additional power that can be provided by the utility company.Scaling up on performance per watt is the last frontier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s stopping more people from moving cloud workloads to AMD? Unless you&#39;re running a rickety legacy application using Intel features you&#39;ll instantly save money by moving to AMD.Both my work and all my side projects have moved to AMD instances where available, except for some legacy on-prem stuff."</p>
