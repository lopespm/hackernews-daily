								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why is the laplacian so ubiquitous? Well, locally any reasonable PDE is well approximated by a linear one. And linear PDEs are of the form Lu = f for a linear differentiable operator L. But why does the particular case of L = laplacian show up so often in physics? Galilean invariance says that the laws of physics should be invariant under translation and rotation. Checking this against Lu = f, you can verify that one requires that L commute with translations and rotations. That is L(u_h) = (Lu)_h, where u_h(x) = u(x+h), and similarly for rotations. What you can show (pretty easily on the Fourier side) is that every linear differential operator with these properties is a polynomial in the Laplacian."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sure. But I have a question: why? Why should we opt out of the telemetry? To me, this idea seems to not just be admitting defeat, it&#39;s ensuring defeat right from the start.Telemetry should always be opt-in. Yes, that means vendors will get much less data. It&#39;s on them to deal with it.On a related note, I wonder how long it takes until one of the vendors of popular CLI tools or desktop apps get fined for GDPR violation. I wonder how much of existing telemetry already crosses the &#34;informed consent&#34; requirement threshold. I&#39;ll definitely be filing a complaint if I find a tool that doesn&#39;t ask for it when, by law, it should."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;PRs and Status&#34; is a very optimistic headline for a list of rejected pull requests.I like the idea, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. I can understand why some Homebrew devs think it&#39;s just an attempt from someone to pad their resume. It&#39;s essentially a single person setting up a website, then submitting a bunch of untested pull requests to a bunch of projects.I imagine this would work much better if a large distro like Debian would adopt this first. They have the credibility and weight necessary for such a project, they can make it much more useful by asking for the desired setting during OS setup, and they can make sure it&#39;s universally respected via patches in the packaging process. From there it would have a chance at wide adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not support this idea. The differences between the things they all group together under one umbrella is wild - ads, usage reporting, automatic updates, and crash reporting are all very different things and it&#39;s actively harmful to control all of them with a single switch.At the very least, there should be two different switches - &#34;ads&#34; and &#34;everything else&#34;.If you don&#39;t want telemetry or crash reporting, that&#39;s fine - you may not care about helping the developers of an open-source project improve their software and that&#39;s your personal choice. Similarly, you may want to manually install security patches, while I want them to be automatically installed so I have one less thing to worry about.There may even be some crazy person that wants ads. I don&#39;t, but I&#39;m not going to try to take away their freedom to choose them, which is what this proposal would do - an all-or-nothing switch for non-essential network access.Give me granularity. There&#39;s no (user-facing) reason not to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to me that there is not as much push back against Rust from the kernel. Linus (I guess everyone addresses him with his first name), has been very critical, even dismissive of systems programming languages other than C. But with Rust he has a more, I guess we could say passive approach. This might be a good indicator that Rust is doing something very respectable.On the other hand I&#39;m slightly suspicious of this movement. Rustaceans are very, very eager to promote the language. It would be interesting to know how much this movement comes from within the Linux kernel community or if it is driven more by the Rust community.In any case the language seems to have potential of becoming a new mainstream systems programming language in a few years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like this now has enough momentum and strong industry support to actually happen.With the initial announcement I mentioned that Linux will need quite a customized Rust experience, and was hopeful that this effort could improve the situation for everyone.It&#39;s great to see this actually happen, with changes already flowing back into core and alloc.A lot of progress in just a few months!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading between the lines it seems the writer has mainly watched American movies that are easily accessible. I recommend instead of scrolling through the Amazon catalogue like he described, he might want to see if there is a local film festival that screens world cinema. Cinema from other parts of the world for me often leads to great new perspectives and insights. Outside of Hollywood there is plenty of auteurs and refreshing cinema happening. Or take a deep dive into the best of the best without the American lens with lists like the TSPDT.https://www.theyshootpictures.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Roger Ebert wrote an essay [0] in 1992 reflecting on his career as a critic. He writes&gt;In the past 25 years I have probably seen 10,000 movies and reviewed 6,000 of them. I have forgotten most of those films, I hope, but I remember those worth remembering, and they are all on the same shelf in my mind.Overall, he seems never to have lost the joy of watching movies. A relevant quote:&gt;When you go to the movies every day, it sometimes seems as if the movies are more mediocre than ever, more craven and cowardly, more skillfully manufactured to pander to the lowest tastes, instead of educating them. Then you see something absolutely miraculous. Something like &#34;Wings of Desire,&#34; or &#34;Do the Right Thing,&#34; or &#34;Drugstore Cowboy,&#34; or &#34;Gates of Heaven,&#34; or &#34;Beauty and the Beast,&#34; or &#34;Life Is Sweet,&#34; and on your way home through the White Hen Pantry you look distracted, as if you had just experienced some kind of a vision.[0]: https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/reflections-after-25-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The root cause of this is basically Hollywood (i.e. who makes what gets shown in your local multiplex) has given up on making movies exclusively for American audiences.  You need a global audience, and you need the potential to get a billion dollars + in revenue.  E.G. as he points out comedies have died, that&#39;s because comedy is highly localized versus the kids movies + adventure plots which are more universal.  End result is everything gets boiled down to its rawest, most accessible elements and everything feels samey."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a xoogler who interviewed way back in 2004, let me say that this post sums up my feelings exactly. The people I worked with at Google back then weren’t necessarily there for high six figure salaries. We were there to work with other people like us. We were there to be part of something larger than ourselves. In some sense I felt alone most of the time, and when I interviewed I felt as if I had found my tribe. These are people who made me feel dumb, but also astutely aware that I could improve. I learned so much during my tenure there, and I regret none of it. Perhaps I do regret taking so long to realize the sense of purpose and mission died when Emerald Sea started and good projects (reader, google talk, code search) were being canabalized to prop up a pipe dream that was never going to work. That’s the nexus event in Google’s time line… where things went askew and never came back to normal. Now people only care about perf, OKRs, and levels. Being a poor new grad with no savings and intentionally picking projects that would not get you promoted (but were fun) was frequent back then. The courage to do new things is rewarded in ways different than titles and symbols. Perhaps no “one” is more cognizant of that than the anthropomorphic Google of today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on the infra team for a TypeScript-based product downstream of the author. His and his team&#39;s approach and writings influenced at a lot of my thinking about core development, and I&#39;ll always be grateful for having had the opportunity to learn from them by osmosis.The success or failure with which any companies hires and retains folks like these is a mystery to me. As the evidence shows, Google (and I suspect almost any &gt;100-person company) is far too much an amorphous glob/slime mold to even have a single coherent approach to this problem. But what are the successful strategies here? How important is it even to retain this kind of talent? How do we know how a company is even doing in this regard?In my meager-in-comparison 6.5 years at Google, while I certainly saw many amazing SWEs come and many go, I&#39;m far from knowing what the real trajectory was. But I can imagine that for many folks, the perceived trajectory would be a major motivating or demotivating factor to stay or to leave themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At the time I left, out of ~150k employees, only ~300 had worked there longer than me.This is why it is insane to accept the &#34;I know the people involved in developing that and they wouldn&#39;t let a terrible thing happen.&#34; Defense of it being ok for the co. to have massive unchecked power.The company is its people. The people /will/ change. Give a company serious power you cannot expect the staff to keep it reigned in. It&#39;s completely unrealistic and also unfair to the staff for them to have that moral responsibility forced on them. Ultimately 99.9% of the time the only thing they can do is resign, which reduces the impediments to bad things happening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; But drill isn’t popular. It’s widely seen as boring. Worse, there’s a body of opinion, especially in education, that considers it an ineffective way to practice. That’s a shame, because it’s the most effective way to build your skills.This resonated with me as I watch my kids go through school.Math used to be taught with more drill style. Now with common core every single problem is an epic quest of 10 frames and double pluses. It seems so ridiculous. I&#39;d rather them crush a worksheet of 20 problems that practices a single skill then 2 problems that try to include everything from reading to drawing just for a simple subtraction problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The premise of Wooden&#39;s methods is that the players already have a lot of experience playing basketball. Many many games by the time they got to UCLA. Informal and formal.And that&#39;s my caveat for this as advice on painting. If a person doesn&#39;t already have a history of painting, by which I mean starting and completing paintings as paintings, no amount of drill is going turn them into a painter. The willingness to execute paintings has to be there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I agree with a lot in this article, I totally don&#39;t understand the &#34;Code Kata&#34; thing promoted by Uncle Bob Martin and others. I understand drilling a specific skill in the arts, but writing the same piece of code over and over just makes no sense at all (and yeah, his example was solving the &#34;Bowling Score&#34; problem every time).So, anyone do code katas and like/recommend them? If so, what does it teach you? Do you do the same problem over and over, or tackle different problems?"</p>

Then work on issues for however long you wanted, billed hourly at a generous rate. Several times I disappeared for weeks to travel and climb and was always welcomed back.That company was minting money and wasn’t worried about deadlines. I wish more work was structured this way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a tip on finding a cofounder. I&#39;ve been looking for the last 12 months and I tried a lot of things, but the thing that worked best is this:Post a job ad.That&#39;s it. My ad sounded like a normal job in every way, with a title like &#34;Director of X&#34;. A couple of specific notes: 1) the first line said &#34;cofounder&#34; in it somewhere, and 2) it specified &#34;part-time to full-time, heavy on equity compensation&#34; somewhere else.The result: Lots of inappropriate candidates applied. But also, my 2 job posts resulted in three extremely excellent team members: a equity-only cofounder, a mostly-equity cofounder/early hire, and an amazing advisor. I have been working with these folks for months and they are very solid.I also recommend my vetting process: just like a job. That is, I did a phone screen, a multi-hour interview, a little take-home, and I winnowed down the candidates at each stage. With the chosen few, I kicked off a &#34;let&#39;s do this&#34; conversation. My pitch was, &#34;I know it&#39;s ridiculous, but let&#39;s get business married, we&#39;ll set up an offsite and start working together full-time... and, if we really need to, we&#39;ll get an annulment&#34;. That&#39;s what vesting is for!Hope that helps :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on a startup for years, like the better part of a decade and finding cofounders is like planning where lightning will strike; unless you&#39;re already in the right place, it&#39;s almost impossible.I&#39;ve tried things like cofounderslab, cold messaging through social DMs and working my network but there&#39;s such a small cohort of people who (1) find value in working at a startup, (2) are willing to take equity in the beginning without being paid and (3) believe in your idea enough to want to work hard.I&#39;ve had to learn how to scale myself into different roles (outside of engineering) to keep going, but it really is an exercise in testing your limits: mentally, physically, emotionally, socially...I hope this is something that actually works.edit: Just to give more context, I have had people who I trusted and who initially signed on to help, but they fell out somewhat quickly due to one of the three things I mentioned above. Most people don&#39;t understand how much work goes into actually making a startup happen and flame out pretty quickly...alas..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using this since February-ish.Talked to maybe 20-30 people through the platform.Joined one startup as cofounder. Worked together for two months, then left. My cofounder was smart, had high EQ, and I enjoyed working with them, but we had different visions and parted amicably.My thoughts:- Early on, there was a smaller pool of people, but they were of higher quality. I feel the quality of people has diminished over time. YMMV.- It was interesting just to have talks with the high quality people and expand my network. This kinda segued me into Lunchclub, but I&#39;ve since stopped both. Depending on who you are, you might get burnt out with these &#34;social&#34; calls after a while.- As a technical person, I had a lot of business-y people reach out, most of which I didn&#39;t end up responding to. There&#39;s plenty of candidates, just like dating on Tinder. I get to choose to work with the really nice and productive people that I like.- BIGGEST PROBLEM: Unfortunately, it suffers the same problem as every other cofounder matching program. There&#39;s no system or formula to really dig deep and see if you&#39;re compatible on all the levels you need to be. This means it can be a big time and energy drain, from the initial meets, to the dating process, to even cofounder work.If you do use this, some tips:- Being short and sweet with your profile. Burying the fact that you&#39;re a high school student in 5 paragraphs of text won&#39;t make it more likely for me to work with you, and I probably won&#39;t even read it.- Add a photo. You&#39;re going to be working with a human, not a robot.- Your cofounder courting process is something you&#39;ll have to develop and figure out what you&#39;re looking for. Take your time and think about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m still bummed out that for years, GPL was the &#34;standard&#34; go-to open source license. So many projects became useless for any commercial projects whatsoever.GPL advocates say it&#39;s so that your code isn&#39;t exploited by corporations.But I&#39;d say that choosing GPL means it&#39;s more important to you that your code &#34;is not exploited by corporations&#34; than that it can be used for good by people with commercial interests.Those two things do not have to be synonyms. I&#39;d much rather allow the second if it means tolerating the first.(Edit: Seeing the downvotes, I&#39;d be genuinely interested in counter-arguments or thoughts on this)(Edit 2: Just because it keeps coming up, let me make absolutely clear that I do NOT in any way think GPL might never be a valid choice, nor that anyone, myself included, should feel &#34;entitled&#34; to &#34;free as in *.*&#34; code.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool to see a team of 25 students put this together and get prototypes made. I wish opportunities like these were available back in my college days.The headline is getting slightly ahead of the actual performance. Reaching Cortex-A76 performance is their goal after many more iterations. Their current implementation is not there yet, but that shouldn&#39;t detract from the magnitude of their achievement and their contribution to the open-source world:&gt; This culminated with an 8-core prototype built based on Yanqihu (雁栖湖) architecture using TSMC’s 28nm process with the processor running up to 1.2 or 1.3 GHz that should be taped out this month. But plans have been made to tape out a new prototype based on Nanhu (南湖) by the end of the year, using SMIC’s 14nm process allowing up to 2 GHz frequency, and further iterations of the architecture will aim at rivaling Arm’s Cortex-A76 processor.RISC-V is an exciting development in the SoC world. We&#39;re starting to see some of HiFive&#39;s boards trickle out into the wild. The performance is good, but it&#39;s not quite as groundbreaking as many of the headlines make it out to be. The most exciting part of all of this is that ARM has more competition and we get to see some open-source contributions like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MicroMagic is pretty interesting to me in the RISC-V space: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/new-risc-v-cpu-claim...They are getting perf-per-watt numbers that are ahead of everyone...albeit with a single core and no real 3rd party verification.Some of the group had worked on Sparc at Sun, and they had previously sold themselves to Juniper for $260M, then regrouped some time afterwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know whether it is possible with chip development or not. But I really hope that this project will enable numerous amount of derivative chips just as Linux kernel allows multiple distro. That means IoT/GPU/CPU/etc chips need not to start from scratch. In addition, having similar foundations might help fabs manufacture those chips swiftly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good write up.  Many years ago I decided to code/program a log based db, to see how far can I go.  It was supposed to be Light-weight (Berkley DB was the inspiration). It had a working stream to file for all changes, and a compaction thread in the background.What I learned...  creating the main/basic features of non-relational database (log based), is easy... but it is the edge cases that hit you hard and dealing with them creates about 90% of the code.It was a fun exercise from which I learned a lot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good tutorial.The problem of out-of-order data becomes more challenging as ingest throughput requirements increase if your storage representation must guarantee a strict total order. In high-throughput designs this is often handled by relaxing the strict total ordering requirement for how the data is represented in storage. As long as the time-series has an approximate total order at ingest time, there are many techniques for inexpensively reconstructing a strict total order at query time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t hear much about it these days, but circa 2004 when I was going into computer science I had multiple teachers and a guidance counselor warn me that all the jobs would be going to India and tell me I should pursue something else. This seemed to be very much the prevailing wisdom of the time. I pursued it anyway as it was my passion.I was one of five students in my program that had been a huge multi-campus program only a couple years earlier. We were the last cohort before the college discontinued the program entirely, and I was the only one to graduate. What I found  however for maybe five years after graduation was a insanely high demand for developers.There was genuinely a generation that was so strongly discouraged from becoming developers that there were very few. Seems to me like the folklorists have largely missed this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest issue with education is the whole &#34;study this, get a job doing that&#34; idea. It&#39;s plainly wrong, and it sucks in people who drink the koolaid and think there&#39;s an easy route to work.Very little is learned in college that is necessary for general employment. By general I mean just about everything that isn&#39;t licensed, like being a doctor.What college does is it throws a bunch of hard but irrelevant subjects at you that you slog through, so that you learn how to learn stuff. The best demonstration of this is in subjects that are scientific mathematical, because there&#39;s very deep trees of knowledge there that you have to trace, and there&#39;s relatively few ways to use common sense and cultural experience to answer questions.This is why there are so many devs with no &#34;relevant&#34; degree. If you can sort through the mess of learning a stack, you can do the job. If you need to know some particular CS thing, you will find it and learn it yourself. There&#39;s no magic dust in any class, it&#39;s all publicly known information that&#39;s been digested by many many people before us, and these days you can find umpteen explanations for just about anything online for free.The thing that sorts people is the ability to persevere through technical issues. You&#39;ll find a lot of people in this world are for some reason unable to deal with the mess. This is not a condemnation, I realise everyone has their own situation, economically and personally."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with this article. GitHub Copilot is indeed infringing copyright and not only in a grey zone, but in a very clear black and white fashion that our corporate taskmasters (Microsoft included) have defended as infringement.The legal debate around copyright infringement has always centered around the rights granted by the owner vs the rights appropriated by the user, with the owner&#39;s wants superseding user needs/wants. Any open-source code available on Github is controlled by the copyright notice of the owner granting specific rights to users. Copilot is a commercial product, therefore, Github can only use code that the owners make available for commercial use. Every other instance of code used is a case of copyright infringement, a clear case by Microsoft&#39;s own definition of copyright infringement [1][2].Github (and by extension Microsoft) is gambling on the fact that their license agreement granting them a license to the code in exchange for access to the platform supersedes the individual copyright notices attached to each repo. This is a fine line to walk and will likely not survive in a court of law. They are betting on deep lawyer pockets to see them through this, but are more likely than not to lose this battle. I suspect we will see how this plays out in the coming months.[1] https://www.microsoft.com/info/Cloud.html[2] https://github.com/contact/dmca"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Julia Reda&#39;s analysis depends on the factual claim in this key passage:&gt; In a few cases, Copilot also reproduces short snippets from the training datasets, according to GitHub’s FAQ.&gt; This line of reasoning is dangerous in two respects: On the one hand, it suggests that even reproducing the smallest excerpts of protected works constitutes copyright infringement. This is not the case. Such use is only relevant under copyright law if the excerpt used is in turn original and unique enough to reach the threshold of originality.That analysis may have been reasonable when the post was first written, but subsequent examples seem to show Copilot reproducing far more than the &#34;smallest excerpts&#34; of existing code.  For example, the excerpt from the Quake source code[0] appears to easily meet the standard of originality.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27710287"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On the other hand, the argument that the outputs of GitHub Copilot are derivative works of the training data is based on the assumption that a machine can produce works. This assumption is wrong and counterproductive. Copyright law has only ever applied to intellectual creations – where there is no creator, there is no work. This means that machine-generated code like that of GitHub Copilot is not a work under copyright law at all, so it is not a derivative work either. The output of a machine simply does not qualify for copyright protection – it is in the public domain. That is good news for the open movement and not something that needs fixing.This is very good news. This line of thought implies that we can legally feed all proprietary code into GitHub Copilot in order to teach it all the patented and secret tricks of the companies we can see (since data mining is not copyright infrigement) in order to have it print those secrets back when we ask it to (so they become public domain)./s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Am I the only one who thinks this is kind of petty? It&#39;s not like Audacity is trying to read your email (or even rip off your tracks). The telemetry I&#39;m reading about is literally:1. error reporting - the user has to click a button to share crash logs. It&#39;s basically a macro to help the user create a support ticket.2. version checking - no PII information being kept, literally just helping the developer get an idea of what versions they need to be supporting--you do want them to support the version you&#39;re running, right? Well, if not, you can turn it off.What&#39;s the big deal?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish we could add telemetry to the rr debugger without risking this sort of blowback. We have no idea how many people are using rr, and how much, so when we talk to hardware vendors and other groups we depend on, we have no leverage. This is a real problem.It would be a big boost to free software if some org like Freedesktop had a standard telemetry library, data collection policy, data collection and publication service, and a distro-wide master switch to opt into data collection, and it was socially acceptable to use that framework."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is the problem I see:1. Users enjoy product for free.2. Users pretty much never tell maintainers what is going wrong for them: no messages (much less proper bug reports), no contributions in any way!3. Something invariably goes wrong for users that do the above.4. Users immediately hit social media and try to tar the entire project, developer/company reputation, whatever.  “Zero stars”, doesn’t work in their use case.  You have surely seen these “reviews” before, and mindless tweets.THIS is why I am torn on telemetry to some degree.  IF you demand no auto-feedback in the name of privacy, THEN you should help out voluntarily OR not use free software!  Yet software maintainers can’t count on this at all.  They risk being hanged in the public square for every bug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not sure what I mean fully by this yet, but I want adaptive music like in video games where it evolves and swells based on how much keyboard input is going on.No input? Im reading or idle, so calm down the music.  Lots of typing? Im coding or documenting and need the tempo to pick up and maybe more instruments to join."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am experimenting with trying to go in the opposite direction and not listen to music at all. I mean this in the sense of actively trying to get music out of my life completely.I can&#39;t listen to music and sleep or do anything even vaguely productive. It just takes over. It feels more like an addiction to music than something that adds value to my life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those unfamiliar with Strong Towns, here’s a best-effort summary of what they do:Strong Towns is a non-partisan non-profit that advocates for governments to build financially solvent towns. Many cities are perpetually broke because they owe more money in maintenance burden (fixing roads, pipes, etc) than they bring in through tax revenue.This happens because towns in North America tend to build out large neighborhoods all at once (think: suburbia). At the start, the developers pay for all the infrastructure, and then “give” it to the city to maintain.At first, everything seems fine. The city gets plenty of new tax revenue! But come 20 or 30 years later, it turns out that the tax revenue of the new development is not enough to replace the roads, fix the pipes, and so on.And so to pay for the repairs, the city then builds yet another neighborhood in the same strategy to collect the initial tax revenue and use it to pay for the repairs of the previous neighborhood. It’s effectively a Ponzi scheme (as referenced in the article).The gist is that many low-density spread-out suburban neighborhoods with expensive infrastructure are a huge cost center for a city. And since most North American cities build this way, we have a lot of cities that are “functionally bankrupt” or will be soon.If you&#39;re a systems thinker who lives in a town that can&#39;t seem to fix it&#39;s potholes, you may want to check out the book they&#39;ve published with the same name: &#34;Strong Towns&#34;.(Adapted from a previous Strong Towns post)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Not Just Bikes [1,2,3] YouTube channel also has an excellent series of videos based on work from Strong Towns.  I link to these videos whenever a friend asks why I chose to leave the United States. :)[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfQUOHlAocY

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This ‘Ponzi scheme’ (bond issuance) is the most efficient funding mechanism by far, and is proven to work sustainably within limits.That limit is the marginal point where the expenditure equals the net asset value gain resultant from it, such as real estate prices. How can you know this limit? You can’t, but the bond market can guess at it.Let’s say that you have a nice picket fence suburb with no police department and lots of robberies. You float a bond for your first police officer (not that this will help, but, run with it…). People buy it for nearly the risk-free rate. Why? Because they know that they will get paid back by the next bond, which will also get funded. Now the cop floats a bond for a Lamborghini. The demand is much lower, and the interest is unsustainable, so it doesn’t get funded.Now here’s where it goes wrong. The mayor sees that nobody wants to pay for the Lambo, and solves the problem by packaging it up with everything else. This works for the first Lambo, but they want 10 Lambos, so the bond interest rate is unsustainable.So what now? Taxes. They put a bunch of taxes on the residents, and then tell the investors that the Lambo bond will now get paid by tax revenues, which they have ultimate authority over. Now the calculus is different. The value of the expenditures is almost irrelevant. The only thing that matters is the marginal point where an additional dollar in tax reduces the net asset value by the inverse of the tax rate (e.g. $1 in tax revenue at 1% =&gt; $100 value destroyed). Notice we’re no longer talking about increasing values by large multiples, but destroying value by large multiples.Now the Lambo bond goes out supported by tax revenues. The casual observer might note that the people of the town are now paying the bond holders for their right to exist on the land that they ‘own’. The major innovation from feudalism is that now the peasants actually pay for the land up-front too, and they pay for any improvements on it, and then higher rent for the improved property.But that’s only an illusion of sustainability created by forceful extraction of resources. It’s like a strip-mining operation on middle class wealth. Profits are great until the resource runs out. So what is the solution there? Growth. Bring in more people to extract resources from. This is a requirement of the extractive funding model.Market forces create sustainable economies. Any use of force distorts away from sustainability, toward finite extraction, and extractive models require expansion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So.. I can see that this ML model is generating some code exactly same as the original dataset, which definiately a problem. A defect model, sure. 
Beside that, I cannot understand why the overall idea, using open-source project to train a ML model that generates code would ever be a problem. We human beings are learning as the model, we read others code, books, articles, design patterns... and it becomes part of us. Even the private code, I mean like you join a company, you read their codebase, methodology and it becomes something yours. Copyrights generally not allow you to &#34;copy&#34; the original, but you can still synthesize your own code -- cutting, combination, creating based on whatever you have learnt. 
The method of how a ML model works is differ from human brain for sure, but I cannot see why this would be a problem, or why an organic would become something superior that what they do is a creation and a ML mode is scraping your code. What is the difference here????And also recently we saw GPT that generates articles, waifulabs that generates ... waifus... to be honest I cannot perceive the difference since all of them are &#34;learning&#34; (in a mechanical way of human created knowledge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a genuine question about this whole thing with Copilot:A similar product, TabNine, has been around for years. It does essentially the exact same thing as Copilot, it’s trained on essentially the same dataset, and it gets mentioned in just about every thread on here that talks about AI code generation. (It’s a really cool product btw and I’ve been using and loving it for years).  According to their website they have over 1M active users.Why is this suddenly a huge big deal and why is everyone suddenly freaking out about Copilot?  Is it because it’s GitHub and Microsoft and OpenAI behind Copilot vs some small startup you’ve never heard of?  Is it just that the people freaking out weren’t paying attention and didn’t realize this service already existed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey everyone, I just wanted to chime in and say that GPT-J is incredibly legit. Every aspect of GPT-J is production grade — no difference in process, quality, or results, compared to any other big name research lab.I also want to apologize to Eleuther for giving them a hard time in the past. My earlier concerns were unjustified. To be completely honest, I was jealous they achieved everything I tried to achieve with my own open source research lab attempt. It took a long time to even recognize that jealousy in myself, let alone set it aside. Sorry.The credit for this work goes almost entirely to kindiana, aka Ben Wang. Remember that name; you’ll be seeing a lot of it in the coming decade. It’s clear to me that whichever lab he ends up at (he’s an undergrad! Google let him slip away because he didn’t have a degree!), he’s gonna be changing the world. Don’t know what, don’t know how, know he will.Every aspect of that codebase is immaculate. Most research code is not pretty; this looks carved out of marble and placed in a museum.Without Eleuther’s TPU resources, this work wouldn’t have happened. Tensorfork (my lab) didn’t get access to the TPU VM alpha. And TPU VMs were an absolute necessity here. (TPU VMs are a new thing; they’ve been in alpha since December, but only recently launched. If curious see https://github.com/shawwn/website/blob/master/jaxtpu.md and https://github.com/shawwn/website/blob/master/mlmind.md for why it’s the future of ML.)Eleuther also helped test the model thoroughly. Leo Gao (go follow him: https://twitter.com/nabla_theta?s=21) ran GPT-J through the gauntlet. He was the primary person behind The Pile, the training data that makes any of this possible. I can say with absolute certainty and no hesitation that there are no “gotchas” here.Eleuther’s https://6b.eleuther.ai page looks wonderful too. It’s like a free OpenAI API playground that everyone can try. Keeping it running for months is no small achievement. (Set top_p to 1.0 and temp to 0.8; the defaults are pretty bad.)Congratulations, and thank you everyone for all your hard work. The world is so much better for having access to this level of quality."</p>

I am actually kinda happy with that. I listen to some podcasts and read the news before leaving to get a couple of documents together. I’m going to my mom’s today to have a meeting regarding my eviction notice. My mom still lives with my dad. I can’t ask him to do anything, though, I guess. I was always so used to having to ask for stuff, that I completely forgot I could get people to do what I want for me. My mom, for instance, is not as bad as my dad, and I actually don’t mind asking her to help me with everything. It makes me feel like she loves me. I know that this is a small thing, but it’s something that makes me happy.I get to my mom’s apartment at 5:30. The place is very nice. There is a roof terrace, an elevator that goes up and down (where can you find something like that in an apartment building?!), and all rooms have their own AC units. All of the furniture is in good shape. The appliances were also all upgraded recently, so there is a full washer/dryer, a coff"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The audacity of it! (pun intended) Fork it, call it Audacious and be done with it. There’s no reason for an offline application to collect data “necessary for law enforcement”. We’re already in an age where software is increasingly tilting towards becoming SaaS. We don’t need offline applications to behave as if they’re online or SaaS ones.If this is only about telemetry or analytics, make it an opt-in choice on first run.I wasn’t aware that Audacity had been acquired by The Muse Group recently. [1] I don’t think this will go well for users when private interests and concerns conflict with public ones.The next obvious question would be about equivalent alternatives that are free and open source.[1]: https://www.prosoundnetwork.com/business/audacity-acquired-b..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given how beneficial sci-hub is, there ought to be some way that the scientific community can formally recognise this, as a way of legitimizing her cause.Some ways I can think of:* Get her elected as rector of a university. Contraversial figures are sometimes elected as Rector, at least in the UK, because students are the electorate. However for the same reason this isn&#39;t considered especially prestigious by people who know this.* Fund and create an academic post specifically for her (Ptolomy II Professor of the ethics of copyright strikes me a  a suitably biting title [1])* Nominate her to some well known prize[1] Ptolomy II decreed that any book found in a ship in the port of Alexandria should be copied by the scribes of his library - with or without the permission of the owner.

For those who don&#39;t follow the current situation with Sci-Hub, Alexandra (the creator and likely the sole operator) of Sci-Hub shut down the part of the website (&#34;the magical proxy&#34;) that is responsible for fetching the papers that were not previously retrieved. This was done to comply with the request of the Indian court, as described in the article.As a result, any papers published in 2021 (and some of the rarer, older ones, that nobody tried to access in the past) are not retrievable by Sci-Hub. The user only gets to see a white screen.This is meant to be a temporary measure, but it&#39;s been going on since December of last year (due to various court hearing delays), and the desperation in online communities like the r/scihub subreddit has been palpable [1,2].[1] https://old.reddit.com/r/scihub/comments/o2xb57/how_do_i_eve...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The push for crypto without ecc ram is a nonstop horror show. Software under normal circumstances is remarkably resilient to having its memory corrupted. However crypto algorithms are designed so that a single bit flip effectively changes all the bits in a block. If you chain blocks then a single bit flip in one block destroys all the blocks. I&#39;ve seen companies like msps go out of business because they were doing crypto with consumer hardware. No one thinks it&#39;ll happen to them and once it happens they&#39;re usually too dim to even know what happened. Bit flips aren&#39;t an act of god you simply need a better computer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cosmic-ray bit flipping is real and it has real security concerns. This also makes Intel&#39;s efforts at market segmentation by not having ECC support in any consumer CPUs [1] even more unforgivable and dangerous.Example: bitsquatting on domains [2].[1]: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/linus-torvalds-blame...[2]: https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/08/10/bh-2011-bit-squa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OP here.  Unless you work for a certificate authority or a web browser, this event will have zero impact on you.  While this particular CT log has failed, there are many other CT logs, and certificates are required to be logged to 2-3 different logs (depending on certificate lifetime) so that if a log fails web browsers can rely on one of the other logs to ensure the certificate is publicly logged.This is the 8th log to fail (although the first caused by a bit flip), and log failure has never caused a user-facing certificate error.  The overall CT ecosystem has proven very resilient, even if a bit flip can take out an individual log.(P.S. No one knows if it was really a cosmic ray or not.  But it&#39;s almost certainly a random hardware error rather than a software bug, and cosmic ray is just the informal term people like to use for unexplained hardware bit flips.)"</p>

Given how hostile it is, it seems unlikely we&#39;ll go back anytime soon. These images were really a product of the Cold War where the US focused on Mars.It&#39;s worth noting that Venus is still probably a better terraforming target than Mars [1]. This romantic notion of Mars has rooted itself deeply at this point (eg with Elon Musk) but Mars is basically a more distant and inconvenient Moon. Almost no atmosphere (in fact, just enough because dust storms will occasionally just coat all your equipment), the Sun is weaker and gravity is still very low.Venus&#39;s atmosphere is about 3% nitrogen and 97% CO2. It has about 100x the atmosphere of Earth, which means there&#39;s actually more atmospheric nitrogen than on Earth. And abundant CO2 means oxygen is abundant.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI-old7YI4I"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice to see more professional commercial projects picking up Blender. It helps to see what are the things missing or suboptimal for &#34;expert&#34; users of the system.Blender and OBS Studio are very good examples of FOSS software that are the best at what they do and can easily offer competition to even the commercial alternatives.Most of all their design and UI language is consistent - something very rarely seen in FOSS software.And they have incredible depth of features 90% of which are overkill for the casual user but the experts sure do appreciate them.And the best part is the well-thought of extensibility and API story. Both of them have a very good community of plugins and extensions which add very useful features without feeling out of place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blender has gone from being a tool professionals scoffed at to one that professionals are stressing over themselves to learn by binging tutorials. It is quite the sight, I remember in 2008 wanting to get into game development and being poopooed on forums from picking up blender and instead pirating maya instead. I obviously dropped the idea completely because of it.Idk, I think there might be a larger lesson somewhere in there but regardless it&#39;s amazing to see the shift that has occurred."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blender is a very good piece of software. The main problem I usually have with it is finding documentation. Although the official documentation is fairly good, Blender is a huge program, and it can be hard to find the info you need. Also the documentation is not always up-to-date."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Googler, opinions are my own.I work in payment and idempotency is always a discussion point.  This draft links to one of our docs (though the draft points to a 404 URL, the correct link being[0]).As the draft calls out, Google Standard Payments uses the &#34;requestId&#34; field as our idempontency key, which is part of the request body, rather than in the HTTP header.  We did this specifically to decouple the protocol from the behavior of the request.  We could take the existing definitions and put that payload into any other protocol and it would work without having to use that protocol&#39;s sidechannel data (aka, the HTTP header).Our design makes idempontency part of the application layer, rather than any middlebox or load balancer.[0] https://developers.google.com/standard-payments/guides/conne..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a bit funny to see an IETF draft for this!Adding idempotency support to Stripe&#39;s API was one of the things I built while an intern in 2015. We&#39;ve since rewritten it almost entirely, but many the technical decisions made in 2015 still stand.One of the things that IETF doesn&#39;t specify (&#34;an appropriate response&#34;) is that Stripe&#39;s Idempotency API has a response body has the latest rendering of the resource. Here&#39;s what I mean:  # Set tax exempt status
  curl /v1/customers/cus_AJ6m5vWl7scnn6 \
    -H &#34;Idempotency-Key: aaaaaaaaaa&#34; \
    -d tax_exempt=reverse

  → {id: &#39;cus_AJ6m5vWl7scnn6&#39;, object: &#39;customer&#39;, tax_exempt: &#39;reverse&#39;, ...}

  # An unrelated request sets the customer&#39;s email
  curl /v1/customers/cus_AJ6m5vWl7scnn6 \
    -H &#34;Idempotency-Key: bbbbbbbbbb&#34; \
    -d email=&#39;foo@bar.com&#39;

  # Set tax exempt status with the first idempotency key:
  curl /v1/customers/cus_AJ6m5vWl7scnn6 \
    -H &#34;Idempotency-Key: aaaaaaaaaa&#34; \

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s more appropriate IMO to name it something like &#34;Request-Identifier&#34;. All the client should indicate is that if you get 2 or more POSTs with that same Id, you are free to no-op on any after the 1st successfully handled one.Idempotency is an emergent property of a system so it doesn&#39;t make sense that a client would dictate the key that&#39;s used to provide that behavior. So if the Idempotency-Key is quite likely not to be the actual &#34;Idempotency-Key&#34; in any sufficiently complex system, then don&#39;t name it that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll repeat my comment from nearly seven months ago [1] since it left a really bad taste about how users are dealt with. Nearly a year ago when the initial waves of the pandemic were raging on, Migadu removed its free tier. That&#39;s not a problem by itself because businesses have to make money to sustain and grow. But Migadu gave one month’s notice (contrary to the claims in the replies, that&#39;s what I saw) for users to switch. The replies to the comment also said that the new lowest paid tier was &#34;affordable in every corner of the planet&#34;, which sounded quite ignorant even for a non-pandemic time.Another point, which may matter to some people, is that while Migadu may be a Swiss company, the data centers where the mails are hosted were in France (this was the case at least a year ago). So the situation is somewhat comparable (not entirely though) to Fastmail being an Australian company with data centers in the U.S. being used.For those who want multi-domain email services for a lower (flat) price, look at mxroute. It&#39;s based out of the U.S. though, which may not be an option for people who want certain services outside Five Eyes jurisdictions.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25382626"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ive had a bad enough experience with migadu that I am compelled to actively warn people not to use them (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25054091).Migadu has taught me bargain basement email is too expensive in the long run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their $19 (Micro) Plan lists &#34;200 in/day and 20 out/day&#34;. My email usage, personally, seems to be in bursts. It stays below 1 or 2 outbound mails on most days, however on some days (rarely) there&#39;ll be threaded conversations with &gt;50 outbound mails. So, I feel like it would be fantastic if the plan had monthly limits instead of daily limit. Or some other sort of limit, say EC2 like, which would allow the user to consume the resources in bursts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The quest to come up with a narrative for why Covid happened reminds me of the reporting when Katrina hit New Orleans.  The city&#39;s vulnerability was known beforehand [0] but the inevitable disaster was greeted with shock, confusion, and a search for peripheral explanations.  In the case of the pandemic, our vulnerability to zoonotic viruses and other diseases was also well-known; e.g. [1] was published in 1995.  But again the reporting, as it seems to me anyway, focuses on the particular circumstances of the disaster rather than our fundamental vulnerability.  There is a plentiful supply of unknown microorganisms to fuel the next global health crisis, and we need to expect and prepare for it so that next time we can prevail without great struggle.[0] https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/predicting-katrina/[1] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46722.The_Coming_Plague"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s going to be a ton of comments on the lab security aspects, but there are two other big takeaways from this article:1) Researchers easily found multiple naturally occurring coronaviruses that seemed likely to be able to jump into humans. In fact that is why they were so eager to conduct that lab research: the natural threat seemed imminent.2) The sequence of COVID-19 does not yet resemble any of the sequences associated with the lab research that was being conducted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was a pretty good thread (by an ex-Wikipedia lawyer) on Twitter about the IP meaning of Copilot.https://twitter.com/luis_in_brief/status/1410242882523459585...And this is a longer article about how IP and AI interact:https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-101-issue-2/copyright...I am not a lawyer, but I am capable of summarizing the thoughts of lawyers, so my take is that in general, fair use allows AI to be trained on copyrighted material, and humans who use this AI are not responsible for minor copyright infringement that happens accidentally as a result. However, this has not been tested in court in detail, so the consensus could change, and if you were extremely risk-averse you might want to avoid Copilot.A key quote from the second link:Copyright has concluded that reading by robots doesn’t count. Infringement is for humans only; when computers do it, it’s fair use.Personally, I think law should allow Copilot. As a human, I am allowed to read copyrighted code and learn from it. An AI should be allowed to do the same thing. And nobody cares if my ten-line &#34;how to invert a binary tree&#34; snippet is the same as someone else&#39;s. Nobody is really being hurt when a new tool makes it easier to copy little bits of code from the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve given thousands of hours to open source projects, I really think open source is a pillar of modern society. So you would think I am all for something like copilot, but no.At first I thought this was a great feature, because easier access to code, but after some reflection, I am also very skeptical.I am able to make my code open source, because I can make a living out of it, and I have a lot of open source code that I love to share for things like education or private stuff, but if you want to use it for something real, you need to hire me. If you can suck all the code without even I noticing it, that&#39;s not fair.The other thing is code quality. I don&#39;t want to sound rude, but there are tons of bad code around. Not necessarily because the author is unskilled, but because the code might not need to be high quality (for example I wrote a script to sort my photos, it was very hastily written and specific to my usage, I used once and was done with it). Also, there are some bad/wrong pattern that are really popular.I am surprised you are able to DMCA a twitch stream because someone whistle india jones theme but in this case it is considered fair use."</p>

I think he in on hn as well ( @SQLite).One interesting thing I found about how SQLite is developed is the amount of testing that is done. Between unit tests and parameterized tests and fuzzer tests they are doing billions of tests per release and spending days running them before each release. I know I don&#39;t like to wait for a long CI build before I deploy a service but something like SQLite needs whole different category of resilience."</p>

I want to control that myself, and so I&#39;m going to go through a lot of pain and a lot of work and a lot of effort to come up with some solution that I can control myself.

It is possible to fault Postgres, but we were very impressed.This is impressive for Postgres.SQLite is incredible.

Like the fact that Genrich Altshuller did not want his teaching to carry on once he dies, but fan groups of engineers existed until the fall of the Soviet union when many of their members emigrated and continued the TIPS cult following, selling  courses and software to large enterprises (Dassault, Lockheed Martin and the likes)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Ryokan that they mention he always stayed at is apparently very good: 
https://www.annees-de-pelerinage.com/tawaraya-ryokan-review-...&#34;Concierge service at the breakfast table is good, but the story goes on. On my way out one of the porters silently approached me and said: “Schwarze-sama, we checked the weather forecast and there will be rain this evening. So here is an umbrella to take along. Also, we took the liberty of reserving a table at that restaurant you wanted to go. Oh and last thing: here is a city plan for you where we already detailed down the way to Fushimi Inari.” It goes without saying that the guy responsible for my shoes already set out my hiking shoes and not one of my city or evening shoes. Even he knew of my plans.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple during Steve Jobs era felt very much as his interpretation of Japanese Culture and Zen Buddhism. Everything from Product Design to Apple Store and Services. The only thing that Japanese dont get ( and they somehow still dont ) is Software.Tim Cook first visit to Japan was in 2016 for business reasons. So I am going to say he has very little understanding of Japanese Zen culture, everything Steve took and put it into Apple.Very unfortunate Tim Cook&#39;s Apple is nothing like Steve Jobs&#39; Apple.  It tuns out &#34;Taste&#34; and &#34;Editor&#34; is such a rare and unique skill set."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;The companies were losing money and employees trying to satisfy Amazon and their constant abusive changes,” Tom Rask, an attorney for Last Mile and Triton, told Motherboard. &#34;You have to hire numerous drivers who may or may not be working. One day Amazon dictates that you have thirty routes, the next day forty, then the day after twenty. You’re supposed to have enough drivers for back-up while Amazon is lowering pay. Amazon’s actions are unlawful.&#34;Sounds miserable. Id shut down too if I was losing money with only 1 client.If this were freelancing it’d be like having to be always available for one client 40 hrs a week, but not knowing if you’ll get to bill 5 hrs or 50… while your rates constantly decrease. There’s no point in having this business"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is more or less how it should be. If Amazon isn&#39;t going to offer a good enough deal, then companies shouldn&#39;t move packages for them. As more and more people figure it out, other delivery companies will stop working with Amazon as well, although it may be that the deals work out better in places with lower cost-of-living, easier delivery routes (due to climate, geography, etc.), or other advantages.If some other delivery company can figure out how to make it work economically, then they can do the work instead.If nobody is interested in trying to make it work, Amazon will have to either improve the deal it offers or go back to using FedEx/UPS/USPS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I guess I never really paid attention to the details behind all the Amazon headlines I see.&#34;In April, Amazon announced it would reduce the amount it paid for drivers from $17.25 to $16.00 an hour, according to the letter...Weeks later, Amazon announced a series of raises for its drivers around the country as part of a public relations push following a union drive at an Amazon warehouse&#34;&#34;Currently, Amazon delivery drivers are expected to deliver upwards of 400 packages a day on 10-hour routes that often extend up to 12 hours.&#34;400 seems crazy, I wondered about UPS. According to Google &#34;At UPS, the average driver makes about 120 deliveries per day, says Jack Levis, the shipping giant&#39;s director of process management&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Robinhood closed my brokerage account after I did transferred out assets (via ACATS transfer, to get a signup bonus with another brokerage without realizing capital gains).A few months later I asked how to reopen the account, using the &#34;reopen account&#34; form in their app to generate a support ticket. Three weeks later they sent an email saying that my account was permanently closed and I should apply for a new account. Replies to this email yielded a response saying that their email server was failing to accepting messages.So as requested I applied for a new account; the application stayed pending for three weeks, then I got an email autoreply telling me that my application is denied because I have a preexisting account (i.e. the old closed one). Replies to this email also yielded a response saying that their email server was failing to accepting messages.I filed a new support case explaining what had happened, what they told me to do, and asking what I should do next. No reply whatsoever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand that many give Robinhood crap because it is not &#34;sophisticated enough&#34; or because of the Gamestop fiasco. Although many startups like to claim that they are &#34;democratizing [x]&#34;, I honestly believe they did it. I have many friends that never traded before, and after they got their Robinhood account they feel comfortable enough to do it often. Even myself, who used to only trade a couple of times a year, started with $300 in my Robinhood account a few years back. Now I have at least ~60k that I rotate around in my Robinhood account on a daily/weekly basis. Yes there are other services that I now use or other apps that seems better, but for all intents and purposes, Robinhood did &#34;democratize&#34; trading for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember seeing their first public demo at LA Hacks in 2014. Seemed like a couple of kids right out of college. They had the iPhone&#39;s screen hooked up to the projector and one of their friends kept sending them silly text messages the whole time that they had to dismiss. This was before the Do Not Disturb feature came out.I remember wondering how it took so long for someone to make a half decent stock trading app for the iPhone -- all the other apps at the time sucked (and they largely still do). I was on ETrade before but signed up for the Robinhood waitlist immediately -- haven&#39;t left since being allowed in early 2015."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They&#39;re all strangely intention-less on every imaginable level. That can be unsettling.I&#39;ve listened to, and made, a lot of music like that. When I want to relax or think, I like music that engages me in some way but has a sort of drift, an ambient (in the Eno sense) quality even if it&#39;s slamming Berlin techno. It&#39;s different from the prog-rock I grew up with, which was difficult and loaded with intentionality.I ended up experimenting with music that was more generative, doing pretty sophisticated things with a degree of structure but without intentionality: always a random factor, a journey to an unknown goal (typical end result: wandering around for a while)AI art is like that. We see it wandering around for a while. It&#39;s getting better at picking up the trappings of identity, but persistently lacks intentionality.Maybe the trick is to supply the intentionality instead of the identity? Instead of &#39;creepy moat&#39;, a visual identity, make it do a painting of &#34;you are not going to survive and that&#39;s good&#34; or &#34;thank you but I am not worthy&#34;.If you have to feed it words, get a poet, don&#39;t describe the picture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting. There is a principle with a lot of modern, abstract art, which is that the work is not complete until the viewer sees it - that is to say, the observer brings a portion of the meaning to the work. This AI art seems to go one step further, there isn&#39;t really an artist anymore, in the traditional sense. The creator of the work is more like an observer - choosing which output they like best. The &#34;artist&#34; becomes a consumer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not sure how to say this best, it probably sounds negative but I don’t mean it that way. It is really interesting because using these tools abstracts away the talent/skills part of creating art - you say your idea, and get the computer to keep showing you completed pieces until you find what you meant, or at least something you found interesting. It reminds me a bit of the role of the DJ to do the searching and curating, but not actually create the music.In fact you could imagine a musical version of this where the operator is describing feelings or styles and the AI is generating music to match where the operator wants to go."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started seeing the value of this ideology recently. I have a really strict routine before I write a single line of code on a complex issue. All of these ways of thinking ultimately came out of efficiency gains I learned on my own in the kitchen. Prepare, then work. Trying to prepare while you work is chaos (but sometimes essential).The very first thing I do after finishing a design review narrative is to type up a list of discrete tasks that I plan to execute. These don&#39;t necessarily say what to do line-by-line, but draw out a very clear picture of what code areas are edited and what the dependency graphs look like. These also highlight specific configuration or other UX points to reference during testing. These task lists are specific enough that other developers could reliably execute them without any additional guidance.Then, I take a short break and review my task list when I return. 9/10 times I find I want to tweak it a little bit.After the final confirmation, I sent notification out to my team that I intend to execute the task listing so they have a super clear idea of what functionality to expect on the other side.I have found that this reduces my anxiety/stress by orders of magnitude throughout the day. Starting with visual studio and fumbling around various parts of the code base might be a good way to get your brain warmed up in the morning, but its certainly not a rational way to go about solving a complex problem.For trivial issues, production RCAs, etc., the process is certainly a little bit more streamlined than what I note above. This is more about how to do work on big tasks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This may seem obsessive-compulsive to others but the way I work on the computer, I close everything that I’m not immediately working on. No extra tabs, no bystander applications. I keep my desktop completely plain so that the only files I see are the ones I just produced/downloaded.I would rather go through the pain of reopening apps/websites than to have it lingering when I don’t need it right then.I don’t understand how people can have multiple windows of multiple browsers with multiple tabs open about things they aren’t working on while they work. The visual clutter overwhelms me quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Because of this brutal reality (In cooking, a dish that is 99% finished has zero value), chefs must adopt a “finishing mindset.”Perfect is the enemy of Done.It hurts me to read this and to think of people adopting a &#34;finishing mindset&#34; while also trying to get behind:(1) planning is prime(2) arranging spaces and perfecting movements(3) cleaning as you go(4) making first moves(5) finishing actions(6) slowing down to speed up(7) call and callback(8) open ears and eyes(9) inspect and correct(10) total utilizationhttps://books.google.com/books?id=l8tUCwAAQBAJ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the most unfortunate things in the past 6 years is that support of Julian Assange and Wikileaks became a partisan issue purely because they exposed corruption in your favorite political party.It&#39;s hard to put a finger on just how much the current form of western democracy differs from the 18th century ideal of western democracy. Let this concretize it: Global western &#34;democracy&#34; conspires to put the single most hard-hitting journalist of the past decade in jail indefinitely on fictitious charges and virtually nobody cares. Where are the protests? Where is the outrage? Do most Americans even know who Julian Assange is?&#34;Fascism&#34; gets thrown around a lot and I know it feels a bit overplayed, and I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re there yet, but when most people are apathetic and the remainder form their opinion based entirely on their political faction, it&#39;s hard for me to believe that fascism isn&#39;t inevitable. After all, what is fascism about if it&#39;s not &#39;party firmly over principle&#39;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The really startling thing is ... considering how effective this technique is with the internet it must have been nearly flawless prior to about 2015 when most of the world didn&#39;t have access to the internet.What we&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t so much an elite group controlling the narrative as an elite group who used to be able to control the narrative and now can&#39;t patch over the rough spots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think Sigurdur Ingi Thordarson is a &#34;key witness&#34; in the claims against Assange. He might be A witness, but I very much doubt the charges rely on his testimony. As far as the media goes, most people don&#39;t care about Assange as much as the conspiracy crowd. And some of the comments here are verging on very conspiratorial."</p>

That said, I want to comment on one of the listed drawbacks:&gt; Occasionally, obscure email servers will block emails sent through usI have a few years of experience running my own email server and I can tell you this is a major pain in the ass. When you send your email via a small email server (a server that sends a low volume of email), you will have constant issues getting mail delivered. Also, most of the issues will not be with obscure email servers, they will be with Outlook and Gmail. When you send email, you will never know if your email will be delivered to inbox, delivered to spam folder, or blackholed entirely.Related:&gt; We&#39;re not a suitable platform for sending marketing emails (although you should use a dedicated marketing platform anyway).Please explicitly ban people from using your platform to send &#34;marketing email&#34;. Clients like that are going to ruin deliverability for your other clients."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An issue with desalination systems of this type (that have water vapor in a carrier gas, so called HDH or Humidification-Dehumidification desalination systems) is the retardation of mass transfer to the cold surface by the carrier gas.  Multieffect distillation (MED) systems usually operate without a carrier gas for this reason, but this means they operate below atmospheric pressure, so they have to be sturdy to resist pressure loads.A few years ago, some people at MIT solved this problem with a bubble heat exchanger: the humidified carrier gas is bubbled up through trays of water (at progressively lower temperatures).  The surfaces of the bubbles provide a very large surface area for heat/mass transfer.https://news.mit.edu/2013/produced-water-cleanup-0205
https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/86334
http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/papers/reviews/HDH-Desalinat...Some of those involved went on to form a company to commercialize the technology, which has been used to recycle/purify brine from natural gas wells and other industrial tasks.   I think they ended up being bought out after several years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those curious what the 385% refers to&gt; the team’s demonstration device can achieve an overall efficiency of 385 percent in converting the energy of sunlight into the energy of water evaporation.Honestly I still don&#39;t know what that means, or how efficiency can be over 100%."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FTA: &#34;Unlike some desalination systems, there is no accumulation of salt or concentrated brines to be disposed of. In a free-floating configuration, any salt that accumulates during the day would simply be carried back out at night through the wicking material and back into the seawater, according to the researchers.&#34;The capabilities are freaking interesting, but let&#39;s say someone builds a big enough settlement on a coastline or island in which every building has one or more of these devices on its rooftop. Would this release back enough salt so that the surrounding seawater becomes hostile to its previous lifeforms? Also, since then the water used in the process would contain more salt, how much would that render the device less efficient?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just tried it on my kids&#39; Legos. I made two scans, one per box: it found ~2500 bricks, which I think is a very high hit rate.
However, the build suggestions are very, very lacking. For reference, my kids are 8 and 4.
The builds proposed are very simple, small, and still mention missing pieces (probably related to colors, which honestly most kids don&#39;t care about).
I think my 8yo would like it, she tends to build &#34;worlds&#34;, assembling many related contraption that each are fairly simple and match the themes found on suggestions.As for my 4yo, forget it. He is a builder, making very elaborate and complex constructions, the bigger the better. He would find suggestions absolutely uninteresting.
I didn&#39;t try to scan Technic legos (which he is fond of and make astonishingly complex contraption given his age). But it&#39;s an even more complex problem to solve.I suspect work on the app was focused on recognition, which honestly is impressive. The second part, finding models, maybe need a bit of work ?
I would recommend at least having an option to &#34;ignore color&#34;: it&#39;s nice to have a build that looks good, but overall most kids - including myself - like to build first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever I got a new Lego set, I built it once, using the manual and then would take it apart, a day or two later. For the bricks to be absorbed into my pile and let me build something new, better. Something I had imagined myself.For me there are definitely two kinds of Lego users. Those who struggle with the building instructions. For them following these is almost meditative.
Then there are those who don&#39;t and who have their own ideas. They will skim through the instructions and build the set once (if at all). And in general just welcome the addition of (new) bricks.For me the resp. set served mostly as fuel for my imagination. If it was a spaceship, the next thing I would build was one. Just not the one in the set.My dad built me a chest of drawers with lots of boxes for sorting Legos. And sorted them for me when he gave it to me as a present, for my 5th b-day. It was almost as tall as me at the time. I.e. I could just open and peek into the top drawer.He also told me why it was important to sort the bricks again, after I deconstructed my opi:I could let my imagination run free and find the bricks I needed quickly when building my next piece.Before, when they were all a pile in a big box, very often the creative flow was killed by the annoyance of searching a pile of bricks for the one I needed. You start building something and eventually you just stop.This thing looks like a tool for people who lack both. Sorted Legos and imagination."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve tried it this week and it&#39;s really cool to see it process a big batch of bricks.I was a bit disappointed by the suggested builds, because they&#39;re small, but I also understand it&#39;s early on and a difficult thing to do.Not vital, but I was surprised that it doesn&#39;t look for colors at all.One thing I&#39;d love is the same technology, but used to look for a particular part. It does that once you pick a build, but imagine building your own thing rather than suggestions and having the app tell you where you can find the piece you&#39;re looking for. If you&#39;re adventurous, you would even have a custom tray with a spotlight directed at your pile :)I&#39;ve been trying to take thousands of mixed parts back into their original sets and I was hoping this might be helpful. The technology itself probably would, but not packaged as it is for the moment.All that being said: really well done!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Could someone spell out a use case for this? One that comes to mind would be validating that a mailing list doesn&#39;t have any outdated email addresses in it, but couldn&#39;t that be determined by just checking for a bounce when a message is sent to it?I tried to sign up for SiriusXM the other day, and though I could create an account with my .pro email address, I couldn&#39;t actually sign up for service with that same address for some reason. It&#39;s frustrating that validating email addresses is still something that people get so wrong. Please just take whatever seeming garbage I&#39;ve entered into your email address field and try to send a message to it.(Their site also had stupid password generation rules such that I couldn&#39;t use the 21-character one my password manager auto-generated, but even after I made one that followed the rules on the page, it was still rejected because there were apparently rules on the back end that weren&#39;t spelled out in the front end. Please hire me, SiriusXM.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The accepts_mail test seems flawed; a domain with no MX records can still accept mail (the spec requires an MTA to connect to the IP address in the A/AAAA record of the domain part of the mail address in this case).All MTAs that I’m aware of support this, and it’s moderately common on personal domains with a single self-hosted MX, rare as those are these days."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, the built in LSP is a mixed bag. Getting language servers configured is a breeze, diagnostics and go-to definition work just fine. But trying to get autocomplete and snippets to work is an exercise in frustration. There&#39;s a handful of different hobbyist implementations which are all somewhat-maintained and somewhat work together but it&#39;s buggy and you end up needing to do 20x the effort of using VS code to get not quite the same ease of use.I really hope they&#39;ll do some official work on lua-based solutions for autocomplete and code snippets in the future to really round out the LSP support, if that&#39;s something that they want to highlight as a feature of neovim. I still think VS code is the way to go if you want LSP features, but 0.5 is a terrific step forward and everyone who worked on it should be very proud."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those out there trying to &#34;learn&#34; vim, give neovim 0.5 a try!I&#39;ve been using neovim HEAD (0.5 pre-release) for a while and it has been awesome. It all started with this config [0] and from there and haven&#39;t tried (as before) to join a vim cult but instead to use it as a tool that works for me (i.e. use mouse scroll to browse around, use arrows on insert mode, and other vim sins)Little by little I&#39;ve been looking at how I could do something a little better and pretty much every time vim has an awesome way for me to do something! Yanked some text then deleted something but I want to paste the yanked text, not the deleted one? &#34;0p is the answer. Need to replace all ___ but not modify the prefixed numbers? I can use visual regex to easily work that out! I&#39;m doing something over and over? I can make that into a macro! There&#39;s a macro that I always use on certain file types? I can make an autocmd to load some string to some macro when I open certain file.It&#39;a awesome feeling that time I&#39;ve actually learning about registers, macros, regex, windows, buffers, and everything else in a modern and snappy tool![0] https://github.com/mjlbach/defaults.nvim"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the biggest tragedies isn&#39;t just that the childhood is wasted, but that many people never learn to have agency once it is available. I&#39;m not saying you need to start your own business or anything like that, but it seems like most people live their lives never questioning the scripts that are given to them.The basic life script we all seem to have in western society seems pretty awful when you think critically about it. Essentially we waste all out vitality and youth making other people rich, so that one day when we&#39;re old and infirm, we can finally do the things we like with the short time we have left. I think most of us never even think about it because it&#39;s too bleak of a reality. I feel somewhat fortunate in that the work I do is something I would generally enjoy doing even if I wasn&#39;t being paid for it, but I still have a nagging fear that what I could be is much more than what I am yet I lack the proper tools and perspectives to become that person (and I don&#39;t think that just starting my own business, like a lot of people here want to do, is really sufficient, it&#39;s just a small part of inventing your own life script)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article did a great job of articulating something I&#39;ve always felt strongly about but haven&#39;t been able to put into words.I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who felt like my schooling was mostly a giant waste of my time and energy.I was waaaay ahead in subjects I liked, because those things I learned myself out of innate interest. Rather than the system accommodating and encouraging being ahead, in those subjects I was held back and forced to sit through material I already knew, because &#34;in year x we learn this and in year y we learn that&#34;. Don&#39;t get ahead. Zero agency.In other subjects that didn&#39;t interest me, I was forced to sit through stuff only to forget everything I &#34;learned&#34; soon after.It really begs the question, what&#39;s the point? And while I&#39;m no genius at anything, surely a system like this will kill many, many actual geniuses, just like the article says."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the article is that it only uses examples of extra ordinary people.Most people are not geniuses, they are average. 
You are not a genius.Most people who flunk out or drop out of school
do not become billionaires and neither will you.Most people who decide to give it their all and become
various forms of artists will never be famous, noticed 
no wealty or admired (Though on a nano scale you may have people who do)By a large margin most restaurants / startups fail.
You are not going to create the next unicorn.yes this is not 100% accurate because it does happen.
Much like buying a lotto ticket. 
People do win.But you will not. (Almost entirely certain but again some do win).People like Lonardo da Vinci are 1 in a billion. 
Maybe one in 2 billion.People like Jobs and Zuckerberg are a lot more common. 
There are maybe 1000? 10.000? 
If we say 100.000 that is about 0.0013% of the world
population. 
You are not in the 0.0013% (2019 estimate)(Though you really need take into account the privilege accorded people based. on where they live, where they were born, family. If you win the lottery and grow up in a wealty educated country, you have a HUGE advantage.Much like buying 1 lottery ticket drastically increases you chance of winning.The point being nearly all people fail to be special. 
They will not be remembered by the grater society after their death. They will have made no huge impact on the world.  They will never make it big.Thus we should not focus our choices in life my making a few of the same choices that are advantageous for 1 in a billion.We should not set our goals to achieve what they did.We should focus on having a nice life, a good set of friends, enough money to live ok, having interesting hobbies
Having a job that is ok. A safe and dry place to live.
Have some love.We should expect and respect that we will be average
That is not a failure. That is what most likely will
happen.So set out to make the most of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See also the leak[1] of big oil PR maestro Rick Berman&#39;s 2014 speech to oil execs, pleading for funds to combat rational debate and reliable information about fracking.“Think of this as an endless war,” he told them. “And you have to budget for it.”&gt; He said the industry needs to dig up embarrassing tidbits about environmentalists and liberal celebrities, exploit the public’s short attention span for scientific debate, and play on people’s emotions.&gt; “Fear and anger have to be a part of this campaign,” Berman said. “We’re not going to get people to like the oil and gas industry over the next few months.”&gt; Berman also advised that executives continue to spend big. “I think $2 to $3 million would be a game changer,” he said. “We’ve had six-figure contributions to date from a few companies in this room to help us get to where we are.”&gt; But always cover your tracks, he suggested, adding that no-one is better equipped at doing so than his firm. “We run all this stuff through nonprofit organizations that are insulated from having to disclose donors. There is total anonymity,” he said. “People don’t know who supports us. We’ve been doing this for 20-something years in this regard.” [2]Plenty more in the transcript at [1], and the article at [2]!1: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/politics/pr-executives...2: https://www.desmog.com/2014/10/31/oil-and-gas-industry-s-end..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago, I got to see an Exxon &#34;Legislative Affairs Coordinator&#34; speak to a group of small landowners about how they could make their own lobbying efforts more effective.In less than 10min this lady had the crowd ready to burn her at the stake.She told them things like &#34;your voice doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; urged them to donate all the money they could to Exxon&#39;s lobbying efforts (with unspecified goals), on the basis that at least it would get something done, even if it wasn&#39;t what they wanted. &#34;Donate to our people, and our people will take care of you.&#34;Then, she told them that actual grass-roots organizations like theirs were socially dangerous, because they wouldn&#39;t stick to their original mission but inevitably became cults, essentially. Something like &#34;the best thing this organization can do, today, is vote to dissolve immediately&#34;All this was in exchange for a several thousand dollar speaking fee, which was the largest expense behind the venue for the event."</p>

Once again, the rich are insulated from the consequences of their greed, while the poorest suffer the most. It&#39;s high time those who sold us out should have to answer for their actions. Something on the order of seven billion counts of reckless endangerment should do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think i’ve got a slightly different take - i’m not saying my take is any better though.If we’re talking engineering principles, not team dynamics, then it’s:  1. Use immutability by default, even in languages that make that harder than it should be
  2. Understand how liberating idempotency is
  3. Divide and conquer, use abstraction to make hard problems manageable
  4. Delete code, delete tests, re-write stuff, re-write it again. Painful? Keep doing this till you get to the other side and feel liberation and empowerment, took me years to get past wincing at the idea of re-writing that thing AGAIN
  5. Pay attention to your build tooling - to do any given task, it should always take exactly 1 command. How do i run the tests? Run the test command. How do i deploy to non-prod? Run the deploy command. Etc

If we’re talking softer stuff:  1. Don’t block collaboration - e.g. if there are 5 people don’t work on 5 tasks concurrently. Work on 1, maybe 2 in some cases
  2. Accomodate 2 types of work: work that needs collaboration &amp; synchronisation (brain storming, planning, why are we even doing this, that kinda thing) work that needs focus time - sometimes that’s focus as an individual, sometimes that’s a mob focussed on one task and saying no to every other distraction in the world no matter how “urgent”
  3. Change what you’re doing throughout the day, don’t try to code all day, you’ll get in a rut, you won’t write your best code after a while. You can optimise this step, e.g. if the team is low energy after lunchtime, use that to your advantage and schedule the easy boring work then, don’t be afraid to use humour or burn low energy time just getting to know each other better
  4. Make sure people are being heard in the team. Hardest point to get right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like a lot of these principles but there is a crucial element missing from this presentation and that is time.As a company grows the importance of each of these principles changes. As a project within an established company grows a similar maturation happens.If you tried to adhere to all &#39;best practices&#39; (principles or not) from day 1 of a project you&#39;d be carrying a lot of weight that could crush otherwise good ideas.Some principles, when presented without a timeline, seem contradictory and that can lead to fights on teams where developers are well meaning but less experienced.I&#39;m encouraged that this presentation includes dimensions along which you can slice the principles, but I encourage the authors to adopt a &#34;stage&#34; dimension as well that helps focus devs/learners on principles appropriate for 1. The stage they are in and 2. The immediate next stage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh wow, author here - I wasn&#39;t quite expecting this to appear here today. I&#39;ve only really just start talking to people about it.That said, my mission is to make software engineering better for everyone. By capturing the best principles from the best in the world at what they do. And to organise and share that knowledge, freely.It&#39;s currently missing features to organise principles well, but I&#39;m working on it (discussion here: https://github.com/PrinciplesDotDev/principles/discussions/2...)You can reach me through my profile or following me on @princples_dev (twitter) - I&#39;ve only starting pushing this, but a lot more will be coming soon.It&#39;s an open source project and it needs your principles to make this a reality so if you&#39;ve got some to share, please do. Or if you have feedback, leave it here. I&#39;m building it for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When it comes to the problem of targeting, one interesting and promising tech is photochemical internalisation [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemical_internalizatio...], where you put the mRNA inside photosensitive molecules (and not lipids) and then shine some light on the tissue/organ where you want the mRNA delivered. Where activated by the light, the molecules then enter the cells, dissolves and deliver the mRNA.
The Norwegian company PCI Biotech has a tech they call fimaNAc for doing this with naked mRNA.https://www.pcibiotech.no/nucleicacidsThis presentation has a lot of illustrations and explanations:https://www.pcibiotech.no/s/PCI-Biotech-SMi-RNA-Therapeutics..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a long essay about the same topic and came to similar conclusions as Derek Lowe: https://trevorklee.com/are-mrna-therapies-the-future-of-phar...One thing that I&#39;d like to emphasize is how unbelievably tiny mRNA therapeutics have to be. It&#39;s probably around 30 mg, and it&#39;s hard to do it more than once every few weeks, at least judging by siRNA therapeutics (which have similar immune issues).30 mg is really tiny. It&#39;s hard to come up with a meaningful therapeutic in such a small amount of material. People have been hyping up self-replicating mRNA as a solution, but that&#39;s still in its infancy, and has its own problems regarding the &#34;compilers&#34;/polymerases that need to be packaged with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sort of mRNA work isn’t immune-driven at all, in theory, and if you need your target cells to keep producing your desired protein, you’re going to have to keep telling them that by sending them more mRNA. Once a day? Once a week? Who knows? That’ll need to be worked out by experiment.This doesn&#39;t seem like a problem from the point of view of those who are in the business of selling mRNA :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting article for two reasons, how the practice originated and what it implies.The practice seems to be somewhat wide spread (in the distance between departments case). That might be because it came from a Facebook group or forum where Law Enforcement officers exchange tips. The second is the choice of artist (Swift) who has been in a pretty visible battle with ownership of her music. I suspect that if the officers who use this technique thought about it, they might find that using Disney tunes would be more effective in terms of triggering DMCA takedowns.What it implies, and is explicitly stated in the referenced video, is that a law enforcement officer is explicitly attempting to deny you your 1st Amendment right (as adjudicated by the courts). While the doctrine of qualified
immunity would likely shield them from prosecution, it is still a violation of your civil rights and should certainly merit disciplinary action on the part of the police department."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This house is 375 sq ft and uses low end materials, and it doesn&#39;t include setup, so it&#39;s going to cost ~$100k, or $266 / sq ft. Most new home construction is more like $150 / sq ft. And with this system, you&#39;re very limited in what you can build.Who&#39;s the target customer for this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish some of these interior designers would check out European or Japanese apartments for the layout. You could do a lot better (and I would never want to have to use the sink proposed in that clip on a day-to-day basis). That A/C location is just plain wrong (the kitchen is where you&#39;ll spend the least time).  And that shelf splitting the living room + the bedroom? What?Meanwhile you have like... storage for plates for 20 people as if you could ever feed more than 3 people at once. And that double-door fridge... I imagine that if you&#39;re in a more rural area it&#39;s more necessary but there&#39;s a lot better choices here if you are actually trying to make a livable space, instead of a place that offers good shots.
This looks a lot like a &#34;set up your own AirBnB&#34; thing. So much so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if AirBnB made a strategic investment in this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I purchased one of these computers for my child. It made a loud buzzing noise and turned off last week. I discovered the locked BIOS for myself when I tried to boot from a USB to diagnose the problem. Acer wants $619.99 to diagnose it at their repair center, since it is 2 weeks out of warranty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He explained that all computer vendors do this to one extent to another, such as Apple with iPhones, and refused to provide me any means to unlock it no matter how technical I am.I bought a Razer Blade 15 two weeks ago during Amazon sales - once arrived I opened it and upgraded the SSD from 256GBytes to 1TBytes without any issue, and it works really good on Arch...So, Acer, not all computer vendors are doing this shit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before we all grab our pitchforks, maybe we should take a moment and realize that this is a single review on Amazon that&#39;s lacking in important details. The headline here reads &#34;Acer disables BIOS for laptops sold through Amazon&#34;, but the review mentions that they&#39;re able to get into the BIOS. They&#39;re only unable to change the boot order, which is a lot different from &#34;disables BIOS&#34;. Furthermore, I don&#39;t entirely understand why the reviewer tried to get a refund from Acer when they purchased it from Amazon. I bet there&#39;s a non-nefarious explanation for the disabled setting that the reviewer saw. Sadly with a $1,530 cost, I don&#39;t expect anyone here to buy the laptop just for research purposes!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Guess I&#39;d better say a few things.First, I deeply appreciate that so many on Hacker News have come out for this.  Enough to awaken me from a sound sleep on a Tuesday evening!I don&#39;t really care that much about selling Klein bottles over Amazon - it&#39;s mainly to reach parents over the holidays.  But I do wish that Amazon would do something about this kind of thing.Finally, I&#34;m very low on stocks of glass Klein bottles. It&#39;s weird for me to ask my friends not to buy the things I&#39;ve worked so hard to make, but I guess I&#39;d better.  I hope to have more manifolds in mid to late summer.Warm wishes all around,-Cliff (way late on a cloudy Tuesday evening in Oakland)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That sucks. Nice write-up of how this scam works, I wasn&#39;t aware of the details previously.Also, if anyone is unaware, this is this Clifford Stoll: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stoll - who wrote this brilliant (and true) book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg_(book) - which is a really good read and perfect for HN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is ironic is that there is an annual Award given to an AWS employee called the Cliff Stoll Award: For those individuals who see something suspicious, not working as expected, show ownership and drive it to resolution. As Cliff did to find a KGB spy, and documented in &#34;The Cuckoo&#39;s Egg&#34;.I wonder what would happen if someone at Amazon pulled on this thread and not only solved Cliff&#39;s problem but also the root cause that enables this kind of product hijacking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One interesting aspect, that I thing will make it difficult for GitHub to argue and justify its not a a license violation 
would be the answer to the following question: Was Copilot trained using Microsoft internal source code or will it be 
in the future ?As GitHub is a Microsoft company and OpenAI although 
a non-profit just got a massive one billion investment 
from Microsoft (presumably not for free), will it
start spitting out once in a while Windows kernel code ? :-)And if it was NOT trained on Microsoft source code, because it could starting suggesting some of it...Is that not a validation that the results it produces are a derivative 
work based on the work of the open source code corpus it was trained on ?  IANAL..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I think a large part of the value add of machine learning is going to be the ability for huge entities to launder intellectual property violations.As an example, my grandfather (an old school EE who got his start on radar systems in the 50s, who then got his radiology MD when my jewish grandmother berated him enough with &#34;engineer&#39;s not doctor though...&#34;) has some really cool patents around highlighting interesting parts of the frequency domain in MRIs that should make detection of cancer a whole lot easier.  As an implementation he did a bunch of tensor calculus by hand to extract and highlight those features because he&#39;s an incredibly smart old school EE with 70 years experience cranking that kind of thing out with only his trusty slide rule.  He hasn&#39;t gotten any uptake from MRI manufacturers, but they&#39;re all suddenly really into recurrent machine learning models to highlight the same sorts of stuff.  Part of me wants to tell him to try selling it as a machine learning model and just obfuscate the fact that the model was carefully hand written rather than back propagated.I&#39;m personally pretty anti intellectual property (at least how it&#39;s implemented in the states), but a system where large entities that have the capital investment to compute the large ML models can launder IP violations, but little guys get stuck to the letter of the law certainly seems like the worst of both worlds to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see the point of this tool, independent of the resulting code being derivative of GPL code or not.being able to produce valid code is not the bottleneck of any developer effort.  no projects fail because code can&#39;t be typed quickly enough.the bottleneck is understanding how the code works, how to design things correctly, how to make changes in accordance with the existing design, how to troubleshoot existing code, etc.this tool doesn&#39;t make anything any easier!  it makes things harder, because now you have running software that was written by no one and is understood by no one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work at Code for America on the Tax Benefits team, and we&#39;re working on a different website to apply for the Child Tax Credit. (See https://www.getctc.org/ and https://www.getyourrefund.org/. )
From the original article:
&gt; Alas, all [People&#39;s Policy Project&#39;s website] can do is funnel users into Intuit&#39;s terrible [child tax credit] site.
Today at work, I&#39;m learning how to use the IRS&#39;s e-File SOAP API in the hopes that we can build a flow that is easier to use than Intuit&#39;s.
Feel free to subscribe to our newsletter. :) https://info.codeforamerica.org/newsletter
See also https://www.codeforamerica.org/news/meet-code-for-americas-n... for how we&#39;re thinking about this work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intuit is consistently one of the least ethical actors in tech. They have a monopoly position in many of their products and take advantage of some of the poorest people through misinformation and lobbying.Facebook &amp; Uber have received most of the heat over the past few years. Intuit has strangely avoided the same level of scrutiny."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s telling is that TurboTax&#39;s UX is really, really, good, deceptive pricing aside. Like, so good I almost enjoy using it to do my taxes.The very fact that Intuit has clearly invested money into making a beautiful interface for a tax program, a program that people use once a year, just goes to show how profitable the current arrangement is for them, and how determined they are to keep the average taxpayer from switching to any competing tax filing ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This makes me laugh exactly because the number of jobs I&#39;ve seen advertised after I&#39;ve left them to do other things because they weren&#39;t challenging enough, only to see that the prerequisites posted for the &#34;new&#34; job would&#39;ve screened me out before I even had the chance to interview and are far beyond what is necessary to do the job well.99% of the jobs that high quality developers could do that they&#39;re screened out of are because of poor concepts of what is needed to be successful.If someone has decent problem solving and analytical skills, can understand the problem domain and has the capacity to learn a new language/framework/construct in a short period of time (which frankly most of us can, and do with frightening regularity), unless you have something miraculously niche and technical, they&#39;re capable of doing the job. All you need to worry about is are they a competent developer and whether they&#39;ll be a good personality fit for the team.They say we rise to the level of our incompetence, but most developers never really grow out of solving problems and only get better with time and experience.Most degrees and professional certifications are meaningless to people who only care about the knowledge - there&#39;s no point in chasing paper that&#39;s out of date the minute the course is designed. We don&#39;t want that knowledge, it&#39;s old. We want current information which the courses and qualifications haven&#39;t been designed for yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a job for nearly 20 years.  Good job, good people, really hard to leave.  The folks at the company who hired me at the time (dot.com era) &#34;Just wanted people who could think about second order effects&#34;.  They didn&#39;t care about resume much.  They wanted &#34;thinkers&#34;.I worked in tech support and had a great relationship with engineering and etc.  They&#39;d ask tickets get assigned to me because they knew I was honest and thorough when it came to documentation and etc.  It was a good gig.Eventually we were acquired and before selling the company off as pieces they laid a huge % of people off, including myself (it was ok, I was ready to move on / and would eventually change careers).The company that got a bunch of the engineers eventually needed support people and the engineers reached out to me to apply.   I applied.But the job requirements had changed, masters degree required.  I no longer qualified (I didn&#39;t / don&#39;t even have a degree).  I applied, but didn&#39;t make it past new company&#39;s filters.  The engineers were told that if I didn&#39;t make it through the filter they wouldn&#39;t consider me.20 years doing that job in one form or another, and there&#39;s maybe a handful of people who know the proprietary side of their equipment... but no masters = not even considered for job.This was a technical job to be sure but it was largely IP (and some proprietary stuff) networking troubleshooting.   You could take capable high school students and they could do it with some good guidance.The hiring people industrial complex is insane."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"General SE hiring comment: One thing I realized, for most IT/SE jobs, the more accurately you describe your current stack in the requirements (or maybe the person you are replacing), the smaller your candidate pool is. You might even find that your candidate pool is exactly the people you are already working with.Which makes it problematic when we make HR people do the initial screening. They would filter out a lot of good candidates just because they used Python instead of Java, or had been working on a C++ project one year less than the person leaving the team.Could it be then that this is a communication problem between the Engineering team and the HRD? After all, the Eng&#39;g team writes the requirements for the job post, HRD just checks it and makes it look attractive.(Though honestly, I don&#39;t think this general comment applies to the job post in Carmack&#39;s tweet. Honestly I can&#39;t fault the job post for the way it was worded. I say the higher you are in an SE-org chain, the less this is a problem.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like SparkFun and I don&#39;t like patent trolls, but I have to say that SparkFun&#39;s mockery of the patent doesn&#39;t make sense. It is pretty clear that this patent was written by an engineer describing their actual system in great detail followed by one fairly narrow claim. I&#39;ve seen many patents that are mostly written by lawyers, and I don&#39;t see any influence of lawyers in this patent.SparkFun&#39;s criticism is kind of painful to read. The diagram that SparkFun claims is SPI is not SPI. The discussion that SparkFun claims is malloc is entirely unrelated to malloc. SparkFun claims that when the patent discusses processing multiple streams of data that it&#39;s discussing variable length arrays, but it&#39;s not. They claim that a MAU doesn&#39;t exist, but a MAU is a multiplier-accumulator unit. SparkFun seems to be entirely confusing the motivation of the engineer filing the patent in 2008 with the motivation of the patent trolls. I&#39;ve seen many patents that are fluff and nonsense, but this one is a solid patent.The infringement claim is probably bogus; I don&#39;t see any evidence that the pcDuino infringes the one narrow claim in the patent. I hope that SparkFun can quickly get rid of this lawsuit. I don&#39;t get any enjoyment out of criticizing SparkFun&#39;s post, but having spent the time to look over the patent, I feel that I should comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &gt;    The cost is further reduced by employing only static or dynamic ram as a means for holding the state of the system. [...]&gt; Dynamic ram? Can I poke fun at them for not knowing what RAM is? Yes I can.&gt; The above paragraph succinctly describes malloc(), which is perhaps one of the most fundamental advancements in modern computing. The problem is that Al didn’t invent it. Memory management (the ability to take RAM and then give it back when your function is done) goes back to the dawn of computing.No, this is wrong.Nathan is referring to dynamic memory allocation, which is what malloc does, but that isn&#39;t what this line in the lawsuit is talking about.Dynamic RAM, or DRAM is RAM that stores state in a capacitor. This is what your laptop uses -- DDR4 SDRAM is &#34;Double data rate (version 4) synchronous dynamic RAM&#34;. In DRAM, the charge on the capacitors slowly dissipates, so DRAM needs to be &#34;refreshed&#34; periodically, which is why it&#39;s referred to a &#34;dynamic&#34; RAM.Static RAM, or SRAM, is RAM that stores state in a register-like structure (usually cross-coupled inverters). It&#39;s &#34;static&#34; in that it doesn&#39;t need to be refreshed -- as long as the supply voltage is maintained, the bits stored in an SRAM will remain intact.I agree that this patent lawsuit is bullshit, and I really hate to derail the conversation, but I&#39;m surprised by Nathan&#39;s misunderstanding here, given that SparkFun makes embedded boards that use all kinds of memory. SRAM/DRAM isn&#39;t unusual terminology. The distinction doesn&#39;t even matter in the context of this line in the lawsuit, but if you&#39;re going to make a point of nitpicking about something, you should really make sure that you&#39;re actually right about it first..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me: software engr, retired; also patent agent who worked in Google Patent Litigation.A rookie mistake is reading the TEXT of a patent. A pro looks only at the claims. The text is only there to &#34;support&#34; the claims, which boils down to using the same words. Cynical, I know.Claims unfortunately look like gibberish if you&#39;re unschooled, but &#34;construing&#34; them is an early step in a trial, and often if you get a bad claim construction you give up. I worked on tons of claim construction briefs.I&#39;ll read those claims a little later this evening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience at least talking to some younger people there is a clear dichotomy: despite all the talk about Gen Z being &#34;digital natives&#34;, people new in their career are much hungrier to get back into the office because they don&#39;t yet have good career networks built up and they&#39;re eager for mentorship. It is older, or at least more established workers who are less keen on that.I don&#39;t think FAANGs will have any trouble hiring a boatload of eager, hardworking college grads in September even if they lose multi-digit percentage of their current workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly don&#39;t know whether these articles are over-stating their case, and neither do I know how typical my own experience is, but for some reason it bothers me that the tone of the HN discussion is so reflexively dismissive.I understand that a lot of people will respond to a question of whether they intend to quit their job with a &#39;you bet!&#39; even at the best of times, but I&#39;m seeing a lot of people quitting and switching right now, as different company plans are crystallized for the &#39;new normal&#39;.In my current company (for another 2 months) I was interviewed to join a team of 12 tech developers, and a couple of months ago the first of the switchers quit to leave for another company specifically because they were guaranteeing remote-first work.Then another five of us quit over the following few weeks. We met up last week for a goodbye lunch in the park: half the team that I joined a year ago leaving the company over the Spring and Summer.Is a 50% quit-rate normal? Maybe each of us had slightly different priorities and plans for the future? But I do know for sure that people are reflecting more than I&#39;ve ever experienced before, about their work environment, the balance in their lives, and prioritizing other things than 40-50 hours each week sitting in front of a screen, inside an office."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They sent around a form at my work asking everyone what their preference would be. The first guy replied to everyone with his preference: 100% wfh. Since he replied-all, so did everyone else.

The first mistake is failing to recognize that many governments (case in point) are not nearly as vulnerable to bad PR, so generating a bunch of sympathetic imagery (photos of student protestors getting gassed or whatever) might not actually be useful in swaying political outcomes.The second mistake is assuming that most (putatively) peaceful protests in the western world are actually the impetus for political change, and not just part of a legitimization strategy for political changes that were already in development before the protest started."</p>

It&#39;s actually my favorite part of the job. But the business invariably doesn&#39;t want to spend the time and money to do that.They&#39;d generally much rather start with a fairly vague description of what they need and let the devs keep throwing stuff against the wall and see what sticks.Good and accurate estimation is not just a dev function. It requires buy in and input from the entire business stack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Estimation that isn&#39;t based on previous data - I think the article that follows this one refers to it as &#34;Evidence-Based Scheduling&#34; - is almost entirely a waste of time.We analyzed our five+ year history of estimates vs actual time, and our standard deviation was larger than our mean. It was ridiculous how wrong our estimates were. The problem was in what was being estimated - coding time. Developers would get asked how long a task would take, and only think about the time spent sitting in front of a computer, typing code, and not the other time - waiting for other resources or people to finish tasks that you depend on, sick days, software and hardware issues, etc.The only way to accurately take those unforeseen factors into account is by analyzing previously completed tasks that have similar scope. Even then you can only get close.A couple people have mentioned weather forecasting as a similar endeavor - but meteorologists don&#39;t just guess, they analyze previous data.Estimation that isn&#39;t based on concrete data is a fool&#39;s game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paid overtime will fix scheduling. Scheduling is bad because the cost falls on the employees, not the employer. If crunches resulted in time and a half, double time, and triple time, scheduling would get fixed.As I&#39;ve pointed out before, film scheduling is an established discipline. Making a movie is much more complex than a software project. There are a lot of moving parts. Things get changed. There are people problems, weather problems, and transportation problems. Most importantly, if a film project goes into crunch mode, everybody starts getting paid overtime. This reduces the tendency to underestimate.There are also third party estimates. Hollywood has something called &#34;completion bonds&#34;. A completion bond is an insurance policy for the investors. Either they get a showable movie into theaters, or the completion bond company has to pay the investors. A completion bond costs about 5% of the cost of the film.Completion bond companies do their own estimates. Estimation inputs are &#34;script, budget, shooting schedule, (and) résumés of key crew.&#34; To survive, they need a net error near zero - they must overestimate and underestimate about equally. Consistent underestimation would put them out of business.Since they do a lot of this, they have scripts and financial data from previous movies. They can look up &#34;car chase, metropolitan area, 2 minutes screen time&#34; for how much that cost the last 50 times someone did it. They also have director info, like &#34;director X averages 2.5 takes per scene&#34;. All this info is collected across multiple film companies.The completion bond company has the right to intervene if the project starts to go over budget. Worst case, they can fire the director and take over the production. This is rare, but it happens. &#34;Malcolm X&#34; by Spike Lee (1992) and &#34;Bad Girls&#34; are examples. &#34;Malcolm X&#34; was an epic movie, a bit too epic - it runs 3 hours and 22 minutes - and somebody had to say no to Spike Lee. &#34;Bad Girls&#34; (1994) was just a botched production, and the bond company put in their own director to try to salvage something. It still lost money, but did reach theaters.That a completion bond company can fire the director puts teeth in this system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like the conspiracy theory/practice distinction and I hope Ed will write more on how we could pay more attention to the latter.Noam Chomsky presents lots of evidence about outrageous acts of American government in his books, and he always claimed that it all comes from official and open government sources. Yet most people are either unaware or refuse to believe it anyway.These are conspiracies done openly, because almost nobody wants to go through and find the smoking gun in the heaps of otherwise boring government documents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Conspiracies happen constantly because people conspire to do nefarious things all the time. However nowadays the framework for evaluating those nefarious things (conspiracy theories) has been completely negated by those in corporate media conflating it with insanity and baseless, nonsensical accusations.And there&#39;s a reason for that, which Snowden touches on. Namely, the world in its current form is largely run by such nefarious schemes. The bad guys won a long time ago. And by taking away the language we might even use to talk about what they did, and the scale of it, they have further insulated their power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed people treat conspiracy theories with the same level of validity or non-validity regardless of the facts or details.Things like flat earth conspiracies have now inexplicably been lumped into the likes of those who believe in things like.https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/758989641/the-cias-secret-que...Or just question in general the motivation behind the decisions made by those in charge.There are some very obviously dumb conspiracies that have no basis in reality, there are some possibly far out there conspiracies that could have some merit and then there&#39;s conspiracies that seemed ridiculous but actually turned out to be true.The world is not black and white...it&#39;s very grey.Again, I find it odd these things tend to all be labeled under one giant &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; label. Much like any theories, some are possibly valid, others very obviously not.Categorizing these things together as has been done in recent years makes no sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using the alpha for the past 2 weeks, and I&#39;m blown away. Copilot guesses the exact code I want to write about one in ten times, and the rest of the time it suggests something rather good, or completely off. But when it guesses right, it feels like it&#39;s reading my mind.It&#39;s really like pair programming, even though I&#39;m coding alone. I have a better understanding of my own code, and I tend to give better names and descriptions to my methods. I write better code, documentation, and tests.Copilot has made me a better programmer. No kidding. This is a huge achievement. Kudos to the GitHub Copilot team!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was an undergrad at CMU, I learned how to work hard. Really hard. After having coasted through too-easy high school, I spent all day every day at CMU either programming, doing mathematics, or thinking about one of those things (to great effect: often the trick to prove a theorem would pop into my head while showering or while taking a walk). I would fall asleep while programming in the middle of the night, dream about programming, then wake up and continue programming just where I left off.One thing from this essay really stuck out to me:&gt; The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working without anyone telling you to. Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarm bells go off.One thing that always happened at the end of a semester is we&#39;d have a few days after exams but before flights back home. On these days I&#39;d typically try playing a video game (my hobby before college) and every time I would stop playing after just an hour with deep feeling of unease at the pit of my stomach. &#34;Alarm bells&#34; is exactly how I would describe it - a feeling at the core of my psyche that I have been wasting time and there must be something productive I should be doing or thinking about.Years later, having tackled anxiety problems that had plagued me most of my life, I came to recognize that my relationship with hard work during my college years was not healthy and that this deep seated desire to do more work is not a positive thing, at least not for me.I&#39;ve since reformed my ambitions, instead of looking to start a company or get a PhD in mathematics, I&#39;ve decided that hard work is not the love of my life and instead I should focus on my hobbies while looking for a career path that can be simultaneously fulfilling but laid back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked my way through college as a mover (and came out the other side with high 5-figure debt). Many of the older guys I worked with had drug habits. I worked 16-hour days with those guys. They&#39;d get on me for not running up stairs, for packing with too little paper around glass, for setting things down more than once. None wrote articles entitled &#34;How to Work Hard.&#34; None knew Warren Buffet as a child (see Gates). None attended the most expensive schools, if they had they certainly wouldn&#39;t have chosen to drop out because they got bored or were unfulfilled (see Graham and Zuck). Take a look at the top 10 highest valued YC startups. All their founders came from schools with less than 10% acceptance rates.Privilege is what I&#39;m getting at. Having an income 300:1 your lowest paid employee is disturbing. Making millions or billions off speculative, debt-fueled VC is disturbing. Proselyting your brand of success is disturbing. Recommendation: every time a founder, investor or businessperson starts to wax poetic on virtue, look for an angle. Why do founders want to appear virtuous and hardworking? Why do we need that from them? How else can they justify making sometimes up to 50% of their companies entire payroll? How emotionally satisfying must it be for Graham and his ilk to tell you why they got what they have?What if most of serious wealth and success is decided at birth?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It was similar with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but his dedication and his desire to win.I can assure you, there are many kids that practice harder than Messi did when he was young. He is not a great player because of hard work, he is a great player because of luck. I know the VC thing about the importance of hard work. They love to promote hard work because that&#39;s how they make money. It&#39;s just plain silly to attribute Messi&#39;s greatness to anything other than luck - both his physical abilities and the environment that taught him how to fine tune his abilities.Hard work is useless without that special precise knowledge of which work you should be doing. Few young soccer players know how to practice in a way to become Messi, even if they have the right body to do it. It&#39;s useless without being in the right environment too.&gt; Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarm bells go off. I can&#39;t be sure I&#39;m getting anywhere when I&#39;m working hard, but I can be sure I&#39;m getting nowhere when I&#39;m not, and it feels awful.That, my friends, is what a VC would love for you to believe. There&#39;s nothing sincere when someone in his position writes something like this. Because hey, if you&#39;re the 0.1% of the time that it works out, he gets rich. And if you&#39;re the 99.9% that wastes their time (like all the kids that never play soccer at the highest levels) he loses nothing.I used to enjoy PG&#39;s writings. He&#39;s crossed a line where he believes that the only thing good in the world is what is best for VCs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not all that great blaming the victim. They clearly made the right moves with at least some of their configuration decisions and leaned on the underlying platform not being bonkers (but alas, it was: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/4737 and https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/22054).Should they have hardened in all the other ways for defense in depth, e.g requiring authentication from localhost? Sure. Should the attacker have not done the attack? Without a doubt. But should docker have not completely undone a security control?Yes, and the fact that docker seems to have persisted with the current state is the topic of discussion.Previously: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27613217"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Network services really should have auth by default even if they only bind to localhost. There’s so many ways that a localhost service can become accessible to attackers. Any process with network access, no matter what user it’s running as, can access a localhost service - UNIX sockets on the other hand can be restricted by the usual user/group permissions. A localhost service can be exposed by e.g. an SSRF bug from a web server on the same machine. Or, accessed by a browser on the same machine browsing untrusted sites (an attack model for desktop services which open local ports), and so on. (In case you believe that the HTTP protocol  restriction in the latter two cases protects you - protocol smuggling over HTTP is frighteningly effective!)Of course, as seen here, a network service binding to more than localhost is strictly more exposed - and auth should be required in those cases (even when the service should ostensibly be LAN-only).Secure-by-default is the best kind of security."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crap like this is why I dont run docker.  I&#39;m glad RedHat took a principled stance on it and dropped it. Podman doesn&#39;t punch holes you didn&#39;t ask for in your firewall.  What a ludicrous anti-feature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When they work well, they&#39;re really good, but when they work badly, they&#39;re _really_ bad.The other week, I went for dinner at a place that had a online ordering system. My experience was as follows...Arrive at the table, scan the QR codeNo phone signal in the restaurant, so I need to connect to the wifi.Connect to the wifi, get a captive portalNeed to put my phone number in to connect to the wifi; there is no signal, so I need to go outside, to receieve the confirmation code.Connected to the wifi, scan the code again, choose my food.Go to pay, need to register an accountPut my email address in, I already have an account on this food ordering service!?Do a password resetPut in my credit card details (why not use apple pay?).This whole time, we&#39;re sat at a table, in theory to meet friends, but we&#39;ve spent the first 15 minutes all glued to our phones!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s really interesting to see how a crowd of tech workers who generally are trying to pave the way are so quick to attack and be negative.Like all things in life, when its implemented well it works and when it does not it is terrible. I still think there is room for this to be the future though. I say this as a westerner but perhaps the west is not ready for it yet but I really enjoyed the experience of using QR codes in China. Go to a restaurant I just get shown where to sit and don&#39;t need to waste time with the host/server giving me menus or telling me anything. If I have questions they are there to answer the but I can also just sit down, scan the QR code, menu opens up and I can order food. Food just shows up minutes later. When I am done I go to the front and pay with Alipay.The benefits to me of not having physical menus is huge. From the business perspective there is less interaction time necessary to serve a diner. Sure if this is an upscale high touch experience physical menu is where it stays BUT the majority of dining experiences are not like this. The menu is up to date and easy to modify. Possible to include multiple pictures and information about the food.I might be wild but I really like the experience and wish more places would adopt it. Like all things I think here in the west its still too new so we have a mixed bag of good and bad implementations. Give it a few years and I think it will be narrowed down to the POS providers who offer it as a feature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I gotta say, I disagree with this piece. I, for one, love QR code menus. I can pinch zoom rather than squint at a menu with small/unreadable fonts in dim lighting. I don&#39;t need to badger the already exhausted wait staff on a busy night when they forget to drop us a menu or two. When orders are taken online, rather than awkwardly force a friend to not go to the bathroom (or take their kid to the bathroom) until a server can take their order, they can just order and then go. I do think restaurants should handle payment themselves and have the option for paper menus or menus posted on a wall if needed, but otherwise I&#39;m a fan."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more concerning security finding here is that Google sat on this for 9 months. Assuming the claims hold, this is a serious problem for any security-conscious GCP customers. What other vulnerabilities are they sitting on? Do they have processes in place to promptly handle new ones? Doesn’t look like it…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While there are a series of vulnerabilities here, none of them would be exploitable in this way if the metadata server was accessed via an IP instead of the hostname metadata.google.internal.The metadata server is documented to be at 169.254.169.25, always[1]. But Google software (agents and libraries on VMs) resolves it by looking up metadata.google.internal. If metadata.google.internal isn&#39;t in /etc/hosts, as can be the case in containers, this can result in actual DNS lookups over the network to get an address that should be known.AWS uses the same address for their metadata server, but accesses via the IP address and not some hostname[2].I&#39;ve seen Google managed DNS servers (in GKE clusters) fall over under the load of Google libraries querying for the metadata address[3]. I&#39;m guessing Google wants to maintain some flexibility, which is why they are using a hostname, but there are tradeoffs.[1] https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance...[3] This is easily solvable with Kubernetes HostAliases that write /etc/hosts in the containers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it certainly seems like a fairly serious vulnerability I think it&#39;s worth highlighting that this attack requires that either you already have access to a machine on the same subnet as the target machine or that the firewall in front of the target machine is very lax. That&#39;s a pretty high bar for getting the attack to work in the wild."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not surprising really.A few years back Hotmail/Outlook were returning people&#39;s Twitter/LinkedIn handles for emails sent/received. It had been noticed you could scrape that fairly easily at scale. With one email account you could check up to 30000 email addresses before being flagged by Outlook.Slightly longer ago you could simply iterate 1...n on LinkedIn URLs to find someone&#39;s profile, by converting the number to base12, you&#39;d be redirected to the person&#39;s public URL.Also their bulk contact upload. Take any data leak of email addresses, bulk upload them as contacts and then correlate email addresses to social profiles.Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are all bad in that regard on the last method, though Facebook at least do not return people&#39;s URLs along with your contact upload (you&#39;re expected to know the person&#39;s face/name to decide whether you&#39;d want to connect). The take away is that once you sign up, whatever information you put on your profile/account is pretty much available to anyone who wants it enough - and clearly there are plenty bad actors who want it. Obviously these social networks want to expand their network, but they also make it much more easy for data harvesting at unprecedented scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, I&#39;ve been scrubbing my social profiles. LinkedIn, Yelp, Facebook, etc.Barest of bones. Removing all connections, photos, posts, personal details. (I know the damage is already done. The aggregators never really delete anything.)Why not just out right delete my profiles? I&#39;m squatting. To ensure they&#39;re not used as socket puppets.After a beloved coworker passed, their profile got highjacked. Ten years later, I&#39;m still so angry about it that I could just spit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dropped out of my PhD because I could not stand the pressure of having to do talks regularly. Even though I was pretty decent at it (I was told my delivery was fine and clarity was superb), and sometimes felt good (&#34;powerful&#34; for lack of a better word) while on stage, I would worry for months before every presentation, then basically get physically sick for weeks before, and take some weeks more to recover.Then one poster I submitted got upgraded to a talk, which brought me over the tipping point, and I quit.I keep wondering if I could have done more to desensitise myself to it, but the anxiety was never decreasing, if anything, it was getting worse each time. I tried therapy, medication, Toastmasters, martial arts classes and dance lessons (which became my hobby, incidentally), and even vocal lessons (since I was particularly self-conscious about my voice), all to no avail.So now I have a co-founder to do all and any public speaking, and I do not plan to put myself in front of a crowd ever again. But I feel I&#39;m missing a part of life by it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, it&#39;s somewhat ironic then that during my early software career (20+ years ago), Fowler&#39;s lucid writing helped me through a lot of the anxiety, insecurity and impostor syndrome I experienced.His work introduced me to eXtreme Programming, UML, Refactoring and more. Much of the agile tooling used nowadays are a consequence of effort he and the groups he was a part of put forth. The book Analysis Patterns is very underrated IMO and was a breath of fresh air after futzing around with the SAMS Teach Yourself series books that were undeservingly popular back then.I think of Fowler as a virtuoso when it comes to explaining practical software matters. I haven&#39;t watched much of his talks, but I&#39;ve read most of his books and PLoP papers.I&#39;m glad he&#39;s going to focus more on writing and helping others with theirs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, these are classic panic attacks.Usually the stressor is obvious, but sometimes it&#39;s not and it&#39;s something you&#39;ve left unresolved that your subconscious gets caught up on from time to time.It might not be the talks themselves. It could be anything.If you&#39;ve never had a panic attack before and start getting these, it literally feels like you&#39;re going to die the first time you get one. Then you get used to them and start adjusting.I went through a period of panic attacks after acquisition talks with a giant corp fell through. I was messed up for years after that, with random panic attacks at all times of day.I worked on returning myself to my previously chill demeanor and haven&#39;t had one for many years now.I also stopped answering any VC/BizDev/CorpDev emails though. lol. But mostly out of a desire to optimize my time use for things that actually matter.Good luck Martin. Covid has certainly put the value of living the life you truly want for yourself into perspective and I hope you achieve that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"link to court ruling PDFhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some choice quotes from the ruling:&gt; The FTC is apparently unwilling to allege that Facebook has ever (pre- or post-Instagram acquisition) had something like 85% or even 75% market share; instead it hedges by offering only that the number is somewhere north of 60%.  The question naturally arises: which firms make up the remaining 30–40%? Although Plaintiff is correct that it is not required to identify every alleged competitor in its pleadings, its choice to identify essentially none is striking.&gt; The Court’s decision here does not rest on some pleading technicality or arcane feature of antitrust law.  Rather, the existence of market power is at the heart of any monopolization claim.  As the Supreme Court explained in Twombly, itself an antitrust case, “[A]district court must retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.” Here, this Court must exercise that power.  The FTC’s Complaint says almost nothing concrete on the key question of how much power Facebook actually had, and still has, in a properly defined antitrust product market.  It is almost as if the agency expects the Court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a good TLDR from WSJ:&gt; Judge Boasberg said the FTC’s lawsuit was “legally insufficient” because it didn’t plead enough allegations to support monopolization claims against Facebook. The judge, however, said the commission can try again and gave it 30 days to attempt to file an amended lawsuit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like terrible news :( After the focus on monetization of platforms such as udemy and coursera, edx seemed to give me a sliver of hope that education will be open. Given the immense trust funds held by Harvard and MIT, I had hoped money would not be a factor and these institutions would be able to develop their platform in the open.I&#39;d like to add .. non-profit does not mean free to end users. There are many good non-profits and there are many terrible ones (highly paid execs, insane amount of money spent on marketing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sad that all education endeavours eventually turn for-profit and then the goals get misaligned.Produce as many courses at as minimum cost as possible.
Enroll as many people as possible without regards for completion percentage.
Create an economy where random people are incentivised to create courses and then the course quality tanks.I wish this turns out differently.Even Udemy and Coursera have become commericialised with edX the last major standing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a huge bummer. edX was the prime example I would hold up when people said &#34;remote learning is terrible&#34;. Several of the courses I took on there ranked among some of the best classes I&#39;ve ever taken, in-person or otherwise.I agree with another commenter in that I had hoped it would persist since 1) education is ostensibly the business of Harvard and MIT and 2) Their pockets are deep enough to think long-term.I will admit that I haven&#39;t used it much in the past few years. Had been getting turned off by the credential chasing and access disappearing after some time.Tough to see an excellent path forward from here. I&#39;ve never heard of this 2U firm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s supersad to me that in 2021 this subject is controversial. I think the &#34;war on drugs&#34; charade has gone long enough and it&#39;s time to actually do the right thing. Stop targeting minorities with this stupid war and legalize ALL drugs. Period. Offer rehab programs + make sure that whatever is on the market is safe and the effects are well documented and understood."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This should be the way everywhere. There is no reason for weed to be illegal when tobacco is legal. I don&#39;t smoke either but I support legalisation or at the very least decriminalisation. At least that way the countries can get tax money and also help people who need counselling instead of charging them with unnecessary crimes. They did this in the Australian Capital Territory. Hopefully they&#39;ll legalise it in most states."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unbelievable that in 2021 Cannabis is still a Schedule 1 Drug but Alcohol and Tobacco are responsible for more death and have killed more people in America than all the Wars.https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/features/excessive-alcohol-death...&gt;Excessive alcohol use is responsible for more than 95,000 deaths in the United States each year, or 261 deaths per day.https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/index.htm&gt;Each year, nearly half a million Americans die prematurely of smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke. Another 16 million live with a serious illness caused by smoking. Each year, the United States spends more than $225 billion on medical care to treat smoking-related disease in adults.Our Government is a Kakistocracy. I really don&#39;t believe the current administration will legalize it and any election promises were lies."</p>

We&#39;re here to sell ads.&#34;It&#39;s not about dark patterns, that&#39;s just a second-order effect. It was never about dark patterns.This is the implied agreement. You understand it, or you don&#39;t. And if you don&#39;t, I guess you haven&#39;t been on the web in the past decade or something.What? You thought it was fair that a company spends millions in technical infrastructure and staffing so you can sit at home and spend your time looking at cats for free?

I&#39;m not gonna even try to install their app on my G-free phone.When a friends sends me a link to Instagram, I know that I don&#39;t need to click on it -- the thumbnail contains all the information that I&#39;d ever see without creating an account.  When news articles consist of a bunch of embedded Instagram crap, it doesn&#39;t even load on vanilla firefox.  That&#39;s cool, those stories are usually celebrity gossip that I don&#39;t actually want to read but got baited into clicking on.It&#39;s my favorite social media site, because their hooks just bounce straight off me.Thanks, Instagram, for the consistent signalling.  I never wanted to be your friend anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is sadly part of a dark pattern called &#34;stickiness&#34;. You can dress it up as functionally useful or even important but ultimately it is about companies wanting to create enough of a dependency that you have to continue using them, which is anti-competitive.Gone are the days where you bought something from a shop with no stickiness other than good service brought you back. Now there are far too many Marketing Managers who see stickiness as a win, even though the win is only to the supplier and not to the customer.It is similar to those web sites who ask you whether you want &#34;notifications&#34; from them in your OS! Nope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft has been using this dark pattern for a while now.Around 1-2 years ago, I upgraded MS Office on my Windows laptop. It asked me for my username/password-- which I didnt think strange, as I assumed it needed it to upgrade.And thats when I got a message &#34;Good news! Your Windows machine now uses your Microsoft to login.&#34;W.T.F.I was never asked, never warned, just tricked into replacing my local login with an online one.Took me 10-20 minutes of Googling to get my original setting back.I have now turned off ALL updates for Windows-- it is my backup machine, for a few programs that only run on Windows.Every update on Windows scared me (and still does), as I dont know what dark pattern they will try this time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a candidate for an even better reason:I have no reason to believe that Microsoft will not pull a Google and start spuriously locking people out of their accounts (as happens every few months on HN), which may then prevent me from logging in to my own computer.In fact, I&#39;ve already been locked out of my Microsoft account for &#34;suspicious activity&#34; (which was literally just purchasing Minecraft) and was required to enter a phone number to unlock it. Literal theft - I was compelled to either give up additional personal information or lose access to the software I paid for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My guess as to why it&#39;s successful is that it&#39;s always been moderately priced and Huy Fong is recognized as the originator of the &#34;Americanized Sriracha&#34; sauces.If a company tries to sell a cheaper version - then it feels like a cheap knock-off. And as everybody can afford to buy the original, why wouldn&#39;t you?If a company tried to sell a more expensive premium product in flashier packaging - then it would feel inauthentic. What are you paying more for?Plus whilst they&#39;ve not paid for advertising, they&#39;ve performed an excellent job of ensuring I&#39;m aware of their history. I&#39;ve no idea of the history of say Tabasco or Franks - but I&#39;ve many times heard the history of this plucky little immigrant founded company (and this thread is just a continuation). Maybe the key is to just have a likable story - and let others tell it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The part that strikes me is that they still have the same 10 distributors since the 80&#39;s.The &#34;local Chinese restaurant&#34; is a much more franchised thing than most people are aware of, and those 10 distributors meant it already ended up throughout the country and allowed everyone to try it for free. This is likely the secret to it&#39;s success.The only similar product I can think of is Mountain Dew Baja Blast. Though it did get some advertising, by automatically being available in every Taco Bell it became a minor craze. It&#39;s not an easily reproducible concept though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;No trademark&#34; is misleading. They have trademarks. Without them I expect exact clones would take their sales. The bottle and logo are quite distinctive and trademarked. The thing they didn&#39;t trademark is the name Sriracha."</p>

The World&#39;s Is.&#34; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jwo5qc78QUWhile I agree with the OP in broad strokes  (they clearly have the right to post and profit off their performance), I find that the vast majority of comments on Youtube&#39;s copyright claim system fail to even acknowledge major aspects of the problem.  Perhaps Youtube&#39;s practical monopoly does it a disservice here, and it&#39;s hard to separate &#34;big self publishing video platform&#34; problems with Youtube specific problems.Without a system like YT currently has, it would get absolutely sued into oblivion by rightful copyright complaints.  This is in many ways is a problem of copyright law not being designed with modern technology in mind.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought it was worth clarifying exactly what has happened here, since neither the BBC nor the FT articles make it particularly clear.The entity that the FCA has acted against is Binance Markets Limited (BML) which the parent Binance Group acquired earlier this year, in part because of its existing registration with the FCA which allowed it to carry out a limited range of regulated activities in the UK.The FCA has now placed restrictions on BML which remove its ability to carry out those regulated activities -- however BML was not actually doing any business in the UK so the effect of this is limited.The FCA also issued a consumer warning which, among other other things, reiterated that no entities in Binance Group are registered with the FCA and therefore cannot carry out regulated activity in the UK. Again, the impact of this is limited since the entity that you interact with when using the Binance.com website is not based in the UK, and the FCA does not have jurisdiction over it.A possibly outcome is that Binance will be a bit more circumspect about offering derivatives trading to UK retail because they want to build a more substantial UK business in the future. We saw this with Bybit a while ago, where they do not allow UK retail to use their website (although they have an exception for sophisticated investors, who can self-certify as an eligible counterparty and continue to trade on Bybit). I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; While the FCA does not regulate crypto-currencies, it does regulate cryptoassets. Firms must be authorised [...]to advertise or sell such products in the UK.&gt; This means that people in the UK are not allowed to use Binance&#39;s services to speculate, or bet&gt; However, they are still allowed to use the website to purchase and sell crypto-currencies, which is not regulatedSo, all is well, just don&#39;t bet, speculate. Just buy and sell?"</p>

I was even on their website 24 hours ago. However, for the life of me I can&#39;t find anything &#34;open&#34; about the Open Insulin Foundation.Could someone please point me in the right direction where I can read anything with more substance than a news article quoting an interview?EDIT: Just to clarify. We&#39;re extremely fortunate that we&#39;re in Australia. Insulin is affordable/subsidised here, my daughter&#39;s CGM (and sensors) are free, and anything else we need is heavily subsidised too. I&#39;ve no intention of biohacking anything to do with my daughter&#39;s Type 1.I&#39;m  asking the above mostly because I&#39;m curious. Admittedly I find it a bit scary that I know so little about the manufacturing of something that is 100% vital to my daughter&#39;s survival. I&#39;d like to know more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the source:
&#34;The high rate of magnesium deficiency now postulated [5,6,7,8] can be attributed in part to a steady decline in general magnesium content in cultivated fruits and vegetables, a reflection of the observed depletion of magnesium in soil over the past 100 years [11,12,13]. A report to Congress was already sounding the alarm as far back as the 1930s, pointing out the paucity of magnesium, and other minerals, in certain produce [14].&#34;The easiest of those references to link to is https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/view/journals/hortsci/44/1... :&#34;Three kinds of evidence point toward declines of some nutrients in fruits and vegetables available in the United States and the United Kingdom: 1) early studies of fertilization found inverse relationships between crop yield and mineral concentrations—the widely cited “dilution effect”; 2) three recent studies of historical food composition data found apparent median declines of 5% to 40% or more in some minerals in groups of vegetables and perhaps fruits; one study also evaluated vitamins and protein with similar results; and 3) recent side-by-side plantings of low- and high-yield cultivars of broccoli and grains found consistently negative correlations between yield and concentrations of minerals and protein, a newly recognized genetic dilution effect. &#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand this seems mostly to be about soil depletion. I&#39;m curious more generally if vegetables are also less nutritious because they are selectively bread for high water content and size. For example, its appeared to me for years that you vegetables you get on a Subway sandwich must have almost no nutritional content. They are all way paler than you&#39;d normally see, and super watery.Thinking about it, I suppose the vegetables may get that way from growing in poor soil, and Subway et al just buy those ones because they&#39;re cheaper"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The BBC more or less episode with James Wong is making me wonder if this is true (shorter summary of what James said on the podcast: https://mobile.twitter.com/Botanygeek/status/984708381507276... )Anyway, from the paper here:&gt;&gt; with estimates that vegetables have dropped magnesium levels by 80–90% in the U.S. (Figure 2) and the UK [11,12,13,32,33]Reference 11 doesn’t support this claim.Ref 12 doesn’t directly mention Mg but does say some nutrients have dropped between 5-40% which is NOT 80-90%Ref 13 does mention mg specifically on page 3 but states under 20%.…I think i’m being fleeced by this paper."</p>

Developers were not interested in rebuilding their apps for fire and other devices without those apis baked in and this was a good solution to ease uptake for fire/Amazon app store.Also note that ms will control this android os, so they already control the signature verification method. They could do this without you knowing very easily by just with something like carrying a second sig and hash of what they modified and the original partial sums from the original app. Google and amazon or any os supplier can.Signature verification is only as strong as the verifier code.Glad to burn karma to put data out there."</p>

On the other hand, even if they allow for the app developer to keep its signature, Microsoft is still probably very capable of gathering data and telemetry through their Android implementation.Either way, and until it becomes illegal to collect data without explicit consent, I’m pretty sure we’re screwed…"</p>

The troubles that face Israelis have always been amplified over those of Palestinians in my experience. That control of the narrative led me to be actively racist for most of my life while thinking I was not and also morally superior.

There will always be someone else out there to serve as the &#34;greater evil&#34; cover and this is a great disservice to the world, as crimes against humanity are just swept under the rug.&gt; Social media, our last remaining avenue for exposing the violence, was aiding and abetting Israeli crimes against us. Our documentation and testimonies of the violence we faced from Israeli settlers were shut down by tech companies far from Palestine. This included videos of mobs chasing Palestinians while screaming “Death to Arabs;” Israeli police firing live ammunition at unarmed Palestinians; the carpet bombing of Gaza;As long as western social media is almost entirely under US control one has to accept that everything there will dance to the tune made by and for the US and their closest interests. That much touted freedom of speech extends only as far as it isn&#39;t an inconvenience or embarrassment for those with the strings and levers.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Aha moment for me came when I was watching Chef Jean-Pierre&#39;s video on the topic. His terminology is unfortunate, he uses &#39;caramelizing&#39; to refer to what we call &#39;browning&#39;, but otherwise he&#39;s taught me more about cooking than any other YouTube chef.There are two steps to caramelizing onions. Cooking, and browning. Cooking, that is, making them soft enough to eat, is what takes the most time. Most of the time when you use onions in a dish, they&#39;re browned first, then they finish cooking with the rest of the dish.But when you make caramelized onions by themselves, if you don&#39;t spend the time to cook them properly, they won&#39;t have the right texture, even if the flavor is close. Since texture carries flavor, browned onions just don&#39;t taste the same as caramelized ones.So Jean-Pierre separates the process of making caramelized onions into two steps. Cook the onions by leaving them tightly covered in a pot on very low heat, they poach in their own liquid. Leave them at least 45 minutes but since the heat is so low it&#39;s almost like sous vide where you can cook them as long as you need.Finally, you brown them in a skillet to desired color.Video for the interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o-u7zjlShQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading a lot of recipes and watching pictures/videos from same authors I learned that the description of browning is very subjective to the author.Very few recipes actually required onions browned through (as in entire volume) and if they actually do, the author will for sure mention it. Onions that are completely browned have very overpowering sweet aroma that is undesirable in most recipes except the ones that are built around it (like, famously, french onion soup or various caramelized onion dips).Vast majority of recipes actually require the onion to just get little hints of being gold in places or some gold just on the surface of it. That is enough to add flavor that will distribute once you add some liquid to it.From my experience most cooking book authors seem to be testing their recipes. Many times I have been frustrated by being unable to get the desired effect only to find some missing technique that the author very likely did not think important enough to mention or maybe difference in ingredients or measuring methodology.I have learned to prefer books that describe the methodology used by the author (for example how they measure things, how they make broth if they use one in recipe, etc.)I have also learned to search the book for a recipe that I already know and figure out if it agrees with my experience and if I would be able to make the recipe from that description.Another important point is that usually you need to understand particular cuisine from which the recipe comes to be able to make it faithfully. Every cuisine is a little small system of thinking about how to choose, process and combine ingredients. Recipes tend to be silent on a lot of stuff that is completely trivial to natives of particular cuisine.For example, I have been practicing Italian, Indian and Thai cuisines for the past 20 years. I can make Italian, Indian or Thai dish on a pinch from whatever I can find in my fridge and pantry but I still can&#39;t make convincing Creole dish even if I tried.(edit)If you are asking for best books for beginners, I suggest to skip books and rather research the recipe on Youtube. Watch couple of people doing the same thing -- this is going to provide much more valuable information than you could ever read in a book. This mostly because having visual reference of how it actually looked when the person was cooking it will give you immediate feedback when you are getting something wrong.It is still my preferred way of learning new kinds of dishes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a 3-dose protein vaccine. [1]&#34;The second of these candidates and the fourth from Cuba uses yeast as a receptor binding domain protein and alumina as an adjuvant.&#34; [2]I suspect there is a translation issue here. I would hope this means they are recombinantly expressing some portion of the RBD in yeast, not that they are using yeast as a vector.[1]

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent news but there&#39;s a translation error or misunderstanding in this article.&gt; The scientists are using yeast as a receptor-binding domain.I think they must mean they&#39;re using yeast as the protein expression medium and encode the receptor binding domain of the spike protein (along with the rest of the spike?) with yeast-y promoters and base sequence preferences. I guess there&#39;s nothing on the spike protein that needs to be glycosylated so non-mammal cell culture works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; According to the state-run biotech corporation, BioCubaFarma, Abdala has proven about 92.28% effective against COVID-19 in clinical trials, which would put it the same league as the most effective vaccines BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna. Huge applause erupted in the auditorium of the CIGB this week when the impressive results were announced.One thing to be careful about is the the regulating authority and the testing authority and the developing authority are all the same and have a huge incentive to have good numbers, not the least of which is national pride.I would be careful with those numbers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’d recommend High Performance Browser Networking by Ilya Grigorik[0].  It’s definitely less in-depth/comprehensive than some of the other suggestions here but I’ve found it to be a really clear, accessible exploration of networking concepts relevant for web development.[0] https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449344763"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Beej&#39;s Guide to Network Programming is IMO hands down the best resource I&#39;ve come across:
https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/It also doubles as a very great introduction to C, if that something you&#39;re interested in. It&#39;s funny because both C and socket level programming are often a barrier, or at least they were for me. It&#39;s an attestant to the quality of Beej&#39;s guide that he introduces both simultaneously, and makes it very approachable.This is one of those sources that helped me disproportionately grow as a programmer in a short period of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d recommend Kurose&#39;s Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach (now in 8th edition) book if you want to learn a proper computer networks concepts because this is the definitive textbook.If you want the practical aspects of computer networks, you can try Niall Manfields&#39; Practical TCP/IP designing, using and troubleshooting TCP/IP networks on Linux and Windows book.  Granted it&#39;s a bit old (2nd edition is essentially the same 1st edition), but because you are after the essentials it should be more than fine.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I strongly dislike Haskell&#39;s focus on theory. Just show me examples on how to get things done and then the concepts will become clear. The Haskell and mathematics communities too often act like ivory towers that humans have to become enlightened to understand, and that simply is not how my brain is wired. I&#39;m not sure of there have been any studies on the usability score of languages, but I think that Haskell would come out very, very poorly. There&#39;s a reason why python is so popular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After years of seeing people try to understand abstractions like a functor from the definition first, I’ve started to think it’s the wrong way to do it.This post helps on some of these points, like explaining that e.g. functors are not always containers.I’d love to see someone try taking it further: just hashing out lots and lots of substantially different examples, showing how they are similar to each other, and progressing into higher level transformations, before finally showing the definition of a functor, and how it maps to each of those cases. Forget monads. Can we just start with functors and see how far we get with that?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like these tutorials always fall apart when they start introducing Haskell syntax and say &#34;That&#39;s Monad, simple as that!&#34;  class Functor f where
    flip fmap :: f a -&gt; (a -&gt;   b) -&gt; f b
  class Monad m where
    (&gt;&gt;=) ::     m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b

Sorry, that&#39;s not doing much for me! I am now going to look for a tutorial on Monads that&#39;s written in, say, Python, so at least I don&#39;t have to learn an abstract new language alongside the abstract new concept."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"5 years ago I hit a burnout point and took a year off work. It was a huge perspective shift. I realized that my day-to-day of a rushed commute to work, a stressful and distracting office, thimble-deep coworker relationships and a life completely orientated around doing the above was an insane waste of my short time on Planet Earth. I reoriented my life around family, remote work, flexibility and balance. My quality of life has hugely improved and there is no turning back the clock.When I saw what the pandemic was doing to nearly every professional office worker, I figured it was just a matter of time before the resignations started flooding in. Everyone had a whole year &#34;pause&#34; to reevaluate if their lives were organized around their goals, and for millions, the answer was no. There&#39;s no putting this genie back in the bottle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first guy in the article is a dev. There&#39;s never been a better time to find work as a dev. Jobs are handing out more money with more flexibility than ever seen before. On top of it all, if your firm wants people back in the office soon, now is the time to do loads of remote interviews so that you can keep being remote.I was interviewing recently and almost everyone is at least partly remote, with a huge number of 100% remote. Even people that I know don&#39;t like the idea are bending and giving two or three days remote.On the restaurant-type work, I&#39;d say a bunch of people have been given a breather from the treadmill, and they&#39;re using it to look around. I see this as mostly positive, but it does suggest that a lot of people are completely swamped, working all the time, spending everything. The little bit of credit they got from the pandemic payment has unlocked a great reckoning with the labor market. Previously if you didn&#39;t like your job, you were screwed. Somehow find time to interview/upskill, or somehow jump the gap with your savings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m one of these. I&#39;m an allrounder software dev in his late fourties, &#34;lured&#34; into a non-software middle management position by the promise of money and stability a few years ago.In practice, the money has never materialized because our sector took a big hit and much of that promise was tied to incentives based on the company&#39;s success. I can&#39;t really blame anyone for this, but that&#39;s strike one as far as job satisfaction goes.Second strike, I love writing code, and I don&#39;t get to do that a lot anymore. I&#39;m listing these &#34;pre-existing conditions&#34; because I believe it&#39;s common for us quitters to have other areas of dissatisfaction that hadn&#39;t been enough to drive us over the edge by themselves.Third strike, while my company does not support WFH after Covid, I did get to experience at least a partial WFH program, and it was absolutely wonderful. There&#39;s a problem though: I would absolutely like to continue working from home, but I also want to work on my own projects, on my own terms, on my own schedule. A traditional full time job is not compatible with that.So I put in my notice for the end of this year, to allow current company projects to come to a conclusion and/or hand them off. I want to stress that for a man in my age group, with no significant savings or other safety net, this is extremely scary. It&#39;s just that this Angst is outweighed by the thought of staying on the treadmill hoping for an eventual reward that may never come and seeing the little time I have left drain away."</p>
