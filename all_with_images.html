								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will miss him terribly. He was the guy who let me crash in his room at Defcon when I was a minor and was too young to book my own room. This kicked off 20 years of friendship. He was brilliant, zany, ADD x 1000, and always endearing and loving.In 2008 I was lucky to collaborate on DNS issues with Dan when he discovered a new form of DNS cache poisoning and spent years helping the Internet upgrade and defend against a serious and significant vulnerability. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for this and so much of his other work.He was a hacker&#39;s hacker, and the guy you want in your corner. Very sad to hear this news."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember attending Dan Kaminsky’s talk at DEFCON 12 and being blown away by it. Three years later, I went on the original “Hackers on a Plane” trip and ended up seated next to Dan on one of the flights. We quickly became friends. His mentorship over the years had an enormous impact on me.We both went back to CCCamp in 2011. I excitedly told him about a reverse DNS scanning project (0.0.0.0/0 in 12 hours on AWS for like $50), and then we ended up talking about the Debian RNG bug and password security, walking around camp watching the lightning in the distance.When I was doing my original brainwallet research back in 2013 and cracked the woodchuck wallet the first thing I did after showing my ex (then girlfriend) was call him. I told him I’d found something but didn’t feel comfortable discussing over the phone. He invited me over.My ex and I hopped on BART headed into SF and met him at the loft he was living at above a motorcycle shop. We talked and carefully planned and then I accidentally made 250 BTC vanish.Dan looked at me and said “[my ex] and I are going to go for a walk and return with burritos. You’re going to calm down and have this fixed by the time we get back. It’ll be okay.”It was, and I did. I’d simply forgotten about change addresses for a brief moment of terror.I think the first time he mentioned wanting to hire me was a few months later at a Bitcoin conference in San Jose. He believed in me. I went on to work alongside him at White Ops (now known as Human Security) in 2014. He brought me on stage with him at DEFCON that year.He spent a lot of time helping me put together a CFP submission about my brainwallet research for DEFCON the following year and then helped me put together slides, rehearse, and had a professional help me refine everything. I couldn’t have done it without him.My wedding was about six weeks before DEFCON - Dan showed up in an Uber, about an hour late. He explained that he’d confused Menlo Park for Morgan Hill when planning to leave. I was just thrilled to have him there.Dan was a supportive friend, a great mentor, and a delightful colleague. I really can’t overstate what a positive impact he had on my life. It’s hard to believe he’s really gone. That I’ll never get to swap stories about our respective side projects with him again.I miss him.https://rya.nc/threads/dakami-eulogy.htmlhttps://twitter.com/ryancdotorg/status/1385989257638993922"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RIP, Dan. I work with a lot of very smart people. So, I&#39;ve gotten a bit used to it and don&#39;t normally find myself in awe of many people&#39;s intelligence. Dan was a person that I was absolutely in awe of. The fist time I met him very long ago (almost 20 years), he showed me code he wrote to share movies through abused DNS slaves... building a p2p network like Napser/Gnutella from the technology. No one had ever thought of such a thing. I don&#39;t think anyone else in the world knew DNS well enough to be inspired to think of it. He was so kind and friendly to everyone. It was fun to talk with him about tech/security because he had such enthusiasm and excitement... like a little kid on Christmas or a puppy. :) I learned a lot from him. I have nothing but great memories of him. I remember once when someone hacked him. He even took that in good humor and didn&#39;t let it bother him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Super excited for your project. I have been using map tiles from Mapbox, MapTiler, OSM Buildings for my project and am coming to the point that I need to merge elevation data with building height data in order to cast realistic shadows across the earth. Unfortunately elevation data and building data come from two different tile sets from two different tile providers and it&#39;s a lot of download/processing overhead to merge the two data sources. I need to make my own tiles!I spent part of today on the OSM wiki trying to wrap my head around Mapnik, how tiles are generated, how I am going to host this cheaply because my project is non-commercial, and then the HN gods smiled on me. Thank you for taking this on and I&#39;m coming along for this journey!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very nice! Happy to see a few of my libraries in the dependencies :)Also check out https://github.com/kothic/kothic-js, an older but similar attempt at making a full-fledged map renderer using 2D Canvas. It has a pretty good label rendering in particular which you might find useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really interesting to me. I do a lot of mapping of natural surface single track trails (for hiking and mountain biking) along the way be sure to properly name things, add intersection markers, and create relations (routes and superroutes) to document the systems.The biggest downside thus far is a good way of displaying the data. mtb.waymarkedtrails.org gets close, but I&#39;d really like something that displays relations in the specified color, has sane intersection markers, etc.I feel like there should be something out there which effectively lets me design a style sheet and then apply it to a map which I embed somewhere (maybe even in an app).This... feels like it? Or if not this, can any of you recommend another system?Ideally I&#39;d love something I can self-host. I tried getting a copy of waymarkedtrails going and then modifying that, but it&#39;s a bit too specialized and I kept running into quirks getting the toolchain set up.EDIT: Looks like this might not include the highway=path data that I need, much relations. Alas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve kept an eye on Blender for the last 15 years and tried it again recently after having almost exclusively used Maya.  It&#39;s continually improved in just about every way, is relatively easy to use with just a trackpad, and it performs really well.In contrast, Maya is has more features overall but is... a piece of shit in many ways.  It doesn&#39;t matter what hardware I&#39;ve used; it&#39;s a rule that Maya has to crash randomly when doing basic things.  I used to be able to just open the Hypershade, but with Maya 2020 merely opening it causes the entire application to crash.So I&#39;ve decided to ditch it for Blender.  I&#39;m not doing character animation anymore, but I still enjoy modeling and rigging some things I want to conceptualize in 3D space, as well as create 3D printables, and Blender is absolutely up to the task.It kind of baffles me how little interest the motion picture and television industries have had in Blender.  Big studios are still using Maya, which I know also crashes for them and has performance issues.  They could pour all their money into improving Blender and eventually not have to pay Autodesk anymore for licenses for poorly managed software that seems to rarely receive bug fixes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Deprecation&gt; OpenCL rendering kernels. The combination of the limited Cycles split kernel implementation, driver bugs, and stalled OpenCL standard has made maintenance too difficult.I am not really up to date on the GPGPU world, but is OpenCL in such a bad shape that it is not really usable? If so that is very sad. Are there any alternative open hardware agnostic GPGPU apis or has CUDA eaten the entire market?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching Blender become more and more prominent over the last several years has been extremely satisfying. This looks like another great step."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note how this is built in the &#34;stacked&#34; method, i.e. old school Lego.  Even with technical parts, this was uniquely accessible.  My proudest achievement was a smooth running, jamproof pump for elevating marbles; you can see it from about 0:27 in this old camcorder video:https://youtu.be/Mw3dUbRfMSw?t=24These Legos encouraged engineering thinking all the way and were the defining toy of my childhood.Modern Legos are stunning.  Look, for example, for the Rubik&#39;s cube solve machine that can twist a (lubricated) cube to completion in a few seconds.  However they&#39;re no longer stacked from bottom to top; they&#39;re built &#34;inside out&#34; and the best tool to come up with a design for them is probably a CAD program.  Stunning results for those who have put in the time, but not so encouraging for tinkerers just starting out.  So it&#39;s nice to still see &#34;old school&#34; stuff being built."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know a chem prof who built a Lego spectrometer. https://publiclab.org/wiki/lego-spectrometerLegos are just wonderful.edit: I know nothing about woodworking or crafting any building materials, but I always wish I could perform those types of projects. And whenever some potential project comes up, I think to myself, &#34;but I could build it with Legos.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s been over 50 years since humans have been outside of low earth orbit. It&#39;s like we sprinted forward so fast, going from horse drawn carriage to space flight in a generation, only to get frightened and recede back from the highest point, never to go back.Granted there has been an enormous amount of innovation in the last 50 years, but by some accounts we&#39;ve been going backwards. Humans are no longer capable of mach 3 flight, or making Roman concrete.I think we assume that technology will keep progressing. We assume Moore&#39;s law will continue into the future and we forget that there are people behind the progress. The technology that produced those pictures are gone, we might be able to take ones like them again, but never with the same rockets and never with the same photo-chemical processes. Progress is fragile, not inevitable and everything we have can be lost in a generation just as easily as it was made."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW, if you wanted to get the static from-scratch go image a lot smaller, try running the binary through UPX. It typically improves compiled go binary sizes by absurd amounts: https://upx.github.io/Also, https://busybox.net is a 1.0MB static binary that provides all of the standard posix-compliant tools (sh, grep, tail, etc) and actually comes with an httpd implementation. So if you wanted a more useful container at about 1MB, you could use it.Edit: here&#39;s a previous thread on UPX that has 80 comments talking about the tradeoffs it makes. You should definitely consider these if you intend to use UPX: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15456980"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;m wondering -- why are people obsessed with container size? A lot of enterprise is Java shops which deal with huge dependencies, huge distributions, and generally pretty heavy software -- with internet speeds what they are today, it&#39;s not hard to throw 100-500MB around internal networks (building the code closer to the deployment area is also a solution). Even gigabyte size containers are not impossible to deploy these days with the right caching (lord help you if you invalidate a bunch of layers though).In a world of xTB thumbdrives, why are we so worried about containers being &lt;1MB? Security is one thing, minimalism is another, but I do sometimes wonder about this.Anyway, if you want to build minimal containers and want to do it with a bit more backing than this one (pretty well written) blog post, probably also check out distroless:https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distrolessI personally find most of the time alpine-based containers are more than small enough and good enough with nice ergonomics (sometimes you just want to shell in to the container), but maybe it makes sense to build containers with and without debugging/inspection tools (a `project:vx.x.x` and a `project:vx.x.x-debug`) and switch them out when problems arise."</p>

Then, after the helicopter hovers briefly, it will go into a slight tilt and move sideways for 7 feet (2 meters). Then Ingenuity will come to a stop, hover in place, and make turns to point its color camera in different directions before heading back to the center of the airfield to land.&#34;via https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/294/were-..."</p>

I asked about this on Twitter and was told the sensor for each pixel isn&#39;t fully shielded from light. The fast-moving rotor blades allow for latent light to enter into the sensor during the image scan, causing the rotor blade itself to appear slightly lighter.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow yikes, kudos to the great disclosure and fix process from homebrew and other involved folks.Github Actions seems like such an easy target--the workflows people build are complex, difficult to audit, and lightly or never tested at all except in prod.  It&#39;s just a recipe for disaster and all these recent issues (see also: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26908076) make me wonder if the Github flow model of a wild west of public pull requests just isn&#39;t compatible with how people use workflows and automation in practice.  No one in their right mind would leave a Jenkins server open for anyone to trigger some workflows.  It&#39;s silly that everyone effectively does that because they see some Github branding on a page and feel safer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Toyota was one of the leaders in just-in-time manufacturing, yet they&#39;re doing just fine with the chip shortage. They stockpile parts, and try to understand how they work in depth.&gt; After the [Fukushima] catastrophe severed Toyota’s supply chains on March 11, 2011, the world’s biggest automaker realised the lead-time for semiconductors was way too long to cope with devastating shocks such as natural disasters.&gt; That’s why Toyota came up with a business continuity plan (BCP) that required suppliers to stockpile anywhere from two to six months’ worth of chips for the Japanese carmaker, depending on the time it takes from order to delivery, four sources said.&gt; The sources said Toyota has another advantage over some rivals when it comes to chips thanks to its long-standing policy of ensuring it understands all the technology used in its cars, rather than relying on suppliers to provide “black boxes”.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-fukushima-anniversa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most comments I&#39;ve seen on this and other related articles on HN are too focused on the high-end chips doing fancy stuff. There are not only supply constraints on these sorts of high-compute chips, but also big shortages on practically all ICs in general.I&#39;m a hardware engineer for a medical device company, and we&#39;ve been dealing with supply constraints not only with our MCUs but other ICs like high-side power switches, LDOs, memory, and more. It&#39;s tough when we&#39;re low volume (a few thousand a year) and the huge automakers and other huge consumer electronics giants are gobbling up all the parts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What has made the auto industry particularly vulnerable is its reliance on just-in-time delivery, where parts are brought in when needed, rather than being stockpiled.It&#39;s fascinating that the response is to close production rather than increase prices.Those warning of inflation point to events like this as support. But inflation requires that higher producer costs be accepted by consumers.And for that price transmission mechanism to work, there needs to be supply actually available at the higher price. It appears that just-in-time economics mean that in the event of a shortage your supply just goes offline. You don&#39;t get higher prices, just empty shelves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thibault Duplessis is actually an ex co-worker of mine, and this guy is truly impressive.Not only he is a very talented developer, he really sticks to his beliefs and made what Lichess is today.He used to take up a job for a year or so, save money, and travel the world for a year or so until money runs out. Then he would come back to France and take up a new job. All working on Lichess during his free time.For a few years now he has enough donation to pay himself enough money for his expenses, while he could have been a startup millionaire if he had decided to take a different path.But he proved that you can have a successful non-profit, free of charge, free from ads service. Not just source code, but an actual service hosted with millions of users.We need more people like Thibault."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I made a site heavily inspired by lichess (specifically AGPL, no ads ever, free forever), but for crossword board games (think Scrabble, Words with Friends, etc). You can see it here at https://woogles.ioIt has been growing steadily and we&#39;re about to hit 400K games played; it&#39;s the site of choice for the streaming community and we just finished hosting the World Blitz Championship this past week :)Thibault is sort of my hero. We&#39;ve talked about doing some sort of cross-promotion but I&#39;d like to polish our app a bit more before I follow up again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lichess is truly on a class of its own. It delivers a better service than any of it’s alternatives (in my opinion), and it’s actually 100% free with no BS.Funny enough, I’ve donated around $30 in total which is $30 more than I would’ve ever thought of spending on a chess site. Hats off to thibault and the open source community for creating such a wonderful gem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seams the core of Apple&#39;s defence:  Apple contends that &#39;[n]o reasonable consumer would believe&#39; that purchased content would remain on the iTunes platform indefinitely

which is a flagrant difference between ownership of physical items and non-cloud items vs cloud items.This strikes at the root of our society&#39;s definition of ownership.  Clarification should not depend on Apple, or even a court.  This should be enshrined by an explicit law.  Using the word  &#39;license&#39; or &#39;rent&#39; instead of &#39;buy&#39; for something you can&#39;t own seems the minimum a consumer should demand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen the phrase &#34;Own it in {HD/BluRay/4K}&#34; so many times and always cringe. You&#39;re just owning a limited license (extremely limited, in the case of digital goods) to watch.The average HN user can spot the difference and say &#34;of course you don&#39;t own it, and in case of streaming, you only have access for as long as the service is around&#34;, but that&#39;s not what the average consumer sees. &#34;Buy&#34; and &#34;own&#34; have very strong meanings and repurposing those for marketing purposes to mean &#34;limited lease&#34; is bending the truth to the point of breaking.But of course, &#34;lease it for a limited time, to watch on a limited set of devices, in a geographically limited region&#34; doesn&#39;t sound so valuable as &#34;buy and own it&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What blows me away is in a study group of 734 infants, which benefited from maternal antibodies against malaria, 717 were infected by malaria in the first year of their life. That&#39;s nearly 100%, in the first year since birth. That&#39;s devastating.The vaccine is showing 77% efficacy in trials in Burkina Faso.That&#39;s an ongoing pandemic that makes covid-19 look like a case of the sniffles. Malaria deaths peaked around 930,000 a year in 2004, and is around 600,000 a year now. I believe covid-19 death toll stands around 3 million deaths, most above the age of 70. Malaria is over 100 million, most under the age of 5.Source: https://ourworldindata.org/malaria"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to urge everyone to consider contributing to cost-effective charities that work on alleviating the scourge of malaria.GiveWell, a charity evaluator recommends Malaria Consortium and Against Malaria Foundation as cost-effective ways to directly reduce instances of malaria.https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great news which will save many lives.We will need to do more though. There are species of Plasmodium which survive on non-human hosts which means the disease will always be waiting - and this vaccination regimen is very demanding, so interruption or underinvestment will make Malaria come back.IMHO to finish off malaria we&#39;ll need some other approaches to complement it, and my suggestion is to get rid of the specific mosquito species that carries the disease. That&#39;s what happened in all developed countries long before a vaccine ever existed, and that&#39;s a good solution for poor countries (this time, we can use more discriminate methods)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 1. Use quotes to force an exact-match searchAlmost never works these days. Google now usually just quantizes your search terms into an ad or ultra popular news article written 3 minutes ago. It also ignores all your operators most of the time.Bonus: If you use something like inurl: You get blocked for a &#34;hacking attempt&#34;. Google also has blocked Tor and VPNs since 2006 or so. In fact, they are the one big search engine who has done this the longest. Google search right now is like one of those dinky websites from the early 2000s that follows all kinds of insane practices like blacklists and filters.What Google Search is trying to be is a thing you can ask questions and get an answer back. For example converting feet to inches, or where is Starbucks. I don&#39;t even understand why the niche (really, this is how academic research is done, but i guess you can just discount the entire web as an invalid soruce) of &#34;searching for strings over a set of websites&#34; is not even attempted to be filled. People are crazy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is missing several operators that are useful. Like  inurl:, intitle:, allintitle:, etc.The &#34;AROUND&#34; proximity search is neat as well, especially for words with dual meaning. like:bootstrap AROUND(6) cpuFinds &#34;bootstrap&#34; within 6 words of &#34;cpu&#34;, which culls out most (not all) of the unwanted results about the bootstrap js library.This article seems to cover most of the ones I&#39;m aware of: https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/Edit: Changed around(6) to AROUND(6).  Apparently the lowercase version doesn&#39;t work, as it&#39;s highlighting the word &#34;around&#34; in the results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great list, but what is the most important in search is not operators. It is context.Every time I work with students and they are stuck, I ask them to Google the issue. 9 out of 10 they will write something like: how to upload an image?Instead, they should first specify the context. Is it an issue on the front end? Are they looking for the correct input type for file upload? Or is it the php method to receive the file on the back end. Or is it in nodejs?Search engines cannot infer the correct context because there are hundreds of correct answers. So we have to specify:- nodejs file upload async (no need to talk to it like a human)- html file upload input type- php file upload tutorialMost likely, the answer will be in the first few links."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing which I don&#39;t think has been commented on is the marketing effort behind the M1.It&#39;s getting a lot of prominence and its use across lots of computers means that there can be a consistent message that &#34;M1 is great - get a new Mac and get an M1&#34;.It also provides an opportunity to distinguish between M1 and the next generation M2 (presumably).I&#39;ve always thought Intel&#39;s marketing was a bit confused - i7 stays the same over 10+ years with only the obscure (to the general public) suffix changing from generation to generation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You get an M1 with the new iPad Pro as well! I hadn&#39;t thought of the situation as the article presents. When shown in that light, it made me pause to reflect. The M1 doesn&#39;t make sense when its in every darn product. The only differentiator is screen size, RAM, and OS?I will admit that I switched to Thinkpad and Win10 about two years ago when I had to return my butterfly for the 5th time. I am not looking back either. If anything, I am more focused on AMD Ryzen and Nvidia 30 series chips in MSI, Lenovo Legion and Asus offerings. There is nothing I can&#39;t do with one of those machines. Going Apple is a backward move for me as I like to program, design in CAD, play steam VR, and run blender sims. Can&#39;t do any of those well with Apple hardware."</p>

And if you&#39;ve ever observed that one tall building may &#34;cover&#34; a range of street numbers, such as 200-220, then you should understand how to move from one 4-byte &#34;value&#34; to the next in an array in memory.Anyway, many more analogies... probably better than this one.Maybe unions could make using pointers a bit more challenging, but again, tall buildings next to short buildings and so on.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Resources like this (and as others have mentioned, Dark Site Finder) are very useful for astrophotography, especially for a hobbyist like myself. Many don&#39;t realize how relatively close they live to areas with great nighttime viewing conditions.For example, upstate New York has some great viewing locations, so even if you live in NYC it&#39;s an easy weekend trip. Here&#39;s a shot I took of the Milky Way taken from such a site (one of the darker spots in the map): https://www.lumathon.com/photo/_qTYviEhy/Colors-of-the-Milky...Edit: a few more of my other shots of the night sky for anyone interested, various locations, all of which were scouted using a light pollution map like the one posted -- https://www.lumathon.com/dan/photos/tag/stars"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not like nothing can be done about light pollution. For example Germany has a law about light pollution, and it shows on this map. It less polluted than its neighbours, although it has higher population density and urbanization level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be really great if this and other kinds of geospatial data were more open and easily mashed-up. Let&#39;s say I wanted to find a nice tract of land to buy (Zillow), which has good hiking trails (AllTrails), low light pollution for stargazing (lightpollutonmap.info), and maybe a dirt airstrip (vfrmaps) to fly into. Currently, I have to have four browser windows open with each site. There&#39;s no way to mash this data up easily without reaching for the dev tools and hoping each site provides raw data. Wouldn&#39;t it be better if everyone made data accessibility a priority rather than just packaging it up for each site&#39;s very narrow use case?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there&#39;s a lot of truth to this, but I&#39;m going to make an additional suggestion that I&#39;ll readily admit is biased by my own feelings:I think Go is in a honeymoon phase and people will hate it in 10 years; I think Rust will continue to be liked even when it&#39;s a legacy language (perhaps no language can continue being loved once it becomes &#34;brown&#34;, but I think Rust will be a lot less dreaded than others).Go, like Ruby (mentioned at the end of the article), is optimized for building. You can do things quickly and easily with minimal ceremony. Some people love that. But that&#39;s exactly the trait that&#39;s starting to weigh on Ruby, and it&#39;s exactly the trait that has put PHP and Perl in the &#34;dread&#34; category over time (remember when people were in love with those?).Rust on the other hand is optimized for maintaining (it&#39;s right there in the name: software should be allowed to become old and &#34;collect rust&#34;). Rust APIs are very hard to misuse, everything is constrained and specified very explicitly. Documentation and testing live inline with your code. You know exactly what a piece of code can and can&#39;t do - you even know whether it&#39;s allowed to mutate an object you&#39;re passing it. And of course certain mistakes are impossible to make at all without (again, explicitly) dipping into unsafe { }.This kind of forethought is what makes a language that survives the honeymoon phase."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A big problem and reason why &#34;brown&#34; languages come to be dreaded is because very few software houses take code UX seriously.I&#39;ve worked on codebases built with UX in mind and codebases without, and it&#39;s a world of difference.Code with UX has descriptive names, functions whose names intuitively describe what they do, using parameters that can&#39;t be accidentally misused. APIs are clearly delineated, domain edges clearly defined. Reading such code feels almost like reading a high level recipe, with the nitty gritty details available on demand using CMD-click. Weird edge case code is documented with a block comment explaining why it was done in this unexpected way. Nesting is minimal. Aptly named temp variables that only exist to aid readability are common.And the irony of it all is that by eschewing code UX, you&#39;re mortgaging your future: making it progressively harder to maintain your codebase, and harder to bring new people up to speed. Changes take longer, and testing is more difficult as fewer and fewer people understand what it&#39;s doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems to completely ignore the possibility that language designers get better at designing languages over time, and people simply prefer to develop new projects in well-designed over poorly designed languages.This to me seems to be the null-hypothesis, and I see no evidence on the page that use in &#34;greenfield projects&#34; vs &#34;brownfield projects&#34; provides any more indication than a simple underlying &#34;well designed&#34; vs &#34;poorly designed&#34; metric.For instance: why do people dislike Objective-C but like Swift? Could it be simply that Swift was expressly designed to ease pain points of Objective-C? Or is it, as this author claims, that Objective-C is in more legacy projects and if Swift were to have been invented first then replaced with Objective-C, people would suddenly love Objective-C and hate Swift? Same reasoning holds for C/Rust, VBA/Python&amp;TS, Assembly/LiterallyAnythingElse [1], Java/C# [2], and R/Julia.[1] I imagine if this author were to have been around to write this in 1980, they&#39;d make a claim something like &#34;People say the enjoy C projects more then Assembly ones, but in this essay I describe how this is actually just because Assembly is more likely to be used in existing codebases, and if Assembly had come around after C people would certainly prefer Assembly and detest C&#34;[2] Note C# is incredibly enterprise/legacy, yet well-designed. This supports the null hypothesis perhaps the most."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent tool to have as a security consultant, and it just keeps getting better and better. When approaching a large codebase, it enables you to write custom rules that match on certain antipatterns you&#39;ve spotted that may be unique to the codebase. That&#39;s the real value of the tool, but the repository of per-language rules is also convenient for quickly finding low-hanging fruit (like every use of a potentially injectable function such as exec,system,etc. in PHP).For example, a webapp may have been designed such that authorisation needs to be explicitly added with a line or two to each controller. A semgrep rule can be written to match all the controllers which are missing this line. Then these controllers can be manually reviewed to assess whether unauthorised access should be allowed. Depending on what you are trying to match, this is something that may be very complex or even impossible to implement accurately in plain grep. Some languages like Ruby have powerful static analysis tools (Brakeman) that can also do this, but the benefit of Semgrep is the flexibility across multiple languages and how readable the rulesets are.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The name &#34;Semantic Grep&#34; does not give a good idea for what this tool is and what it does.The web page states:  &#34;Static analysis at ludicrous speed.  Find bugs and enforce code standards&#34;&#34;grep&#34; is short for &#34;global regular expression print&#34;.  It finds matches for the given regular expression and prints them.&#34;Semantic Grep&#34; is a static analyzer with configurable rules, style checks, etc.  It does much more than search and print.Perhaps a better name is needed?Edit:  How about &#34;omnilint&#34; or &#34;omnicritic&#34; since semgrep is more of a &#34;lint&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) or &#34;critic&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl::Critic)  type of tool that handles multiple languages?Edit2:  &#34;Static analysis at ludicrous speed&#34; ==&gt; &#34;turbolint&#34;? (&#34;ludicrous speed&#34; reminds of the hilarious Space Balls scene :)   &#34;turbolint, GO!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a more complete example of how to call semgrep from pre-commit (which gets called before every git commit) in order to prevent e.g. Python print calls (print(), print \\n(), etc.) from being checked in?https://semgrep.dev/docs/extensions/ describes how to do pre-commit.Nvm, here&#39;s semgrep&#39;s own .pre-commit-config.yml for semgrep itself:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Folks - this is what we are outsourcing and externalizing.When foreign entities are able to bid for a lot less, and pay a lot less, a lot of it has to do with the fact that they will not bother with &#39;end of life&#39; for ships, or getting insurance, or worrying about the lives of people who are &#39;expendable&#39;.Those very nice buildings in Dubai come from some nasty labour practices.If every piece of this puzzle from end-to-end were to have happened in a &#39;rich country&#39; there&#39;d be legal issues, PR/media, litigation, and a separate kind of bureaucracy altogether, meaning the &#39;alternative&#39; for a lot of corporations is just &#39;wash their hands&#39; of it, pay 1/2 the price, and get all the ugly parts &#39;off the books&#39;.We are to the point now where we have ample material surplus - we don&#39;t need any more &#39;plastic stuff from China&#39; - it&#39;d be worthwhile to start integrating a lot of &#39;off the books&#39; stuff into trade deals. Ironically, it would be good for &#39;them&#39; as well, because in chaotic, quasi-lawless systems it doesn&#39;t make sense for participants to invest in anything further ahead than what is in front of their noses (i.e. don&#39;t hate the Lebanese shippers for doing the only thing they can do to remain profitable, i.e. don&#39;t hate the player, hate the game) ... forcing some degree of transparency and accountability in these systems might raise prices a little bit, but the benefits would likely be immensely positive in the system overall.It&#39;s nice that the story is made personal, about a real individual (think: that Tom Hanks film about someone stuck in international airport limbo) but that&#39;s not really the story here is it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His ship has been sitting still for so long that you can see it on Google Maps:
https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%86%D...Edit: a few more story details here: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/19/ever-giv... When he rows to shore to get supplies he can only stay for two hours at most as the area is a restricted military zone. Other crew members were repatriated in September 2019, so Mohammad was not alone for 2 years but only for 7 months (which is no less unacceptable). The only reason Mohammad was allowed to leave was thanks to a local union representative who agreed to take his place as the ship’s guardian."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there something that could be done by people otherwise uninvolved - like myself, or my fellow HN readers - to help the other ~250 people who are currently stuck in similar situations?I don’t even know how to go about enumerating who those people are, their ships, or where they are anchored. With that information a well-organized and/or funded group could at least get someone out to these people to check on them, provide basic supplies, and perhaps some form of reliable communications.A lot of problems seem insurmountable large and complex, and even this one seems so if your goal is to free these people of their legal liabilities - but if you set aside trying to solve the reason they’re stuck onboard these ships in the first place, providing basic humanitarian aid to them seems doable.ETA: This looks like a good place to start - https://www.ilo.org/dyn/seafarers/seafarersbrowse.home"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case you don&#39;t know who Proctorio is:(like me)Apparently it&#39;s a supervision software that students are forced to install on their private computer and (as expected) it&#39;ll do its worst to invade your privacy and flag &#34;suspicious&#34; things, based on which the university might punish you.&#34;Suspicious&#34; here means wearing glasses [3] or looking around in the room or blinking too much [4] or having eye and/or skin colors [1] that are difficult for AI to track or reading questions out aloud [2]. Because everyone knows that a good student is white, sits in a bright room, and will continuously stare at his/her PC screen while thinking about a difficult math problem, I guess. WTF?I am so glad that this kind of abuse was not yet common when I was in university. I love sitting in the (dark) basement, it helps me concentrate. And I tend to close my eyes a lot because it helps me visualize the problem. I&#39;m sure this kind of misguided software would have failed me.And the worst part is: Bugs in this software will fail students in the real world. [4]So it is crucially important that this type of software receives a lot of scrutiny to make sure it works as planned. But it seems that Proctorio is suing this guy for doing exactly that: Documenting how the software is supposed to work by linking to Proctorio&#39;s YouTube videos.[1] https://twitter.com/uhreeb/status/1303139738065481728[2] https://www.insider.com/viral-tiktok-student-fails-exam-afte...[3] https://proctorio.com/frequently-asked-questions[4] https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/g2ub05/god_kicked_out_..."</p>

In the US, they tend to be red, and the word “EXIT”. Everyone else does green, with the man running through the door.In Japan, medical facilities were denoted by a green cross. In the US, it tends to be blue or red.Color can be an important factor, but that’s tangential to the Unicode set.[0] https://www.iso.org/news/2013/10/Ref1787.html"</p>

It was 100% not ready then as it wouldn&#39;t even boot into the desktop with my nvidia card.Is it actually ready now? Does it work with nvidia cards? Does GPU acceleration work with nvidia cards?

I&#39;m also well versed and shipped games in UE4.All I can say is working with Godot is an absolute bliss. Seriously, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s &#34;easy&#34; and it gets out of the way. Within a couple of weeks, you can be focusing on making your game, rather than a constantly evolving tech-demo.There are only two caveats: understand what Godot is not good at, 3D open world / large landscape, and console development.Godot 4.0 was a total mess the last time I tried it though. The Vulkan stuff was completely half baked and the UI was acting out. Godot 3.2 though, solid fun."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using tmux for quite a while, though at a fairly casual level.The first thing I noticed is that this interface is discoverable - it shows me what I can do, which is incredible and makes me want to use it. The main reason I&#39;ve been a casual tmux user and not an advanced one despite using it for years, is because every time I want to try something new I have to google if it&#39;s possible.The second thing I noticed is that it uses ctrl-r as a core shortcut. Mega problem: ctrl-r is a built-in bash feature which I use every day to recall previous commands. This makes me think I can&#39;t use this tool at all.I would suggest to consider taking a page from tmux&#39;s book. Just use a global modifier key. Ctrl-b is what tmux uses, so you know it&#39;s safe. Other software being developed knows they should avoid it, because tmux uses it. By also using it, you&#39;d no longer have to dance around the global space of what shortcuts every software in existence is using. Additionally, if you use ctrl-b to enable your commands, you can minimize your interface. Currently you&#39;re using two entire lines to display your menu. That&#39;s going to become tiring as I use zellij 8 hours a day for years. I&#39;ll have to hide it eventually. Instead, what if you reduced it to zero lines? Put &#34;ctrl-b: menu&#34; in the upper right of your title bar. Pressing ctrl-b now enables commands and shows what your next keypress will do. You have now (1) avoided breaking existing shortcuts, (2) aligned with established standards (3) given some familiarity to welcome tmux users (4) expanded visible screen space and (5) simplified your menu system. You can also now remove ctrl-g since the interface is &#34;locked&#34; by default until I want to start interacting with it.Anyway that&#39;s my 2 cents. Thanks for this exciting demo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love that the UI can be explored by the user, since it shows available keyboard shortcuts. This is something where GNU screen or tmux suck, because you really have to lookup how to operate these tools. In some manual or with google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure I could untrain all my muscle memory I&#39;ve built up over the years with my TMUX configuration, but I truly believe in the next 10 years all of my current command line tools will be slowly replaced with rust equivalents (with the exception of neovim). ripgrep and fzf are already a large part of my workflow, and I love seeing WebAssembly becoming the universal plug and play standard.&gt; Build a web client to allow users to connect to a running Zellij daemon through the browser (on a local or remote server).That&#39;s the future feature I&#39;m most interested in over TMUX."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty much any federal agency you have heard of has an investigative dept that employs federal special agents. These are law enforcement roles with the same training, authority, and responsibilities as investigative agents in the FBI, etc.They were created to meet the specific law enforcement needs of each agency. Dept of Education agents investigate misuse of Dept of Education funds, for example. The Postal Inspectors investigate illegal use of, or threats to, the mail system.After 9/11 a lot of these depts got new infusions of resources, and instructions to do a lot more information sharing. There was a feeling that the attacks of 9/11 could have been prevented if existing disparate info had been better collected and collated.So it’s not that surprising that these agencies will seem to stray out of their lanes. If Postal is monitoring broadly for threats against their systems, but sees other concerning info, they are supposed to share it.This is all intended to be explanatory; I’m not saying that it’s how things should be.I will say that personally I have fewer concerns about programs to monitor public content on the Internet, than programs that seek to access, monitor, and store content that people intended to be privately communicated to other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of sentiment today that the USPS is way out of its zone of expertise in doing this -- and that is possible.But it&#39;s worth noting that the USPS has had its own legion of postal inspectors going back to the 19th century, when they were a (comparatively) huge part of the U.S. government, and the FBI, etc. did not exist.Some 1,200 postal inspectors are still around, and they play important roles on federal prosecutions related to mail fraud, drug shipments, etc. There&#39;s a good Wikipedia entry on it all: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Inspectio..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a tough issue for a government. We do have crazies out there and we do need to investigate potential dangerous groups and individuals and reel them in before they do something crazy.On my FB feed I have seen friends and friends of friends call for armed revolt many times over the past few years. Most all of them are blowing steam and many are in their 60s or older and couldn&#39;t run a block in gym shorts, and much less if they were carrying any kind of real military gear, but they like to think they can. We all grew up with &#34;Rambo&#34; movies.But some of those who&#39;s comments I&#39;ve seen I don&#39;t know at all.The ordeal at our Capital proves there&#39;s a problem that needs to be monitored. Most of those who went there were not armed or dangerous, but there were enough kooks to cause some real damage and lives were lost. And last year we had the guy who blew himself and his motorhome up on a Downtown street.If we had another &#34;Timothy McVeigh&#34; event people would be howling, and if we had several they&#39;d be freaking out and demanding something be done.We all have good reason to be wary of &#34;Big Brother&#34; type surveillance but we also have to acknowledge that we have a problem with people getting crazy and shooting into crowds and blowing things up.There&#39;s not always a good solution to a shitty situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"[DISCLAMER: I used to work at Google in general, but not at Google Cloud]I&#39;m not sure whether this has been discussed here before, but I&#39;d love to take this forum to share an angle from the tech side of things:IMO, Google is _cursed_ to keep deprecating its products and services. It&#39;s cursed by Google&#39;s famous choice of mono-repo tech stack.It makes all the sense and has all the benefits. But at a cost: we had to keep every single line of code in active development mode. Whenever someone changed a line of code in a random file that&#39;s three steps away on your dependency chain, you will get a ticket to understand what has changed, make changes and fire up every tests (also fix them in 99% of the cases).Yeah, the &#34;Fuck You. Drop whatever you are doing because it’s not important. What is important is OUR time. It’s costing us time and money to support our shit, and we’re tired of it, so we’re not going to support it anymore.&#34; is kind of true story for internal engineers.We once had a shipped product (which took about 20-engineer-month to develop in the first place) in maintenance mode, but still requires a full time engineer to deal with those random things all the time. Would have save 90% of that person&#39;s time it it&#39;s on a sperate branch and we only need to focus on security patches. (NO, there is no such concept of branching in Google&#39;s dev system).We kept doing this for a while and soon realized that there is no way we can sustain this, especially after the only guys who understand how everything works switched teams. Thus, it just became obvious that deprecation is the only &#34;responsible&#34; and &#34;reasonable&#34; choice.Honestly, I think Google&#39;s engineering practice is somewhat flawed for the lack of a good solution to support shipped products in maintenance. As a result, there is either massively successful products being actively developed; or deprecated products."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in GCP support for over 4 years. My opinions are my own. I try to stay as impartial as I can about my employer. I know there are a lot of valid criticisms to be made about GCP. As one of the people often bearing the brunt of the fallout whenever there is a painful outage or deprecation, I share some of them.But it never gets easy to read posts like this. This one appears to be a collection of old hacker news posts. And I can&#39;t help but think about all the posts that are never written, submitted, or upvoted about every time someone had a good experience with support. No one talks about their GCE VMs with years of uptime.I&#39;ll spend hours on video calls with customers, going through logs, packet captures, perf profiles, core dumps, reading their code, conducting tests. Unpacking the tangled web until the problem is obvious. It&#39;s always a good feeling when we get to the end, and you get to reveal it like the end of a mystery novel. For me, that&#39;s the good part. Sometimes it takes a couple of hours. Sometimes weeks. Months even. And then the customer goes on with their life, as they should.That&#39;s how it always should work. But no one talks about when a process works the way it&#39;s supposed to. People want to read about failures. And trade their own analyses about why that failure happened and how Google is fundamentally broken for these N simple reasons.I don&#39;t want to diminish the negative stories as they are about people who went through real pain. I also realize that I&#39;m just one person, and I can only work with so many customers in my time here. I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going with this.I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, keep an open mind. This is a highly competitive field. There are strong incentives for GCP to listen to its customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know, seems to be mostly filled with speculation and anecdotes. I can find similar anecdotes of bad behavior by Amzon, for example claims of using AWS to steal its users&#39; business ideas[1].Admittedly, the original author&#39;s title of &#34;Why I distrust Google Cloud more than AWS or Azure&#34; much better describes their position than the editorialized title of the HN submitter (&#34;Why Google Cloud is less trustworthy than AWS or Azure&#34;).1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23929044"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It simulates real life pretty well:- I have an unread email in the inbox but I can&#39;t find it- The banks send me emails with no content in the body, some email glitch on their side- I tried to buy a property, lost my solicitor&#39;s fee but never got the property- There are no good jobs available except one underpaid junior position- I pay way too much in tax compared to what I make"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me a bit of &#34;The game of life&#34; back in the 90sOptimizing life for filling the savings account as fast as possible at the expense of everything else has consequences and your game should reflect this.You should have stats including your characters age, health, happiness and social skills and have some kind of social media app with your friends constantly trying to invite you out for concerts, nights out, dating? and so on so that you have constant distractions to spend your money on to make it more challenging. Not building up the happiness and social skills stats should have consequences. You should be able to buy a gym membership to keep your health stat from deteriorating.The consequences of not building up those stats early in your life is poor health, shit social skills and no friends except for the people you work with. But yay, you&#39;re a millionaire I guess?The real game of life is that it&#39;s all a balancing act between having your financial house in order while also having a fulfilling social life, health, and happiness"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played for around 10 minutes, quite fun. Some comments:- how would you get 4% gains in real life? it makes a massive difference, but you&#39;re unlikely to reach this unless the money is put into the stock market- was unable to sell my property (the &#34;request valuation&#34; button does nothing)- the university option never showed up- there were no further jobs after ~12 years of career (stopped at something like engineering manager at ~45k/year which is very low for London)- advancing month-by-month is pretty slow. there should be a way of fast-forwarding to important events (new job, promotion, housing market goes up/down, etc)- had to transfer $ to savings / pension in batches every year or so, losing out on a lot of interest. should be possible to set a monthly amount- the expenses are way too stable to reflect real lifeI ended the simulation at 35 years old, with €200k savings, €60k mortage equity, and €80k on a pension fund. Living on a €100k house, no car, no gifts, no travel, no family. It&#39;s not bad, but for someone saving fiercely from 18 years without any major expenses it&#39;s not a great result. Getting a high-paying job (80k+) around your 30s will land you in the exact same place, while giving you 12 years to live more liberally."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The professor gets exactly what they want here, no?&#34;We experimented on the linux kernel team to see what would happen. Our non-double-blind test of 1 FOSS maintenance group has produced the following result: We get banned and our entire university gets dragged through the muck 100% of the time&#34;.That&#39;ll be a fun paper to write, no doubt.Additional context:* One of the committers of these faulty patches, Aditya Pakki, writes a reply taking offense at the &#39;slander&#39; and indicating that the commit was in good faith[1].Greg KH then immediately calls bullshit on this, and then proceeds to ban the entire university from making commits [2].The thread then gets down to business and starts coordinating revert patches for everything committed by University of Minnesota email addresses.As was noted, this obviously has a bunch of collateral damage, but such drastic measures seem like a balanced response, considering that this university decided to _experiment_ on the kernel team and then lie about it when confronted (presumably, that lie is simply continuing their experiment of &#39;what would someone intentionally trying to add malicious code to the kernel do&#39;)?* Abhi Shelat also chimes in with links to UMN&#39;s Institutional Review Board along with documentation on the UMN policies for ethical review. [3][1]: Message has since been deleted, so I&#39;m going by the content of it as quoted in Greg KH&#39;s followup, see footnote 2[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH%2FfM%2FTsbmcZzwnX@kroah...[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/3B9A54F7-6A61-4A34-9EAC-95..."</p>

your University.Understandable from gkh, but I feel sorry for any unrelated research happening at University of Minnesota.EDIT: Searching through the source code[1] reveals contributions to the kernel from umn.edu emails in the form of an AppleTalk driver and support for the kernel on PowerPC architectures.In the commit traffic[2], I think all patches have come from people currently being advised by Kangjie Liu[3] or Liu himself dating back to Dec 2018. In 2018, Wenwen Wang was submitting patches; during this time he was a postdoc at UMN and co-authored a paper with Liu[4].Prior to 2018, commits involving UMN folks appeared in 2014, 2013, and 2008. None of these people appear to be associated with Liu in any significant way.[1]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/search?q=%22umn.edu%22[2]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/search?q=%22umn.edu%22&amp;typ...[3]: https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/[4]: http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~wenwen/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, that video made my day. This bit is key:&gt; &#34;For example, by including a specially formatted but otherwise innocuous file in an app on a device that is then scanned by Cellebrite, it’s possible to execute code that modifies not just the Cellebrite report being created in that scan, but also all previous and future generated Cellebrite reports from all previously scanned devices and all future scanned devices in any arbitrary way (inserting or removing text, email, photos, contacts, files, or any other data), with no detectable timestamp changes or checksum failures. This could even be done at random, and would seriously call the data integrity of Cellebrite’s reports into question.&#34;They&#39;ve may have just got a lot evidence collected using Cellebrite from phones with (or without) Signal installed on them thrown out of court.I don&#39;t recall the details, but there was an absolute unsubstantiated speculative and surely fictional rumor of at least one entirely theoretical zero-day non-gif formatted image file that exploited a similar class of vulnerability in what was probably not a market leading tool used tangentially for the same purposes, floating around well over a decade ago as well.I for one am very glad that these hypothetical issues have almost surely been fixed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cellebrite doesn&#39;t even have a bug bounty programme or contact to report their bugs.Last year I&#39;ve managed to gain partial access to one of their systems and it took me weeks emailing their internal email addresses to finally fix the bug. They were total ass about it.Now I&#39;ve got complete access to their entire database and I don&#39;t know what do. Can HN advise?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is truly a hacker’s retort.It attacks Cellebrite&#39;s ability to operate by casting doubt on the reports generated by the product that their customers may wish to use in court.It places them in legal peril from Apple, and removes any cover Apple would have to not take legal action. (I assume someone at Apple knew they were shipping their DLLs?)It makes a thinly-veiled threat that any random Signal user&#39;s data may actively attempt to exploit their software in the future and demonstrates that it&#39;s trivial to do so.edited to add a bonus one:Publish some data about what they are doing to help create a roadmap for any other app that doesn&#39;t want their data to be scanned."</p>

https://twitter.com/lorenterveen/status/1384955467051454466&gt; I do work in Social Computing, and this situation is directly analogous to a number of incidents on Wikipedia quite awhile ago that led to that community and researchers reaching an understanding on research methods that are and are not acceptable.and https://twitter.com/lorenterveen/status/1384966202301337603&gt; Yes! This was an IRB &#39;failure&#39;. Again, in my area of Social Computing, it&#39;s been clear for awhile that IRBs often do not understand the issues and the potential risks/harms of doing research in online communities / social media.An interesting question is IMHO who people actually tried to contact in the first round of this getting publicity (and I guess how many did so at all), and if leadership should thus have been aware earlier that there was controversy worth looking into."</p>

By only banning the &#34;US government&#34; in the &#34;purchase&#34; of the data, it doesn&#39;t prevent acquiring the same data from another governmental body (Canada buys the data and shares with US Intelligence community, suddenly &amp; mysteriously trade relations with Canada improve).So many loopholes, the bill becomes &#39;feel good&#39; legislation instead of effective legislation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat! I checked out your source code, and if there&#39;s one comment I have, it&#39;s the way you query for comments. Currently, response times are around 300-400 ms for just 79 bytes of data. That&#39;s likely because you recursively fetch nested comments from a serverless function, which potentially has to make multiple network request to talk to the database. Coincidentally, a past Disqus employee has a great write up on the faster solution (recursive CTE): https://cra.mr/2010/05/30/scaling-threaded-comments-on-djang...Regardless, great work!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I LOVE Prisma. I’ve used Django, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize,  Knex, and TypeORM in the past. all had rough edges that continually frustrated me or didn’t provide the functionality i needed.Prisma is different. It’s absolutely got rough edges, but the extremely strong type safety makes Sequelize look like a joke. The query engine itself, written in rust, combines and optimizes queries inside every tick of the event loop so GraphQL N+1 issues are a thing of the past.Also, the team and community behind it are amazing! I never thought having an active dev community behind an ORM would be important, but as the author of Sequelize-Typescript was forced to abandon it late last year and the author of TypeORM was also pretty much absent, Prisma was a breath of fresh air. I REALLY hope they can find a way to build a sustainable business out of it. Support packages, feature development contracts, something to keep them financially incentivized to keep making it better.Happy to answer any questions about my experience using it if anyone has any."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like ORMs, but Prisma is one of the better ones. It avoids a lot of shortcomings of popular ORMs. I hope they find a way to make it work as a company. I&#39;ve been following them over the years from the beginning of their journey through various pivots.To use an ORM effectively you must learn both the API of the ORM and SQL. It does not absolve you from learning SQL, which I think was one of the unstated attractions to junior developers. Then you have to map between the API of the ORM and how it translates that to SQL under the hood. Then you have to understand how it handles caching and sessions and how that all works under the hood. This has been the source of so much complexity and so many bugs over the years that I no longer think the benefits are worth the cost. As always, there are exceptions and caveats, but I now believe it&#39;s better to use SQL directly than to use an ORM. In general there is too much complexity in all the layers of abstraction in software development these days, and I think the industry is strangely blind to the consequences of this. Complexity is death to software, and it should not be taken on lightly. The entire craft of a software engineer boils down to eliminating complexity and simplifying problems, the better you can do that, the more productive an engineer you will be.[1][1] https://github.com/sqljoy/sqljoy/blob/master/docs/pages/orm...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“ Application developers should care about data – not SQL”Anyone who has been bitten by an ORM generating inefficient SQL (and subsequent having to learn and care about SQL) knows the above not to be true."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some people are quoting the recent Tesla safety report [1] as evidence that Autopilot is on average much safer than a human driver. This is a classic case of the Simpson&#39;s Paradox [2].On the first look it seems that Autopilot is 4x safer than driving without any safety features (1 accident every 4.19 million miles vs 0.978 million miles). However, the data used to compute the stats is different in two important ways:1. Autopilot cannot be always activated. This means that is some particularly difficult situations, the driver needs to drive himself. These are more dangerous situations in general.2. If a driver disengages Autopilot to avoid an accident and engages it again straight away on a 10 miles drive, then you will have 9.99 miles driven on Autopilot without accident. The statistic misses the cases where the human driver intervened to avoid an accident.This means that we are comparing the same measure (accidents) on different datasets and therefore in different conditions. This is dangerous, because it may lead us to wrong and often opposite conclusions (see Simpson&#39;s Paradox [2]).I&#39;m not saying that Autopilot isn&#39;t safer than a human driver, given that the driver is at the steering wheel and alert, but that this data doesn&#39;t lead to that conclusion. If the driver is not sitting at the driver seat, then it is certainly much more dangerous.[1] https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport
[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Authorities tried to contact Tesla for advice on putting out the fire; it’s not clear whether they received any response.This will become a massive issue in the years to come unless we find a way not only to drastically reduce the number of crashes but also massively improve reliability.High voltage battery fires are probably the worst kind of fire a regular emergency responder would have to deal with, between the hard to put out fire and the risk of electric shock. It also causes some massive damage to the surroundings (the actual road surface, surrounding cars, or any garage unfortunate to house the car at that time).Today very few emergency responders are even trained to properly deal with such a fire, and it&#39;s a topic really lagging behind everywhere compared to the rate EVs are popping up on the streets."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“They just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It’s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It’s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do.”Hmm, that seems like a rather stark contradiction.Elon I think has some character flaws and when people are dying it&#39;s not the time to be defensive. I&#39;m one of the least naturally empathetic people I know and yet I wouldn&#39;t be talking about anything other than condolences.Finally he can&#39;t continue to defend the term &#39;autopilot&#39; - in Public Communications, you&#39;re talking the masses, the lowest common denominator, and the &#39;laziest mode&#39; of even high functioning people - you gotta use words that will shape outcomes. &#39;Autopilot&#39; is just a bad choice - he needs to change it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great project, well done. Algorithmic music is fascinating to me, I feel like there&#39;s a lot of untapped potential in the concept particularly with more &#39;complex&#39; genres where higher levels of composition and structural continuity are required. This tends to work much better with loop-based genres but I&#39;d personally love to do a side project on something that could write melodies from some sort of generative grammar for example. A lot of these exist but the results are mixed very often.For me the interesting part is not just in getting a computer to do all the work but using it as a compositional aide. You can think of it at writing music at a higher level of abstraction. Rather than writing a score you can write the rules of the score and use a stochastic process to spit out permutations for example. Eg imagine writing a program that could spit out Eric Satie-esque melodies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This generates much better patterns than any other music web project I&#39;ve tried. Awesome work.If you had no music experience, snuck into a club, impersonated a DJ, and just pressed play on this, I think even without touching it, no one would notice anything&#39;s amiss. If you messed around with it occasionally, you&#39;d probably get hired back. (And that&#39;s a compliment to the app; definitely not a diss of acid techno.)"</p>

Since it will just notify a thief that the bike they just stole is being tracked, and they can look for the AirTag and throw it in the nearest trash can?Not criticizing Apple here -- anti-stalking is super-important -- but just looking for clarification if this will help you find lost items, but not stolen ones."</p>

If the choice had been made 8 years ago to make Kibana less-permissively licensed, it&#39;s very likely Grafana wouldn&#39;t exist right now.And for historical fun, here&#39;s the first commit from Torkel after the fork from Kibana v3:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I applaud this decision.I would like to see all major SaaSS projects be AGPLv3. End users still have freedom to user, modify, and distribute the software. Cloud providers must share contributions.This is how I like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t want to weigh in here with a huge value judgement on whether this is the right decision. However, I do want to say that what they&#39;re saying regarding SSPL vs AGPL is totally right. One of the biggest sticking points with SSPL is that it&#39;s not even really plausibly open source, and it tries to create restrictions that implicate software that is not even &#34;linked&#34; with the program that is licensed under it, which calls into question whether it&#39;s even legally enforceable.[1]AGPL is somewhat controversial, but the reasoning for AGPL to exist is chiefly to protect the end user&#39;s rights, however misguided that may be in your opinion. In this case Grafana presumably retains the copyright to these programs, so presumably they are not beholden to these restrictions in any way. On the other hand, though, it does mean that other providers will have to distribute their patches back to the community, which is pretty much the entire goal of copyleft open source in the first place.In any case, this is, in my opinion, a lot better than SSPL or the Timescale license.[1]: https://www.processmechanics.com/2018/10/18/the-server-side-...edit: wording regarding AGPL was changed, because the claim that considering AGPL as not open source is “somewhat controversial” isn’t quite accurate; it’s more correct to say the license itself is simply controversial."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking as an 18 y.o. doing my first year college online, I wouldn&#39;t have made it through quarantine without Discord. I&#39;ve a server with my high school friends and since Discord lowers the barrier to join a voice call so much it&#39;s super chill to just hop in a channel when doing homework or playing a game or whatever else, and anyone else who&#39;s free can join.I really wish there were competition, but there&#39;s nothing AFAIK that can replicate this particular experience except for Teamspeak, which has other problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s crazy to me to think how TeamSpeak and Ventrilo had more than a decade to iterate and never came up with something like Discord. Xfire came close multiple times, but never got the voice part right, though for the time the client was acceptable.Granted, the server model was very different for TS and Vent (more so the latter), but it was normal then. Kudos to the Discord team on making a solid product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Discord does not give users a choice to opt-out of their wildly invasive data collection methods including logging executables running on your system while the desktop client is open, not just games. This data alone is very valuable.Comment from a 2019 support thread &#34;I am pretty flabbergasted that people aren&#39;t making a bigger deal of this than they are. Discord actively monitors your executables, but the larger concern for people now seems to be its inaccuracy in identifying them as games. As if to say &#34;make it better at identifying games&#34; instead of &#34;stop scanning my programs&#34;.&#34;https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/3600307..."</p>

It&#39;s likely that &#39;smart&#39; people are just as likely to be unaware of their own follies or inabilities, I would argue, maybe more so as a lot of smart people tend to be &#39;inwardly focused&#39; and less concerned about their direct environment.This kind of thing happens all the time among Exec. level, but normally we&#39;d expect it from Ford CEO, not Google types. It may be an odd sign of industry maturity.That said, we shouldn&#39;t discount how often this kind of stuff actually does work. Watching the crowd at the Oracle conf. eat up Larry Ellison&#39;s huffery as through he was some kind of market visionary was the lesson at the other end of the spectrum, and it&#39;s that &#39;If you&#39;re rich and stand on stage and say something that &#39;sounds credible&#39;, a lot of people with just believe it&#39;. Of course there&#39;s more to it than that.But this one is Comedy Gold.It might be a sign that Susan does not have a fully trusted team around her ...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think people here are fundamentally misunderstanding what happened here. There is a nonprofit, the &#34;Freedom Forum Institute&#34; that awarded this award. Only the award ceremony was sponsored by YouTube. It&#39;s common practice for nonprofits to use awards like this as an opportunity to ask for donations, and for the company associated with that person to offer to sponsor the awards ceremony.I don&#39;t see anything to indicate that this award was created by YouTube or that YouTube decided to award this to her."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Do Spotify actually manage to sell any significant number of subscriptions due to podcasts?Personally when ever I hear about an interesting podcast, and it&#39;s followed by &#34;available on Spotify/Podimo, whatever&#34;, my reaction is always: Okay, never mind then.There are so many great podcasts on the open web. Those available on platforms like Spotify always seems to be people with existing celebrity status trying to &#34;cash in&#34;. Those shows are rarely that interesting, and even if they are there are so many competitors.Assuming you have an existing successful podcast, I don&#39;t get why you&#39;d move to something like Spotify. Are you really going to make that much more money? Your share of $10 per month cannot be high. Of cause it Spotify throws a large sum at you, to effectively buy your listeners, then I see the profit motive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Joe who?Seriously, I think that there are a number of reasons why this won&#39;t pan out as predicted:- There aren&#39;t really any tent-pole, must listen podcasts. They thought Joe Rogan was one but I&#39;m hearing a lot of people have stopped listening to him on Spotify (I have).- Spotify (and others) don&#39;t have the money to buy out the whole podcast ecosystem and many podcast makers I think would resist going Spotify exclusive.- I like my podcast player a lot and there is no way I&#39;m giving it up for the inferior Spotify experience.I see podcasting as being more like YouTubing - sure there are outfits generating substantial revenue from advertising but many have more diverse revenue streams and reaching the largest audience is more important that an uplift in advertising revenue. Plus not everyone on YouTube is there for the $$$"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post is essentially a funding pitch for Spotify. I talks a lot about they are going to try and kill the open podcast ecosystem but no evidence that they are making any progress. The podcast ecosystem is very different from other media markets-- it started open, it grew up open, and people are actually willing to directly pay content producers either for bonus content, to avoid ad reads, or just to keep the train chugging along. 
I immediately  unsub from any podcast where there is some jarring dynamic ad insertion. I&#39;ve watch all of the once great Gimlet podcasts wither, and some die since their acquisition.Yea there is a market for the low-est common denominator stuff like low-brow true crime stuff and the joe rogans, but I don&#39;t see those as competition, either for sponsors or ears to the healthy, robust, mature open podcast ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; There’s no evidence that the deal directly affects coverage in either the news or editorial departments. Before the Facebook News deal, the Times famously published an op-ed titled “It’s Time to Break Up Facebook,” by Chris Hughes, a cofounder of Facebook turned critic. And since the deal, columns from Tim Wu and Kara Swisher, among others, have been similarly critical. In December, the editorial board welcomed a lawsuit calling for Facebook to be broken up.It&#39;s kind of a throwaway passage in the article but it feels like a crucial point. Maybe I&#39;m wrong but &#34;buying off&#34; to me strongly suggests something along the lines of a bribe. We&#39;re going to give you this cash, nudge nudge, wink wink, maybe that negative stuff you print about us goes away. My question is: is this actually happening?The core conflict here isn&#39;t new, surely. Newspapers have taken advertising money from news-making companies since time immaterial. The question has always been whether that money affects coverage. And so far it seems like &#34;no&#34;, or &#34;not yet&#34;. And there&#39;s a very worthy debate to be had here, much as there always has been about advertising in news media, but the headline doesn&#39;t do that debate justice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is worth remembering the Australia fiasco. The Australian media led by Murdoch basically shook down Facebook until they came to am agreement to give the media kickbacks. Then Australia agreed not to apply its law.The European media has also demanded payments, even though the value flows from sending traffic to news sites and not the other way around.The media seems to believe it is entitled to be send traffic AND to be paid for it. Common story all over the world.So, to reduce those demands in America, Facebook pays kickbacks to the biggest media orgs.Here, the media publication is presenting it as a grant for favourable coverage. But the far more likely explanation is Facebook knows the media will shake it down for more money unless it gives them a payoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s always been the case that big advertisers influence the media that cover them. In the quaint old days there was a metaphorical &#34;wall&#34; between the business side and the news side, and neither could influence there other. In theory, that is. In practice, at a high enough level, the wall was less of a 16&#39; fence topped with razor wire and more like police tape.Of course, we don&#39;t live in the quaint old days. There&#39;s no distinction between news as journalism and news as business. Writers are measured not on how good their reporting is, but on how much &#34;engagement&#34; it gets, which is just a proxy for how profitable.Is it a bribe or buyoff? Or just a failure of credibility? Newspapers used to have a position called the ombudsman to address just this scenario. The New York Times had a position called Public Editor. That position was eliminated in 2017[1]1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_editor"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The semiconductor supply chain is now almost completely disaggregated ie everyone specialises in just a small part of the value chain. ARM’s speciality is in CPU design and it has carved out for itself the enviable position of being the defacto standard for mobile applications - almost every single phone on the planet has ARM processor(s) running it. And their products are in dozens of other end applications segments as well. These chips are embedded in System on Chip IC’s and manufactured by third party companies like TSMC and UMC etc to end customer specifications, like Apple or Samsung for example.The problem with the original SoftBank deal, and now the Nvidia deal, is that these companies will simply hollow ARM out (slash R&amp;D, cut staff etc) to pump up the target’s value, before flogging it off or breaking it up. The stock market doesn’t value synergies, although it is quite happy to punt this aspect when M&amp;A deals are in the offing.  Given its strategic position as the defacto standard for mobile comms, that’s a serious threat.ARM also gives the UK strategic leverage in any trade negotiations. Would we knowingly allow Rolls-Royce Jet Engines to be flogged off? No. Ditto ARM.So, I think this is the right policy and hopefully the government will see fit to step into other deals like this and block them.I’ve been through a PE acquisition. We were stripped bare and bits sold off before finally getting our mojo back. I benefited handsomely but we were not the company we were before and the job losses in the process were huge. It will be no different with Nvidia’s proposed take over of ARM.(disclaimer: I was a semiconductor executive in a global MNC)."</p>

They probably see the need now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe this has been Microsoft&#39;s guidance as far back as 2016, with the caveat of using Azure AD risk analysis /MFA.[1]&gt;Password expiration policies do more harm than good, because these policies drive users to very
predictable passwords composed of sequential words and numbers which are closely related to each
other (that is, the next password can be predicted based on the previous password). Password change
offers no containment benefits cyber criminals almost always use credentials as soon as they
compromise them.&gt;Mandated password changes are a long-standing security practice, but current research strongly
indicates that password expiration has a negative effect. Experiments have shown that users do not
choose a new independent password; rather, they choose an update of the old one. There is evidence to
suggest that users who are required to change their passwords frequently select weaker passwords to
begin with and then change them in predictable ways that attackers can guess easily.&gt;One study at the University of North Carolina found that 17% of new passwords could be guessed given
the old one in at most 5 tries, and almost 50% in a few seconds of un-throttled guessing. Furthermore,
cyber criminals generally exploit stolen passwords immediately.[1]https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Agreed - there&#39;s so much I find frustrating about how companies manage passwords in addition to mandatory changing.- Maximum length requirements (often secret until you try to put a password in)- Requiring some symbols, but not others- Silent truncation of the the password without telling you- Failure because the password is too long, but the error says something else (like missing symbol)This isn&#39;t just small unknown companies either. If you use a password longer than 32chars in Zoom when creating your account it just truncates the remaining without telling you. Login works on the websites, but if you try to login via the client it fails. If I manually backspace to 32chars it works. I tried to tell it to their US Twitter support and they just kept sending me a password reset link so I gave up (they&#39;re a bad company anyway [0]). Tmobile&#39;s website used to do the same thing, except worse because it would truncate on creation but not on validation.How is this not standardized in some sane way?An old credit union I was part of in NY (SEFCU) mandated passwords with exactly 6 characters. When I complained about this I was told it was secure because they forced one of the characters to be a symbol.[0]: https://zalberico.com/essay/2020/06/13/zoom-in-china.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article kinda misses the reason why mandatory password changes existed in the first place -- unknown breaches. The idea was that if there was an undetected breach, the attacker would have a maximum of the mandatory password change to use credentials. You would still have mandatory password changes upon discovering a breach, which would reset the counter.  And the article wasn&#39;t very clear as to why this is no longer recommended, but when mandatory password changes are enforced, users tend to make new passwords which are trivial to crack if you have a known old password. So if there&#39;s an unknown (or even known) breach, users will tend to make a new password which an attacker can easily guess given the older known passwords, losing any benefit gained from mandatory password changes. And this is worse than not having mandatory password changes, because rare password changes (when a breach is discovered) don&#39;t put people into the habit of just iterating off of an old password."</p>

At least, it seems like we’re good at it. Why can I read that font or that calligraphy? It’s almost an abomination, haha. Yet my brain troops on, parsing and processing, turning those squiggles back into what it knows.Truly fascinating stuff. I also enjoy the back story here. Exploring written language as a kid was a lot of fun. I settled on a strange way of writing, not much unlike the runes on the inside of the ring in the LOTR movies, and it was entirely arbitrary and almost an artistic decision. Totally impractical.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s very exciting!A nit:&gt;  For example, I have not encountered hardware for reading vertex attributes or uniform buffer objects. The OpenGL and Vulkan specifications assume dedicated hardware for each, so what’s the catch?That is not my understanding of those specs (as someone that&#39;s written graphics drivers). Uniform Buffer Objects are not a &#34;hardware&#34; thing. They&#39;re just a way to communicate uniforms faster than one uniform per API call. What happens on the backend is undefined by those specs and is not remotely tied to some hardware implementation. Vertex Attributes might have been a hardware thing long ago but. I&#39;m pretty sure there are older references but this 9yr old 2012 book already talks about GPUs that don&#39;t have hardware based vertex attributes.https://xeolabs.com/pdfs/OpenGLInsights.pdf chapter 21"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great work—I&#39;m glad to see this being tackled with such speed.From the Phoronix comments on this post[0]:&gt; I have an idea. Why not support exclusively Vulkan, and then do the rest using Zink (that keeps getting faster and faster)?&gt; This way you could finish the driver in one year or two.(For context: Zink is an OpenGL to Vulkan translator integrated into Mesa)I had the same thought in my mind—Zink is 95% the speed of Intel&#39;s OpenGL driver[1], so why not completely ignore anything but Vulkan? On the Windows side, dxvk (DirectX to Vulkan) already is much faster (in most cases) than Microsoft&#39;s DX9-11 implementation, so it&#39;s completely feasible that Zink could become faster than most vendors&#39; OpenGL implementation.I have no knowledge of low-level graphics, so I don&#39;t know the ease of implementing the two APIs. I could envision, however, that because this GPU was never designed for OpenGL, there may be some small optimizations that could be made if Vulkan was skipped.[0]: https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/phoronix/latest-phoron...[1]: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Zink-95-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So there are two issues with this:1. If I were looking to hire someone and read this, I would immediately be turned off. Why? Because part of being an engineer (or any employee really) is doing a bunch of stuff people don&#39;t enjoy doing. This includes:- Writing documentation- Writing tests- Fixing bugs- Talking to partners about a change/launch- Talking to lawyers- etcSo I would be wondering: if you&#39;re signaling you don&#39;t want to do those things, that means someone else will need to do all that for your code, which is not great for them and tends to be much worse.Like you&#39;re basically saying you want to cherrypick the parts you enjoy and not give a damn about anything else. You might say you&#39;re only costing $1/hour but the risk of a bad engineer can mean you&#39;re still expensive or a loss.2. You don&#39;t factor in the time cost of me or my team in onboarding you, dealing with you, dealing with your code and so on. That&#39;s a big part of the filtering in hiring. People are deciding if they can justify that time investment and the opportunity cost involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you expect the interesting work to land in your lap you are either one of those people that redefine (maybe invent) entire fields of research or you&#39;re incredibly lucky. In other words, your work speaks for itself and people want to give you more of it. For most people we need a job in order to keep up with the rising costs of living.If, however, you&#39;re like 99.99% of people and are good at what you do then you&#39;ll have to find what is interesting about the job. I&#39;ve worked at a company that replaced clipboards with iPads in a factory. If all it was to me was a form-builder application and the technology under it I would have been turned off ages ago. But I was incredibly curious as to why the product as successful and growing, what our customers liked about it, and I pushed for developers to visit the factories and see how people used the app. The results were quite surprising and it fed out team with dozens of ideas.Technology for technology&#39;s sake is fun for a while but will eventually bore you. It helps to have a reason to work on what you do. Which I think is part of what OP is saying but I think  you can find the reason in a &#34;boring&#34; job as well. You just have to be curious and look for it.Although avoiding working at feature factories where the developers are just cogs in a Kafka-esque Agile Machine is a whole other can of worms. The OP&#39;s strategy seems like an interesting way to avoid it. Best of luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been on the receiving end of similar requests before.“I’ll work for free or nothing if you let me do what I love under the umbrella of your organization because I love it so much.”I did one or two agreements like this and then stopped altogether. The individual would start their work, others would start to depend on its existence and the individual would leave in a matter or weeks or months because something else better came along for them. There was no incentive to keep the relationship going over a longer term. My organization just wasn’t setup to see any upside to short lived but high quality team members.Is there anyone out there who does work agreements like this currently and benefits from them? Would love to hear more details. Perhaps that feedback could help Franceso with his pitch.Franceso please come back in a week and let us know what kinds of offers you received. Will be very interested to see where this goes."</p>

It won&#39;t come untied by itself, ever.  But you can untie it by tugging on the tails of the laces.  You can do this one with a thumb on the initial bend, unlike the &#34;bunny ears&#34; style knots.It&#39;s a hell of a lot better than the &#34;double knot&#34; your kids&#39; teachers will do if they go to school with any kind of single knot, square or not.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a primer for music theory, this post doesn&#39;t teach much. It&#39;s using Python to derive various sets of notes in scales and modes, which is already easily available via google search, and in a more learnable format than Python code.The most basic aspect of Western music theory overlooked here is the relationship between tonic and dominant. If you know the &#34;home&#34; chord aka &#34;the I&#34; aka &#34;tonic&#34; is C major, the dominant will be G major, aka the V chord. Add just the F major chord, and you&#39;ll know 1-4-5 in a &#34;basic&#34; key: C major. 1-4-5 is the simplest chord progression, you can play amazing grace, you are my sunshine, even The Beatles, you&#39;ll be rocking with 1-4-5.Next level, if you add in the minor 6 (a minor) and minor 2 (d minor), you realistically know 95% of the chords you&#39;ll ever hear in C major pieces. And on the piano, this is ALL white notes, so even someone with zero musical knowledge can &#34;solo&#34; over your chords by just plunking any white notes while you play these chords (kids LOVE LOVE this btw, highly recommend trying with a kiddo).I wouldn&#39;t consider double-sharps and double-flats &#34;basic&#34; music theory. They really aren&#39;t needed for beginners, since they&#39;re relegated to keys like C# major where you&#39;ll occasionally sharpen a note like E# (aka F) into E## (aka F#). I didn&#39;t run into these until around 5 years into my piano training, playing Chopin&#39;s F# major nocturne Op 15 No 2, there&#39;s a bunch of double sharps in that piece.In any case, don&#39;t worry about double-flats and double-sharps or the precise notes of various modes and scales. Just learn pieces you enjoy, preferably with a mentor or teacher who can suggest improvements based on their trained ear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It can be tricky to deal with the intersection of music and programming. For example:&gt; The chromatic scale is the easiest scale possibleSo far so good-- in both programming and music we&#39;re just stepping through the smallest values (half step for music, the integer &#34;1&#34; in programming). So &#34;easy&#34; definitely applies to both domains.&gt; We can generate a chromatic scale for any given key very easilyFor programming, sure-- you just find your offset and go to town.For music, however, this is a wrong warp. The chromatic scale is a special case of a symmetric scale which cannot be transposed. There&#39;s literally only one such scale-- each transposition brings you back to the same exact set of pitch classes.Figuring out what it means to have a chromatic scale &#34;for a given key&#34; is advanced music theory. In fact, I can only think of a few places where that makes sense:* studying the complex harmony of late-19th century Romantic music* studying the choice of accidentals in chromatic passages of Bach, Beethoven, etc. to infer the implied harmonyThose are important things, but they are definitely advanced concepts.Long story short for programming, the author moves logically from an array to stepping through an array. But in terms of music, they start with the simplest possible scale and then jump to a third year undergrad theory concept."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are maybe three aspects to music theory:(1) Theory of how things sound like: Tones, melodies, scales, chords, based on the frequencies of individual sounds.(2) How to name things.(3) How to handle the mess of naming things in Western music theory, where things have 12 different names, depending on which note you choose as the base.This post seems to focus on 3."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You&#39;ve discovered what many other people have: The cloud is the new time-share mainframe.Programming in the 1960s to 80s was like this too. You&#39;d develop some program in isolation, unable to properly run it. You &#34;submit&#34; it to the system, and it would be scheduled to run along with other workloads. You&#39;d get a printout of the results back hours later, or even tomorrow. Rinse and repeat.This work loop is incredibly inefficient, and was replaced by development that happened entirely locally on a workstation. This dramatically tightened the edit-compile-debug loop, down to seconds or at most minutes. Productivity skyrocketed, and most enterprises shifted the majority of their workload away from mainframes.Now, in the 2020s, mainframes are back! They&#39;re just called &#34;the cloud&#34; now, but not much of their essential nature has changed other than the vendor name.The cloud, just like mainframes:- Does not provide all-local workstations. The only full-fidelity platform is the shared server.- Is closed source. Only Amazon provides AWS. Only Microsoft provides Azure. Only Google provides GCP. You can&#39;t peer into their source code, it is all proprietary and even secret.- Has a poor debugging experience. Shared platforms can&#39;t generally allow &#34;invasive&#34; debugging for security reasons. Their sheer size and complexity will mean that your visibility will always be limited. You&#39;ll never been able to get a stack trace that crosses into the internal calls of the platform services like S3 or Lambda. Contrast this with typical debugging where you can even trace into the OS kernel if you so choose.- Are generally based on the &#34;print the logs out&#34; feedback mechanism, with all the usual issues of mainframes such as hours-long delays."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in the AWS world for 4+ years now and my immediate feedback is don&#39;t run any local emulators. None!
Write unit tests for the internals and test your system end-to-end. I say that both because AWS services can have unpredictable behavior that you need to account for but also because local emulators are at best functional, but in reality far from emulating the AWS world on a 1:1 scale (especially the unpredictable behaviors i mentioned). So instead optimize for many local unit tests and many live end-to-end tests (implies many deployments and parallel environments prod, staging, dev, etc)When it comes to Lambdas, given the reasons above, there&#39;s only one thing that can improve the experience: PROXY. Before i went on parental leave i had the idea is creating a proxy lambda which can be configured with an IP and port number. That IP and port is for your local dev environment. This way, when developing you can instruct a live system to short-circuit and to proxy calls to a local lambda available om the respective port. Trigger end-to-end tests by invoking AWS services that will eventually call the proxy lambda, and then your local lambda with the same environment/context/input, reply with output which will reach the proxy lambda, which will output the same content forward."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Think of the history of data access strategies to come out of Microsoft. ODBC, RDO, DAO, ADO, OLEDB, now ADO.NET – All New! Are these technological imperatives? The result of an incompetent design group that needs to reinvent data access every goddamn year? (That’s probably it, actually.) But the end result is just cover fire. The competition has no choice but to spend all their time porting and keeping up, time that they can’t spend writing new features. Look closely at the software landscape. The companies that do well are the ones who rely least on big companies and don’t have to spend all their cycles catching up and reimplementing and fixing bugs that crop up only on Windows XP.&#34; - Fire And Motion, Joel on SoftwareIn my own work with serverless I think about this a lot. In my day job, we built a new service and we pay AWS a few dollars per month to run. It would have cost us around $100 a month in AWS costs. However, the operational complexity is extremely high and we are also coupled to another service via Kinesis. For a billion dollar business, the trade off doesn&#39;t seem worth it.I wonder how much of serverless is just AWS firing at Google (and Heroku, DO, etc) and other competitors. It certainly hasn&#39;t made my life as a developer easier. It&#39;s certainly much cheaper for some use cases but the complexity of the system goes up very quickly, and you&#39;re end up having to manage a lot of that complexity using an inferior tool like Cloud Formation (or Terraform)."</p>

It would be very cool if you could run a livebook inside of a sandboxed checkout (a temporary transaction) and write your db changes, then write your code that verifies that the db is in a state that you want it to be in.  If you mess up your code, then you just terminate the transaction without committing.  Then when you&#39;re happy with your notebook, you run it once with a commit at the end, and then save your notebook immutably in your records so that you can keep track of what you&#39;ve done.I think for intervening in prod, it would be very cool if someone could figure out how to extend erlang distribution over websockets so you don&#39;t have to figure out complicated mechanisms (open up ssh port, forward encrypted epmd, e.g.) to get into your system in prod"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is great.The fact is can connect to existing nodes also makes it can also be great for operation and administration - instead of building an awkward admin panel, you can just having a collection of scripts.The Elixir community is insanely productive. Also, the Elixir system is impressively pretty balanced - productivity-wise like Rails, concurrent-wise like Erlang, and continuously brings novel yet practical ideas to life in a robust manner!"</p>

  - Minute 23: Live collaborate on a single notebook
  - Minute 22: Visual indication that cell is stale after an upstream cell changes"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Why is this bad? As the Electronic Frontier Foundation explains in their post “Google’s FLoC is a terrible idea“, placing people in groups based on their browsing habits is likely to facilitate employment, housing and other types of discrimination, as well as predatory targeting of unsophisticated consumers.All of this has been happening with tracking cookies, fingerprint tracking, pixel tracking and so on. And will continue to happen.I find it so bizarre it took Google to talk about phasing out 3rd party cookies and replacing it with a much lesser technology in the face of FLoC, for people to suddenly be all up in arms about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am hopeful that this will help get rid of FLoC but I worry about two things. One, this will end up being treated like the &#34;no track&#34; headers. That&#39;s just totally ignored after IE (was it IE?) enabled it be default. That gave all the trackers a reason to just ignore it and track everyone. I don&#39;t know if that exact same thing can happen here, but something similar maybe? The other thing I worry about is that FLoC 2.0 or whatever might replace it, will be worse.&#34;Kill it before it lays eggs.&#34; but do we worry about what evolves from this if it dies?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A comment in the WP post brings up the malicious nature of FLOC opt-out - it requires base layer changes to your site. Google knows from Samesite that it requires &#34;your app is going to break&#34; levels of urgency to get old sites to update, and can likely follow the dots to how an opt-out is much less likely to be used than an opt in.This feels like something that should get more attention/discussion. It flew for Samesite because &#34;better security defaults&#34; is a good argument. Not sure it works that way for FLOC.Despite being involved in the Samesite rollout I hadn&#39;t quite made the same connection as that commenter, as I am not as connected to the FLOC work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Take a binary array of length N, where N is in the hundreds to thousands range. Choose 2% of the bits to set to 1. Now you have a &#34;sparse array&#34;.Now, you want to use this sparse array to represent a note in a song. So you need every note to consistently map to a distinct* sparse array.However, you also want to be able distinguish a note as being in one song or another. The representation should tell you not only that this is note A but note A in song X.How might you do that? Well some portion of the ON bits could be held consistent for every A note and some could be used to represent specific contexts.Stable and variable bits of you will.Now if you look at two representations of the note A from two songs you&#39;ll see they&#39;re different. How different are they? Well you could just count the bits they have in common or not, or you can treat them as vectors. (Lines in high dimensional space) Then you can calculate the angle between those two lines. As that angle increases its easier to distinguish the two lines. They won&#39;t ever get to full &#34;right angles&#34; between them because of the shared stable bits, but they can be more or less orthogonal.That&#39;s what&#39;s happening here. The brain is encoding notes in a way that it can both recognize A, but also recall it in different contexts.*But not perfectly consistent, we use sparse representations because the brain is noisy and it&#39;s more energy efficient. Pretty close is good enough in the brain and you can encode a lot of values in 1000 choose 20 options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really would have been harder for me to understand had I not taken linear and abstract algebra courses a few years ago. That area of maths reused common words like &#34;rotation&#34; but with more generalized definitions, which made it was jarring and confusing to hear and take in at the time. When someone said the word &#34;rotate&#34; my mind as if by reflex was already trying visualize a 3d or 2d rotation even when it made no sense for the problem at hand. Being an English speaker my whole life I thought I understood what a rotation was or could be but I didn&#39;t.Same goes for what&#39;s being alleged here: Is there even a way to visualize this that makes mathematical sense?
What will be the corollaries to this discovery simply as a result of what the mathematics of rotations will dictate?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something to keep in mind though is that in a high-dimensional space, approximate orthogonality of independent vectors is almost guaranteed."</p>

I noticed however that the verification email that gets sent to you after you register has the name/address of &#39;webmaster@local&#39; rather than &lt;username&gt;@projectlovelace.net.Speaking of registration, it would be nice if we could log in using our Google accounts (ie. Sign in with &lt;service&gt;), rather than make another account with your site.Also it would be nice if the site picked up your preferred language of choice after you&#39;ve done at least one of the problems. I like coding in javascript, but I have to select it from the dropdown list each time I go into a problem to solve, and sometimes I forget to do so (defaulting to Python instead)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really nice! When I was in college we had all sorts of online systems that automatically graded assignments based on how close to the correct answer your supplied answer was. I think it&#39;d be nice if in the future there was more of an overlap between science classes and programming classes (almost like a freshman / junior level scientific computation class) where instead of approaching problems from a pure theoretical perspective, we involved these types of computational approaches in parallel. Personally I have found that while I often know how to perform various theoretical computations, it&#39;s faster for me to just throw together a quick script to approximate the result (e.g. what&#39;s the expected value of the product of two gaussians?)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like I&#39;ve seen this cycle a few times now. Around the 2010-2013 time Firefox was pretty popular and the browser wars had cooled down a bit, various standards had progressed to the point where the web was mostly the same for Firefox users and Chrome users.Then Google Docs, Drive, Voice and a few other apps with the addition of Chromebooks started to appear and all of the sudden a few key features stopped working for Firefox. Probably the most important teachable moment was just how few features it takes to flip users.Maybe we&#39;ll see Firefox regain browser share are users dump Chrome. Edge even has a shot at this point - a strange irony bringing us full circle.I guess the real question is how long until we iterate on this loop again? What will compel users to jump back into the embrace of &lt;insert not yet but eventually evil company&gt; versus the relatively consistent arms of Mozilla.Also, FWIW, Mozilla isn&#39;t innocent either. Despite being very much _less scummy_ they have still upped their scum factor a bit over the years. Let&#39;s not forget they are quite happy to trade millions of dollars to make Google the homepage for their users. While nowhere near as egregious they have some tracking happening (&#34;experiments&#34;), they aggressively push their Firefox Accounts stuff, appear to be selling spots on the homepage tabs, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t use Chrome and don&#39;t use other browser based on Chromium either. As long as Google&#39;s engine has 85%+ market share, they can just unilaterally do whatever they want to the web.Use Firefox if you actually want to fix the web."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just a rant and not very helpful for anyone that gets redirected here. I can’t really see anyone that care about their visitors doing this.Do as the good old times when we showed a banner to IE users below a certain version, and suggest better alternatives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone actively managing investment portfolios, a deep understanding of the Kelley criterion is very important. For example, it is common practice to use &#34;Half Kelly&#34; to size positions, but most sources only provide a hand-wavey intuitive explanation. Thorp&#39;s paper[2] quantifies the benefits for any fraction of the &#34;full Kelly&#34; bet and its implications.  In addition to Poundstone&#39;s book [1] I strongly recommend Ed Thorp&#39;s highly readable paper[2].[1] Poundstone, William (2005), Fortune&#39;s Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street,
[2]https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090320125959/http://www..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kelly himself ended up using 1/n for his own personal portfolio management.Gerd Gigerenzer has a lot to say about how harmful this model has been to finance and the world, because it creates &#34;false certainty&#34;.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26325425 has further discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many here are correct that the Kelly criterion is relatively useless compared to standard portfolio management techniques for a basket of assets.However... I will say that it&#39;s incredible useful when deciding on more high risk bets based on binary outcomes which is not something portfolio managers would dream of doing for their clients. Consider a long dated call spread on the SPY that goes out to 12/2023.Say you think the SPY will be over $600. Today, for $140 of risk, you stand to make $1,860 if you&#39;re right if you buy a $570 call and sell a $590.This is exactly what Kelly was made for.The proper strategy, IMO, is to find a comfortable allocation for trades of this sort as a portion of an overall portfolio (Say 1-2%), then of that percentage use Kelly to allocate capital to different bets of this nature to lower the variance.So sure, Kelly isn&#39;t useful for portfolio management writ large, but for managing a portfolio of binary trades, it&#39;s a useful metric."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve thought about this since last year, and I can’t understand how this proposal has been able to survive this long.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I worked at eBay, we had a bonus program based on company revenue.  It was around 6% of your salary max and managers got around 25% max based on the same formula.  For the first few years, you could count on getting a max bonus every quarter.  To the point where most everyone who worked there had always gotten one.And the one quarter, we didn&#39;t get the max bonus.  In fact, I don&#39;t think we got it all.  People screamed and yelled and were pissed.  At the company all hands they spent a lot of time explaining that bonuses weren&#39;t guaranteed.  Some of the lower paid folks were actually crying about not making critical payments because they counted on the bonus.  Morale went way down.  People left because of it.Stories like this are one of the stated reasons Netflix doesn&#39;t do things like bonuses or any sort of variable comp.  Because once you get one once, you feel entitled to it in the future, and it feels like a loss when you don&#39;t get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I remember being in shouting matches with our signal integrity team about among other things, how many capacitors we needed.I think the place where big companies go wrong is by having teams that are too specialized.  If you&#39;re the Signal Integrity team, the only thing you care about is signal integrity.  You should just say no to anything but the most conservative arrangement possible; you&#39;re responsible for Signal Integrity, not profit or time to market!  Block the project until the signal integrity is as good as it can be, that&#39;s your one and only job.The even bigger problem is that the existence of the signal integrity team means that signal integrity experts aren&#39;t embedded on the product team.  The product team can happily say &#34;they&#39;re handling that&#34;, and cut whatever corners are necessary to get their $25,000 bonus, not caring at all about the tickets the Customer Service Team will have to handle as a result of poor signal integrity, the weird bugs the Software Engineering Team will have to work around, and the terrible reviews caused by a computer that randomly flips bits in memory.Engineering is a discipline about balance, and I think the balance has to be done inside the team.  You need to make a conscious decision to trade off a lower BOM cost for more customer service tickets, and the team needs to own that decision and plan for the future under the constraints of that decision.  (Instead of sending out an order for capacitors, send out a req for more customer service.)  If there is someone in the &#34;out group&#34; that you can pass your concerns off to (i.e. that makes the cost of your balance decision cost 0 for you), then you&#39;ll never make the right balance for the product and company as a whole.  You&#39;ll just maximize for your own gain.  From there, you ship your org chart, the company becomes entirely about politics, and you&#39;re out of business... just like DEC apparently.(I guess I also want to comment on the article as a whole -- being bitter about too small a bonus.  Something similar happened to me and I sure was bitter about it.  I actually quit over it.  It all sounds very rational to me, knowing how humans work, and I can&#39;t believe management would do something so stupid.  It&#39;s the kind of thing that kills your company, and yup! it killed them!  If there is one constant in the field of engineering, it&#39;s that we forget the mistakes of the past much too quickly.  Except Therac-25, everyone remembers that one, but integer overflows are still killing people to this day.  Sigh!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my last job I worked at a company that paid slightly below the market rate, not including the bonus. At the time I got the job, I didn&#39;t realise that I was already being significantly underpaid. I thought it was a bit low but didn&#39;t realise the extent of it. So when I got the new job, I was blown over by the huge jump in salary and couldn&#39;t be happier. What was better? I was entitled to receive each year up to a 10% bonus for just doing my job, 15% if I went above and beyond, or 20% if I was a &#34;role model&#34;.At the time, both the recruiter and my new manager explained to me that I should think of the 10% bonus as a baseline expected part of my salary &#34;you will always get this unless you are doing something egregiously wrong&#34;. This was indeed what everyone was told, and what management was told to tell people. Of course, this made me recalculate what I thought I was worth and it did in actual fact bring my salary up to roughly market rate.What the recruiter and my manager said was right. Come bonus time, I and almost everyone else in the company got their bonuses (apart from the people that did egregiously bad, and they saw it coming). In the second year I even qualified for 15% and when I got paid out I really felt that I had actually gotten a bonus. I was banking on 10%, but not 15%! I treated myself to something I&#39;d wanted for ages but could never justify.Then Covid hit, and suddenly upper upper upper management started signaling that bonuses might not be paid that year. Needless to say, absolutely everyone apart from the CFO was up in arms. Morale, which already wasn&#39;t amazing because of Covid, plunged even further and the number of &#34;hallway conversations&#34; increased significantly. People started to leave in larger numbers because the bonus was an expected part of their salary. Each year they waited expectantly to receive it, and if they weren&#39;t going to get it this year they would need to go and find a job that paid market rate as base salary. The thing that made this worse was that we were working at one of those few companies that actually did better during Covid. For better or worse, we sold a service that had an increased demand for Covid.By this time I was a manager, and we were told in a leadership meeting by our head of department where we were all vocally pissed, and were told that we had to pass the message on to the people we managed. Clearly, this is what had happened to him, and to his manager.The company didn&#39;t want to come out and say &#34;you aren&#39;t getting bonuses even though we&#39;re projected to do better&#34; presumably because it would provide a platform for people to ask why. Instead, they thought it would be better if it came from the direct line manager. Great idea except that we received the message from someone who at the same time said to us &#34;I can&#39;t imagine how they&#39;ll get away without giving bonuses&#34;. It just served to add to the feeling of being cheated.Anyway, they ended up actually paying the bonuses because the annual revenue figures had increased so much that it was basically impossible for them not to pay them. When we got them, we didn&#39;t feel happy that we had received a bonus, we just felt bitter that the company put us through hell for seemingly no reason.I no longer work at that company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For background context around telecoms for anyone reading this, there is an underlying difference in how telecoms networks are designed and architected - in the Telco world, links between networks were predicated on trust. Originally, telecoms networks were run by national level quasi-government operators, one per country. You interconnected with other &#34;known entities&#34;.Even now, you likely have 3, 4 or 5 national mobile operators in any one country. They negotiate their own roaming agreements in order for you to get roaming access. It&#39;s all driven by these kinds of relationships predicated on trusting other networks.In IT, we are rapidly moving towards zero trust (due to the internet), but circuit switched (legacy) voice is still all designed to be sent over private circuits between operators who trust each other.The legacy protocols (see SS7), used to route calls between operators are functional, but also lack access control and authentication, as it&#39;s assumed only trusted parties are on the network and able to use them. Those assumptions are no longer valid, and there&#39;s a huge challenge in dealing with this - hence SMS and call interception and rerouting attacks to steal 2FA tokens etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My assumption is that all intelligence services in all countries would love to have access to fully compromised networks. They spend all their time thinking about how to access information, so they would be fairly incompetent not to consider this.Does that mean that all systems are compromised? No, because there are risks associated with tapping in to these systems. Partly it depends on if they have access to the systems, but mostly on the possible blow-back if they get caught.Example: Swedens FRA (NSA equivalent) could in theory ask Ericsson (a Swedish company), to install a backdoor. But, Sweden has a fairly free press, and there are good chances that someone would leak this information. If it got leaked it would be a major scandal that could go as far as toppling the government and destroy one of Swedens most important export companies. Its very risky, and its a risk no one wants to take, so the parts made in sweden are probably not compromised.China, on the other hand has almost no risks associated with adding backdoor. No free press, hard suppression of whistle blowers, and since most foreign intelligence services already assume the equipment is compromised, there is no real reputational damage either. I assume they are all compromised, why wouldn&#39;t they be?The US is somewhere in between.Sometimes companies are compromised by intelligence services, but much more often I think its employees. Why try to change Tim Cooks stance on privacy, when all you need to do is find one Apple employee, willing to take a sack of money to &#34;do their country a great service&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Since the early 2000s at least, most billing has been outsourced. This works by sending all Call Detail Records (CDRs) to a third party, often from Israel or China.This is quite misleadingly written: telcos are not shipping reams of CDRs to some cubicle farm in Haifa or Chongqing.Yes, almost every telco outsources its billing software to other companies, notably Amdocs (founded in Israel, now HQ&#39;s in the US).  However, billing info is some of the most sensitive data a telco has for both privacy and commercial reasons, so that software always runs in a closed environment from where it cannot dial home.  Historically that&#39;s been on-prem, it&#39;s slowly moving to the Cloud but even there it&#39;s going to be firewalled off very carefully."</p>

But events like Dogecoin hitting a $50B market cap are very unsettling to me.I used to take part in &#34;Dogecoin Socks for the Homeless&#34; events. It was wonderful, everyone was trying to make something good out of what we all knew to be a meme. I am shocked now to look back on those wallet addresses which once held ~$1,500 and see they&#39;d be worth $285,000 (had I held). Of course, it might be that I&#39;m just angry I wasn&#39;t the one to become rich, but the mania right now is really, seriously, insane.Many people who are FOMO-ing in thinking this will make them millions with a few hundred dollars invested will be hurt when the &#34;number go up, number go down&#34; cycle turns to &#34;number go down.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of these are probably fingerprinting but the Twitch one isn&#39;t (I worked on the video system at Twitch for a number of years).&#34;player-core-variant-....js&#34; is the Javascript video player and it uses WebGL as a way to guess what video format the browser can handle. A lot of the times mobile android devices will say &#34;I can play video X, Y, Z&#34; but when sent a bitstream of Y it fails to decode it. WebGL allows you to get a good indication of the supported hardware features which you can use to guess what the actual underlying hardware decoder is.This is sadly the state of a lot of &#34;lower end&#34; mobile SoCs. They will pretend to do anything but in reality it just... doesn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry, but this is nonsense, as presented.There is zero evidence any of these are being used for fingerprinting, which is defined as building up an entire set of capabilities to uniquely identify a user.Essentially all of these seem to be attempting to identify the graphics card, and all of these could be related to feature detection for an embedded video player, for example. Feature detection is not fingerprinting.Fingerprinting is pretty easy to confirm, because it collects a large combination of data points (fonts installed, canvas rendering quirks, etc.) and either reports or hashes them all together. (That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy to find the code that does the fingerprinting, but once you&#39;ve found it it&#39;s quite obvious what it&#39;s doing.)It is deeply irresponsible and misleading of the author to claim fingerprinting without looking for that type of combination. And slapping &#34;No claims made about accuracy&#34; at the top of the page isn&#39;t an excuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author doesn&#39;t actually know what this information is being used for. Sure there can be a discussion about whether this information should be recorded at all (say, to determine if your site doesn&#39;t work on certain hardware), but claiming it _is_ fingerprinting is baseless."</p>

I find it to be as close to the perfect mix of flexibility, usability and beautiful defaults that I&#39;ve ever seen in a website builder. I can hand off management of the site to someone with almost zero technical skill (my 70 y/o father with almost no technical knowledge manages a Squarespace site I built him!) and when I look back in 2 years the site will still look pretty good and will still work on mobile. Chances of the site being hacked are much much lower than on Wordpress. Prices are reasonable. The layout engine is exactly what I want, it looks nice on all devices and can handle most layouts, which is a totally worthwhile tradeoff for the few times that something just doesn&#39;t quite look the way I want it to without custom css.I know people say this stuff:&#34;You can&#39;t transfer your site away&#34; - I know, but I can build a reasonable site in ~2 days, so the tradeoff is worth it and the sunk cost is lower&#34;But I want a fully custom design&#34; - Yeah, fair enough, there is a cap on the high end of design with it but I think that cap is pretty high, especially in 7.1&#34;But it is making the whole internet look the same!&#34; - Not really, between colors, photos and sections in 7.1 I just don&#39;t think this is true. If you use unsplash for all of your photos then maybe, but if you are doing that you are probably too small to care, worry about that when you hit 2MM in revenue&#34;But Wordpress is user friendly too&#34; - No it isn&#39;tAs I write these I think that maybe it is just the perfect thing for my subset of clients (SMB), so read this from that perspective. I know this isn&#39;t really the discussion on this thread, I just wanted to see what experiences of others have been."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  We may acquire or invest in companies, which may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions.Squarespace and Shopify would be an super combo. Individually they currently suck at the other&#39;s main area of focus - Shopify has weak design capabilities, Squarespace e-com is too basic - but together they would offer great value in terms of online presence for businesses and still keep their edge."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For my use cases, Java has all the wrong compromises:- not high level enough to compete with Python/Ruby/JS/PHP, etc- not low level enough to compete with Rust/D/Nim/Zig- not specialized enough to compete with Erlang/R/Go/Julia- not opinionated enough to compete with Lisp/HaskellSo why use Java ? It&#39;s good, it&#39;s fast, it&#39;s productive, it&#39;s well supported, battle tested and documented for decades with a huge pool of devs. And many companies already use it and the tooling is excellent.But those are not sufficient reasons for me.Python is older than Java, well supported, battle tested, documented with a huge pool of devs. But it&#39;s way better for high level stuff, data mangling, scripting, gluing, and for most web dev stuff.If I want a distributed system or something with a lot of I/O, Erlang and Go will always be better than Java. Sure, they are less widespread, with all the stuff it implies, but for such a nice need, I will pay the price hapily: my goal is optimization for the use case. Same for stuff that needs to go fast or have a small footprint, I&#39;m not going Java if I can go Rust.If I want to have fun, Java is out of the loop. Better sharpen my inner weirdness by fighting with some exotic lisp. Why try productive ? I wanna enjoy myself, not run a business.So Java is not a bad choice. It&#39;s an excellent tech. I just don&#39;t have a use case for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post from &#34;an ignorant computer science undergrad&#34; is pretty silly, so allow me to get a little silly in response.I think if Java&#39;s new features are an attempt to woo new developers, Java comes off pretty tragically, like the old guy in the club, trying stay relevant by showing off how it just got up to date with ideas that hit the mainstream ten years ago.  Whoa, check out these record classes!  Fresh stuff over here!  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any significant audience for this (a few &#34;ignorant computer science undergrads&#34; aside,) and I doubt that&#39;s what Oracle is shooting for.I think what Java is really doing is reassuring people who committed to it long ago that it will take care of them.  Java is not the old guy in the club; it is the middle-aged guy dressing up and taking his wife out for a night (or half an hour, depending on her arthritis) of dancing at a jazz bar.  It&#39;s doing its honorable best to show the people who committed their lives to it that it understands they still need a little bit of excitement now and then, and they don&#39;t have to sacrifice their dignity to some cad at the bar at the country club to get it.They don&#39;t really want to leave Java.  Java understands things about them that nobody else ever will.  All Java needs to do to keep them is love them enough to keep doing its best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of vitriol Java receives in the game development space is rather strong. However, whenever people dismiss Java as being a bad language, I can&#39;t help but think of Minecraft.Yes, it&#39;s one of the few mainstream titles where Java has been successfully applied, but I believe Minecraft&#39;s success was specifically because it was written in Java.With no JVM, there would have been no Minecraft mods at the level of flexibility that Forge provides, and the game would probably have stagnated in comparison with the sheer amount of community content from the past ten years that&#39;s available. Being able to use libraries like ASM that allow you to transform the compiled bytecode in radical ways were possible only because Minecraft targeted a virtual machine. The incredible thing was that this was in spite of the obfuscation Mojang applied to the compiled source. If it was possible to create a flexible mod system at all thanks to the JVM, people were just too motivated for any deterrence to stop them.For the people who say that Minecraft should have been written in C++ or something from the start, because Java is a mediocre programming language, there&#39;s Bedrock Edition. Nobody I know cares about it enough to play it. For all its bloat and performance issues, the benefits of the JVM were simply too convincing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title is slightly misleading, and so is Linus&#39; response here. This RFC never claimed to be in shape to be immediately mergeable into the mainline kernel as-is. Miguel (the author of the patch) has replied to this mail (and in other places in the thread) that the Rust alloc() is currently called only as a temporary measure to speed up development, and all panic() calls from allocation failures are just as temporary. This is all because the Rust code that hooks into the kernel memory allocation functions is not yet usable.The main point of this RFC is that &#34;the [in-kernel Rust] support is good enough that prototyping modules can start today.&#34; There&#39;s no point in making long arguments about alpha-quality design shortcuts on an alpha-quality prototype that are also explicitly mentioned by the patch authors to be of alpha quality.See e.g. https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1130 and https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1023EDIT: Thanks for the child comments; it seems that Linus is simply not aware of all the specifics and is asking for more information and/or decided to look at the code before reading the full mail thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I would love to see is Rust in the kernel, with a caveat. That caveat is something akin to Erlang&#39;s OTP supervision trees. Erlang has a similar philosophy to Rust in that if something erroneous happens the process fails. The difference is that Erlang OTP is designed to have supervisor processes of the worker processes. The only thing the supervisors do is monitor the processes under them and control when, if, and how those processes are restarted on failure or other conditions. The supervisors themselves have supervisors, right up to the root supervisor for each Erlang application.Rust got the language and the tooling perfect, but Erlang got the services and service infrastructure perfect.  The more I think about it the more I think I should shut up and put up. In other words, apply my knowledge of Erlang and OTP to create a gen_server in Rust as a jumping off point for a OTP like Rust framework, perhaps called OARS (Open Advanced Rust Services).  This is definitely bigger than one person. If you&#39;d like to join me on this journey then reply to this comment and I&#39;ll send you project details by the end of the weekend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside from Linus&#39; reaction, there are some really interesting pearls in that thread, for example:Regarding code style[1]:&gt; The more you make it look like (Kernel) C, the easier it is for us C people to actually read. My eyes have been reading C for almost 30 years by now, they have a lexer built in the optical nerve; reading something that looks vaguely like C but is definitely not C is an utterly painful experience.&gt; You&#39;re asking to join us, not the other way around. I&#39;m fine in a world without Rust.CoC was already brought into battle[2]:&gt;&gt; I could be mistaken but you seem angry. Perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to read your own code of conduct, I don&#39;t think you need a browser for that either.&gt; Welcome to LKML. CoC does not forbid human emotions just yet. Deal with
it.These ([3] [4]) messages have an interesting perspective about maintenance.&gt; I&#39;m sure about one thing, the C bugs we have today will be
fixable in 20 years. I&#39;m not even sure the Rust code we&#39;ll merge today
will still be compilable in 10 years nor will support the relevant
architectures available by then, and probably this code will have to
be rewritten in C to become maintained again.Linus wants to see a real, working kernel driver instead of Android Binder[5]:&gt;Would there be some kind of real driver or something that people could
use as a example of a real piece of code that actually does something
meaningful?[1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/118[2] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/143[3] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/181[4] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/16/283[5] https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1091"</p>

You come along, with Google Chrome, and visit my site.
Google adds the fact that you visited my site to their massive dataset (as well as who-knows-what-else)
And to opt out of something I have never been asked to be involved with in any way, I need to contact Google and ask them to please leave my site alone?Am I understanding this shit correctly?Whether I like it or not, my site, by proxy, is participating in Google&#39;s data mining?If my guess is correct, how the actual fuck is this not illegal?Edit: Ok, I guess I&#39;m off the mark here with my assumptions so I&#39;ll put my pitchfork down.Google are just using your Chrome browsing data, matching it with site id&#39;s (or hashes?) and then analysing the shit out of it for their gain.As a website owner, nothing has changed other than I can tell them not to use my site as part of their analysis... that sound about right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has nobody bothered to read anything about FLoC?The purpose of this permission is to prevent embedded third-party content from using FLoC. Besides that it’s a no-op.FLoC does not track arbitrary websites, it tracks sites which retrieve the FLoC cohort via JS. So instead of dropping a unique third party cookie, and associating it with the data on the page, sites can now retrieve a k-anonymous cohort id and associate it with the data on the page. If you’re not doing that (or serving ads) there’s nothing you need to do.That’s not to say that FLoC doesn’t deserve criticism just that most criticism I’ve encountered is not grounded in reality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really huge news. Starship has in about 18 months gone from a Elon standing next to a steel grain silo duct-taped into the shape of a rocket, to all the eggs in NASA&#39;s moon basket. The thing I kept thinking - and I have to believe was considered within NASA - is given the rapid progress SpaceX has been making along with the delays in Congressional funding, SLS, BlueOrigin&#39;s other projects etc ... if NASA hadn&#39;t selected SpaceX there was at least some chance they&#39;d go ahead and do their own private Moon landing mission before NASA&#39;s, a massive egg-on-face moment.There are still major risks with the Starship program so I don&#39;t think anyone should be 100% confident they can pull this off, but the massive side benefit is if they do NASA will have proven out a generic system, fully reusable and with orbital refueling, that can with minimal modification cost-effectively send humans to Mars and much of the rest of the solar system as well. A Model T or 737 in space. The original Artemis plan never made much sense as a Mars &#34;proof-of-concept&#34;, but it actually does now.If at some point say 2025, NASA says to the President &#34;we can get the first human on Mars in 4 years for $15 billion&#34; I have to imagine any American president being eager to sign their name on that accomplishment and give the JFK speech, &#34;We choose to go to Mars in this decade, not because it is easy, but because it is hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win&#34;To me that&#39;s the real takeaway here: this is implicitly a huge NASA bet not just on the Moon, but Mars and the rest of the solar system. Finally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest news IMO is that there&#39;s only a single winner.   There was a lot of pressure to make Commercial Crew a sole contact to Boeing, and it now appears that Boeing is going to deliver Starliner two years later than SpaceX delivered Crew Dragon.  So going with two winners saved NASA&#39;s bacon.    It&#39;s surprising to see them only choose a single winner here.  Yes SpaceX may be considered a safe bet, but ten years ago it was Boeing who was considered the safe bet.   Things change over years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to say, I am completely skeptical of Blue Origin&#39;s ability to do anything in a reasonable amount of time and that they will amount of anything but Bezo&#39;s hobby. At least until they change their approaches.That said, it&#39;s a very secretive firm with an unknown amount of progress.I&#39;ll believe in Blue Origin when I see it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The important parts:&gt; The Court ruled that when consumers created a new Google Account during the initial set-up process of their Android device, Google misrepresented that the ‘Location History’ setting was the only Google Account setting that affected whether Google collected, kept or used personally identifiable data about their location. In fact, another Google Account setting titled ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ also enabled Google to collect, store and use personally identifiable location data when it was turned on, and that setting was turned on by default.&gt; 
The Court also found that when consumers later accessed the ‘Location History’ setting on their Android device during the same time period to turn that setting off, they were also misled because Google did not inform them that by leaving the ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ setting switched on, Google would continue to collect, store and use their personally identifiable location data."</p>

And what&#39;s worse is that the federal governments don&#39;t even have any direct control over the app itself, they just bought access to the contact tracing data for 12 months from the company operating the app. Meanwhile the company controls the app and all connected user accounts and can repurpose it in whichever way they see fit (and they already announced they have plans for the app beyond the pandemic).It&#39;s absolutely mind-boggling to me how our government(s) can get the idea to &#34;rent&#34; contact tracing data from a private company like this, it just reeks of corruption. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the Covid tracing app in the beginning, but in retrospect the concept of that app seems miles ahead of the current situation with the Luca app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a hiring manager, the things that stand out to me in your post:- You said you quit a job at EA, quit a job at IBM, dropped out of college your freshman year. You may have valid reasons for leaving each of these, but you have to see this from the manager&#39;s perspective: You had 3 different great opportunities that all came to a dead end at the beginning of your career. You need an alternate narrative.- You talk about applying to Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Palantir, and other companies known to be very competitive, yet the only real job experience you list in your post is low level customer support. Nothing wrong with aiming high, but you need to also be applying to jobs that are a logical next step in your career. It&#39;s extraordinarily difficult to jump from customer support to FAANG engineer, so have a backup plan.- You spoofed e-mails to manipulate executives into meetings. This kind of thing sounds clever in movies or from anecdotes in the 90s or 2000s, but in this era everyone is on high alert for phishing attacks and security breaches. Read the room, and don&#39;t commit computer fraud during your application process. Big companies have systems in place to catch these things and you&#39;ll get blocked in short order.- No mention of your network. Do you have any contacts or friends or acquaintances anywhere in the industry? Even people you knew briefly from school? People who you worked with in the past who moved up? Reach out and ask if they have any advice for your job search. Going forward, make a point to stay on good terms with the people around you. You can help each other as your careers progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have you tried asking any of the jobs that rejected you&#39;re getting rejected?Honestly, just a guess, you&#39;re probably giving off bad interpersonal vibes/people don&#39;t really like talking to you. Half of interviewing is just being very personable/being able to talk comfortably with other people. Generally in this space (this space meaning those interested in tech/startups/etc) sometimes people struggle in this area but really shine in tech. I would encourage you to spend some time reflecting on your interpersonal skills.Some other red-ish flags from your post - you kinda seem like you might struggle just doing exactly what you&#39;re asked to do. Bringing up how frequently you quit things for various reasons or finding issues and bringing them up with your superiors&#39; superiors, spoofing numbers to get in touch with very very senior people. Lots of lower-tiered jobs literally just need people to show up and do what they&#39;re asked. A part of getting a &#34;first&#34; or &#34;entry level&#34; job is accepting you&#39;re there mostly to learn, not to teach/move outside of your lane. The fact that you would even bring up Bill Landreth seems like you might not necessarily see yourself how the rest of the world sees you.I&#39;m not trying to offend you - I really hope you can line something up soon. I apologize if this feedback seems cold - I think reflecting on things like this can be hard because you have to face things about yourself you may disagree with or not realize. Unfortunately interviewing is such a biased game, you kind of have to play your opponent (meaning, be the person they want, not the person you are).Happy to chat through any of this stuff if you have questions. Wish you all the best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your writing is not strong, i can tell you did not attend college. Written communication is important in tech.Your applying to those companies with 0 experience or college degree is unrealistic. The entry level is extremely competitive and you have nothing to make you interesting to hire. They get thousands of applications for those jobs.You are still young, plenty of time to learn, but I recommend taking a step back and rethink your strategy. There are plenty of companies that do not get thousands of applications for jobs.Let me put it bluntly: you are not qualified to be a software engineer. There is no reason anyone would currently hire you, unless you are personable and fun to talk to.You show immaturity in the way you handled the flaw in the system you described. Calling your boss&#39;s boss because you think you are right is childish.Additionally, you do not understand how to get a software job, you do not have realistic expectations for what kind of jobs you are qualified to acquire.A few years ago my brother, who is in his thirties, was stuck in a dead end job he hated. So he took some classes in 3D modeling. He worked hard, built out his portfolio, networked, and eventually landed a job at a world famous video game studio making AAA games at an interesting role that builds his skills.What he did not do was blindly apply to jobs he was not qualified to do with zero training"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s a simple equation:
So long as there is more money in mining BTC than there is cost in energy to mine it, mining will proceed.No entity in the world can control the price of crypto. But, we can and already do regulate energy production.I think we need a carbon tax, that is specifically a financial disincentive towards any means of energy production that directly pollutes the atmosphere.Seriously, what are the current best arguments against levying such a disincentive?Moreover, if energy were priced correctly (its toll on the climate priced in) would BTC become higher in value? That is, we have a supply, increasing at a rate fixed between the arbitrage of energy and mining efficiency. If energy were to become more expensive, the growth in supply would slow. Assuming demand remains constant or continues to grow as well, the only way for price to go is up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Easy solution: tax carbon emissions.Who cares if you’re using energy to mine Bitcoin? Or if you’re using it to play video games? Or to run the AC all day?If it you’re internalizing the cost of any emissions, then you’ll use those resources efficiently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Who cares? Everyone is fixated on Bitcoin... there are tons of energy inefficient processes out there. The solution has nothing to do with Bitcoin... environmental impact needs to be priced into energy itself, whatever the application. This is a failure of the markets (and therefore ourselves).

How can Google own the entire ads market and still be allowed to compete in it? Obviously for-profit companies will abuse their positions if it&#39;ll earn them more money, and fines ends up being the cost of doing business instead of deterrents.How is Apple allowed to disallow any other web browsers on their mobile devices? We already went through this with Microsoft in the past but suddenly it&#39;s different?How can Amazon be allowed to sell competing products in their own marketplace, when they own the actual marketplace? They should have been forced to divide their business long time ago. Of course they are gonna use metrics from competitors that only they have access to, in order to make their own product line get better.Why is Google allowed to rank their own products in front of more general results? Try searching for &#34;Earth&#34; on Google and see what the top hit is. Is that really a fair ranking? We don&#39;t even know, because no one knows how their algorithm is working, but one thing is clear, Google products consistently rank higher than anything else in the search engine.The list goes on.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given the volume and profitably of tech trading by members of Congress (see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26821601) I have ZERO confidence that any useful legislation will come of it. It will just be a bunch of earnest and disingenuous theatre by the very people profiting from a bunch of companies who make Microsoft circa 1995 look like a kitten.For my part, I think the fundamental business model of profiting from user engagement (where screen time is money) is toxic, and we can’t fix anything until we find a way to effectively eliminate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;A year after initiating the investigation, we received testimony from the Chief Executive
Officers of the investigated companies: Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai.
For nearly six hours, we pressed for answers about their business practices, including about evidence
concerning the extent to which they have exploited, entrenched, and expanded their power over digital
markets in anticompetitive and abusive ways. Their answers were often evasive and non-responsive,
raising fresh questions about whether they believe they are beyond the reach of democratic oversight.Although these four corporations differ in important ways, studying their business practices has
revealed common problems. First, each platform now serves as a gatekeeper over a key channel of
distribution. By controlling access to markets, these giants can pick winners and losers throughout our
economy. They not only wield tremendous power, but they also abuse it by charging exorbitant fees,
imposing oppressive contract terms, and extracting valuable data from the people and businesses that
rely on them. Second, each platform uses its gatekeeper position to maintain its market power.By controlling the infrastructure of the digital age, they have surveilled other businesses to identify
potential rivals, and have ultimately bought out, copied, or cut off their competitive threats. And,
finally, these firms have abused their role as intermediaries to further entrench and expand their
dominance. Whether through self-preferencing, predatory pricing, or exclusionary conduct, the
dominant platforms have exploited their power in order to become even more dominant.&#34;Well they&#39;re not wrong..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing.I never thought I would say this, but I actually implemented an FTP server in 2020. This was needed to support firmware updates to specific hardware (Electric Vehicle charging stations). Apparently embedded software developers choose FTP whenever a spec doesn&#39;t specify how binary file transfers should work.It was kind of amusing getting FTP to work in a modern cloud environment. I run a single Kubernetes pod with a Node.js based FTP server optimized for one thing: Transferring files between FTP and Google Cloud Storage. A series of ports are specified in the Docker file to enable passive FTP transfers.Even more amusing was the number of varieties in which FTP was implemented by different hardware manufacturers. I regularly had to dive into the FTP libraries to add support for crazy edge cases (tcpflow in kubectl exec -it is your friend!). Example: one device added a newline in the middle of a command (USER\n myusername)..The latest curve ball I received this week is that a certain firmware version of a Qualcomm modem chip cannot deal with the size of the IP packets coming from our FTP server... Fun stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From rfc801 (transition from NCP to TCP/IP) :
&#34;FTP: This is specified in RFC 765.  It is very similar to the FTP used with the NCP.  The primary differences are that in addition to the changes for Telnet, that the data channel is limited to 8-bit bytes so FTP features to use other transmission byte sizes are eliminated.&#34;So FTP is older than the standardisation of byte size :-)"</p>

He’s been selling calls at peaks on $MSFT all 2021, &amp; seemingly buying back the contracts on dips. This in blocks of $250,000 - $5,000,000, which is incredible size given the amount of $MSFT shares he owns. For ex, on 02-12 he sold 500k $MSFT $160 strike expiring 06/18/2021.

This is regardless of being in no position to see positions/flow/etc that would give you any insider edge.The industry generally sees it as easier to show compliance by having locked down personal trading by employees.Usually this takes the form of - ETFs only, pre-clearance required, 30 day holding periods, limited to using only a list of 5 approved brokers.. and sometimes all of the above.The restrictions apply not just to spouses but to anyone in household, and you have to attest you are reporting any holdings of say.. your parents, if you still live at home.So the mother of a live-at-home college grad tech support analyst who plugs in phones at a bank has more trading restrictions than senior politicians :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s also really easy to have high quality audio! The author recommends a &#34;podcasting&#34; microphone, but a $35 standalone headset mic[1] is almost as good and much easier to use. If you want to hear a comparison, I got kind of obsessed with this problem at one point and took some comparison recordings here[2].(You need a standalone mic since most headsets, even really nice ones, have really bad mics because most headset buyers don&#39;t care about or even know how good their mic sounds. The one I linked is wired because wireless is evil[3] and in particular, Bluetooth will silently degrade your audio quality. If you want a pair of wired headphones, I like these[4] which are &#34;open back&#34; and therefore sound more natural + cool your ears better, although the open back also means they &#34;leak&#34; sound and are only suitable for working without people next to you. But you shouldn&#39;t be having calls with people next to you anyway!)[1]: https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Comm...[2]: https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/#get-a-better-microphone[3]: https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/[4]: https://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHP9500S-Precision-Over-ear-H..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People vastly undervalue good audio quality. It also often makes the difference (given equal visuals) between great amateur and pro in e.g. the YouTube scene.I didn&#39;t have data to back this up before, but I bought a good microphone specifically for this purpose. People will simply like the audio, and by extension what I am saying and also me as a person, better.Meanwhile, my ears will continue to bleed from the awful audio people broadcast into this world. I wonder, most people must notice how terrible everyone in e.g. video conferences sounds; why don&#39;t they make the connection that they themselves have it in their hand to improve the situation? Maybe it&#39;s like wearing masks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A cheap and usable condenser mic costs 30 bucks (e.g. Fifine), a lavalier mic costs between 2 bucks on aliexpress and 50 for e.g. from Rode. (I found that the ultra cheap aliexpress are the exact same like the no-brand 10 bucks on amazon, like so many things)I got both but mostly use the condenser mic and it is an absolute game changer. If you want to explain something it is so noticeable in the eyes of your conference participants how good they can hear you. And it makes a huge difference if you finally feel like what you are saying is not painful for others to endure.Check out this very lovely video series on how to pimp up your conferencing setup.

Everything I make for personal use works in Firefox and I don&#39;t bother testing with anything else.However, almost every web site or web app I make in my professional capacity gets tested with, and is expected to work with, ~95% of browsers. That means testing against Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, UC Browser, Samsung Internet, and Internet Explorer.
Edit: I forgot to add Safari, which I also test with.Anything less is not my brand of professionalism, because I am convinced my clients expect me to leave my personal thoughts and convictions at the door. If you want to only create sites that work in Firefox and maybe not elsewhere, then you can do that - but doing it ethically means telling the client upfront that you won&#39;t accept work that requires the site work for the widest audience reasonably possible.That said, there are two caveats.  The first is ethics. I do not leave my ethics at the door and if I am being asked to do something unethical I will refund the money and walk. If it is illegal it will be reported, as otherwise I am an accessory. Clients agree to this upfront. The second is client requests. If the client wants it to work in Firefox and they tell me not to bother with the other websites, despite my advice against it, then that&#39;s what I do."</p>

Here&#39;s one example - I like to access my database from my IDE remotely - my understanding is that remote access is not possible with sqlite.Another example - multitenancy is dead easy in postgres, makes things more secure and makes coding easier.Another is that Postgres had an extremely rich set of data types, including arrays and json.Also Postgres is designed for symmetric multiprocessing which matters in today&#39;s multicore world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;ve been using SQLite as our principal data store for 6 years. Our application services potentially hundreds of simultaneous users at once, each pushing 1-15 megabytes of business state to/from disk 1-2 times per second.We have not had a single incident involving performance or data integrity issues throughout this time. The trick to this success is as follows:- Use a single SqliteConnection instance per physical database file and share it responsibly within your application. I have seen some incorrect comments in this thread already regarding the best way to extract performance from SQLite using multiple connections. SQLite (by default for most distributions) is built with serialized mode enabled, so it would be very counterproductive to throw a Parallel.ForEach against one of these.- Use WAL. Make sure you copy all 3 files if you are grabbing a snapshot of a running system, or moving databases around after an unclean shutdown.- Batch operations if feasible. Leverage application-level primitives for this. Investigate techniques like LMAX Disruptor and other fancy ring-buffer-like abstractions if you are worried about millions of things per second on a single machine. You can insert many orders of magnitude faster if you have an array of contiguous items you want to put to disk.- Just snapshot the whole VM if you need a backup. This is dead simple. We&#39;ve never had a snapshot that wouldn&#39;t restore to a perfectly-functional application, and we test it all the time. This is a huge advantage of going all-in with SQLite. One app, one machine, one snapshot, etc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool article. I definitely agree that SQLite is the way to go in 99% of the cases you&#39;re making some kind of app.I have often seen Postgres, MySQL and MongoDB in places where they were really overkill and added unnecessary network and deployment complexity. And upon asking the designers it turns out they simply didn&#39;t know about SQLite...Small gripe in case the poster reads this: There&#39;s a malopropism in the opening bit:&gt; SQLite is properly the only database you will ever need in most cases.Should be:&gt; SQLite is probably"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I call it the privacy doom principle. Any information which separates you into a subset of a larger group can eventually be compounded to fully break your anonymity.I did a lot of work on privacy coins, and the power of statistics is staggering. Doesn&#39;t matter if you shield yourself by grouping with 100,000 people per transaction, if your anonymity set isn&#39;t _everyone_, eventually you can be singly identified.Same goes for browsers, tracking, and &#34;anonymized data&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s FLOC has an unfixable problem. As soon as other advertisers create their own FLOC&#39;s, anonymity goes away. No matter how careful Google is to make sure these ID&#39;s aren&#39;t unique, as soon as users have several FLOC identifiers, maybe even two, they&#39;re uniquely identifiable.Behavioral tracking needs to die. It was a mistake created from lack of web security in the early days, nothing more. It&#39;s a bug, not a feature.Google is finally showing us what Chrome was meant to be. A browser monopoly to defend Google&#39;s user tracking interests."</p>

For other browser vendors, it is zero-effort to not support it.For Chromium forks, implementing it is zero effort but also comes with the same negative gain it would have for other vendors (that end-users are blind to).  Unless you consider &#34;more relevant advertisements&#34; a win for users.Although Chrome/Edgium have enough market share to make advertisers happy with this change, I see this entire concept as something that could further erode that given enough negative publicity.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The video [1] has much more explanation.3:2 screen ratio, I really wish the whole PC industry including Mac moves towards it. Even 16:10 is not enough when we increasingly clutter the vertical space with OS menus, controls, dock. And then Browsers address bar, tab bar, then we have the WebSite layout which is also taking vertical space at the top for navigation.1.3mm Key Travel. Which is the same as the old perfect MacBook Scissors Keyboard. Instead Apple went to 1.0mm Key travel in their magic keyboard just to save face.Sane size precision trackpad, no more absurdly large trackpad that has easy false positive when you are typing on it.Replaceable SSD, Keyboard, and Monitor for easy repair. Wow.Surface Connect - Is that Microsoft version of MagSafe?Larger sensor for better quality HD Video Call. They even compare it to MacBook Air 2020 LoL.I haven&#39;t looked at PC Laptop hardware for quite some time, but in mid 2010, Dell or HP&#39;s motherboard and Laptop layout just aren&#39;t anywhere near as good as Apple. But this Surface Laptop definitely took lots of clues from the old MacBook ( I am wondering if they have ex-Apple MacBook Engineers on their team ).Ignoring the Software, this Laptop looks exceptionally good![1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3N3u6NyWSY"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll be skipping this and future MS hardware for a while.Using a Surface Laptop 3 right now and everything except for the display is pretty much a dumpster fire. The display hardware is incredible in every way. 3:2 is the correct aspect ratio for laptops if you care about running visual studio or other apps which gobble up vertical real estate.I have reloaded this thing from official image 3x and it will still randomly fuck up important things like hardware accelerated video playback and WiFi, both of which require a hard reset to resolve. There is also some really annoying bullshit with the ambient brightness adjustment feature where I have to manually disable it in the registry every time a driver or windows update hits.The most painful problem with the machine is that WiFi is entirely unusable if you are simultaneously using bluetooth. I have had to get external dongles to resolve this.All of that said, I have had few-to-no issues with the Surface Pro product line at work, and my sample size is 1. Might be bad luck or just really demanding expectations. I have been debating going back to Apple, but there are some HP/Asus machines that look compelling now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; As described above, it is important to “warm-up” JavaScript when benchmarking, giving V8 a chance to optimize it. If you don’t do that, you may very well end up measuring a mixture of the performance characteristics of interpreted JS and optimized machine code.Since unwarmed first execution is a very common use case on the web, and a very intentional improvement for WASM, it seems foolish to discard that when comparing. I understand for benchmark determinism warming is important in long-running systems, but when parsing/warming is a common part of every run, it deserves to be factored in. I can make WASM look better by removing intentional benefits from JS before comparing too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Still, you can archive significant speed-ups with WebAssembly at some use cases.For example, I have a hash function library (https://github.com/Daninet/hash-wasm) where I was able to archive 14x speedup at SHA-1 and 5x speedup at MD5 compared to the best JS implementations.You can run the benchmarks on your computer here: https://daninet.github.io/hash-wasm-benchmark/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a project zero article on HN recently [1] that said that bound check eliminations were removed from v8 because they allowed attackers to easily turn a type confusion into a memory read-write primitive:&gt; As a result, last year the V8 team issued a hardening patch designed to prevent attackers from abusing bounds check elimination. Instead of removing the checks, the compiler started marking them as “aborting”But this post, which also appears to be written by someone from google with access to v8 developers, states that :&gt; You never go out of bounds. This means TurboFan does not need to emit bounds checks [...]Does someone here know more about bound checks eliminations in TurboFan ? Are they removed in some cases but not others ?[1] https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/in-wild-serie..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have yet to check it out, but it&#39;s very cool when people try to rethink SQL, and also revive Datalog. I (morally) support this effort.Myself, I would like to see data query/manipulation language as a total functional language, possibly based on the idea of categorical data transformations: https://www.categoricaldata.net/Also - bit of a rant - if you&#39;re creating a new programming language, consider making syntax and semantics separate in the specification. Lots of people get hung up on arguing about language syntax but it&#39;s really semantics differences that are important for compatibility. Lot of new languages comes up only to fix syntactic problems with existing languages but create small semantic differences in the process, making automated translation from and to existing languages difficult. I wish we could move to a world where syntax and semantics in programming languages are discussed separately from each other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see Datalog being validated by a big name, though I don&#39;t see what&#39;s modern about Logica in particular, or why one should use it over plain Datalog (as syntactical Prolog subset) when the available backends are restricted to SQL rewriters or locked-in to BigQuery. Will have to look into the model for aggregate queries which I guess is a selling point for Logica (as is modularization/composition with optimization), and a weak point since typically neither in Datalog (the decidable logic fragment) nor portable.Edit: also I find the title a bit grandiose since this isn&#39;t about Logic Programming in general, but only database querying"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a great introduction to the language, IMHO. There is not a clear use of logic to automatically reason about anything, just query composition. It seems the language is much more powerful than what this introduction makes it to be!&gt; English words (...) often capitalized to keep the old-fashioned COBOL spirit of the 70s alive!I like logic programming a lot but a convention not technologically enforced is a poor reason to argue for a language change. When arguing about SQL limited abstraction capabilities that space would have been better spent talking about CTE limitations, for example.Also:&gt; To make things worse, SQL code is rarely tested, because “testing SQL queries” sounds rather esoteric to most engineers, at bestSo nonexisting best practices require a language change, apparently. It was also not showcased how this can be done in Logica, beyond the table mocking that could be done with a &#34;with xxx as (values a, b, c) select (query to be tested)&#34; approach in sql."</p>
