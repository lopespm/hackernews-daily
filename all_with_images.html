								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so pleased to see this happen in a way where its not tied to Apples own payment processor. They could so easily have done that to capture more revenue but I suspect it would have opened up more chance of an anticompetitive lawsuit.Obviously they are going to vet which processors are allowed, but as a consumer you want that so you can be confident that the iPhone you are tapping your card against isn&#39;t skimming your account.I suspect there is a revenue agreement with the processors allowed on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me about an anecdote about how stock market works I heard when I was young. The story goes like,It was autumn, and the Red Indians on the remote reservation asked their New Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was a Red Indian chief in a modern society, he couldn&#39;t tell what the weather was going to be.Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his Tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared.But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea.He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked &#34;Is the coming winter going to be cold?&#34; &#34;It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,&#34; the meteorologist at the weather service responded.So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more Wood.A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. &#34;Is it Going to be a very cold winter?&#34; &#34;Yes,&#34; the man at National Weather Service again replied, &#34;It&#39;s definitely going to be a very cold winter. &#34;The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them tocollect every scrap of wood they could find. Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. &#34;Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?&#34;&#34;Absolutely&#34; , the man replied. &#34;It&#39;s going to be one of the coldest winters ever. &#34; &#34;How can you be so sure?&#34; the Chief asked. The weatherman replied, &#34;The Red Indians are collecting wood like Crazy.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story reminded me of a story written by a Czech biologist who studied animals in Papua-New Guinea and went to a hunt with a group of local tribesmen.The dusk was approaching, they were still in the forest and he proposed that they could sleep under a tree. The hunters were adamant in their refusal: no, this is dangerous, a tree might fall on you in your sleep and kill you. He relented, but silently considered them irrational, given that his assessment of a chance of a tree falling on you overnight was less then 1:5000.Only later did he realize that for a lifelong hunter, 1:5000 are pretty bad odds that translate to a very significant probability of getting killed over a 30-40 year long hunting career."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read them as sloppy caricatures that provide little value to the conversation.Let&#39;s take the security guard: &#34;The only problem is: he now provides literally no value. He’s excluded by fiat the possibility of ever being useful in any way. He could be losslessly replaced by a rock with the words “THERE ARE NO ROBBERS” on it.&#34;That is blatantly not true, the guard provide value since the wanna-be robbers don&#39;t know whether the guard will be of any value, and a rock could not provide any deterrent. Losslessly?The doctor (if there is someone skeptical of doctors it is me, if I were less lazy I would have greatly enjoyed fighting to make some useless US dermatologists lose their license): &#34;Her heuristic is right 99.9% of the time, but she provides literally no value. There is no point to her existence. She could be profitably replaced with a rock saying “IT’S NOTHING, TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND WAIT FOR IT TO GO AWAY”.This is an unhelpful caricature, too, because if we add &#34;and call back if it does not&#34;, it looks like a very reasonable approach.Un-nuanced and quite sloppy presentation of heuristics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It sort of make sense for Nvidia&#39;s shareholders. The initial offering for ARM was only worth $38.5bn, which was already expensive due to SoftBank initial purchase price and not wanting for a loss. But at Nvidia&#39;s peak this deal was worth &#34;$87bn&#34;. For a company that makes less than $2B in revenue and at best ~$300M in Operating Income. Remember this isn&#39;t something you can buy and milk the crap out of other market players. &#34;Not a very British way of doing business&#34; is A Direct Quote from ARM. ( Edit: Because of perceptual licensing agreement, for those unaware of how ARM business model works )It didn&#39;t make sense how ARM was worth $22bn in 2016 on LSE, that has a PE100+ when I cant see how it could double its Net profit in the next 10 years, with a saner valuation of P/E 50. It make even less sense to me when Softbank bought it for $32bn. Didn&#39;t make any sense when Nvidia want it for $38.5bn, and later at $50bn+.Now we are back to square one, how many investors, in the open market are willing to buy ARM&#39;s stock at a valuation of, let say the same $32bn as Softbank initially paid? Roughly P/E 100, assuming they managed to grow ARM business from 2018 at ~$220M operating income to $300M in 2021. I much rather bet on Intel if I had the money.And of course many on HN will think ARM is worthless because the future is going to be the Riscy Silver Bullet.Disclosures: I do not currently hold any stocks or Mutual Funds, Indexes and other financial instrument."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Soooo back on the LSE or?It was such a hot stock in 2014-15. Softbank kinda bought it at the peak. Still, Apple has proven ARM on the desktop is phenomenal, and Ampere has done the same in the datacenter. Both have swiftly made compiler support accelerate dramatically. I would love for my next desktop to be arm-based, and it would be great if it didn’t NEED to be a mac. Broad adoption of ARM would be a huge win for sustainability. I’m bullish on their business, even if their business model isn’t vertically scalable.I think that RISC V also has a bright future, but its still a bit far out before its a viable competitor. Still there have been some things that look really promising such as what is coming out of SiFive:https://www.sifive.com/press/sifive-raises-risc-v-performanc...And Intel just announced a $1B fund for companies building on their Open Foundry RISC-V alliance. https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-1b-fund-risc-vBig things are happening for small instruction sets… watch this space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. Never a good outcome for the industry for Arm to be owned by Nvidia - and regulators have learned by now that undertakings in these circumstances have little value.Sorry for Simon Segars who must have had a tough job essentially implementing Son&#39;s ideas. And those ideas seem to have been pretty poor - Arm China debacle, focus on IoT and selling to Nvidia have all clearly harmed Arm&#39;s prospects.It&#39;s clear by now that selling CPUs is a mature market but that Arm has room to grow and there is still lots of money to be made in hardware if you innovate - eg in accelerated computing. It&#39;s also true both that Arm&#39;s model works and that it has more competition than ever from RISC-V.A lot still to play for in my view and I think that the IPO price will reflect that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It must be noted that the satellites were not directly damaged by the geomagnetic storm. The storm warmed the atmosphere which caused it to expand, leading to additional drag that prohibited the satellites from leaving their low &#34;safe mode&#34; orbit.Shortened excerpt:
&#34;These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase.... speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50 percent.... The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe-mode where they would fly edge-on (like a sheet of paper) to minimize drag...Preliminary analysis show the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented the satellites from leaving safe-mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers, and up to 40 of the satellites will reenter or already have reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. The deorbiting satellites pose zero collision risk with other satellites and by design demise upon atmospheric reentry—meaning no orbital debris is created and no satellite parts hit the ground.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SpaceX deploys its satellites into these lower obitsUnintentional pun on &#34;orbits&#34;, perhaps?It&#39;s incredible to me that launching satellites is so easy now that a failure of 40 satellites can be tolerated. On the bright side, I guess this gave SpaceX a chance to talk about their debris-limiting strategy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"40 sats makes up about 2% of the current fleet - so a rounding error in cost and time.The important part of this news is how those 40 sats deorbit and leave no junk either in orbit or on earth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having done computer architecture and bit twiddling x86 in the ye olden days, I immediately, independently converged on the patented solution (code / circuit / Verilog, more or less the same thing). It goes to show how broken the USPTO is because it&#39;s obvious to anyone in the field. Patents are supposed to be nonobvious. (35 USC 103)https://patentdefenses.klarquist.com/obviousness-sec-103/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;SWAR&#34; approach `(a &amp; b) + (a ^ b) / 2` looks bizarre but can be understood.Adding two bits produces a sum and a carry:    0 + 0 = 0, carry 0
    1 + 0 = 1, carry 0
    0 + 1 = 1, carry 0
    1 + 1 = 0, carry 1

So the sum is XOR, and the carry is bitwise AND. We can rewrite x + y as (x ^ y) + (x &amp; y)*2Distribute the divide, and you get (x ^ y)/2 + (x &amp; y) which is the mystery expression.(Note this distribution is safe only because (x &amp; y)*2 is even.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the official response from SE:https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/376060/update-on-th...For the past month Stack Overflow has been hit by weekly DDoS attacks that progressively grew in size and scope. In each incident, the attacker(s) have been changing their methodology and responding to our countermeasures. Initially we were able to detect and mitigate the attacks before any performance degradation could be noticed but the latest attacks ramped up very quickly and the site was brought down before we could react.While we cannot go into specifics on each attack in order to maintain opsec and not tip off the attackers, we can say that each individual attack has been using different IP addresses and targeted different aspects of the site. During an outage, our top priority is always getting the site back up and running. After traffic has been stabilized, we perform a post mortem for the incident where we assess and improve upon the actions we have taken.During the outage last Sunday, we noticed that a large amount of the DDoS traffic originated from Tor exit nodes. The decision to block Tor exit nodes did not come lightly, in fact Teresa, our CTO was on the call when we discussed remediation methods. Due to the persistent nature of the attack and our desire to bring the site back up as fast as possible we made the decision to block all DDoS traffic endpoints, including these Tor exit nodes.We did not target, nor set out to block all traffic from Tor, that’s not something Stack has ever done. However, due to the shared nature of Tor exit nodes, some of them were also routing DDoS attacks to our sites and were blocked. We have tried removing these blocks between attacks but this action has resulted in further site outages as DDoS efforts continue to originate from these exit nodes. Unfortunately blocking the Tor exit nodes also blocks legitimate users from using them. An immediate solution for users who find themselves blocked is to access our site from other IP addresses, via home internet, work internet, or other VPN services.We are continuing to evaluate the situation and will keep our community updated. Thank you for your patience and understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was no intentional blocking of Tor there in the past as far as I understand. But there are some mechanisms that block users from IP addresses that posted spam or abusive content. Those are automated and based on flags and not directed towards Tor specifically, but of course TOR addresses are more likely to have been misused that way so your chances of encountering these blocks is dramatically higher when using Tor. But these blocks only apply to low reputation users, I think once you&#39;re above 100 they don&#39;t matter anymore. And they also don&#39;t block reading the sites.There have been DDoS attacks recently on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, I think it&#39;s quite plausible those have something to do with this. They still seem to be under active attack intermittently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe Stackoverflow finally started to aggressively block everything that might &#34;crawl&#34; their data. I&#39;m super tired of all the paraphrased/translated copies in Google results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The interesting thing this brings up is whether programming hiring is too specific. Why do we hire reactjs programmers with e-commerce experience instead of react programmers, e-commerce programmers, or programmers?To me this guy sounds like he could do anything, just see if he&#39;s easy to work with and see if he likes your domain. He&#39;s certainly said enough about programming over the years that he shouldn&#39;t need a leetcode grilling.Anyway my point was it can get quite narrow what we look for in a coder when in fact some broad experience might be just what is necessary. For instance I&#39;ve coded apps for iPhone and Android despite being ostensibly a back end financial trader. I&#39;d think a lot of coders wouldn&#39;t want to be siloed into the first thing they get a job in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this thread really exploded! My 2 cents on Haskell, since we&#39;re building https://wasp-lang.dev/ in it and also just hired several founding engineers:- we&#39;re sticking with the &#34;Boring Haskell&#34; manifesto(https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2019/11/boring-haskell-manifest...) - using only the widely adopted compiler plugins and not going too crazy with the monad transformer stack, which keeps the code easy for others to contribute to.- we&#39;ve hired 2 founding engineers so far - none of them knew Haskell beforehand! But they were both senior engs well versed in different languages and I was surprised with how quickly they picked it up - within the first month they are at 90% productivity."</p>

The cost of this inaction has been billions of dollars in fraud, which has in turn fueled a black market for stolen personal data, and enabled companies like ID.me to commercialize what should be a core government service.”not great!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So basically, we are a hosting association that wanted to put their servers at home _and_ sleep at night.
This demanded inter-home redundancy of our data. But none of the existing solutions (MinIO, Ceph...) are designed for high inter-node latency.
Hence Garage! Your cheap and proficient object store: designed to run on a toaster, through carrier-pigeon-grade networks, while still supporting a tons of workloads (static websites, backups, Nextcloud... you name it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Y&#39;all might want to get to the point a bit quicker in your pitch. A lot of fluff to wade through before the lede..&#34;Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.Garage implements the Amazon S3 protocol, a de-facto standard that makes it compatible with a large variety of existing software. For instance it can be used as a storage back-end for many self-hosted web applications such as NextCloud, Matrix, Mastodon, Peertube, and many others, replacing the local file system of a server by a distributed storage layer. Garage can also be used to synchronize your files or store your backups with utilities such as Rclone or Restic. Last but not least, Garage can be used to host static websites, such as the one you are currently reading, which is served directly by the Garage cluster we host at Deuxfleurs.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh this is great. When we taught SHA-256 last semester, we linked to this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/f9EbD6iY9zI. Next time we do it, we&#39;ll probably link to both. Having several different ways to visualize the same thing is very helpful, and I like that this one moves quickly.A couple of details missing from this visualization are how you pad a message to be a multiple of the block size, and how you chain blocks together to form a longer message. In the pseudocode at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Pseudocode, that&#39;s the &#34;Pre-processing (Padding)&#34; part and the &#34;for each chunk&#34; loop just below it. I get why you&#39;d want to leave those things out, since they&#39;re not really the interesting part, and the screen is already pretty packed as it is.If anyone&#39;s feeling curious about implementing this yourself, take a look at these project notes: https://github.com/oconnor663/applied_crypto_2021_fall/tree/.... At some point I&#39;ll clean that up for public consumption, but for now just ignore the parts about grades and cheating :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, how do people come up with these things? I assume every aspect of the design is carefully considered to defend it against various attacks. For example, why &#34;right rotate 7 XOR right rotate 18 XOR right shift 3&#34; and not &#34;right rotate 2 XOR right rotate 3 XOR right shift 4&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s really cool. I made a terrible one for SHA1 years ago, yours is 1000x better.https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/sha1/visualize.htmlI read a paper at the time where someone described a tool they made to find a near-collision, they explained they were just flipping bits and visually observing the affects. That sounded kinda fun, but they didn&#39;t release it, so I tried to replicate it from their description!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Indeed. Valve established DRM to a degree many previously hoped it would get rejected. But they offered a decent service and proved that piracy is a service problem. What they did for Linux as a gaming platform is spectacular. Not many people use it yet, but Windows does look less and less like a dependable long term solution, especially with Microsofts other ambitions in that industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add on this: Valve works with upstream developers on upstream code, so their work benefits the whole FOSS ecosystem. They are funding a lot of kernel, Mesa, Wayland, Wine and KDE developers.(Disclaimer: I&#39;m a Valve contractor.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I am in a &#34;late-game&#34; stage of gaming. I have sort of an overview of what is going on, but a major percentage of games simply look not interesting (anymore) to me.The collection of games I end up playing is somewhere between special and weird, I&#39;d say.And, to get back to the topic, for people in a comparable situation like me, Linux is a great alternative. So if hear or read other people comparing pros and cons of Win vs. Linux (or Apple vs. Linux), and gaming was the major drawback, think carefully if that applies to you as well.Having a pile of shame on Linux is as easy to do as on Windows, just it&#39;s smaller (which is good, right?). But having one at all means that you don&#39;t have a lack of games, but quite the opposite.Of course, when you deeply into AAA and big franchises, and need to play a game when it&#39;s published and everyone talks about it - then probably not."</p>

But what if a lot of &#34;stupid&#34; design decisions are actually Type 2?And the reasons may or may not be good - somewhere on a scale from real budget and/or time constraints, lack of insight, indifference, penny pinching economics, to passive aggressive user hostility.When Apple removed Magsafe no doubt there were perfectly good internal justifications for that decision.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked with Nick a few times in a previous job and he was a reviewer on a paper I wrote; he was really nice and professional, and his feedback was constructive and incisive.The movement he&#39;s part of is fundamentally disagreeable (in the &#39;big five&#39; sense [0]), and some of its prominent characters, as you might expect, have reputations for being interpersonally difficult [1]. Collectively they&#39;ve been labeled &#34;data thugs&#34; [2] and accused of &#34;methodological terrorism&#34; [3], which is why I think Nick&#39;s fundamental goodness is an especially valuable asset. We&#39;d gain a ton of social value from certain reforms to the scientific research apparatus, and, IMO, being kind when delivering pointed critiques helps a difficult pill go down. That&#39;s different than pulling your punches; it just means staying focused on the thing you actually want to change.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits[1] https://medium.com/@OmnesRes/the-dumbest-fucking-thing-ive-e...[2] https://www.science.org/content/article/meet-data-thugs-out-...[3] https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/09/21/what-has-h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a fantastic example of how a) anyone can call bullshit on science if it doesn&#39;t make sense and b) there are more and less correct ways of calling bullshit on established science.You don&#39;t need to hop on a podcast or radio show in order to question the orthodoxy of a scientific claim, and in fact you shouldn&#39;t if you want to be taken seriously.  Nick Brown would have hurt his case had he done that, and instead found a path that actually knocked down a faulty concept in a way that has lasting effects.This is the process working.  This is all okay, and welcome, IMO, though possibly not by everyone involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taking equations from physics out of context to bolster social science claims isn&#39;t unique to psychology, other social sciences like economics have done the same thing with little more justification.  The rationale behind this approach is simple marketing, in that &#39;using more mathy stuff&#39; will sell better to the general public than non-mathy hand-waving claims will.However, the practioners of this approach don&#39;t seem to understand that physical equations are constructed by analysis of empirical experimental and observational data on one hand, and theoretical mathematical development on the other, within limited scopes of applicability.  Copying equations from one area of science to another willy-nilly like the article describes is just ridiculous - would cosmologists studying general relatively just plug in quantum mechanical equations in the hope of getting a &#39;mathy explanation&#39;?Here&#39;s another example from &#39;mathematically sound neoclassical economics&#39;, which does the same with 19th century physical science equations:&gt; &#34;The strategy the economists used was as simple as it was absurd—they substituted economic variables for physical ones. Utility (a measure of economic well-being) took the place of energy; the sum of utility and expenditure replaced potential and kinetic energy. A number of well-known mathematicians and physicists told the economists that there was absolutely no basis for making these substitutions. But the economists ignored such criticisms and proceeded to claim that they had transformed their field of study into a rigorously mathematical scientific discipline.&#34;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-economist-has..."</p>

Thousands of AngelList members were invited to invest personal checks ranging from $2,000 to $20,000+ via the mailing lists of multiple syndicates.&#34;It&#39;s worth noting that any US person investing this way is required to be an accredited investor, which is another way of saying they&#39;ve proven they can afford to lose that $20k (or whatever they&#39;re putting in).The accredited investor rules in USA seem draconian, but if it weren&#39;t for them, we&#39;d be absolutely drowning in fake tech companies taking money from retail investors.

A16Z certainly do lead follow-on rounds, but it isn&#39;t the norm. (It would be interesting to know if they exercised pro-rata or not, but even that isn&#39;t necessarily indicative of anything.)I don&#39;t know if there is or isn&#39;t fraud here, but the only evidence seems to be that Kagan was good at fundraising, raise a lot in a frothy market on little traction, and did not succeed at building the product or a successful business.One of the best things about the tech ecosystem is the lack of stigma around failure. I hope people don&#39;t lose sight of that as round sizes and valuations spike."</p>

We loved the jokes about iDongle; how about ThinkDongle?The latest MacBook Pro does not come with an Ethernet port. It is however very annoying that Lenovo requires a proprietary dongle to use the built-in Ethernet controller.&gt; The removal of the SD cards slot and Ethernet port has made recent ThinkPads a suboptimal choice for traveling photographers and some IT professionals.The removal of the SD card reader on the X13 AMD Gen 2 is bizarre, but they can and do still offer Ethernet via a dongle.&gt; would you read about the update procedure after you’ve done multiple BIOS updates for the same machine already? Even if you would, would you pay much attention to the Notes section?Yes, but I&#39;m probably weird because I like to know what the vendor fixed and whether the firmware update might remove features that I use (shakes fist at Dell).I own an X13 AMD Gen 2 (20XH), and I think it&#39;s a great laptop with some small caveats.Pro:- 1600p matte display looks amazing- proper support for S3, very low S3 power consumption- super quiet, I never hear the fan and the laptop is never uncomfortably hot (even doing heavy things like compiling buildroot)- amazing performance for a laptop (5850U)Con:- no SD card reader (seriously, why?)- proprietary dongle for Ethernet- Ethernet is only GigE- Came with MediaTek 7961 WiFi, which while supported by mainline Linux, the performance is trash (~30MBit on 802.11ac).

When I returned my Macbook I dusted it off and was surprised by how usable it was (and how usable and well-supported it was running Arch compared to debian in the early 2010s). I finally gave in and upgraded the memory (DDR3!) to 16 GiB recently, and am considering getting a third-party 9-cell battery, as my 9+ year old one has gotten long in the tooth (i3&#39;s battery &#34;widget&#34; reports ~70% fully charged).I dare say it&#39;s my most usable travel laptop outside of my work-issued Yoga, which it still trounces in terms of keyboard ergonomics. It absolutely dunks on the bargin-bin laptops I&#39;ve tried out over the past few years, I think in part because of ergonomics but also because Arch on old (but well-supported) hardware feels snappier than Windows 10 on new (but low-cost) hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me, or did old laptops have better keyboards that the new ones have today?My first laptop was Acer Aspire One (this one [0]). I still have it and I still use it, it&#39;s currently running Debian with Xfce. And the keyboard is still the best I&#39;ve ever used, I genuinely prefer this keyboard over any desktop keyboards that I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve tried many mechanical including Cherry Brown switches. I get that the very low profile keyboards on modern laptops look nice, but I personally don&#39;t use the keyboard for its looks. Not to mention that my cat stepped on the &#34;Enter&#34; key of one of the newer laptops (Acer CB3-431) and she broke the butterfly shaped keycap stabilisation thingy making the button feel very inconsistent. I can&#39;t the replacement for just the bit that broke, I have to buy an entire new keyboard for it (~55€). The cat wasn&#39;t fat and she has walked over pretty much every keyboard that I&#39;ve used, but that was the first one that broke...It is this line of thinking that I personally think is the reason why a good number of people like and still use ThinkPads today.[0] https://www.globalmediapro.com/dp/A25LT9/Acer-Aspire-One-AOA..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a foreign wife and it really drives home one truth: America is a very nuanced place. We have this idea of almost unlimited free speech. Which sounds great, but in practice, it is not really true. Because ultimately, Americans do not have equal rights. We see this over and over in different aspects of society. The Frederick Douglas example from Boston in the article is a great example of why free speech is good. But the truth is it is the same kind of people who are always preventing free speech in meaningful ways. If your takeaway from the speech is that &#34;all kinds of speech need to be heard&#34;, you might be philosophically correct. But, again, in practice, the people in power do not allow free speech. And this is fundamentally different from most examples of cancel culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The application of censorship itself, not what is being censored, is the main symptom of the declining cultural health. The mentality that there are so universally wrong and right things that the right ones must be forced upon any mind, no matter the context, and the wrong ones must be extinguished no matter the context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One major distinction this glosses over is the difference between making it so you can&#39;t read something (e.g., banning it), and making it so you aren&#39;t required to read something (e.g., removing it from the curriculum). Only the former is censorship."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Judging from what an insider in the HR org told me, we&#39;re going to be hearing a lot of stories like this going forward. Apparently, Amazon scale is so large and their attrition rates are so bad that in some markets, every potentially qualified candidate has already applied and failed an interview, or previously worked at Amazon and quit. As the adage goes, necessity is the mother of invention and Amazon seems to be at a point where it really needs to try everything under the sun to try to attract talent, given their extremely poor reputation.With this said, from reading the article, this move seems reminiscent of Netflix&#39;s pay structure, in the sense of offering a higher cash portion but lower equity. Some people here already mentioned that this was already sort of the case with a sign on bonus compensating for the backloaded vesting structure. From my experience interacting w/ professionals outside the FANG bubble, equity tends to be a bit confusing, so I wonder if a move towards bigger cash portions is a way to try to lure people who wouldn&#39;t otherwise be looking at big tech as a prospective career choice.What&#39;s also curious to me is that bumping up cash comp is in direct opposition to the trends from some other tech giants, where they are frontloading equity vesting. My sample size might just be small, but it feels like cash comp seems to correlate somewhat with bearish stock feeling and that frontloaded equity tends to correlate w/ bullish stock feeling. Would love to hear whether I&#39;m off the mark here or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had an office near an Amazon office. I interviewed a lot of people trying to leave Amazon. I don’t ask candidate’s compensation, but a lot of them volunteered it anyway. I was always surprised at how effectively low their comp was in the first few years due to the vesting schedule. The internet is adamant that everyone with FAANG jobs is rolling in TC, but there are a lot of people out there who are getting into FAANG companies (especially Amazon) at lower compensations with the hopes of moving up to those higher levels.OTOH, the backloaded vesting system works. It was easy to hire people out of their first year at Amazon, but almost impossible to hire someone after a few years when the bulk of their vesting was right around the corner. I talked to a lot of people who admitted being miserable but felt they couldn’t leave until they got the equity that they had been toiling over for the past few years.Weird situation all around. We eventually reduced our recruiting out of that particular Amazon office because so many of the people coming out of it were deeply disgruntled with the tech industry in general. Really changed my view of Amazon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been talking to close to a dozen current and former Amazon employees since the end of 2021, and reached out to people publicly sharing attrition observations. Amazon attrition is really bad, even in AWS (Amazon employees all agree that AWS is a much better place to work in tech than Amazon retail).At the same time, Amazon has had to pay very high for new hires. Hiring managers used to need to get L10 approval to go out of bands on offers outside bands, but starting late 2021, they could go out of bands up to ~20% higher with no approvals.To top all of this, Amazon has a 6% internal URA (non-regretted attrition) target: something that has been in place for close to a decade. The Amazon Music group revolted late 2021 as reported by the Big Technology publication in-depth [1] as they didn&#39;t have 6% of people to fire, at the very time when they could not hire. Yet they were forced to hit this URA target, just like all other orgs in Amazon. Apparently this “rebellion email” leaked across the company and is sparking Amazon-wide outrage, and adds fuel to the fire.Amazon has been extremely frugal for the skillset they hire for, very demanding and have created a stressful workplace. They still force 6% of engineers to be fired, even when their own leadership opposes this (Amazon Music).I wonder why they can’t hire. Also, why is Amazon still part of the FANG abbreviation when they have this culture across many of their organisations?[1] https://bigtechnology.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember that when I worked at Google about a decade ago, there was this common saying:&#34;If the first version of your shell script is more than five lines long, you should have written it in Python.&#34;I think there&#39;s a lot of truth in that. None of the examples presented in the article look better than had they been written in some existing scripting/programming language. In fact, had they been written in Python or Javascript, it would have been far more obvious what the resulting output would have been, considering that those languages already use {} for objects and [] for lists.For example, take this example:    jo -p name=JP object=$(jo fruit=Orange point=$(jo x=10 y=20) number=17) sunday=false

In Python you would write it like this:    json.dumps({&#34;name&#34;: &#34;JP&#34;, &#34;object&#34;: {&#34;fruit&#34;: &#34;Orange&#34;, &#34;point&#34;: {&#34;x&#34;: 10, &#34;y&#34;: 20}, &#34;number&#34;: 17}, &#34;sunday&#34;: False})

Only a bit more code, but at least it won&#39;t suffer from the Norway problem. Even though Python isn&#39;t the fastest language out there, it&#39;s likely still faster than the shell command above. There is no need to construct a fork bomb just to generate some JSON."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago I wrote zsh helper [1] that uses jo to quickly construct complex JSON requests, mainly for testing and quering services from console.Paired with httpie [2] aliases [3] it produces concise APL-like syntax:  POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=j`a=b c=`e=3` l=`*1 2 3``

Which translates to:  http POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=&#34;$(jo a=b c=&#34;$(jo e=3)&#34; l=&#34;$(jo -a 1 2 3)&#34;)&#34;

Or, in other words, sending POST with the following body:  {&#34;a&#34;:&#34;b&#34;,&#34;c&#34;:{&#34;e&#34;:3},&#34;l&#34;:[1,2,3]}

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it, very concise but retains all the features you need.`jq` can construct JSON &#34;safely&#34; from shell constructs, but is rather more verbose - e.g. with the same examples:        $ jq -n --arg name Jane &#39;{&#34;name&#34;:$name}&#39;
        
        $ jq -n \

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is almost exactly my life, shifted by a decade.The problem is that by 35 you can&#39;t get by on novelty anymore because you&#39;ve seen some version of everything there is to see.The worst thing you can do is pine for the good old days. They aren&#39;t coming back. And they weren&#39;t that good anyway. Your best times are ahead if you can successfully adjust.What worked for me was putting down roots. I resisted it mightily at first because I wanted to stay mentally 25 forever. Now I see that getting married and having a couple of kids was the right thing to do. It forced me to become more flexible, more deliberate, more focused and have more stamina to do hard thingsI&#39;m a loner by nature, so I can&#39;t imagine where I&#39;d be if I hadn&#39;t settled down. I just know it wouldn&#39;t be as good.Once you&#39;ve got those roots down, life will lead you to what you should do next. Maybe being a full time parent, maybe learning to sail, maybe more successful entrepreneurship. Who knows...EDIT: I don&#39;t mean to imply that everyone needs a family. What&#39;s important is to start living for others to some degree. Hedonism has famously bad diminishing returns.Some people choose to do lots of volunteering or switch careers to social work. There&#39;s lots of options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m 58. Everything IS an different iteration of the same thing. Generally, if intelligent adults are involved, there are likely to be some useful new things in the new iteration, small improvements.  On rare occasion, there are massive changes that only become apparent later. (Like when transistors first appeared, they wore out, like tubes, but slower... germanium was replaced by silicon, and lifetimes tended towards infinity, and then integrated circuit appeared)You&#39;re not too old to have a social life... that happens once you&#39;re in a nursing home, and have worn out the good will of the staff. Up until that point, there are always new friendships and relationships to be had.Going out to parties and drinking until morning is a lot harder on you than it was, that&#39;s a normal part of growing up. There are plenty of other things to do that are far more rewarding if you give yourself time to grow into them (and Covid rules don&#39;t prohibit them)If you need a hobby, I suggest machining.  Challenge yourself to make 1000 of some everyday hardware store item, like a 1/4&#34; 10-24 x 2&#34; screw, Flat head.  You&#39;ll learn a lot of interesting history, and grow to appreciate the supply chain, along the way.Note: Outside of the US, maybe some M8 Torx screws instead? You&#39;ll learn about Rotary Broaching, or cold heading, along the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mourning the loss of one’s youth is pretty typical. You lose a step. You didn’t do what you hoped you would do. You wasted your time. So forth and so on.Don’t worry. It gets better. This is all part of the process of life.My recommendation is that you read Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”I’m 52 here. I was a prolific programmer in my 20s. A go-go marketer in my 30s. For the last 10 years, I’ve run a business that I love with two partners who have taken advantage of me at every turn. The last two years neither has worked and yet they get paid.Do I feel lost or depressed? Absolutely not.I love life. I have an amazing family to whom I am utterly devoted. I volunteer for stuff. I do cool things every day. If I feel bored, I make things with my hands or engage in other creative pursuits. I focus on the moment and others more than anything else and all the rest just goes away.How is this possible? I’ve filled my life with reasons to live.In fact, I have so many now that there is no room for worry about what I have and haven’t done. And in doing so, I realize that none of that matters anyway.My mom died at 52 after taking a header down a flight of stairs. My grandfather died at 56 after getting stabbed in the belly by my grandmother (she was psychotic).Our naked existence is laughable. Everything can be lost in an instant.Dive into the why and you can deal with any how."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The output is very polished and fast, I like it a lot.
Unfortunately it&#39;s not technically a single file as it depends on code downloaded from their server, therefore it can&#39;t be deployed locally without Internet connection.From the forum:&#34;In terms of license, you don&#39;t need an internet connection. However, Files app loads it&#39;s own Javascript, CSS and several plugins from CDN (jsdelivr.com), and this requires internet. We already have a request to allow serving all assets locally (as an option), although in your case that might not be practical as this means Files app is essentially no longer a&#34;single file&#34;, but multiple files that you need to be included with each installation (although you could assign a global path perhaps). In any case, for now it&#39;s not possible to load Files app without internet.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, Files app DEVELOPER here. Someone notified me that the app had been posted here. A lot of negative comments, which I don&#39;t have a problem with, but I can perhaps clarify a few things.About Files app not being &#34;single file&#34; because it loads JS/CSS resources from the CDN (internet). That is of course a correct observation, and this is already noted on the website. From an operational perspective, there is only one file to download/move/install, and from a functional perspective for the vast majority, it will be viewed in browser with an active internet connection. Furthermore, it was INTENDED BY DESIGN to load all JS/CSS from CDN, because ultimately it improves the user-experience, and makes it plausible to make an app like this wrapped into a single index.php file.It&#39;s not reasonable to add ALL Javascript/CSS directly into the index.php file. PHP is only 10% of the codebase, and it would bloat the file to insane dimensions and make it difficult to maintain. JS/CSS is loaded from CDN service jsdelivr.com, with multi-level redundancy (Amazon, Cloudfront, Cloudflare), and will load faster and cache more effectively than anything served from within the index.php app on your own server. Furthermore, some plugins are served on-demand, for example when browser needs a &#34;polyfill&#34; or for specific features. For functional reasons, benefiting the vast majority who do not care how/where the JS/CSS is loaded from, JS and CSS files are therefore served from CDN. If this does not suit you, nobody has any problem with that.Does anyone have any examples of any other single-file app with a comprehensive interface like Files app that is entirely self-contained?There will be a future release where you can assign all scripts/css to be loaded from local path, but then of course all these files will need to be installed alongside Files app index.php. We will NOT be adding all JS/CSS directly into the index.php file.About license, as stated on the website, you can use it as a file viewer for free (with the nag). If you want to remove the nag and use it as a file manager, license is required. Those who expect apps like this to be entirely free with updates and support, are living in dream land. It&#39;s hardly worthwhile in the first place. There are loads of other free apps, and if you can&#39;t see any difference, then your choice is easy.I have noted comments about license info being unclear, thanks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fought the battle to keep my SMTP server IP off blacklists, and lost.You can do everything possible, have a perfectly clean IP, have a good amount of outbound email traffic, only send transactional email, etc. Still, there will be edge cases where email does not go through. AT&amp;T email servers would constantly blacklist me and not respond to requests to remove me, gmail/yahoo/outlook would silently put emails in the spam folder, and companies using email firewall products would blacklist me, with an IT Dept too inept to fix it.The solution was to pay a small fee and proxy all outbound email through a transactional SMTP sender, like Postmark or Mailgun. It&#39;s easy to do, with one line of code in Postfix. You can be selective, and only proxy emails sent to certain troublesome domains. If you try an email provider and it&#39;s not working out, it&#39;s one line of code to change to another provider.This allows me to still manage nearly all aspects of hosting my email server and control my email data, while not dealing with deliverability issues. I use Postmark and I have not dealt with a deliverability issue in two years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m dealing with this right now.Both my personal domain and rsync.net are on a distinct subnet, but that subnet is smaller than a /24 and someone on a different subnet has, apparently, behaved badly.Enter &#34;abusix&#34; ...One of my engineers had an enlightening webchat with one of their engineers where we were shown the &#34;offending&#34; IP and it was explained that they have no ability to distinguish subnets (and no interest in doing so).  So if you&#39;re not wasting an entire /24 (we only need ~10 IPs at this location) you&#39;re in danger of this misclassification.We were also informed that our normal, business communications with paying customers should have unsubscribe notices appended to them.  Which is to say, you&#39;re a paying customer of a service and we send you some kind of alert or critical announcement ... and it should have an unsubscribe link.Unbelievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spam blocklists are run by an unaccountable cowboy cult that somehow has managed to consolidate a ton of power simply for the fact that most people who run email inbox services didn&#39;t want to deal with the problem of spam, so they were more than willing to just hand over anti-spam &#34;enforcement&#34; to anyone who was allegedly doing &#34;what was best for the internet.&#34; There&#39;s no check on these people who run these blacklists, and the system they&#39;ve built is entirely a black box, antithetical to the principles of the open internet. And if you&#39;re not a huge corporation that can afford professional management of your email deliverability, good luck – the individuals and small organizations are just out of luck. It&#39;s a miserable racket and for what?If you want to know why there&#39;s a new thread each week on HN about why it&#39;s impossible to host your own email service, this is why."</p>

This vaguely reminded me of something (now admittedly, terrible) I did way back in highschool to give myself a bit more time on an assignment: submit a corrupted docx by putting in some random bytes in the file.This would give you time until the teacher would get to grading (and opening) the file at which point you’d hopefully have finished.Learning not to procrastinate as much turned out to be the better life skill."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a lot of work on microbiome and cancer immunotherapy... the latest study in the field published in the most prestigious journal there is [1] seemed to show that fibre intake was more important than any specific microbe. In fact they found that eating more fibre and taking probiotics resulted in worse outcomes than just eating more fibre alone. This was recapitulated in a mouse model:&gt; Together, these data have important implications. We show that dietary fiber and probiotic use, factors known to affect the gut microbiome, are associated with differential outcomes to ICB. Although causality cannot be addressed from the observational human cohort, where unmeasured confounders may exist, our preclinical models support the hypothesis that dietary fiber and probiotics modulate the microbiome and that antitumor immunity is impaired in mice receiving a low-fiber diet and in those receiving probiotics—with suppression of intratumoral IFN-γ T cell responses in both cases.It would be a bit disappointing if the final conclusion from all this microbiome work was &#39;Eat more vegetables&#39;...[1] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz7015"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just another data point, but my journey through digestive issues and recovery was kicked off by the worst depression and burnout I ever experienced, which started in 2019 and lasted 3 years.My best guess for what happened is that work stress, excessive celebration and coping with the cognitive dissonance of the pre-COVID era and subsequent pandemic, combined with overtraining and the misuse of protein shakes in place of food, left me in a chronically dehydrated state. The body tries to collect moisture from the gut, which opens an opportunity for bacteria to get into the body cavity and blood, which is colloquially called leaky gut. This sets off food sensitivities and eventually an autoimmune condition/response to lectins, gluten, etc, which have proteins similar to linings in the body, joints and thyroid. Then a cascade happens where everything goes out of whack quickly. In my case, I went from being in the best shape of my life, the strongest I had ever been in the gym, to barely able to get out of bed in the morning. In other people, it might present as chronic fatigue, arthritis, etc.I didn&#39;t really believe any of this in 2018, and my meal plan then consisted entirely of everything that I can&#39;t eat today. So I consider what people say politely, but for the most part, they have absolutely no idea what they&#39;re talking about. This experience has made stuff like GMO foods sound absolutely insane to me. Like, why would we ever taint our food supply to make food 5 cents cheaper or &#34;feed the world&#34; when we&#39;ve been operating under artificial scarcity since the end of the second world war? It&#39;s all a crock.Every time you eat inflammatory food, the risk is similar to smoking a cigarette. Probably nothing will happen, but if it sets off your immune system, you may wake up one morning chronically depressed and/or unable to eat something that you rely upon. It got me after I turned 40, YMMV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see the gut brain axis becoming more well known in medicine. Less than 10 years ago it was considered near pseudoscience to consider that the gut could actually influence the brain.https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-preventi...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367209/#:~:tex....https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut%E2%80%93brain_axis"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool. My daughter has a brain shunt due to complications of spina bifida and so we’re thinking of cerebrospinal fluid on a regular basis. As a layman I guess there’s a particular cerebrospinal fluid pressure you want, and that being too high or too low causes issues? Apparently the shunt just drains into her belly so I also found that interesting. Too high and she’ll have terrible headaches and an “alien” head (sorry, don’t mean offense by that but it’s what I’m trying to avoid for my child) and I don’t know what would happen with too little, maybe someone could tell me. Probably not good I’m assuming.I frequent some FB groups for parents of children with SB and am shocked at how large some people let their kids heads get without consulting with or complaining to a doctor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is curious.  During my research into neutral networks we depended on a neuroscience result that found waves of trophic factor (i.e. the stuff used to build up neurons [i.e. learn]) travel in cascading waves from the core of the brain to the periphery.  By adding a sense of location and a learning term contingent on the factor we saw learning 
(xor) prohibited by Minsky&#39;s result (not really prohibited because we changed the model).The take away was that our models of ANNs benefit from considering more that just neural signaling (i.e. solution contents and fluid dynamics).  Is anyone aware of modern work expanding on that front?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Re falling asleep during MRI - I was a subject in a study where for about an hour you had to lie in a machine and repeatedly indicate which of two pictures depicted a larger object.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lat/Lon is really the standard. The fact that some software internally represents it as Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a settled issue. If you look up the coordinate of a location - it&#39;s always in Lat/Long. You can&#39;t rewrite all the books and change all the maps to make it nicer for programmersAs the linked post says, Lon/Lat is generally easier to deal with b/c it matches to X/Y (and the North/Up way we look at maps). But you still have annoyances. For instance Lon goes 0-360 but Lat goes -90 to 90. This is also mathematically inconvenientAdd on top of that the X-Y coordinate on images generally have the X flipped and starting at the top left corner. So changing to Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t fix everything.What I personally lean towards now is converting everything on read-in to a South/East coordinate system so it matches the flipped X-Y of images (like GeoTIFFs) and just always working in that system. Image manipulation, drawing to screen, output etc. - those systems/libraries I can&#39;t really modify myself. Everything else I can manipulate in whatever coordinate system I want. So it makes sense to choose the most convenient. Plus only dealing with positive coordinates is a big plus.That all said, I&#39;m a total noob and I have no &#34;geospatial&#34; background (just writing some software to deal with rain data right now) So this isn&#39;t pro advice.  I&#39;d just be curious what others think"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of two days of bug fixing, after our Python mapping tool suddenly returned bogus data, without any change in the code base.Turns out, we did not pin the pyproj library [1] and they introduced a switch from lon-lat to lat-lon order, per default.It was possible to retain the old behavior with `always_xy: bool = False`. I saw hundrets of similar reports, who knows how many users were effected. Conclusions, a) Always pin your dependencies, b) explicit is better than implicit.Besides, I have a personal, subjective preference for lon-lat, but I understood the lat-lng order to be the officially accepted norm.[1]: https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/proj.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Latitude historically comes first when spoken or written because of the rule of ablaut reduplication, which makes it more natural for the &#39;a&#39; sound to come before the &#39;o&#39; sound when using phrases like this.  For instance, &#39;bish, bash, bosh&#39; sound natural/correct, but &#39;bosh, bash, bish&#39; sounds wrong.I get the order wrong when working with geojson with embarrassing frequency...http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/a-hotchpotch-of-redup..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone stuck in this dark pattern here is a trick I&#39;ve used in the past:Adobe won&#39;t let you cancel without paying the remainder of your subscription fee however you can switch to a different plan. As soon as you switch you&#39;ll have the ability to cancel your &#34;new&#34; plan within 14 days. If you cancel after 14 days they&#39;ll charge you the early termination fee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just yesterday, on a local streaming platform that has a series that I want to watch I was offered &#34;7 days free&#34;. Great, I can watch the accumulated episodes and if I still feel like watching the new ones that come weekly I can keep the subscription, right?Nope, the &#34;7 days free&#34; wasn&#39;t a a trail but 7 extra days when you purchase a full year subscription. I was considering to get a monthly subscription to try it out but since they tried to trick me into a yearly one I simply decide to Torrent the crap out of their content. Sorry not sorry.That&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s great about Apple&#39;s iAP and Apple being the handler of transactions. There&#39;s no tricks, it&#39;s standart on every app: If there&#39;s a trail period you get the trail and if not you directly start paying.  Also no tricks in the cancelation process, it&#39;s all in one place so you can review and cancel easily. You can also change plans right from the same screen. If somehow you manage to purchase something you don&#39;t want, get refunded easily.I really hope that if Apple is forced into allowing 3rd party payments, we end up getting a standardised interface like the one we have currently on Apple&#39;s platforms but with an option to choose the alternative payment method(in the same screen but a different card or account kind of thing, like choosing a card in Apple Pay)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you’re on macOS and just want a good and convenient image editor, I warmly recommend Acorn. The Muellers (owners of Flying Meat Software) have put a lot of effort to make it feel like a really solid Mac application. The price is good and from time to time they offer discounts. The whole experience reminds me of using good old Paintshop Pro back in the late 90s (^_^)Other options are Affinity Photo from Serif Ltd and Pixelmator. IMHO Acorn has much better GUI though. (FWIW, Affinity works fine on Windows too.)I realize that some people need the features from Photoshop and then I guess they have to pay the “Adobe tax”. But if you’re not a photo/graphics professional, you can come a long way with the above options.AFAIK there are also lots of good alternatives for Illustrator and InDesign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t really understand why anyone who claims to be a proponent of a free market economy has an issue with a private corporation deciding what type of content they want to broadcast.JR sold his catalog of intellectual property (podcast episodes) of his own free will and was paid very well for it: about $100M from what I can gather. What Spotify chooses to do with it is completely up to them, even if they bought it with the express intention of &#34;burning&#34; it all, i.e. never broadcasting it, that would still not be censorship. That would be nothing but exercising their intellectual property rights, that they paid for, just like buying the rights to a song that you hate to stop that specific recording from ever being played again is within your right, or even negotiating with the artist to never play it again.He signed a &#34;multi-year&#34; exclusive deal (the details are fuzzy, for obvious reasons) which means he sold his trademark and time for money, which is how the market works.Exactly what he sold (NDA, limitations on his speech in his free time etc.) we&#39;ll probably never know, but whoever calls this &#34;censorship&#34; needs a reality check. There exists plenty of proper censorship in the world if you look for it, and this isn&#39;t it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I speak for the majority of people here.Before the Spotify deal, you would just see couple of Joe Rogan clips on YouTube and you have sat through maybe 3-4 entire podcasts. You don&#39;t care much about MMA or you don&#39;t think comedians are that important/hypeworthy as the JRE fandom would claim.After the Spotify deal you just slowly stopped even seeing the clips because for some reason you just don&#39;t care to search for them and YouTube stopped recommending new clips.You would hear about some hot takes about Joe Rogan vs something but you just don&#39;t find it worthwhile to investigate or frankly having an opinion about them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bigger than Spotify.Rogan was a proactive person conducting open research into the world around him. When proactive people investigate things and share their findings, it now only takes a few to dislike the findings, fuss, and have the findings removed.To those that support this, I have 4 questions:1. Is disincentivising sharing knowledge really good for the world?2. Is it reasonable to expect 100% of inquiries be 100% accurate on the very first attempt?3. Is it efficient for society to repeat the same research many times since previous investigations are scrubbed from public record?4. Is it healthy for public discourse to be made less diverse and only concern &#39;safe&#39; topics?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this bill is strongly opposed by the Internet Society, ACLU, CDT, and EFF, the critiques I&#39;ve read don&#39;t get much into the real &#34;why&#34; behind this legislation continuing to be pushed so forcefully. The pretext is, of course, &#34;protect the children&#34; and more generally law-and-order with a bonus side-helping of &#34;stop those awful social media giants.&#34; While these justifications are (hopefully) obvious misdirection to most, I&#39;d like to see more mainstream discussion about who this bill benefits and why. The legislation &#39;coincidentally&#39; achieves exactly the agenda proposed by the &#34;surveillance state&#34; (ie CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS, law enforcement lobby, state prosecutors, etc). While it doesn&#39;t specifically prohibit public access to encryption, it seeks to create nearly the same effect by making it legally risky for large social media and platform companies to offer end-to-end encryption as a default to law-abiding citizens. It&#39;s no accident that almost every version of the bill creates this exposure to essentially bottomless legal liability for platforms offering secure communications.Frankly, this scares the crap out of me. These people seem incapable of understanding the existential threat to free society and democracy posed by limiting everyone&#39;s ability to communicate private thoughts. While not explicitly outlawing untappable communications, it&#39;s much easier to identify who is choosing to use end-to-end encryption when it&#39;s not the typical default. This will ultimately put all of us who care about secure communications under default suspicion, whether our interest in private comms is a moral ideal, political principle or simply proper technical architecture and data hygiene. In today&#39;s multi-national environment of nation-state, criminal and privateer (NSO etc) threat actors, insecure communications over Internet infrastructure should only be seen as an ill-advised risky behavior or a technical bug."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 3 Techdirt links in the article are especially helpful for catching up.EARN IT is another skirmish in the 30+ year old Crypto Wars. For those who care about defending privacy and encryption, exhaustion is not an option.Power-hungry governments must be viewed similarly to an APT in this context. They are following their very nature, and they will never stop inventing new approaches.There is no other option except to  stay organized and always ready to engage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those living in California: https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/e-mail-meA copy of my note if you would like a template:```
Dear Senator Feinstein,I am deeply disappointed with your support of the EARN IT act and am expressing my deep concern and disapproval of such a bill.Congruent with the recent report released by Stanford, I am expressing my deep disappointment in your sponsorship of the EARN IT act. I believe it represents a fundamental undermining of citizens right to privacy through strong encryption under the extremely divisive framing of &#34;protecting the children&#34;. As a Father of two children myself, I do not believe that whatever incremental improvement to their safety, if any at all, justifies the undermining of encryption of ordinary citizens. In my opinion, this law actively undermines the fourth amendment in the digital realm and I must state that if you believe this is in my best interest, you have lost both my vote and my trust.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, I thought I would resurrect my HN account for this.I wrote this article a little over a decade ago, when I was still in college, and I knew almost nothing about the world. (I still don&#39;t, but I didn&#39;t then, either) It&#39;s fun to see that it still resonates with people despite the naivety and the slight sense of &#34;I am headed for success&#34; that makes it hard for me to re-read.My initial reflection on the article was that I had fallen off the &#34;do things, tell people&#34; wagon a little bit, having let go of my twitter account and with it much of the easiest path to doing things and telling people. I still work in tech but I haven&#39;t created anything I&#39;m particularly excited about in a good while, so I felt that I was failing my own ideal.Then, of course, I remembered that I hiked all of Ireland&#39;s long-distance trails (https://toughsoles.ie) and have a reasonably successful, if niche, youtube channel (https://youtube.com/toughsoles). Funny that my mindset, especially regarding this article, is so tech-focused that I automatically discount something I&#39;ve been doing for five years.All that said, I&#39;m starting to look for new opportunities in the larger-than-startup space. Shoot me an email at carl@flax.ie and let&#39;s chat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually very good advice from personal experience.The best career results (promotions) I have seen came from people who built a prototype of some sort then evangelized it, even if it wasn’t necessarily a complete product, often just a good prototype.First example: This guy took the Intel Edison and built a pretty cool project and brought it to our maker faire events. He ended up in conversation with the CEO of some company and ended up landing a $500K exec job. Just from building a skateboard hack and trying to tell people about it.Second: I knew a guy who built this neat prototype of a compute service and then did a keynote talk at a Meetup. It didn’t really work as a product but the website was convincing. It was enough to “get bought” by a major tech co and land him a CTO job.Another time I saw a guy leave a FAANG and build a compelling IoT type project in three months. Again, he ended up with a CTO level job after a few months.My take away is if you want an executive job, build something somewhat cool, even as a prototype, and go try to sell it for real. Even if you don’t raise any money or make it work as a business it is often way better than submitting resumes.There is something much more powerful about creating something that generates a lot of engagement and conversation, even if it is only half baked but looks decent and your storytelling is compelling.This isn’t interviewing it’s auditioning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alexa… what is &#34;survivorship bias&#34;?Implicit in this argument is that you need to build the right thing and talk to the right people.I&#39;ve been to industry events where I&#39;ve seen people give &#34;career limiting&#34; presentations on something awful they&#39;ve built. And I&#39;ve seen great people stuck in a corner with the worst kind of industry fraudster.Sure, you&#39;ve got to kiss a lot of frogs to meet your prince. But you also have to remmeber that you might end up kissing a poisonous one in the meantime."</p>

AMEN!&#34;.&#34;I was running late to an interview this morning but stopped to help a man who fell off of his bike and fixed it up for him. Afterwards I bought him a coffee and talked about life. He mentioned how he had to go to work but was touched by meeting me, he said we had a real connection. I go to the interview and guess what! The man was my interviewer! He immediately offered me a job at 1.5m a year plus bonuses and is fast tracking me to become a regional director. Remember to be a nice human #Hashtag #Human #WEAREPEOPLE #ConnectWithMe&#34;It&#39;s just a giant circle jerk."</p>

And if you haven’t read The Gervais Principle, I highly recommend it, although it may bum you out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a recovering perfectionist who has read their fair share of Brene Brown, Steven Pressfield, Seth Godin, Tony Robbins, Anne Lamott, and many more.The best metaphors I&#39;ve read is in Bird by Bird. The author describes two different scenarios.The first is that perfection &amp; progress is much like driving late at night with headlights. You will only be able to see as far as your headlights allow. You might be going through a canyon, on a straight and narrow highway, or going the wrong way. But all you know for certain is what is in front of you.The second is that you have to frame your perfectionism around something. That could be your loved ones, your dreams in life, whatever. If it&#39;s always framed around your past achievements, you&#39;re comparing to the past and not to the future version of what could be. Getting clear on why you&#39;re doing it is very important.I truly believe you can devoid yourself of perfectionism. I&#39;ve gone from being afraid to publish work to the public, to only publishing in the public and shaping my work based on the imperfections being pointed out in my shitty first attempts.Your first attempt will be shitty. Your second attempt will be less shitty. Do this for long enough and you&#39;ll start to get a feel for proficiency and what others see as &#34;perfection&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mental health issues too often remain untreated among high-achievers who are able to maintain a surface appearance of holding it together.  It&#39;s a good trend that nowadays we feel able to talk more openly about struggles like this.I see myself in this article but for me, the word that was the key to find resources to get better was the broader acronym RNT, &#34;Repetitive negative thoughts&#34;.  Perfectionism themes are one common type of thought for me, but I also have several other categories that don&#39;t fit in that frame.  Two resources I found particularly useful:* https://www.amazon.com/Negative-Thoughts-Workbook-Repetitive... &#34;The Negative Thoughts Workbook&#34; A practical self-help book with chapters to work through each common category of negative thought* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672052/ &#34;Constructive and Unconstructive Repetitive Thought&#34; A survey in the clinical literature which I found particularly helpful for identifying the subset of negative thoughts which has been actually helping me.  This helped me ease up on the majority of unhelpful thoughts with greater confidence that I&#39;m still preserving the small subset of my thought pattern which has helped me succeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article. I saw myself a lot in it. I find myself on this orange site multiple times a day largely for some of the reasons outlined.&gt; She dwells in puddles for fear of the oceanwoah. Beautiful line. Great writing can really make the content more impactful. I find myself regularly absorbed in the minutia of a technology used in a project. I tell myself it&#39;s because I find the subject fascinating and knowing it deeply will make the solution (and me) better (which is partly true), but I often have that thought niggling in the back of my mind, &#34;Am I spending too long on this detail because I&#39;m avoiding tackling the bigger problem because I&#39;m worried I might fail?&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems pretty awful to suggest that the government-managed &#39;no-fly&#39; list should be used for anything after watching how poorly it was used and abused as a security measure. But considering the airlines look to the government to solve their financial problems, it&#39;s no surprise they would look to the government to solve their passenger problems as well. I assume begging for government intervention has become an airline CEO reflex, at this point.Bureaucracy, security theater, and airline/airport ineptitude has turned flying into a painful, regrettable process. Add shrinking seat space and airport and airplane booze to the mix and you&#39;ve got a recipe for stress, discomfort, and short tempers.I suspect booze is actually the primary culprit. I&#39;ve flown a few hundred flights in my time and only witnessed two, rather tame, incidents that caused people to be kicked off flights or caused in-air arguments. In one case the culprit was very drunk. The other case the culprit was very hung over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is probably a good idea, but not as an extension of the current no-fly list, which is opaque and lacking accountability.The &#34;disruptive passenger&#34; no-fly list should have clear criteria for why people are put on it and for how long, and a clear process for challenging being incorrectly placed on the list.  Ideally this would be a bit better than having airlines collaborate amongst themselves to create their own no-fly list which can&#39;t be legally challenged because they&#39;re private organizations that can mostly do what they want.  On the other hand, being blacklisted by private companies would in some ways be less creepy/authoritarian than the no-fly lists as they exist now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is with some of the responses in this thread! I understand some cases are not so clear, but if you do something as blatant as punch a flight attendant in the face I think that’s grounds to be put on such a list. There should be a policy so that after a period (or going through some program) you could then be removed from the list though..It actually blew my mind when I heard that you could assault someone on a plane and not be instantly banned"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here.HVM is the ultimate conclusion to years of optimal evaluation research. I&#39;ve been a great enthusiast of optimal runtimes. Until now, though, my most efficient implementation had barely passed 50 million rewrites per second. It did beat GHC in cases where optimality helped, like λ-encoded arithmetic, but in more real-world scenarios, it was still far behind. Thanks to a recent memory layout breakthrough, though, we managed to reach a peak performance of 2.5 billion rewrites per second, on the same machine. That&#39;s a ridiculous 50x improvement.That is enough for it to enjoy roughly the same performance of GHC in normal programs, and even outperform it when automatic parallelism kicks in, if that counts! Of course, there are still cases where it will perform worse (by 2x at most usually, and some weird quadratic cases that should be fixed [see issues]), but remember it is a 1-month prototype versus the largest lazy functional compiler in the market. I&#39;m confident HVM&#39;s current design is able to scale and become the fastest functional runtime in the world, because I believe the optimal algorithm is inherently superior.I&#39;m looking for partners! Check the notes at the end of the repository&#39;s README if you want to get involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks pretty awesome, and holds much promise for the future.
Optimal beta reduction has always seemed like something of theoretical interest only, but Victor has been working many years on making it more practical, which deserves a lot of respect.&gt; HVM files look like untyped Haskell.Why not make it look exactly like Haskell?
So that every valid Haskell program is automatically a valid Hvm program,
while the reverse need not hold due to hvm being untyped.Instead the syntax looks like a mix of Haskell and Lisp, with parentheses around application, and prefix operators. I prefer the cleaner Haskell syntax.Some of the speedup examples look somewhat artificial:The exponential speedup is on 2^n compositions of the identity function,
which has no practical use. It would be nice to show such a speedup on a nontrivial function.The arithmetical example uses a binary representation, but strangely uses unary implementation of operators, with addition implemented as repeated increment, and multiplication as repeated addition. Why not use binary implementation of operators? Does that not show a good speedup?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Story time! Back around 2008 when we were developing the first version of AWS CloudWatch (which was then code-named &#34;Granite&#34;) we had two problems to solve:1. What should the API for PutMetricData look like?2. Where should we store that data?(you know, minor issues)At the time, we decided that #1 was more critical than #2 (and of course #2 depends deeply on the answer to #1), and that the best way to solve it would be to do some learning-by-prototyping - stand up an internal version of CloudWatch to dogfood with some other Amazon services and be able to go to prospective internal customers with a &#34;working&#34; service that they could kick the tires on, not just some API docs and paper prototypes. So I quickly hacked up an implementation of &#34;GraniteDataStore&#34; called &#34;InMemoryDataStore&#34;, which would store every PutMetricData request in a HashMap and nowhere else.When I sent the code out for peer review, my reviewer was aghast at the idea that we would stand up a service that would knowingly store different copies of the data on every server, and lose it all on process restart. I responded by renaming InMemoryDataStore to FakeInMemoryDataStore, but that wasn&#39;t enough. Finally, we settled on a name of (if memory serves) FakeFakeFakeDataStoreThatLosesAllYourData and that was enough to get my merge approved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been an Amazon SDE and an Amazon SDM. I enjoyed my time as an SDE, luckily free from these horror stories. After having been an SDM, I understand how these horror stories can form.Generally, Amazon has two minds about performance management. In written documentation, it&#39;s all about whether your reports meet the role guidelines. The written documentation is solid. They share how to evaluate people objectively and how to minimize bias. Verbally, it&#39;s all about numbers and probability. The organization wants X number of people to leave this year, to do that they want Y number of people in performance improvement plans.There is an intense pressure to force a certain amount of attrition each year. While Amazon may claim stack ranking doesn&#39;t exist, Amazon uses rating and calibration mechanisms to learn who you think as a manager are your lowest performers. As a manager, you get verbal (never written) lashings from your manager and skip manager to put the lowest performers on performance plans that ensure that any attrition counts. As soon as you capitulate, your lowest performer is now considered a low performer.As an SDM, I wanted to maintain the illusion of great Amazon culture for my team. Behind the scenes, I spent a lot of time advocating for my team and trying to poke holes in the performance ratings of other teams. It was exhausting. There are certainly a lot of shortcuts I could have taken like putting potential internal transfers on performance management, but did not. I feel bad for the LinkedIn poster here, I think he had a lazy manager."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve worked at Amazon. I made it a few years, but was almost pipped in the first few months. Management dropped a huge project on me, a brand new tier 1 service, with full dns resolution, api, database, distributed system, along with micro services. The deadline was three months. Brand new tech stack. When I was struggling to meet the deadline, we started having “performance conversations”.I ended up switching teams and had a decent time at the company, but the nightmare situations are very real. You are replaceable and there’s no mercy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some people meet this with a healthy level of scepticism, which is great. However I used to work at Amazon, working on the performance evaluation and HR tools used within the company. It was a couple of years back, but I am fairly certain that the same tools are still used, given that all of them were developed from scratch. At the time it was in line with the company&#39;s PR of removing its toxic work culture.It&#39;s worth mentioning that it wasn&#39;t uncommon for people to move around teams, and to be honest HR is not the most exciting field for software development anyways. So, as expected, the HR dev teams had people move around quite a bit. Nothing toxic so far.One of the projects I worked on was what used to be called the dev list or personal improvement plan (pip) now renamed to Pivot. Most likely the exact same same tool. Management wanted to update the processes in order to automate as much as possible and reduce the risk of managers putting someone in pip, just because they didn&#39;t like them. However the process was set up in such a way that a manager can progress an employee through a pip for waaaay too long, until a failsafe, or a second pair of eyes even takes a look at it. I, personally, voiced my concerns about it, but it was shrugged off as &#34;it shouldn&#39;t happen&#34;, &#34;managers wouldn&#39;t do that&#34; and &#34;it&#39;s fine&#34; by the project stakeholders.The project starts, development is going a usual and a couple of years go by. I moved to another project within the HR space. Most of the team developing the tool has also moved on to greener pastures. Apart from that one guy, who has been there since its inception. He went from being a backend engineer, learning React and painstakingly working on a messy frontend codebase, eventually leaving him the only person competent enough to make changes to it. Eventually he was fed up and wanted to move to a different team. Lo and behold - his manager, the manager of the team building the pip tool, put him in pip to prevent him from moving. Haven&#39;t seen someone decide and actually leave a company as quickly as he did. So if the manager of the pip company can use it to blackmail people not to leave, I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s like for the rest of the company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google searches for React and node.js exceed searches for Ruby on Rails by 100% and 50%, respectively [1]. Some people have used this to argue that React/node are more popular than Rails. But I wonder if perhaps this discrepancy appears in Google Trends because it takes more google searches to accomplish the same thing in React/node versus Rails. I feel the Rails ethos of &#34;convention over configuration&#34; allows me to accomplish the same objective with less googling.[1] https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=31&amp;date=today%2..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to write Rails professionally for many yearsThis comparison isn&#39;t a good one. Rails is an all-encompasing framework.If you compare Rails to something like Nest.js, there&#39;s not much you&#39;re missing. Nest is one of the best application frameworks I&#39;ve used in any language, and it comes with all this stuff you say JS doesn&#39;t have.---EDIT: To clarify (because it is confusingly named), NestJS is a framework modeled after Spring Boot for TypeScript + Node:https://nestjs.com/Not to be confused with Next.js, which is a framework for building SSR React apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps I missed it, but the single biggest reason that I moved away from SPAs (such as React) and back to server-side rendering of templates is avoiding having to model my data twice. That’s a lot of overhead.Granted, I’m in the B2B software space, so end-user expectations are those of accuracy, consistency and performance. I imagine expectations (or perhaps priorities) are different for consumer-facing applications."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Last night I watched a YouTube video that had a song in the background that I hadn&#39;t heard but really liked. I pulled up Shazam but it didn&#39;t recognize the song, so I took to Google. I entered the lyric and added the search terms &#34;lyrics&#34; and &#34;r&amp;b&#34; at the end. Google returned 4 YouTube videos to songs that didn&#39;t contain the lyric, a link to a Boyz II Men song on Genius that didn&#39;t contain the lyric (good job Google, you know an R&amp;B band), a link to peterbe.com to find a song by lyrics, and a bunch of other useless links. I clicked on to page 2, which hilariously presented 3 of the 4 YouTube videos that were on page 1.I was immediately turned off, so I pulled up DuckDuckGo and Bing, entered the same exact query, and both engines returned the song I was looking for in the first result. I laughed out loud.I then thought to myself, &#34;I wonder how many pages I would have had to flip through in Google to find this result.&#34; Eventually, I found it. It was the 68th result on page 7."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just gonna throw this out there as I&#39;m noticing it more and more at this point since switching languages.What the actual F has happened to google search results for programming issues?I used to be able to google a question and get, more or less, a right answer from a forum or stack overflow.Recently, many coding tutorial websites have clearly figured out how to hack googles pageranks and now instead of one &#39;right enough answer&#39;, its 5 clone &#39;tutorial&#39; websites, with all the same crappy answer that isn&#39;t actually what I was asking. Like I can&#39;t use google for coding questions any more. Not like I was able to previously. Also, Stackoverflow with bangs from ddg are broken and it thinks I&#39;m a robot. No answer except to go to SO directly and search."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I call this the squeeze.Google, even after all its attempts, is still a one trick pony. They have to grow at least 20% year over year to justify the market cap. They weren’t able to create a two pillar company like Amazon (AWS + Retail) so what do uncreative master executives naturally turn to? Of course their only cash cow.“ Rabban! I place you in charge of Arrakis. It&#39;s yours to squeeze, as I promised. I want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze!” - Dune"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m shocked those defending the Apple tax aren&#39;t considering the fact that businesses are just offloading that tax onto consumers making things artificially more expensive for iOS users. Even worse, when you do this you can&#39;t communicate why this is the case or tell people you can use the web for cheaper so users feel like you&#39;re just scamming them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple allows “free apps” that are entirely ad-supported, never giving Apple a dime (aside from $99/year), yet they are consuming infrastructure: hosting pages, downloads, reviewer time, etc.  Why isn’t Apple concerned about any of those costs?  Simple: they make overwhelmingly most of their App Store money from the handful of developers that offer purchases.  This also leads to perverse outcomes like Apple dragging its feet on scams that make them heaps of money.Developers are literally subsidizing other developers, and it’s not necessarily the richest ones helping the poorest ones.  Someone trying to make money on a $0.99 app is sacrificing more to Apple than Facebook does with their free app.That’s why I find all these percentage and payment discussions weird: income is so insanely distributed that a lot of this literally does not apply to more than 80% of the stuff on the store.  There are fundamental issues that need to be resolved too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re nuts. All they are doing is setting themselves up for another set of lawsuits.Seriously: Apple should focus on selling hardware and be happy to facilitate those payments that people - and application developers - voluntarily process through their system.All this stupid taxation of other peoples&#39; businesses should stop, it is anti-competitive behavior that they themselves would never tolerate.Imagine if in the past Apple would have had to pay 30% of their gross to Microsoft in order to be allowed to run their software on Windows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a rough datapoint, I run a consumer targeted e-commerce site. We ran a campaign before Christmas were we were selling a new product that was only marketed on Facebook, we are certain that (almost) all customers found it though that Facebook campaign. Facebook was only able to attribute about 50% of the sales to the ads, it should have been close to 100%. This then meant that Facebooks estimated CPA was effectively double what it actually was.Important to note about 60% of our customers are on an iOS device, which is a little higher than the global average but matches the market segment we are in in the UK.The situation improved after about 4 weeks, I believe Facebook now uses some &#34;AI&#34; to help with attribution on iOS, but it&#39;s somewhat difficult to be sure as by then we had other campaigns running.So, this will definitely be effecting marketers decision making process of where to allocate spend. It certainly made us more courteous about spending on Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when Facebook Platform came out. The super early version where you could embed your app on Facebook and engage with the social graph.I thought dang, this is smart. They’ll basically own the next level up the stack from the browser: they’ll own the “social chrome” of every application on the web.Although it devolved into spam, Facebook was a hot spot of weird social games for a while there. And every web dev was learning how to build Facebook apps. We wondered if we’d even really need a domain for much more than a landing page, if 99% of our engagement was going to come through Facebooks.And then they killed it because they wanted to own the entire experience inside Facebook. It became not a walled garden, but a walled flower pot.It always seemed short sighted  to me. Yes, they lost control allowing third party apps in their frame. But didn’t they want to be a Microsoft and not a WordPerfect?Looking back, I wonder if it was a missed opportunity. They have to go try to be the metaverse because social never became a platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice how Zuck said $10bn in the analysts call with nothing to back it up, but the whole press jumps on it. Apple is not Facebook&#39;s problem, all they did was giving users a choice, which should have happened ages ago. So Facebook just says Apple kills our business without ever thinking that maybe users don&#39;t like the way they do business. If they did, they wouldn&#39;t opt out…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Poignant remarks.  We&#39;re not getting any younger:&#34;Erik &#34;alphageek&#34; Jan Tromp passed away in 2020 after a long illness. He was
a long-time member of the Slackware core team doing a ton of stuff behind
the scenes and a master of lesser-known programming languages like Tcl. :-)
For a long time he lived closer to me geographically than anyone else on
the core team, but unfortunately with an international border between us
we never did meet in person. But he was there in chat every day and was a
good friend to everyone on the team. He is greatly missed. Sorry I didn&#39;t
get 15.0 out in time for you to see it...My old friend Brett Person also passed away in 2020. Without Brett, it&#39;s
possible that there wouldn&#39;t be any Slackware as we know it - he&#39;s the one
who encouraged me to upload it to FTP back in 1993 and served as Slackware&#39;s
original beta-tester. He was long considered a co-founder of this project.
I knew Brett since the days of the Beggar&#39;s Banquet BBS in Fargo back in
the 80&#39;s. When the Slackware Project moved to Walnut Creek CDROM, Brett was
hired as well, and we spent many hours on the road and sitting next to each
other representing Slackware at various trade shows. Brett seemed to know
all kinds of computer luminaries and was an amazing storyteller, always
with his smooth radio voice. Gonna miss you too, pal.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slackware was my first Linux too. I remember making the installation floppy disk set. And then it was my first introduction to running a computer others could remotely control. After learning how to dial up AOL from Linux then join an IRC chat room, I was immediately &#34;pwned&#34; by someone in that chat room who guessed my root password and rm -rf /&#39;d my entire hard drive. I was probably 8 or 9 at the time and cried."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the last entries in the -current changelog before the 15.0 release was the following:  Wed Feb 2 04:17:39 UTC 2022
  fortune -m &#34;I will be finished tomorrow&#34; fortunes2
  a/kernel-generic-5.15.19-x86_64-1.txz: Upgraded.
  a/kernel-huge-5.15.19-x86_64-1.txz: Upgraded.
  [...]

This gives the following:  %% (fortunes2)
  A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the
  program on which he was working.  &#34;I will be finished tomorrow,&#34; the
  programmer promptly replied.
      &#34;I think you are being unrealistic,&#34; said the manager. &#34;Truthfully,
  how long will it take?&#34;
      The programmer thought for a moment.  &#34;I have some features that I wish
  to add.  This will take at least two weeks,&#34; he finally said.
      &#34;Even that is too much to expect,&#34; insisted the manager, &#34;I will be
  satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.&#34;
      The programmer agreed to this.
      Several years later, the manager retired.  On the way to his
  retirement lunch, he discovered the programmer asleep at his terminal.
  He had been programming all night.
    -- Geoffrey James, &#34;The Tao of Programming&#34;

No matter how practical it is to use Slackware in the current year (works for me!), it makes me very happy that projects like this are still going. Congratulations Patrick on a fantastic release."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But remember to reduce your personal carbon footprint! /sWe&#39;re expected to shave off a few kilos of CO2 here and there, usually at significant personal expense, while nothing is being done about these releases that a) could be avoided relatively easily b) have a much bigger impact.The abstract mentions ~8 million metric tons of methane per year. Using a GWP of 28 (which seems to be the value from the IPPC&#39;s AR5) that&#39;s equivalent to around 224 million tons of CO2.That&#39;s 224 billion kg CO2e, or around 28 kg CO2e for every human on the world, just from the large leaks (not from the ongoing smaller leaks which are &gt;10x as big according to the article). So yeah, go ahead and tell me (and everyone else) to go vegan for a month [1] or make similarly impactful changes just so companies can continue venting methane.To avoid being only negative: The obvious solution would be to require companies to buy emission certificates for those emissions, with a penalty factor that accounts for the probability of detection if they didn&#39;t accurately self-report and had to get caught. This would create an immediate incentive to reduce those easily avoidable emissions, and should be relatively easy to implement if we can get accurate enough data from satellites or aircraft. It would also ensure these emissions are accounted for in the emissions trading framework, so we don&#39;t emit the allocated amount elsewhere and are then surprised by the unaccounted-for emissions.[1] Assuming I replace 250 kcal from pork per day with Tofu (around 100g of pork which seems to be considered &#34;one serving&#34;), this would be savings of ~1 kg CO2e per day: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-kcal-poore"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; EDF is planning to launch its own methane-detecting satellite in about a year, which will take much sharper pictures, showing smaller leaks. Other organizations are developing their own methane detectors.When this does launch, the images taken should be open to public consumption, preferably on a website. Once we put these companies on blast with the hard facts, things will begin to change. Very quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting how some &#34;dark patterns&#34;, especially of the psychological kind, are actually important elements of good game design.For example the &#34;illusion of control&#34; (The game cheats or hides information to make you think you&#39;re better than you actually are) is everywhere, and it makes better games. One classic example is &#34;coyote time&#34; in platform games. Or for a more specific example, in Portal, at one time, you have to quickly fire a portal to avoid being crushed, it is a tense situation, and an important part of the story. So, to avoid a stupid death at the worst time, if you fire the wrong portal, it silently switches the other portal to correct your mistake.Aesthetic Manipulations (Trick questions or toying with emotions or our subconscious desires) is the entire point of many games. We want games to play with our emotions. Take a horror game for instance, you are sitting on a couch, at home, in the least scary environment you can imagine, the game has to pull all the trick on you if you want the scares you paid for. And no one is going to tell you that getting attached to characters is a bad thing and they would rather see them as the bunch of pixels they are.Frequency biases are all over the place too, usually in favor of the player. So much that when the game uses true randomness, it feels unfair. Good games are designed for player enjoyment, not to punish them with randomness.It also considers competition a dark pattern, are sports a dark pattern too?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this site has a very low threshold for considering something a &#39;dark pattern&#39;. If you look at the psychological section, these are all considered dark patterns:* A leveling up system* Badges/achievements* Collecting things* Getting better tools/equipment as the game progressesThat&#39;s like...most games, I think? Most single-player games at least probably have at least one of those.edit: some of the examples listed here are hilarious&gt; D4DJ Groovy Mix&gt; &#34;difficulty 1 through 14 is easy to learn and master, while 15 is the hardest difficulty in the game. makes people think that they have 90% of the skill of the best player but in reality it is not the case&#34;&gt; Magic: The Gathering Arena&gt; &#34;There are mysterious matchmaking algorithms. It isn&#39;t clear how these work. At face, they appear to match players of similar skill or deck strength.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this can help parents and kids with mobile games, but let’s talk about the elephant in the room of the games we ourselves are addicted to or our kids keep coming back to play.When I was a teen I was addicted to World of Warcraft. I played for a few years before quitting. My grades dropped, my social life was hurting, and all for just in game items? I remember how worried my parents were about my screen time and the lengths they went to try and limit it.Some of my best friends continue to play to this day and keep telling me that they are bored with it and will quit next expansion. They are now re-playing the same game over like they did with me a decade ago as it’s now a “classic” version.How do we help people get help they desire when these games create almost a combative, intervention needed type of situation?There’s https://www.restartlife.com/ and other similar types of websites out there to help, but I feel like the problem is the dark patterns already have a hold on one’s behavior to the point where only that person can be the agent of change or a major event happens in their life to spark the change."</p>

We describe an ultra-low-field brain MRI scanner that operates using a standard AC power outlet and is low cost to build.”This is fantastic. What a sentence to get to write."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The images are better that I expected.
The ‘FLAIR like’ image is not particularly FLAIR like. FLAIR are nicer to look at when fat saturated (not everyone agrees with that), but that’s probably not feasible at that field strength and adding scan time would be a problem on these long sequences.
Voxel sizes of 2x2x10 are pretty terrible resolution, but if the alternative is nothing, I guess that’s ok.
The static field is so low, I’m impressed it works at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Edit: This post was intended as a reply to https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30209618 , presently below&gt; The lead author, Dr. Craig Bennett, wanted to get something fresh, so he headed in to the grocery story first thing in the morning. At the fish counter, he spoke the words that will echo down the centuries as a testimony to the dedication and drive of neuroscientists throughout the ages:&gt;&#34;I need a full length Atlantic Salmon. For science.&#34;That reminds me of the day that I needed a strong lightweight cable for a silica-fiber melting/drawing apparatus. After some puzzling, I realized that bicycle shift/brake cabling would probably be perfect for the task.I&#39;ll never forget the puzzled look at the bike shop -- &#34;What kind of bike are you putting it on?&#34;  &#34;I&#39;m not, I just need some brake cable for a science experiment....&#34;  As I recall, I think we finally settled on some precut cabling for a GT Zaskar of some kind.Similar things came up the day that I needed a valve that switched faster than our dedicated micro-switching valves. A similar light-bulb went on, and I went down to the nearby auto shop for a fuel-injector.&#34;What kind of car do you need it for?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t, but there are a couple of different valve-switching protocols, some that latch open and others that accept straight TTL at reasonable currents. I need one of those.&#34;That experiment was brought to you by an injector for, I believe, a Dodge Caravan, and later, when I needed another, an injector for a Ford Mustang.  Fuel-injectors are really good valves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Best description of the hack I have found yet. The hack is on the solana side not the ethereum side of the bridge https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1489041221947375616*edit: another good thread https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1489044939732406275"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This highlights an incentive issue and a paradigm issue in the blockchain space. There is a strong incentive to get new protocols up and running and even though users are technically responsible as they can audit the code, most users, of course, are not qualified to do so, and stand to make more from exploiting any vulnerabilities they find than they are pointing for them out.The issue of paradigm is just how poorly suited EVM is as a smart contract language. It is too hard to manage the complexity of bytecode with memory managed on chain and in contract code. When small errors have huge consequences and there are no second chances, EVM is and should be pointed out to be one of the worst standards Ethereum has brought to crypto.When it comes to high stakes programming and especially in a space where new programs are written quickly and often, its almost objectively obvious that functional styles with more guard rails is the better choice. Nothing running on chain needs an infinite loop or many other fancy features one typically expects from a programming language - restrictions and readability in smart contract code are more important to computational chains than seat-belts are to automobiles, but the network effect is slowing the space down.Edit: Some people have pointed out this was an issue with Solana contracts, which run on Rust - so I was wrong to use this as an example for half of my point, but still believe the point stands. Even Rust IMO is not tied down enough for contract code, but the fact that it can happen on Rust which is loads better then EVM for bug catching I think proves the point a bit more if anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most people don&#39;t love fiddling with settings. People love when software does what they need, and some of them will be willing to fiddle with settings if they have to. Settings are a cost the user pays (just like data entry, loading times, hard drive space, loss of privacy, ads, or the monetary price of the software) in order to get the value. If good defaults mean most users don&#39;t have to muck with settings, great, your software is now more valuable. But the only thing worse than having to tweak a setting to get your functionality is not being able to get your functionality at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an engineer on Microsoft Office, users would often request features that the product already had. It was great that their problem was quickly fixed (just point them to the right setting), but it shows the lack of discoverability that happens when the list of settings gets long and you have to dig for them. If you can do the right thing automatically and avoid having a setting, that is an improvement.My other observation was that everybody said Office had too many features and then asked for two more."</p>

Why the bathrooms next to the bedrooms for your kid? Why cement floors and no floor heating? How did you end up at 400A/96kw of service (my car charges slower than that!). Why not building a indoor pool instead of a outdoor one? Feels a lot like your architect and contractors saw you had too much tech money and not enough common sense.That, and the fake pretending to care about the environment when you live in the middle of nowhere and have a heated outdoor pool with 96kw of service in Canada is just astounding!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beautiful house and there was a day I would have been extremely jealous but...I live in Oregon and in 2020 chose to (was not officially in an evac zone but the smoke was awful) evacuate when the horrible Beachie Creek and Lionshead [0] fires ripped through the Santiam Canyon. Houses that my wife and I had looked at possibly purchasing were torched, as well as some of the most pristine ancient forest I&#39;ve seen [1].My outlook about living in the forest drastically changed after these events. The Beachie Creek fire reached 130,000 acres overnight at a growth rate of 2.77 acres per SECOND. [2].You couldn&#39;t pay me enough money to live in a forest at this point. It&#39;s just too damn dangerous. Also, the flat roof seems problematic. Everyone I know in the PNW who has owned a flat roof has had issues with it due to pooling water. That far north, I imagine snow accumulation would also be a really big problem in terms of stress on the roof.[0] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiam_Fire[1] - https://www.opb.org/article/2021/09/02/oregon-field-guide-op...[2] - https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7001/"</p>

It&#39;s pretty amazing but has a pretty steep learning curve (although they&#39;re getting better and better at this). The real power of HA is the rich integration ecosystem[2], the Community Store[3], and that it runs locally (more reliable and much faster for things like motion sensors, etc).It expresses everything from every integration as an entity in various device classes so as long as some random tech is supported by an integration you can group them seamlessly. For example - I have Z-wave based motion detectors but I can control Hue lights and Wemo switches for motion detection - but only if I&#39;m home as reported by the zone feature in their iOS companion application.Their supervisor/docker based install for Raspberry Pi is pretty slick[4]. Write an image to disk as you usually would and you get a bare-bones OS with Home Assistant running in docker. Then there are additional docker-based add-ons you can install for stuff like MQTT, Z-Wave, Let&#39;s Encrypt, SSH access, nginx, and more. All managed in the web ui. Pretty cool.[1] https://www.home-assistant.io/[2] https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/[3] https://hacs.xyz/[4] https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi"</p>

Same with central heating, I rarely need to adjust it and I don&#39;t see the appeal of messing around with some integrated interface, i&#39;d rather an old fashioned radiator dial or an independent reliable digital central heating timer I might have to tweak for 2 mins once a year.None of these things are analogous to the TV remote control, there&#39;s a reason why we haven&#39;t seen similar precursors such as radiator switches on extension cords, we don&#39;t need to constantly adjust these things at high frequency... and when we do, we are literally walking past it (light switch).&lt;/rant&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Quick story: I was the CFO for a company that sold to a private equity group (PEG). I took over as the CEO as the founders retired, leaving me to deal with the PEG. It quickly became apparent that the PEG managers looked at everything through the lens of an Excel spreadsheet.  These guys were brilliant attorneys and analysts but lacked experience building businesses and managing teams.    Ultimately, they couldn’t add much value in terms of operations or strategy, but they were great at financial modeling/quantitative analysis and forcing us to justify expenses.  That may sound good at first—eliminating wasteful spending—but it ultimately led to the gradual erosion of the company culture and employee loyalty.  It’s easy to cut benefits and pay given that many workers lack the leverage to do anything about it, while it’s much harder to reduce hard costs like materials and equipment.  That meant employees just kept getting squeezed, and it was surprisingly difficult to quantify the impact that terminating an employee or cutting benefits would have on morale/culture/performance.The moral of the story is that people with analyst mindsets play an essential role in our economy, but sometimes giving those people power over large organizations can have disastrous consequences.  There truly is a disconnect between measurement and understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surprised not to see Goodhart&#39;s Law[0] referenced here - &#34;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure&#34;. Not the same concept, but a related one (as is the Cobra Effect[1], of which the poppy-field burning is an example)[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart&#39;s_law
[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive#The_origina..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the McNamara Fallacy is a real thing, although I would say Goodhart&#39;s Law expresses the more fundamental issue.  But, the examples they give (Vietnam and Afghanistan wars) are bad examples, because in both cases the issue was primarily not that the U.S. military was relying too much on quantitative metrics, but rather that it was being asked to do a job which militaries are not good at.In neither case, despite what many deniers and apologists proclaim, was the war &#34;winnable&#34; by the military, because in both cases the primary problem was that the government of the nation in question did not have the respect (and thus support) of its people.  There is no strategy that an outside military can use, which will fix this, because it&#39;s not a military problem, and a military has the wrong personnel, the wrong training, and thus the wrong institutional mindset.It is as if you sent the Red Cross in to defeat the Viet Cong or the Taliban, and then concluded that the reason they failed was that they were measuring numbers of hospital beds and counting how much medical equipment they needed.  It was the political leadership, who decided this was a job for a military to perform, that was the root problem.  McNamara&#39;s metrics were neither here nor there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is exciting! I&#39;ve met with people from AdaCore and Ferrous systems (individually) several times and they&#39;re all serious, competent and motivated.I&#39;m curious what kinds of software they want to (eventually) verify, my PhD thesis is developing a verification tool for Rust (https://github.com/xldenis/creusot) and I&#39;m always on the look out for case studies to push me forward.The road to formally verified Rust is still long but in my unbiased opinion looking quite bright, especially compared to other languages like C. 
Ownership typing really, really simplifies verification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ferrous&#39;s embedded Rust tooling is outstanding. Ie its [Knurling App template](https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template), and associated Probe-run, Deft, and flip-link.These make flashing and debugging Rust embedded very easy - easier than any embedded toolchain I&#39;ve seen besides Arduino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very interesting move from AdaCore. I&#39;ve been a vocal advocate of Ada as a general purpose programming language for a little while. I hope that this helps expose the language to a wider audience, and gives the wider programming community cause to reappraise Ada from a modern perspective. It&#39;s a language with a lot to offer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello hello, PM for the feature checking in here. amf12&#39;s reply is quite on-point. Web and App Activity is designed to store search activity across all Google services, and we&#39;re splitting Workspace data out since it&#39;s governed by strict data handling guarantees, with the hope that more people will feel comfortable getting the benefits of better search in Workspace without having to opt-into search history being tracked for all Google services.Search history can be immensely useful for our users, since a lot of them re-run prior searches or want search experiences built on top of prior ones. Today, for the Workspace paid offering admins who choose to disable the somewhat confusingly named Web and App Activity admin console control, users in the domain have no ability to get relevant and historical search suggestions in Drive or Gmail that can help them save time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note: this seems to be about their paid &#34;Workspaces&#34; offering. I have a private paid domain email on Google Workspaces. I received their email and checked out their FAQs to see how it would affect me in terms of privacy.Workspaces data is inherently said to be private under contract and not used for advertising or other Google purposes. Here are relevant snippets from their new FAQ:- &#34;Google never uses your data in Google Workspace core services for advertising.&#34;- &#34;Google Workspace search history includes search activity in Google Workspace services such as Gmail and Drive and is subject to the data protections that Google Workspace provides for users’ data.&#34;Seems to me that other non-core services are not covered by it, which may be the reason for this split?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is going on inside Google? Far worse search results recently, verbal ads during Maps navigation directions, and stuff like this.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is something else going on around FB.Almost all activity online has shifted away from the Social Graph to a Content Graph. Almost nobody wants to see what their friends are doing online anymore. In a lot of ways it can be cringey. People just want the latest, catchiest content. TikTok and Youtube are the OGs here, but it&#39;s everywhere when you start to look. Twitter timeline changes being an awkward but working example. Discovery &gt; Static friends list.The entire premise FB was founded on is eroding. This isn&#39;t just Apple privacy and some regulatory strangulation. It&#39;s seismic to the business. The reason most people are still going to Facebook is incompatible with their primary activities online which is: consuming content from people-you-don&#39;t-know.Facebook is where you find out your highschool friend is super in to a MLM, your uncle has drastic political views you don&#39;t share, and that your historical social class and network is largely irrelevant to your life a decade later.They are doing everything they can to try to move in this direction, but the more they push it the less useful Facebook is for the average user. Instagram&#39;s discovery page is a prime example. But Reels are less good than TikTok, and whatever they are doing for short form video in Facebook is surely a hopeless game of catch up. This is classical innovator&#39;s dilemma.The very idea that Zuckerberg straight up said they need to copy the competition harder is incomprehensible considering the resources they have.They are going to try to do a few things. One is to anti-trust Apple (in the media at least), and the other is to hand wave (Metaverse).The reason the Metaverse was such a non sequitur is that it is so clearly a last minute thrust coming out of the C-Suite. If you&#39;ve ever worked at a highly visible tech pubco, you&#39;ve seen this happen before. Weak quarters mean that product announcements get pushed up. When it is as all encompassing as the Metaverse announcement, you know something is up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is how the narrative of Facebook looks to me:Zuckerberg got lucky and then executed brilliantly, transitioned from nerd hacker to CEO amazingly well. He deserves a lot of credit for that.Since then, Facebook have innovated very little. Zuckerberg recognised this, and bought Instagram and Whatsapp in lieu of building an innovative company. The latter is clearly really difficult to do.Without a stream of new ideas and products (unlike, say, Apple) Facebook double-downed on maximising revenue growth from their core advertising business. This led to all the scandals and disasters they have brought us, including destabilising societies.Inevitably, this led to the core product becoming less attractive, and people were also turned off by the negative press. Zuckerberg&#39;s rigid control of the company has led to him being a lightening rod for the backlash against big tech and especially adtech. His media skills are awful, so insisting on control and making himself a figurehead has further damaged the business.Zuckerberg knows the only way out is another home run. He&#39;s a super smart and prescient thinker, so he can see VR is a good play. It looks like the timeline for VR won&#39;t be short enough to save FB, but even if it were arriving soon enough he must know that FB probably isn&#39;t capable of delivering a truly new thing.This then marks the beginning of the end for the company, as it continues to bring in revenue from Instagram and monetises Whatsapp. Its sheer size means decline is going to take decades.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Zuckerberg leaves in the next few years, before the failure of Meta strategy becomes apparent.What they _should_ have done is debatable, but developing some sense of ethics might have helped. I think they could have focused on building Whatsapp into a payments (etc) app, which would have created an enduring product, and then used the time that bought them to rebuild the company.Microsoft are showing that it can be done, but I wonder if Facebook has the capacity to do great things. Perhaps the lesson from MS is that only a new leader can rescue such a mired company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It never ceases to amaze me what you can do with these transformer models. They created millions of potential solutions for each problem, used the provided examples for the problems to filter out 99% of incorrect solutions and then applied some more heuristics and the 10 available submissions to try to find a solution.All these approaches just seem like brute-force approaches: Let&#39;s just throw our transformer on this problem and see if we can get anything useful out of this.Whatever it is, you can&#39;t deny that these unsupervised models learn some semantic representations, but we have no clue at all what that actually is and how these model learn that. But I&#39;m also very sceptical that you can actually get anywhere close to human (expert) capability in any sufficiently complex domain by using this approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sometimes read these and wonder if I need to retrain. At my age, I’ll struggle to get a job at a similar level in a new industry.And then I remember that the thing I bring to the table is the ability to turn domain knowledge into code.Being able to do competitive coding challenges is impressive, but a very large segment of software engineering is about eliciting what the squishy humans in management actually want, putting it into code, and discovering as quickly as possible that it’s not what they really wanted after all.It’s going to take a sufficiently long time for AI to take over management that I don’t think oldies like me need to worry too much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is extremely impressive, but I do think it’s worth noting that these two things were provided:- a very well defined problem.  (One of the things I like about competitive programming and the like is just getting to implement a clearly articulated problem, not something I experience on most days.)
- existing test data.This is definitely a great accomplishment, but I think those two features of competitive programming are notably different than my experience of daily programming.  I don’t mean to suggest these will always be limitations of this kind of technology, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, adjusted for driver age the difference vanishes.That&#39;s quite an interesting observation, and it shows the importance of proper statistics. It also raises questions about companies producing their own stats, it&#39;s often only when someone takes the time to dig into it that we discover this kind of thing.I am not holding my breath waiting for the common consumer to understand statistical critical thinking though.

It basically &#34;just&#34; trashes the industry standard that is used to pass consent signals. There are plenty of custom or non TCF implementations (all equally awful) of consent dialogs.This ruling puts Google and FB in a much more powerful position - because they do not have to rely on standards like TCF to pass consent signals.Instead of going after publishers and website owners who integrate these popups in the first place - they went after the inventor of the spec."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is from Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s post. I think it&#39;s a decent explanation of their performance. Historically Facebook always made these longer-term bets and they&#39;ve typically paid off.&#34;Before I get to that, I want to briefly touch on our Q4 results, which I know Sheryl and Dave are going to go deeper on. I&#39;m proud of the work our teams did here. We shipped products, our community continued to grow, and businesses of all sizes turned to us to help them reach people. But there are two things that I want to call out that are having an impact on our business.The first is competition. People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly. And this is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long-term. As is our work to make sure our apps are the best services out there for young adults, which I spoke about on our last call.The second area, and related to this, is that we&#39;re in the middle of a transition on our own services towards short-form video like Reels. So as more activity shifts towards this medium, we&#39;re replacing some time in News Feed and other higher monetizing surfaces. So as a result of both competition and this shift to short-form video as well as our focus on serving young adults over optimizing overall engagement, we&#39;re going to continue to see pressure on impression growth in the near term. Now I&#39;m confident that leaning harder into these trends is the right short-term tradeoff to make in order to get long-term gains. We&#39;ve made these types of transitions before with mobile feed and Stories, where we took on headwinds in the near-term to align with important trends over the long term. And while video has historically been slower to monetize, we believe that over time short-form video is going to monetize more like feed or Stories than like Watch – so I&#39;m optimistic that we&#39;ll get to where we need to be with Reels too.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook’s core business model appears to be in decline. They don’t have a very diversified revenue stream despite trying various side businesses. This is the market worried that Facebook’s best days are behind it.Facebook is betting the farm on the metaverse stuff but without meaningful financial results that’s not going to placate market concerns over what looks like a downhill future for the core businesses. Facebook’s less than fantastic record at making money on its other businesses doesn’t have the market terribly optimistic about about the future prospects metaverse stuff either. Net net stock down 20%."</p>

Not out of fear of the North Koreans, but out of fear of our own security agencies seeing the activity as interfering in international relations. Also the vagueness of our hacking laws probably make what he did a crime.But I also am immensely proud that we have people willing to take things into their own hands when needed.Also, I feel like the 2nd amendment should be interpreted to include the right to bear digital arms (strong encryption for a start). This will probably take another decade to figure out what that would really mean."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see comments saying that he may be interfering with actual operations against NK or that now that he has done this they are more likely to patch their systems and be more secure, contradicting his own intentions.It&#39;s also entirely possible that this action, including the WIRED article and it&#39;s high visibility, is part of a broader effort and strategy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like many journalists are failing in their primary responsibilities to keep the public informed. Fact checking liars or misleading statements is tedious, and some politicians lie or mislead.Journalists should be doing investigations and creating reports that put social and political issues in context. Yet so often these issues, real issues that affect lives, are treated as political theater or a public sport.I can&#39;t blame journalists for the politicians lying or misleading, but I can blame them for so often going for the easy stories that they are fed, instead of the hard ones they have to look for or put together.As a result, when I read the news I pay special attention to stories that are based on original investigations, public records requests, whistleblowers, or stories in which actual context is provided from multiple viewpoints that are informed by the facts, rather than merely by self interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This conversation isn&#39;t formal enough to be meaningful.If you want to talk meaningfully about how &#34;facts&#34; are used, you need to be able to invoke any notion at all of propositions and implications. It doesn&#39;t matter if your implications are mathematical in nature or scientific in nature or just correlation, facts exist in the structure imposed by implication. And facts without an implication structure are useless.In order to mislead with a &#34;true&#34; fact A, it needs to already be the case that there is a false fact of the form A implies B already sitting in there. The combination of a belief in A implies B (false) with this newly introduced belief A (true) yields a belief in B (false).The essence of &#34;lying by telling the truth&#34; is then just finding these false implications, and exploiting them.Fortunately, It&#39;s much easier to fact check implications. If A implies B is false, then you just need to come up with an example of A and not B.Unfortunately changes to belief do not always propagate reliably, and the combinatorial game is against the implication checkers. For any given true fact A there are as many potential false beliefs of the form A implies B as there are propositions B.Fortunately, most humans make do with as few (quantified) implications as they can. Rules are hard to remember. Getting rid of false implications is much easier when you can replace them with &#34;true&#34; implications.I suppose I am arguing then that the solution to all of this is education that doesn&#39;t teach facts, but rather implications (which are themselves just higher order facts)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the idea of this article, but it doesn&#39;t address the reason things are the way they are. Facts get checked for literal accuracy because that&#39;s what&#39;s easy to actually do in a reasonably unbiased way. We stop there not because that&#39;s all we want, but because everything after that is too messy to even come close to systematizing.If they&#39;ve got a well thought out framework for systematizing high quality contextualization, i&#39;d love to hear about it, though."</p>

  content-type: application/json

  {
    &#34;name&#34;: &#34;sample&#34;,
    &#34;time&#34;: &#34;Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT&#34;
  }

First line is the method and url, then headers, then a newline, then the request body.Hit ctrl+alt+p, the request is sent and you see the response in a side pane. Everything is encoded and decoded properly.You can organize your tests under multiple files and folders.I cannot recommend this extension enough, it has made my life so much easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postman founder here. Thank you HN community for highlighting this feature. We have been seeing gRPC usage exploding especially in microservices driven architectures and we are looking forward to the feedback we get on the feature.A few other observations on comments that I read through:1. Postman leans towards adding UI affordances instead of hiding them. This can irritate experienced developers at times who already know the complexities of HTTP or other protocols but that is really how new developers find their way around. So while it is attractive to have 1000 options hidden behind a command line interface, nobody uses 995 of those features. We are getting better at building experiences for both experienced and new developers. Also, I don’t believe reading man pages of git or curl is a better experience.2. Performance is a huge area for improvement. More to come in subsequent releases this year.3. Our roadmap is community driven: https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues. Raising more investment helps us do more. We have built a business model around doing the maximum for every developer on the planet while also providing value to companies so we can charge for it and continue development. I find it fair that companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on salaries can pay some money for improving their productivity by spending in developer tools.4. API Development is a huge and growing area and developers are spending more and more time working with APIs rather than their IDEs. API Design, documentation, and testing are areas that a large number of developers tell us they wish they had better tooling for. Most of their time is spend pointlessly in trying to figure out how an API works (in some cases whether an API even exists). We decided to take Postman in those areas even though paradoxically it might lead to “less” Postman usage. (The faster people figure out an API the fewer number of calls they have to send)5. Finally, it is good to see here a call for fewer features which we insist internally as well. Unfortunately at some point some part of the community is upset that we are NOT adding features (just see the gRPC thread on our issue tracker!). We don’t see issues to remove features as much as we have requests to fulfill. We do remove features consciously but it is a hard problem, so we default to adding them slowly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postman is so incredibly bloated and slow these days. All I want is a REST client, but it feels like every time I want to perform a basic task now, I have to dig past all of their confusing platform and cloud stuff that I have no interest in."</p>

In this case, the spoofing layer could be set up such that whenever Google Maps uses the Android API to ask &#34;Is wifi location sensing turned on&#34; the spoofing layer would say &#34;Yes.&#34; When GM asks &#34;What wifi networks are around?&#34; the spoofing layer would say &#34;None.&#34; (Even better would be for it to just make up a bunch of random wifi SSIDs to pollute Google&#39;s wifi database with noise.)I have several other apps (Twitter for example) who are able to tell that I have notifications for them turned off, and consequently they bug me to turn on notifications. I need a spoofing layer that tells Twitter &#34;notifications are turned on&#34; even when they&#39;re off, because if the app can tell some feature is turned off it will bug me or in some cases fail to work at all. So it&#39;s also critically important that there be no way for applications to figure out that the spoofing layer is in place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who don&#39;t know, &#34;Riddim is the Jamaican Patois pronunciation of the English word &#39;rhythm&#39;. In the context of reggae and dancehall it refers to the instrumental accompaniment to a song and is synonymous with the rhythm section... A given riddim, if popular, may be used in dozens—or even hundreds—of songs, not only in recordings but also in live performances.&#34;The actual riddim sounds completely uninteresting to my American ears. But the novelty and catchiness obviously connected to millions of people at the time.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddimhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjw7m-BKmQ8"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love my Framework. Barring Apple&#39;s recent move away from the touchbar it&#39;s honestly the first machine I&#39;ve been excited about in 6 or so years. The build quality is great, love the simplicity and design of the expansion ports, and the repair/upgrade-ability is huge. It&#39;s gotten me back into using Linux as a daily driver.I really hope they stay true to their vision and that this means expanding it into other consumer product lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We’re not ready to share what the next products are just yet, but this funding unlocks categories even more ambitious than our first one. We have a detailed plan in place for the next two years and napkin sketch ideas going out a couple of decades.It&#39;ll be really interesting to see where they go next. Given that they&#39;re already in computer and custom board space, I&#39;d make a guess that it&#39;s going to be routers - similarly embedded devices and they&#39;d make a great option for replaceable parts (i.e. WiFi, connection options etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Frameworks are really good. However, the chips inside are disappointing, IMO.I was considering the i5 1135g7 Framework with 16gb of RAM. A friend of mine bought it, and it&#39;s idle power draw is of 8-9W with Gnome 3 and Firefox open.I decided to get a laptop with a 5800H and an RTX 3070 instead. My power consumption as I&#39;m typing this comment right now is of 7W with a dozen tabs and an IDE, messaging, etc... open. That is despite a 46% larger screen, and a much faster, unlocked TDP, 8 core CPU.That&#39;s a real shame, IMO. Combined with a 55Wh battery, it&#39;s quite problematic, and was a deal-breaker for me."</p>

What if you could ride one of these filaments?Or what if they&#39;re like the exhaust trails of an FTL vehicle/body? Or something inter-dimensional?Knowing they&#39;re very far away, are we looking for them closer to home? Can they even be observed with such clarity if they were closer to us?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My Tesla will allow me to engage autopilot in a school zone, obeying the adjustment I’d set on speed limit - while using, not the correct school zone speed limit, but the non-school time speed limit. It would allow me to go 30 mph over the school zone speed.How can Tesla claim self driving if the car can’t read a sign that says - speed limit 25 mph during school hours, and properly adjust? Humans just look around to determine if school is likely in session by the number of cars in the parking lot during normal school hours, or they know the school calendar.How does a self driving car make that determination? Query the school district website for the school, identifying their bell schedule and tacking on a buffer ahead and behind? Assume a school schedule that’s M-F? What if it’s a religious school that operates Sun-Thursday? Now the car has to determine which religious sects obey which calendar? Is it different in each country?Just another example of a massive hurdle self driving cars have……And another recall that should be issued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was rear-ended in Colorado when I didn&#39;t do a rolling stop. Had a road-rage incident when the other driving was livid that I would stop under thoose circumstances.My dad (when gowing up) was pulled over for a cop for doing a california stop in Colorado. The police officer let us off, because we had california plates.When I got my Tesla, it was immediately evident that _no one_ travels the speed limit. They travel 5-10mph over it on anything other then a local road. or they drive way under it.This is the problem with our mental model - FSD/Autopilot has to co-exist with human drivers - and human drivers don&#39;t follow the law. FSD/Autopilot has to exist in a world where roads do not follow standards, lines are not marked, deer jump in front of cars, people do California stops (it&#39;s called that for a reason), cars have accidents.Computers, today, change none of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actual implementation is a little more nuanced than always roll or never roll, with seven conditions required to avoid coming to a complete stop:  1. The functionality must be enabled within the FSD Beta Profile settings; and

  2. The vehicle must be approaching an all-way stop intersection; and

  3. The vehicle must be traveling below 5.6mph; and

  4. No relevant moving cars are detected near the intersection; and

  5. No relevant pedestrians or bicyclists are detected near the intersection; and

  6. There is sufficient visibility for the vehicle while approaching the intersection; and

  7. All roads entering the intersection have a speed limit of 30 mph or less.

  If all the above conditions are met, only then will the vehicle travel through the all-way-stop intersection at a speed from 0.1 mph up to 5.6 mph without first coming to a complete stop. If any of the above conditions are not met, the functionality will not activate and the vehicle will come to a complete stop

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know a few upper-middle class small business owners (all non-retail sectors) whose businesses weren&#39;t substantially affected by the pandemic, but who basically got a free handout as part of the program.Two mentioned how they were initially hesitant to apply for money, but then worried that if they didn&#39;t, their business could take a downturn after it was too late. Then as long as they spent the money on payroll (which they had to pay for anyway), they didn&#39;t have to pay it back, even if their business didn&#39;t show any losses. I shudder to think of how much the bigger players yanked out of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US lacks the state capacity to tell who was going to have trouble with COVID-19 closures, and who wouldn&#39;t, so a whole lot of money just had to go to people that had no need for it whatsoever.Regarding PPP, every local tech staff augmentation company got a few months worth of payroll out of it. For those of you not in the know, their model involves hiring developers at $x an hour, and then placing them at large enterprises for $x+y, often for years at a time, as those companies would rather have contractors than employees.So where does the money go? Straight to the owner&#39;s pockets, as lockdowns only changed staffing needs in a very small number of companies. So if your sole proprietorship staffing company employs 25 of those developer-contractors for, say, 180k and a couple of HR staff, you could get million dollar &#34;loan&#34;, that would be forgiven in a few months, as you didn&#39;t fire any of them.Needless to say, the people in charge of that kind of company were very happy about the PPP program."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I understand it, the reason an HIV vaccine has been so difficult to create is that HIV mutates so easily. I understand the basics behind how mRNA vaccines are generated, but I don&#39;t understand why this approach would be expected to have any more success in evading the high mutation potential of HIV than other vaccine types. After all, it was even a concern with new coronavirus variants that the original Moderna vaccine would be less effective against them (and, indeed, while the original vaccine is still highly effective against all variants, my understanding is that it is less so than the original variant). And SARS-COV-2 mutates much less easily than HIV.Can someone with more knowledge explain the thought process behind this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember growing up being terrified of HIV/AIDS. The idea of something being permanent and transmissible via sex, and literally dismounting your immune defense to all other diseases on the planet...To this day it still terrifies me, even though the treatments have become so good.Each year it seems there are new stories about HIV research, and progress keeps being made. I pray for positive results and am really amazed. We have a lot to be thankful for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if we&#39;ll see HSV also addressed by this new wave of mRNA vaccines, or if it&#39;s just not top of mind for companies and researchers due to its &#34;mostly benign&#34; nature. At least until one&#39;s immune system starts to weaken with advanced age and it starts to cause all sorts of problems, but perhaps by then it gets swept under the &#34;problems of aging&#34; rug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once hired a guy who had no experience, but seemed like a good culture fit for our company and seemed very interested in learning.We interviewed him and made e-mail communication a large part of the interview, because it is a critical part of our business.  And his communication was great!After hiring, a recurring problem we had was his e-mail to us and to customers were terrible.  Bad grammar, bad spelling, uncorrected typos...  It got so bad that we had to have someone review all e-mails he sent to customers.We had regular &#34;improvement plan&#34; meetings with him, but after a year of paying him, we had to let him go.  As part of the exit interview we went back and looked at his interview e-mails, and compared them with his current e-mails.  So we asked him:&#34;During the interview, all your e-mails were great!  Why was that?&#34;&#34;My wife wrote all of those.&#34;I guess we should have hired his wife!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a hiring manager for remote positions for a long time. If your recruiting channels are good, most of your candidates are going to be honest and good intentioned.But interview enough people, and you&#39;ll start encountering people trying to abuse remote work. They&#39;re not interested in contributing to your company. They&#39;re only interested in collecting paychecks while they do as little work as possible for as long as possible. They might already have a full-time job or other remote jobs, or maybe they&#39;re just trying to travel the world and do a &#34;four hour workweek&#34; thing where they answer e-mails once a day and phone in a couple hours of work at key times during the week.The common theme is that they aren&#39;t really interested in fighting too hard for the position. As soon as the interview or job turns out to be something they can&#39;t just talk and smile their way through, they&#39;re out, just like this:&gt; I think my last update for a while: as soon as HR got on the call with him, before they could get through their first question, John said the words “I quit” and hung up the calls. He has since been unreachable!!Always makes me wonder how many dysfunctional companies are out there letting deadbeat remote employees collect paychecks and do as little work as possible because nobody cares enough to press the issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Practices like this are hilariously common in the industry.Right out of college I accepted a job offer at a small consulting company on the east coast. They promised they would give me free housing at their luxury apartment for the first few months and give me all the training I need to excel in areas of my interest. I flew across the country and found out the whole thing is not as advertised. Their luxury apartment had piles of unwashed dishes and flies in the kitchen and piss on the bathroom floor. They had bunk beds in each room and I slept with three other dudes from wildly different backgrounds. My first night, this guy from Turkey assured me that everything is going to be fine, that he was shaking in fear for the first couple nights but he soon learned that if you work with them, they get you what you need. At the same time, another guy from Chicago was telling me how I need to look out for myself because the company likes to steal money from your paychecks.The next day, I learned that &#34;working with them&#34; meant going through their &#34;resume revision&#34; process. Turns out, there was a network of consulting companies like this one, each creating fake experiences for one another. Fresh grads who clearly have never coded anything of significance became senior engineers with 5 years of experience. The resulting resumes looked real stacked, filled with keywords that recruiters love. Furthermore, during live interviews, they actually placed someone with actual technical knowledge behind the laptop camera to basically write out all the answers on the whiteboard while the candidates read out the answers.Some of the people there loved talking about how so and so got placed at prestigious companies and became hugely successful in their career. Most of them knew what they were doing wasn&#39;t the most ethical thing to do, but not many complained given their visa status. Also, they were actually really grateful to get a developer job that pays ~$40k. They were just regular people.I personally didn&#39;t need visa support, and I had the luxury of being able to fall back on my parents. So about a week after I flew over, I gathered my things and left. It was an interesting experience overall, one I&#39;m glad I could experience.My 2c for interviewing: always look up key phrases you see on resumes and see if identical copies show up. It&#39;s usually a giveaway sign."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like a Miele. That menu can be exited (the image where it says &#34;Software Update&#34;, the tiny bit on the right... that&#39;s a scroll bar of multiple options including the ability to exit this menu), but it does imply that the dishwasher is already connected to Wi-Fi and that it has determined that there is an update available.There are few times that a dishwasher is interacted with, if not when you go into the menu to start it then when? It&#39;s just asking &#34;Do you want to do this now?&#34; if not that is fine (the menu can be exited), but now you know to do it later.Alternatively as the dishwasher clearly is on Wi-Fi already (the only way it would know there&#39;s an update), one can use the Miele@Home app to perform the update at a more convenient time.I have a Miele dishwasher, it is connected to Wi-Fi (on a VLAN with other white goods, outbound connections to certain domains only). The Wi-Fi is useful... the dishwasher auto-doses the powder, rinse aid, salt, etc... and can let me know the levels of those. In addition it tells me when the cycle is done. Performs updates, etc. There&#39;s a Home Assistant integration too, but I&#39;ve not done that (my VLAN setup prevented it!).PS: If you&#39;re of the opinion that a dishwasher doesn&#39;t need to be on Wi-Fi and you wouldn&#39;t connect it... then great, that&#39;s another way not to be asked to do an update. This dishwasher isn&#39;t going to ask to connect to Wi-Fi, it&#39;s something you choose to do (something that takes a degree of determination I might add)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it weird that the more tech becomes like this the more I feel checked out?I don’t want smart devices, nor do I want to be online 24/7. However it’s hard to escape this reality. My thermostat (in apartment) recently reset due to a power issue and I had to have maintenance over to do its configuration again. They had to come twice because after setting it up they have to figure out how to connect it to Wi-Fi for a software update.Before this apartment I lived in one where all the appliances were straight out of 1950/60. They were retro af but they worked without any issues for the time I lived there. Here I’ve had issues every month."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart devices are overly complex. The entire point should have been to make devices work for you, but now when you buy a ‘smart’ washing machine, it requires you 30min of setup. Downloading apps, connecting it to wifi, providing GPS location etc. why? What’s the point. We need devices that make life simpler. Straight out of the box."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I went car shopping this year in the new market and found that that if you want more a &#34;dumb&#34; car (UX occurs primarily outside of a touchscreen, no internet, no geolocation) you lose all potential for any nice non-smart features. So no heated/powered seats, no power windows, the material of the interior is refurbished from a spirit airlines airplane, etc.I think manufacturers are hoping that certain aspects of the modern auto become &#34;can&#39;t live withouts&#34;, e.g. bluetooth, which helps them smuggle all the other more marginally useful, security and ux intrusive features into your model. Now as others have mentioned, these unwanted smart features might actually be required by law/regulation/tax-credit/legal-dept, so it&#39;s not bad programming/design but &#34;design by committee&#34; that&#39;s dooming our chances of a good dumb car.I wonder how well my car will age when miscellaneous sensor all over the car start failing. It used to just show a light on your dashboard, now I wonder if I&#39;ll be grounded - stuck in park - or hounded by incessant bells repeating the same spurious warning over and over again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our Volvo doesn&#39;t let you adjust the volume when you&#39;re in reverse.  That means if you&#39;re backing out of the garage and the music is blaring -- you can&#39;t turn it off!The Volvo UI pops up an almost full-display warning when it can&#39;t connect to the phone over bluetooth on startup.  This UI takes priority over the rear camera.  So I guess it&#39;s better to hit Timmy and his puppy when I&#39;m backing out, so long as I know my phone&#39;s not connected!The Volvo&#39;s headlights have &#34;smart&#34; auto-adjustments.  That means I can&#39;t leave the high beams on, or force it to stay on low beams.  It will decide for me!  I think maybe I can disable this... somehow.So smart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I hate about &#34;car discourse&#34; like this is the apparent blindness to public transportation. Trains, bikes, buses, and street cars solve almost every problem that the author complains about.The only outstanding problem, however, is that American infrastructure has been deliberately designed solely around the car. Those who suggest alternative modes of public transportation are immediately written off as &#34;impractical&#34;. Discourse ought to be centered around democratizing and diversifying the ways people can get around, not on how one ought to &#34;make dumb cars&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like the elephant in the room is culture.* Facebook seems to be a bunch of smart people working on pet projects. Monopoly profits drive a political empire where people at the top think up something random, and it gets built.* Google has customer contempt. They started with brilliant people who were used to being smarter than everyone else. They also started in algorithm-driven markets like search and ad-words, where everything was statistical and individuals didn&#39;t matter. They&#39;ve lost the smarts and the ethics, and they&#39;re in a bit of a hole. I think they&#39;ve reached the end of the growth line.* I know nothing about Apple. Too secretive.* Microsoft has a bunch of cut-throat teams, competing with each other. Their technology is middling. However, they&#39;re the only one of the bunch you&#39;d want to partner with for B2B.* ... except for Amazon, which is hyper-customer-focused, and has a track record of successful forward-looking projects. AWS has been rock solid. On the other hand, I&#39;d never want to work there; they treat employees like crap. But it somehow works out for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good and thorough article. The author got down to brass tacks pretty quickly and brings up interesting hypothesis about $MSFT.That said, I do have one gripe:&gt; To oversimplify Notion to its demographics, it is Office 365 for people below age 35.I recognize this is an oversimplification, but even so, it seems like a stretch. Notion is a decent product, and I have used it for a few small-scale team projects in uni (mainly for Kanban-related stuff) - but to call it a replacement for O365 is an exaggeration at best.Yes, you can have pretty, nested documents in Notion and that&#39;s great, but a tabular database in Notion is by no means a replacement for Excel or even Google Sheets. The velocity that is afforded by Excel in terms of formulas is unmatched and there&#39;s a reason it has yet to be unseated as the kingpin of modern finance.Most young people I know use a combination of Discord + Google Suite to collaborate. I am aware this is slightly anecdotal, but I am also having a hard time imagining myself as a founder and then asking my CFO to use Notion to prepare investor pitches.Source: Am 23 :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, as a developer, Microsoft is a company with deep roots in compilers and operating systems. All of the business empire started from these two foundations. 
Since its inception till today, Microsoft has been producing some global products every decade. And then making these products unbeatable in the global marketes. 
Be it Windows, Office, Exchange, Developer tools &amp; Compilers, Web Servers, XBox, Azure, Teams etc. You just name it and Microsoft is right there in almost every field with profitable products. 
A lot of people don&#39;t like the traditional Microsoft products but all of the products just work and are being used for tens of millions of customers around the globe every day. 
Any Software company with ability to create profitable products every decade is a killer company. That is the secret souce Microsoft has.As a developer just imagine about a company which gives you a developer tool to make a web application, using the company&#39;s provided compiler, which then can be deployed on a company&#39;s provided webserver and can store some data on company&#39;s provided database which is running on company&#39;s provided operating system.The company also happens to provide end-to-end tools for running a company of a 5 people to a company of 500,000 people.This is Microsoft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Similar things happen surprisingly often in companies.  Many intense arguments can be diffused by first being specific about what we agree upon.Just to add to this, one strategy from the rationalist community that I rarely see practiced is to &#39;taboo&#39; certain words.  For example if two engineers are arguing about a solution not being scalable, taboo the word scalable.  They both re-explain their POV without using the word scalable at all.  It often works like magic and they quickly reach a shared understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry to be a curmudgeon, it&#39;s a poetic little story - but isn&#39;t the takeaway a little banal?&#34;Different people have different perspectives.&#34; Well sure.&#34;Consider things from others&#39; viewpoints.&#34; Of course.I don&#39;t know, it rings a little of management-ese, or something overpaid consultants might present in the boardroom that gets everybody nodding their head and feeling like they&#39;ve received great wisdom, but is a little hollow or obvious when you really break it down.It&#39;s a good takeaway, even if commonsensical I guess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of water pooling and etc.  i wonder how much work it would take to fix it up.I had a friend growing up who had a missile silo on the edge of their property.Folks in the area never talked about them but everyone knew where they were.   We would go look at it once in a while.   Really eerie that out in this peaceful prairie was a horrific weapon just sleeping and waiting.  Ready to go at all times.  Pointed at folks on the other side of the planet nobody in the prairie knew or would likely ever meet.After the Cold War they were decommissioning them.  While driving out there I was waved down my an APC and some soldiers.   I pulled over, they asked me to wait with them.A couple convoys of more soldiers drove by, trucks, then a big convoy with a big white truck.I asked “Was that the real thing?”   The soldier said “They don’t bring us ALL out here unless it is.”They thanked me for waiting and told me I could go after one more group when by."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The full version of Brin and Page&#39;s classic paper &#34;The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine&#34; [1], which describes the early architect of Google and is an interested read in its own right, literally has &#34;Appendix A: Advertising and Mixed Motives.&#34; Highlights include:-&#34;We believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a
competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm. &#34;- &#34;We expect that advertising
funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.&#34;- &#34;A better search engine would not have required this
ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it
could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer
advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the
advertising supported business model of the existing search engines.&#34;To be clear: the &#34;we&#34; in these quotes are the founders of Google.[1] https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-...As an aside, I&#39;ve been reading a bunch of academic papers about early web crawlers and search engines. It&#39;s a fun and interesting subject. Mercator [2] (which became Alta Vista) is another early search engine and one of the few that discusses its architecture in detail.[2] https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-173.pdf"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m usually a defender of the single screen on the Model 3/Y, but on this, the author is right: the new UI (v11) is terrible compared to the previous one (v10).Not only does it hide commonly-used safety-relevant functions behind extra taps in sub-menus (as detailed), it was apparently done to free up space to offer a &#39;dock&#39; of app buttons - three permanant and three &#39;recently used&#39;.  I struggled to choose three apps I needed enough to fill the permanant spaces - and certainly don&#39;t need quick access (when I&#39;m driving!) to Netflix, or games, or whatever is popping up in &#39;recently used&#39; today.  I would like the driver profile menu to be quickly available, but alas that&#39;s been hidden too.It&#39;s a total cluster-f*ck that makes no logical sense when considering the need of drivers, and I hope they listen and revert at least this aspect of the UI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The problem isn’t really that complicated: originally the defroster icon was visible on the bottom. With the latest December 2021 update it is now hidden behind the temperature indicator. Tapping the temperature brings up a sub-window with the defroster icon.&#34;Even after reading that, I had to look at the pictures again, and read the paragraph again to find where you are supposed to tap. When they simplified the UI, they also removed the degrees symbol and the fan.Seeing as how 60-70 are both reasonable temperatures in Fahrenheit and speeds in miles per hour, it is not at all clear at a glance what that number means.(Disclosure, I work for GM)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The manufacturer changing the UI of a car after you bought it should be illegal or at least highly restricted.I think many of us have been incensed by UI changes in software we use for our daily work, and that&#39;s already bad enough; but IMHO this really crosses a line.There were jokes when Apple changed the scroll direction, comparing it to the steering wheel of a car suddenly working opposite to what everyone is used to; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible to do that with a Tesla or other modern car, but it&#39;s disturbing that we seem to be headed down that path. What an absurd reality.The icons-only UI is also a huge regression; would it really take much extra effort to add a text label? I know people often mention localisation when it&#39;s brought up, but much of the world knows English, this is an American car sold in English-speaking regions, and changing the text in software is much easier than a separate part with different printing.(I drive a 50-year-old land yacht that&#39;s received many upgrades, but all under my control; so my perspective may be slightly biased...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case you’re wondering what happened, from the thread:He sent ETH to the WETH contract, received WETH as expected.Then he wanted to do the reverse and sent WETH, but will not receive anything, because you&#39;re supposed to swap your WETH to ETH in exchanges like Uniswap, or call the &#34;withdraw&#34; function in the contract.For contracts that want to only work with ERC-20 tokens, you use WETH, which comes from a contract that takes 1 eth and gives you 1 WETH.A known problem with ERC-20 tokens is that transferring them to a contract that isn&#39;t made to access them is equivalent to burning them. You should almost never transfer ERC-20 to a smart contract. You instead use approve to give the smart contract permission to withdraw, then call the function you want to receive and tell it to make the withdraw (the contract will internally call transferFrom)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since no one seems to think about how this could have prevented, here is a simple way, which I&#39;ve applied to lots of things in life, not just cryptocurrency transfers:- If you&#39;re making a transfer somewhere with a large amount, do a small transfer first and verify it&#39;s working. Confirm at the receiving end before moving big sums.- If you&#39;re calling a contract, try it with a small amount first. Verify the parameters multiple times, and verify the return values multiple times.- If you&#39;re doing something with a huge sum of money, do it in steps instead of all-at-once. Fees won&#39;t be as big since you&#39;re already dealing with a huge sum of money anyways- Verify verify and verify that everything went alright with the small sum before trying to do something with a big sum- If you&#39;re tired, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you got some sleep- If you&#39;re rushed, don&#39;t do it. Wait until you&#39;re not rushed, have a tea and think about it- When in doubt, verify it and don&#39;t be tired- If you&#39;re not an expert, have someone who is do verification above for you"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based. Nullius in verba [1]. The whitewashing of censorship is accelerating the erosion of trust in the institutions, and it&#39;s refreshing to see a long-standing institution take a bold stance.[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullius_in_verba"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see the root cause of all this debate as a failure in scientific communication.When it comes to complex scientific decisions with significant impacts on the public, nuanced and detailed justifications are required. Instead, we often get simple declarations written by PR departments at juvenile reading level. This spawns chaotic and poorly conducted debate in all walks of life.What is required is a robust and transparent framework for honest analyses of topics. 
For example, if the CDC has a specific recommendation, They should provide an outline of the arguments, counter-arguments, assumptions, and supporting data for each part.It seems that the status quo is to completely ignore any arguments against a given recommendation. This suffocates any honest discussion in the crib. It also suggests to some that the justifications are not robust enough to survive the light of day. If you cant show your work, people will be skeptical that you did it all.This is applicable to any science based public policy, but especially obvious to covid policy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue that plagues us is a lack of trust in long-standing societal authorities.We can&#39;t follow the entire scientific proof chain for every piece of information we encounter, because we don&#39;t have time.So we rely on authority to some extent, whether that be peer review, government, independent bodies, etc.We need to be able to trust that these bodies are telling us the truth and aren&#39;t seeking to mislead us. Because when we start to doubt them, we then inevitably elect alternative bodies, simply due to limited thinking capacity/time - as explained above it&#39;s impossible to do otherwise, no-one derives from first principles every opinion they hold.The best way, _overall_, to convince someone to do something, is by clearly explaining to them the positives and negatives and letting them come to their own conclusion.It doesn&#39;t always work, and there are specific situations (e.g. someone is holding a gun to your face) in which the cost/benefit analysis is very different - in such a situation, the short term is all that exists, the long term effect of misplaced trust is irrelevant - you simply have to neutralize them.But in general, I&#39;m absolutely sure that education over coercion is the correct approach for society.Because if you force them, sure, you&#39;ve got a short term win, at the long term cost of trust. What is the long term cost of lost trust?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is handy, but the good news is that if you&#39;re dealing with anything made in the last 30-40 years, it&#39;s all but guaranteed to have the ETRTO measurements marked on it somewhere.Practically speaking there are two rim diameters you&#39;ll likely come across on all but old, &#34;unusual&#34; or high end bikes:559mm: the ubiquitous &#34;26 inch&#34; mountain bike tire. Has largely fallen out of favor on high end mountain bikes, but there are zillions of bikes with 559mm wheels and frames sized for them out there. On high end mountain bikes, largely displaced by 29&#34; or 27.5&#34; setups.622mm: &#34;700c&#34; road rims or &#34;29 inch&#34; mountain bike rims. Nearly universal on modern road bikes. If you have something else on a new road bike, you probably already know it.Other sizes you might find in the wild:630mm: The largely obsolete &#34;27 inch&#34; road rims. uncommon on new bikes, but you&#39;ll still find plenty of them on older bikes. Not even the slightest bit interchangeable with 622mm. Usually, you can&#39;t even switch to 622mm rims on frame built for 630mm because the brakes won&#39;t reach 4mm closer to the axle. Easily mistaken for 622mm if you aren&#39;t paying attention.584mm is the &#34;27.5 inch&#34; mountain bike standard that splits the difference between 26&#34; and 29&#34;. If you have this, you probably know already.Once you&#39;ve got the rim diameter right, the tire width is pretty straightforward: if it looks right, it is right. It&#39;ll be pretty obvious that a &#34;29 inch&#34; mountain bike tire doesn&#39;t go on a road rim, even if the diameter on both is 622mm. If you have needs under which that doesn&#39;t apply, you&#39;re probably already aware of them.You can put hooked tires on straight sided rims safely (I have), but likely not the other way even if you could find dedicated straight sided tires.Tubulars are a while &#39;nother animal, about which I know nothing :-)ETRTO made it much, much simpler to get the rim size right when all of the various standards had different names to different people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html  has (i think all?) of the edge cases you&#39;re going to encounter in any bike made after about 1925."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heh. Even in bicycle-rich countries like Germany and the Netherlands, these numbers are somehow still tricky. I guess it doesn&#39;t help that they are often hard to read and a lot of the numbers are actually redundant.So yeah, useful! And my compliments for the neatness in your data privacy approach.At one point I just took the old tyre into a bicycle repair shop and asked for the proper replacement, and the person who sold me one even managed to get the wrong one (they replaced it for the proper one afterwards of course). It used to be that most normal use bicycles all had the same tyre, and only racing bikes had those weird French style ones, but newer bicycles tend to have fatter tyres (which is not a bad development for sturdy day-to-day bicycles laden with groceries, an adult cyclist, and a child in front or behind the cyclist)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is extremely common. In their 30s, people get married, have kids, and move to the suburbs. Finding and keeping friends in your 30s is quite a challenge.Some tips:- move to a city - things are much much easier in a city as people are more transient, groups aren&#39;t as established, and new people arrive all the time- it sounds like you have some friends - ask them if they have any friends in your area you should meet platonically- the easiest way to make friends is an activity: you mentioned a hobby, but it can be anything - a running group, the gym, board games, etc. The more non-nerdy, the more likely you are to find non-nerdy people- if you&#39;re like me, you struggle to make friends because it&#39;s not &#34;easy&#34; like it was in college. Friends in your 30s take work: reaching out, texting, scheduling, planning, etc.- it sounds like you&#39;re not in therapy. So let me be the first to tell you that you&#39;re depressed (that &#34;apathy&#34; you&#39;re feeling is depression). Which is fine, it happens us all. But go to therapy because that&#39;s how you solve that. Just try it for a month, no pressure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;they&#39;re all full of lonely developers and other socially awkward people - short guys looking for girlfriends, unattractive/aging women looking for husbands, etc.&#34;So...people like you?
you sound really judgemental man.Since you have no friends(so nothing to hold you where you are, right?), and apparently a good source of income, I&#39;d advise you to go remote, travel, try digital nomadism, go to meetups, meet other travelers, maybe try coworking spaces? hacker houses/airbnbs with people from lots of different places?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have often been told im good at making friends and I think you can make them anytime, anywhere, anyhow, the first thing to focus on is your personal mindset and build from there:  1. Just say yes. When someone asks for anything, say yes, no matter how big or small (help them move out, look after their dog) This will put you into novel situations.
  2. Show genuine interest in things. Ask why, learn more, dig deeper, keep conversations going by trying to share anything you think is slightly relevant.
  3. Dress up. Wear things that stick out, even just a bit, a funky shirt, a nice bright pair of socks, use these to add flare to a standard dark blue and grey world, people will reflect back and be interested in you.
  4. Pick one new thing you want to master (not online) my advice here for all round great friend activities - Rockclimbing, Pub Quizes, Boardgame nights, Cycling, Pottery. Each of these almost always need another person to make them work and that helps you grow your confidence.
  5. Don&#39;t work so hard. Tell your boss you wanna slow it down, try and do 4 day weeks, give back some commitments, take a pay cut. Don&#39;t quit just slow it down and give your head some space.

I&#39;m 35, I just quit my /Director of Product role at a successful startup because I wasn&#39;t happy. I&#39;m about to go to Thailand to learn how to become a yoga teacher, not for a career but for a disciplined adventure that will deeply enrich me and is nowhere near a computer! You can do it! Put a plan in motion.HN Believes in you! :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the comments here are focused on the question of why you would prefer an app to calling. The author&#39;s point is a great one though, and something I&#39;ve wondered a lot. Why should I create an account to order a pizza? The app should reduce friction even from the very first order. Instead it adds, and adds for every order... Got to go look up coupon codes! On the phone I just ask the guy what their best deal is in a large cheese and garlic knots and he gives it to me. The app or website should make my life better but instead it&#39;s harder.Worse, the app pretends to be an unrelated party when something goes wrong. &#34;Sorry, you need to call the store. Look up their number, it&#39;s on the website.&#34; For me it doesn&#39;t add anything to the transaction, it only takes away.The literal only reason I use the pizza app at all is for chains where I have no idea which store delivers to me. Rest of the time I&#39;ve gone back to calling. Much faster that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is the happy path. It has a lot more possible sources of error/time consumption than the app and there are many benefits to the app.1. The line is busy. The app is next to never busy.2. The line has static and you are not heard correctly. Especially problematic for delivery or complicated orders. Or they may get your name wrong. My first name is common and my last isn&#39;t great over the telephone.3. You have to remember what you ordered each time. Apps let me quickly re-order.4. You cannot easily pre-pay (irrelevant if you have cash, but if you are like me and wish to never use cash again, having to pull out the card is annoying rather than just grabbing the pizza).5. Most places now seem to be on DoorDash, so you can just order from there and avoid the additional friction. You also know you can get excellent customer service from DoorDash while a new restaurant is an unknown."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My local pizza place in Seattle has moved the technology the other way. Here’s the dialog when I call.  “Pagliacci Pizza, how can I help you?”
“I’d like to order a pizza”
“Sure thing. Is this John Smith?”
“Yes”
“Do you still live at 1234 Main Street”
“Yes”
“Would you like to order the same thing you did last time?”
“Yes”
“Ok, it’ll be there in 20 minutes”Even better, while you talk to the store you called, the order goes into some sort of pizza load balancer and gives the order to the least busy store with a good drive time to your house.I’d seriously like to buy/have a beer for/with whoever designed it."</p>

Especially if I throw in some quotation marks, to make it clear I want a literal match?Yet when I search for realsense &#34;failed to recconect&#34; Google, in its infinite wisdom, returns pages that contain neither realsense nor recconect [2]. They offer me a supreme court opinion, a review of a car dealership, and a facebook church service.Correcting the spelling of a query is one thing - but also completely ignoring other keywords? Even when there are pages available that match the query? [1][1] https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/5ff27fca... [2] https://imgur.com/a/okYV5V2"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was looking for a specific person recently and searched:
&lt;name of person&gt; CanadaI guess they were pretty obscure so Google in all their wisdom displayed the results for Canada, with the entire name struck through. Fantastic. Defaulting to the most generic term in a query to the point of absolute uselessness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the past maintainers of minikube here. Minikube, while targeted towards Kubernetes developers, also provides all the features you&#39;d want here. It also takes away most of the pain from virtual machine management w/ native hypervisors.If you&#39;re looking for customizability (boot image, docker version, container runtime), minikube is probably your best bet. It even comes with some rudimentary file-sharing and port-forwarding primitives, but it isn&#39;t as batteries-included as Docker desktop. On the other hand, you have full ssh access to the VM to do whatever you want (+startup scripts, etc.)Awhile back, I wrote up a comparison of all the Docker Desktop Alternatives.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know people doing docker dev are generally targeting a Linux of some sort, but why the heck doesn&#39;t the macOS kernel support native containerization?Come on Apple. Microsoft can do it.edit: this seems like a new development since my last whine/complaint on this topic:https://macoscontainers.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been exploring 2 alternatives (podman and colima) to replace my normal docker workflow, which is just building and running containers locally, sometimes with docker-compose. I started with podman but had issues with 2 main pieces of my workflow: docker-compose (or podman-compose) and shared volumes (with `run -v`). Switched over to colima and those worked out of the box for me (&#34;brew install docker; brew install docker-compose; brew install colima; colima start; docker run ...&#34;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is strange, in a way, since the series does not present an obviously alluring portrait of creative collaboration. Its principal locations are drab and unglamorous: a vast and featureless film studio, followed by a messy, windowless basement. The catering consists of flaccid toast, mugs of tea, biscuits and cigarettes. The participants, pale and scruffy, seem bored, tired, and unhappy much of the time. None of them seem to know why they are there, what they are working on, or whether they have anything worth working on. As we watch them hack away at the same songs over and over again, we can start to feel a little dispirited too.Are you kidding me?? This is probably the most inspiring part of the whole show! This is how you create things. It&#39;s a long, &#34;unglamorous&#34; slog full of dead ends, muck &amp; mire, and discovery. This is what gets an artist excited - the oeuvre in gestation, the birthing pains, the grim determination depsite not knowing whether you&#39;re pursuing genius or madness! Gets me fired up every time.The completed creation is usually a bit of a downer, like when you finish a good book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you ever played in a band, even if it&#39;s a middle-aged-friends-with-minimal-talent one, you&#39;ll enjoy Get Back immensely. It looks so real. Even if you weren&#39;t in a band, but in some other kind of a team of peers, you&#39;ll enjoy how group dynamics plays out. I still didn&#39;t manage to watch part 3, but first two are pure gold."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beatles fan since 1963 here. Easily the best thing I&#39;ve ever read about them. All the mind-reading, which I generally hate in profiles like this, is pretty well justified by context. For anyone creative, Peter Jackson&#39;s &#34;Get Back&#34; can be both heartening and devastating: the former because it reminds you that a lot of creativity is sweat equity, and the latter because holy shit, they just had it like no one else."</p>
