								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always found it funny that companies will go to extreme Herculean lengths to hire the best programmers, and are incredibly fearful and paranoid that they could be making a &#34;bad hire&#34;, and yet once hired they don&#39;t spend a second making sure engineers aren&#39;t completely running the software product off the rails and killing the company internally. The author mentions trying to rewrite Etsy&#39;s backend in Scala and MongoDB. That probably cost the company X million dollars. Etsy could still be recovering from that.The industry constantly mints senior engineers who have been bitten by complexity, but doesn&#39;t want to hire them, or listen to them. More often than not senior engineers pretend to be excited about complecting the tech stack, because hey, it pads their resume with the latest buzzwords and they&#39;ve given up trying to fight against it anyway.The last line of defense against a rogue engineering team is managers who have studied this stuff. How many engineering managers can spot the common situation &#34;the engineers are bored and they&#39;re rewriting perfectly-good codebases in Common Lisp and OCAML for funsies&#34;? And how many know what to do about it when they see it?Anyway, this is a cool website, and it&#39;ll be useful to point people to it in the future, so thanks for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the non-boring technology club is that programmers see what problem FAANG companies are solving and wanting to be on the edge on new technology too. But they don‘t have the same problems. Another problem is they want to show what they can do. If they tell in an interview they are working with rails/django and a postgresql database they fear they look incompetent using those old technologies. So they try to convince their companies their products need to be rewritten in mongodb, react with graphql in a micro service stack and many more state of the art technologies.And in the end many developer years are wasted just rewriting a working an existing software in a new stack they are not yet comfortable with and the new product is much less stable than the old one.I love basecamp for their hotwired stack and showing that you can make the great software with old boring technologies and just a little bit of javascript magic pixie dust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way I see it is that one should master their stack.  If you work over and over again with the same stack you will know it well.  You will be able to move mountains with it.  But it takes years to arrive to that.  It takes implementing multiple projects the same way over and over again.You need the wherewithal to stick with your stack and not get lured away.  Maybe this is what boring means.  Maybe boring is different to different engineers based on their background.Sometimes you cannot select the stack cause there might be more senior engineers at a company and they have more sway.  This is fine as long as the engineers picking the stack have picked a stack they have mastered and it is boring to them.  As a regular engineer in their team I would hope to rely on their expertise and would hope to learn from them.I remember at one job a rogue engineer picked a boring backend that would have been fine.  But they fell behind because the other engineers knew their boring stack a lot better.  Ultimately the rogue engineer had to switch to the other boring stack.  The rogue engineer just was not fast enough to master it and implement the features required to keep pace with the demands of management.  These demands were trace centralized logging, security, and of course features.  So while they were still learning the ropes, we were moving on to even more advanced security, logging, and feature requirements.  They just couldn&#39;t keep up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I want to express sympathies in a particular way:When I had a job I didn’t want, in a city i didn’t want, no kids, no wife, and prospects abounding, it was easy to speak truth to power.  I did it, and I was right technically, businesswise, and 
morally.  What a win...(?)Now, I have my dream job, my dream location, my own damn house, and my family.  -Whole thing feels like a dream I might wake up from if I am not careful...  and I feel totally weighed down when it comes to speaking up in a way I would have never countenanced a few years ago.All that to say, this poor kid... I can only imagine the incentive structures that led him to choose this route, but I know academia being f’ed is a big part of it, and it ticks me off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m gonna get enemies for that ....But let&#39;s face it: the Academia peer review process is pretty rotten.- Many organisations could not care less about whatever crap you publish as long as you publish. And if possible a lot.- Many journal&#39;s reviewers are friend of friends and you can often easily guess their names, even in double blinded review.- Many reviewers care more about you quoting their own paper than giving any relevant feedback.- There is plenty &#34;pay2publish&#34; journals that care about quantity not quality that are commonly used by academia to &#34;force&#34; validate crappy researches/PHds- The publishing world is full of oversized-ego individuals that will destroy a paper just because it comes from a competing lab/department/professor and not because it is scientifically irrelevant.And that is only a little subset of the problems..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone really, really, really needs to get this professor&#39;s current students to safety immediately. Don&#39;t forget that shortly before the student&#39;s suicide, according to a screenshot of a conversation with the student who took his own life (same Medium account, earlier article), the professor threatened to kill the student if he &#34;ruined his reputation.&#34; His students are not safe and the focus should be on making sure they are safe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plastic recycling seems heavily motivated by emotion and virtue signaling.In reality, only about 5% of our crude oil use goes towards plastic.If we rolled out EVs, and then just burned all the plastic trash (using waste-to-energy plants), we would still be far ahead.The biggest challenges with plastics are hormone disruption, and microplastics (particularly in the 3rd world without sufficient landfill or W2E infrastructure or societal environmental concern).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Between Clipper and this, we’ve arrived at an inflection for SLS - it’s a dead program walking. The Senator from Alabama, Sen. Shelby is set to retire. And so it has become politically viable to sunset SLS.I predict that the program will end after Artemis flies and they have a plan in place for the jobs it creates"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a shame that the lunar gateway is useless and itself a jobs program like SLS. Since NASA decided not to fund the version of the asteroid retrieval mission (ARM) that included de-spin there are no near earth asteroids that can be brought back to the proposed space station. All it can do is uselessly orbit the Moon, getting full cosmic radiation dose instead of less than half in Earth orbit in the magnetosphere.In terms of resources the moon itself only has water. But it&#39;s down in a difficult to access gravity well. There&#39;s no nitrogen. Far, far, better would be fully funding ARM and starting to despin and drag asteroids to the lunar gateway for study, resources, and eventually living space in space protected from radiation and, if you build sub-surface tracks, enough acceleration to live normally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand how NASA&#39;s manned space program has become such a mess and basically a political football while their unmanned scientific missions seem to go pretty well. Whenever I hear something about SLS I feel sad for the people working on it.  Although the James Webb also seems to be a disaster."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m surprised by the backlash regarding this tool. Well, I guess surprised is the wrong word. I get that it is creepy. There are lots of websites that do this very thing like whatsmyname.app.I personally like running my username through tools like this and aggregating my digital presence. When I was younger, I signed up for lots of sites that were the cool, new thing. Checking myself years later, I am shocked by the wide berth I left. Fitness accounts. Accounts from that time I was getting into studying chess. I’m the type of person who is always on to the next hobby. I go 100% in on something, then pop to the next thing. It was a big wake up call to me looking back seeing how much presence I left. Many accounts are so old I can’t even get into them anymore to clean up what’s out there. Tools like this can be used for good.That said, I totally understand the cyber stalking/bullying concerns. I am also astounded by the cyber sleuth types. In the documentary, Don’t F* with Cats, people spent 100s of hours carefully walking through streets in Google Maps to match a location to a photo they had of a guy who killed a cat on YouTube. It seems to me where there’s a will, there’s a way. It’s scary, and unfortunately a lot of tools we can use to protect ourselves are the same tools that can be used against us. Look at cyber security in general. A black hat and a white hat are people with the same skills, but ethics draw a line between them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; API, CLI &amp; Web App for analyzing &amp; finding a person&#39;s profile across +300 social media websites&gt; could help in investigating profiles related to suspicious or malicious activities such as cyberbullying, cybergrooming, cyberstalking, and spreading misinformation.It will much more likely be used to aid cyberbullying and cyberstalking. Those types love digging for more information by finding their targets&#39; profiles on other social media sites.Those types of trolls are much more adept at using randomized usernames, disposable e-mail addresses, and VPN clients because they know what they&#39;re doing is potentially illegal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think that anyone developing a social media app for the 2020s will need to make a conscious decision to not let users pick their own unique identifiers. You can&#39;t expect users to protect themselves, because you don&#39;t know what dangers might exist in the future for them that do not exist today.The other thing you can do is not allow your API to iterate over the set of all users by user-set identifier. It&#39;s an extreme flaw of the telephone numbering system. You would think by the 2020s we&#39;d have learned to use a unique UUID designation for every user for any public facing APIs. If users want to link to it on their public pages, that would be on them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is interesting how manufactured distraction-free sessions like yoga, meditation, paid retreats, have emerged to fill the demand for idle time. We’re forgetting how to unplug unless it’s a product or service that we can buy.The distraction issue is the number one issue holding back most of the young people in the mentorship group I’m part of. They’re so glued to their phones to check minute-by-minute updates about COVID death tolls, how big their stimulus checks are going to be, the value of their crypto portfolio, GameStop, and every other popular topic under the sun that they don’t have any attention left for their own lives.Bitcoin is especially distracting right now, as they’re all nervously watching the real-time changes of their $1000 portfolios to see if they need to be sad about losing money because it’s crashing or sad about not investing more money because it’s going up.These are all smart students. I always wonder how much more they could accomplish if they’d simply pick four hours each day to turn off their phones. That’s a tough sell, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry to say this, but HN is a problem as well.I’m looking for that 1% of the posts that interest me, and when I find them it’s fantastic, since it’s info I would not be able to find anywhere else. But going through the other 99% is a waste of time.These two combined have a harmful effect on me. I don’t know if there’s a name for it, but it’s the same as the one causing addiction in gambling/bets/games. Gathering energy/motivation to do something productive instead takes effort.Just a few days ago I was thinking of adding a dns block for it. But that 1% of the links is sweet..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if we see a rise in ADHD in kids nowadays because it is an increasingly useful adaptation to our environment.&#34;Hyperfocus is the experience of deep and intense concentration in some people with ADHD. ADHD is not necessarily a deficit of attention, but rather a problem with regulating one’s attention span to desired tasks.&#34;I don&#39;t know, but &#34;hyperfocus&#34; on a hobby you love sounds exactly like what most people need nowadays to get off their phone and stop wasting their life staring on ads and ad-financed content. Also, I remember that most things we covered in school were completely irrelevant for the real world. So a difficulty to concentrate on school stuff may actually be better than doing the homework.In short, ignoring what society considers normal and instead being super focused on your own things ... sounds more healthy to me than the average &#34;normal&#34; person."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tangentially related to this post: I am surprised at the infosec’s love of file checksums, like MD5 here.
There are endpoint tools which collect MD5’s, network scanners which collect MD5s, and I have heard about actual infosec directors who, upon seeing a blog post like that, would carefully type the hashes in their endpoint management interface to make sure their org is not infected.How on earth can this be effective? It is trivial to create customized binaries in the installer, so no two users have the same file checksum. With a bit of work, one can rig their download server so each user has a completely different installer checksum as well.I remember reading about polymorphic viruses back in the 1990’s - not only those had different checksums for each  computer, they also had no long-ish substrings common between two versions, making signature analysis ineffective. Did malware authors just forgot about all those and went back to trivial “everyone gets the same image” strategy?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Mistake 3: Communicating something one time is enoughI joined a company once where a particularly skilled engineer had become a manager.   She was very good at her job and I&#39;m fairly certain had something like &#39;perfect recollection&#39;.We were in a meeting and she went on about how she was upset people were doing a troubleshooting process wrong despite having sent out a detailed email.Not wanting to do that thing wrong I searched my email, but couldn&#39;t find it.   I asked about it and she told me &#34;Oh it was before you joined us.&#34;.I had been with that team for two years...People tend to remember important things like it was yesterday, but don&#39;t always realize that other people can only absorb so many important things / don&#39;t always know how important it is... and email is kinda a terrible way to communicate it too.   Let alone 2+ years earlier ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most difficult things I had to learn to do as an engineering manager was to be able to confront attitude problems and take action as quickly as possible.Performance problems can be fixed. Attitude problems are much harder to solve. You will face this situation multiple times in your career as engineering manager.I&#39;m not very aggressive or confrontational by nature, so having that conversation with the engineer in question is absolutely not something I looked forward to. This obviously led to an unfair amount of work for the others in the team, a feeling of unfair treatment, resentment and a hit to morale and performance.Two situations were so extreme that we&#39;ve had to lay off the engineer(s) in question, which is one of the hardest things to do as a manager. I can tell you that in both instances the teams fared much better afterwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mistakes I&#39;ve seen eng mgrs make:- not acknowledging obvious elephants in the room- not building enough trust early on with their reports that when a problem comes up, the information they get is biased as they are seen as part of leadership/management and not the team- applying pressure in the wrong direction (ie; if the team is moving slow because of stress or fear, making things more stressful will not speed things up)- trying too hard to be friends with all their reports, rather than figuring out the appropriate boundaries on a person to person basis- relaying anonymous information around in an effort to &#34;protect people&#34; and thus making themselves the go-between between all members on a team rather than encouraging people to work things out themselves- for ICs that then became mgrs, staying way too focused on the in the weeds details and not on the bigger picture or people details, up to an including still spending too much time coding or trying to do PR reviews that carry too much weight--I would actually go so far as to say that the best &#34;IC turned managers&#34; I&#39;ve had have been about at par with the most mediocre &#34;good people mgrs that didn&#39;t come through coding for that role&#34;, and the people in that role that excelled at it (a motley crew of former stage managers, teachers, guidance counselors, project managers, etc)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Running an alternative OS &#34;natively&#34; on a Mac doesn&#39;t seem very appealing to me. It&#39;s almost guaranteed you will never fully get Wi-Fi, audio, graphics acceleration, the trackpad, etc. working flawlessly, especially on the M1 where almost every component is Apple proprietary and it&#39;s not a matter of loading, say, some common Intel graphics driver.On the other hand, virtualization _already_ lets you run whatever arm64 BSD, Linux, or Windows that you want. The trackpad and everything else will work flawlessly thanks to guest additions. Yes, you make some tradeoffs -- you sacrifice a core, a few GB of RAM, some disk space for an OS you don&#39;t _really_ want to be running. But I&#39;m skeptical that these are not better tradeoffs than constantly using a hacked-together and half-broken OS.To me the ideal solution is not that Corellium or Marcan or whoever reverse engineers the drivers to a sufficient degree. I&#39;d rather see Apple (or the Hackintosh types) release a tiny variant of macOS that contains hardware drivers and Hypervisor.framework and not much else. It could be the next generation of Boot Camp and it would probably take less engineering effort for them to maintain while satisfying the small segment of customers interested in running other operating systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic. OpenBSD on an M1 Mac Mini would be a great home server.As for desktop, I love cwm on my thinkpads, but macbook touchpads have won me over. That said, if arcan gets to a usable state on OpenBSD, I wouldn&#39;t mind sinking a few weekends (and/or crates of beer) into helping with improving touchpad/gesture support. X11 is just too daunting to have me bothered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much for the many remarks made on HN claiming that Apple would use the M1 to further exert control over users’ ability to boot an alternative OS. Between this and Asahi Linux, I’d say things are off to a good start.Btw, Asahi has a Patreon page for anyone who wants to contribute. I’m tossing twelve bucks a month and recommend any Mac users with interest in booting alternative OSes support such projects.Now I’m gonna see if there’s an option to throw money at this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am deeply, deeply romantic about programming. I consider it an act of self-actualization.But answering the question literally, I am not representative of everyone in the industry, and that&#39;s a good thing. It&#39;s easy to feel romantic about your vocation when you have a number of reasonable options for achieving modest financial security, and you thus had the privilege of choosing the one that most closely matched your idea of self-actualization and self-identification.Not everyone in this economy has the same set of choices. For many, programming is the lowest-risk way to put a roof over their head and feed their family. We can make up little myths about how we romantics are obviously more passionate, work harder because it&#39;s our dream, are more deeply engaged, and so on.But in the end, I think we&#39;ll find as we look around that those of us who feel romantic about something that is also an excellent way to make money at this particular place in time and space have won a lottery of sorts, and are definitely in the minority.That&#39;s not a bad thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I don&#39;t disagree with the article, this quote better sums up how I feel about programming.&gt; The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet&#39;s words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself... The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.-Fred Brooks, in The Mythical Man-MonthIn deference to the counterpoints in this thread, a lot of the &#34;poetry&#34; we actually encounter seems to have been written by Vogons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing as i&#39;m not as jaded yet as many of the other commenters here towards programming, maybe I can give my views.I understand what the author&#39;s getting at pretty simply, it&#39;s pretty awesome to write some words...lots and lots of words...and you create &#39;something&#39;.It&#39;s sort of the same romance that say would surround something likeA carpenter that builds homes from start to finishOr a mechanic that builds super cars in their garageI think it&#39;s that same thingThe lone programmer hacking away building something awesomeUnfortunately, like the &#39;romance&#39; of most things, the reality isThat carpenter&#39;s working on a crew of 100 people building yet another cooking cutter townhouseThat mechanic works a day job at a shop and spends more time paying bills and dealing with customersAnd...that programmerThey&#39;re part of a team debugging some server code somewhere that a bank or accounting firm relies on or somethingSometimes though, I find it helps just to stop and think of things romantically from time to time, even if you&#39;re disillusioned.By the time I left my prior job, I was kind of fed up with it. But even then there was two ways I could look at it.I could be&#39;A CNC programmer in a granite shop making countertops and fireplaces for rich people&#39;Or&#39;I turned mountains into high end furniture using large machines in a trade that stretches back to the farthest history of humanity.&#39;Looking at it the second way helped on those days you just really didn&#39;t want to be there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect Brave&#39;s efforts to make Tor accessible to the masses, but it also puts people at risk. There&#39;s lot of people with not a great deal of technical knowledge who are aware of Tor and might see it as a means to bulletproof privacy, unaware that using it through Brave on an OS like Windows 10 could easily expose them.Brave does present some kind of warning to users when opening an incognito tab. It just doesn&#39;t make the risks clear enough and will mostly be ignored.I&#39;m not sure what solutions there are for this. Perhaps shipping Tor as part of a regular browser isn&#39;t a good idea. In fact, I&#39;d say Tor should&#39;ve never been tunnelling generic protocols and instead had its own protocol for sharing information. That&#39;s another conversation though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Psychedelics are not without risks, but the risks are for me a deal breaker when they are illegal.There are too many ‘designer drugs’ out there with unknown properties that are sold by misrepresenting what they are.LSD25, psilocybin, MDMA, DMT these are drugs with known risks and side effects, and there has been legitimate investigation into their benefits. It would be great if we could legally continue to gather data.So far, it seems these substances are arguably much less dangerous than many illegal substances. I would be in favor of legalizing all of them.Decriminalizing seems to be a necessary step in that direction, but it doesn’t allow for quality control. Legalization allows for real and enforceable disclosure about what I might be putting in my body.I hope we get there someday.Edit: and possibly less dangerous than some legal substances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just want to give a shout out to Rick Doblin, the founder of MAPS, who has been fighting this fight since at least 1990.He, like myself, is an alum of New College, a non-traditional college in Sarasota.  He graduated I think the year before I matriculated, but his presence was well known on campus and his house was a legendary house he rented out to a few students every semester.To be clear, MAPS already existed back then, he was already working to get psychedelics (and entheogens such as MDMA) incorporated into therapeutic modalities.Back then the idea of legalized psychedelics seemed like a pipe dream.  To see his dreams begin to come to fruition 30 years later must be one of the most satisfying things a person can accomplish in his life.My hat&#39;s off to Rick Doblin.  What a mensch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Off-topic, but I wonder if decriminalizing all drugs will kill the cartel profits. From what I can see, they make a ton of profit due to the illegality(risk-profit) and this big profit is how they became so powerful. Food for thought I guess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This classic passive-aggressive apology — “I felt awful that I had let down so many people in my effort to be loyal and learn from EA” doesn’t exactly ring out with contrition — isn’t even internally consistent; if the development team loved their game so much, why was Origin’s management forced to devise stratagems to keep them from going home out of the fear that they wouldn’t come back? Nevertheless, it does contain a fair amount of truth alongside its self-serving omissionsUgh - those omissions are not self-serving. The reality (which we all see) is that the dev team f*cking hated the game, probably gave up on quality, and everyone knows it.  But saying so is an attack on the people Garriott screwed when he screwed up; the omissions are of other people&#39;s contributions to his faults, not his faults themselves.The apology was _incredibly_ well-written: it highlights all of garriott&#39;s mistakes, in detail, and places the blame squarely on his own shoulders: he could say &#34;EA is evil because they enforce business discipline,&#34; but instead said &#34;they did their job as a business, and I didn&#39;t so mine as a creator.&#34;If anything, this was probably _too_ self-blaming (we all know EA would just replace him if he didn&#39;t bow down, accomplishing nothing). But don&#39;t criticize him for failing to throw his team under the bus.  Knowing very little, I&#39;d love work for this guy, based on that apology alone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pagan was pretty bad. I was one of the superfans at the time, I had played every Ultima on my Apple II and then my PC. I was one of the first people to beat Ultima VI and still have my award certificate from Lord British which I got in the mail. I spent late nights tweaking my autoexec.bat and config.sys to get Ultima VII to run properly. Pagan was unplayable on release, it was actually impossible to across the stones leading across an underground river without falling in. Later they released a patch which fixed the most glaring issues and I completed the game, but it left a sour taste in my mouth.What REALLY killed Ultima was the absolute state of Ultima IX. Also released in an unplayable state, the patches rolled in. Finally after about two months, it was playable but as one progressed in the game, incongruities almost immediately popped out. The lore had been changed, sometimes substantially. And this wasn&#39;t the worst thing - it became clear after not too long that the game wasn&#39;t done at all. This was later admitted by an Origin team member who released the real plot, and later on people attempted to fan-patch the game to make it more like it had been planned originally.Of course, EA is to blame for all of this, but Garriott shares this blame for allowing them to take too much control away from his organization and okaying the releases before they were ready.http://hacki.bootstrike.com/english/nitpicks.htmHacki&#39;s page is still THE internet resource for the pissed off former Ultima fan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It only killed the franchise if you don&#39;t count Ultima Online, which is probably one of the most important games in video game history."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like it uses system webviews instead of bundling a copy of Chromium? This to me seems like the real headlining feature, but strangely I had to dig pretty deep to find it: https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/technical-detai...I kind of wonder why it took this long for someone to try this approach. It just makes a whole lot more sense on the surface.Interesting thing I just thought about: since users don&#39;t get to choose their system webview, I wonder if this has the potential to broaden browser diversity a little bit?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of makes me think... is there room for a much more stripped down version of Chromium that is suitable for lower memory footprint? Or is this impossible?It looks like Tauri uses system webviews, which use a lot less memory, but the burden is then on the developer to make sure that they build essentially 3 (maybe more) UI&#39;s on platforms that might change under their feet. That&#39;s why the Electron approach is simpler - it trades of performance for uniformity of experience across the major platforms.But I&#39;m wondering if it really has to be this way. Do modern browsers really need 2G of RAM in order to send and receive messages in a chat box (looking at you, Slack)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A more common scenario I see is that people start with a monolith that ends up inheriting all the conceptual debt that accumulates as a project evolves. All this debt builds up a great desire for change in the maintaining team.A champion will rise with a clean architecture and design in microservice form that addresses all high visibility pain points, attributing forecasted benefits to the perceived strengths of microservices. The team buys into the pitch and looks forwards to a happily-ever-after ending.The reality though is that the team now has multiple problems, which include:- Addressing conceptual debt that hasn&#39;t gone away.
- Discovering and migrating what the legacy system got right, which is often not documented and not obvious.
- Dealing with the overheads of microservices that were not advertised and not prominent at a proof-of-concept scale.
- Ensuring business continuity while this piece of work goes on.I would propose alternative is to fix your monolith first. If the team can&#39;t rewrite their ball of mud as a new monolith, then what are the chances of successfully rewriting and changing architecture?Once there is a good, well functioning monolith, shift a subset of responsibility that can be delegated to a dedicated team - the key point is to respect Conway&#39;s law - and either create a microservice from it or build a new independent monolith service, which aligns more to service oriented architecture than microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hahaha. I have been saying the same for years but have either been punished by my managers or mercilessly downvoted on HN.Somehow mentioning that microservices might not be perfect solution in every case triggers a lot of people.I have actually helped save at least one project in a huge bank which got rolled from 140 services into one. The team got also scaled down to third of its size but was able to work on this monolithic application way more efficiently. Also reliability, which was huge issue before the change, improved dramatically.When I joined, I have observed 6 consecutive failed deployments. Each took entire week to prepare and entire weekend to execute (with something like 40 people on bridge call).When I left I have observed 50 consecutive successful deployments, each requiring 1h to prepare (basically meeting to discuss and approve the change) and 2h of a single engineer to prepare and execute using automation.Most projects absolutely don&#39;t need microservices.Breaking anything apart brings inefficiencies of having to manage multiple things. Your people now spend time managing applications rather than writing actual business logic. You have to have really mature process to bring those inefficiencies down.If you want to &#34;do microservices&#34; you have to precisely know what kind of benefits you are after. Because the benefits better be higher than the costs or you are just sabotaging your project.There are actually ways to manage huge monolithic application that don&#39;t require each team to have their own repository, ci/cd, binary, etc.How do you think things like Excel or PhotoShop have been developed? It is certainly too large for a single team to handle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with creating a dichotomy between &#34;monolith&#34; and &#34;microservices&#34; is that... well... it doesn&#39;t make any sense. You describe your &#34;microservices&#34; and I&#39;ll explain how it&#39;s really just a monolith.&#34;So let me get this straight, you have a Billing package and an Ordering package. How are these organized again?&#34;-&gt; &#34;We have a distributed system.&#34;&#34;So you you compile them together and deploy them horizontally across many machines? Like a distributed monolith?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No we use microservices. The two packages are compiled and deployed separately so there is no code dependencies between them.&#34;&#34;Okay. So if I understand this right, you develop each package separately but they both access the same database?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No no no no! Microservices are not just about code dependency management, they are also about data ownership. Each package is developed and deployed separately and also manages it own database.&#34;&#34;Ah, so you have two monoliths?&#34;-&gt; &#34;...&#34;You see the problem is that the above terms are too broad to describe anything meaningful about a system. And usually &#34;monolith&#34; is used to described the dependencies between code whereas &#34;microservices&#34; is used to describe dependencies about data. It turns out there is a lot of overlap.Design and implement your systems according to your use-case and stop worrying about how to label them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so disappointed in this. Whatsapp is a functional tool. It was successful since it worked.Facebook has entirely failed to utilise it - to allow external systems to connect in so that businesses can do business on there. The voice calls are also a disaster.They&#39;ve now come along to start messing with the privacy to start selling ads.  It is insane that they&#39;re able to make such a mess of this. Is there a word for anti-innovation?Considering that they&#39;re linking Facebook ad platform with the chats, and they&#39;re forcing this upon everyone, why isn&#39;t this covered by the monopoly laws? Most of us paid some money for the app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s absurd this article doesn&#39;t try to describe what the changes actually are. The privacy policy change doesn&#39;t functionally change anything about what data is collected or shared with Facebook. Metadata collection for ad targeting has been allowed by the privacy policy since 2016."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s really hard for me to understand why and how something fails or succeeds to grab the public&#39;s attention.I&#39;ve been complaining and refusing to use WhatsApp for years, mostly because it&#39;s centralized at the worst possible company. But a boycott of one is not a powerful move and no one cared.Now, for whatever reason, nothing has effectively changed and millions suddenly care.I mean, I&#39;m glad they finally do, don&#39;t think it will make much of a difference, as network effect is a very strong pull, but I&#39;m flabbergasted nonetheless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It took time, and many thousands of dollars, before I realized that the vast majority of “likes” my pages received as a result of paid campaigns on FB were from accounts which were clearly not real people.A simple look enough of their profiles revealed that, like would he expected from any fly by night CPA network, FB was using bots, or at least straw man accounts run by low-cost staff, to like and view content which FB was paid to advertise.Worse, I found that the clickthrough metrics reported by them to off-FB destinations I advertised NEVER was anywhere close to what was reported on the destination, including when tracked by Google Analytics.In short: like-fraud, click-fraud, and more.I cannot be the only person to notice these things. I assume it persists because most people, self included, simply complain and move on once we notice the “game” but don’t sue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context: Daniel is the primary maintainer of curl (the ubiquitous utility and library for HTTP requests) [1]His name often shows up in the licensing disclosures/attributions of applications that include curl.The general opaqueness of modern software leads people to latch onto him and his email for all manner of things, and for non developers to attribute to him all sorts of bad motives (&#34;You hacked me!&#34;).This is especially unfortunate as Daniel has been such a genuinely positive and helpful face to a popular open source project.

OP discovered a problem they had and wrote a solution for it, believing that others might need to solve the same problem.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience doing perf optimizations in real world systems with many many people writing code to the same app is a lot of inefficiencies happen due to over fetching data, inefficiencies caused by naively using the ORM without understanding the underlying cost of the query, and lack of actual profiling to find where the actual bottlenecks are (usually people writing dumb code without realizing it&#39;s expensive).Sure, the framework matters at very large scale and the benefits from optimizing the framework become large when you&#39;re doing millions of requests a second over many thousands of servers because it can help reduce baseline cost of running the service.But I agree with the author&#39;s main point which seems to be that framework performance is pretty meaningless when comparing frameworks if you&#39;re just starting on a new project. Focus on making a product people wanna actually use first. If you&#39;re lucky enough to get to scale you can work about optimizing it then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A humble request to folks making benchmark or other graphs - please understand that thin coloured lines are not easy to visually parse .. even for folks like me who aren&#39;t totally colour blind but have partial red-green colour blindness. At least, the lines can be made thicker so it is easier to make out the colours. Even better, label the lines with an arrow and what they represent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related to ORMs/queries/performance, I have found the following combination really good:* aiosql[0] to write raw SQL queries and having them available as python functions (discussed in [1])* asyncpg[2] if you are using Postgres* Map asyncpg/aiosql results to Pydantic[3] models* FastAPI[4]Pydantic models become the &#34;source of truth&#34; inside the app, they are designed as a copy of the DB schema, then functions receive and return Pydantic models in most cases.This stack also makes me think better about my queries and the DB design. I try to make sure each endpoint makes only a couple of queries. Each query may have multiple CTEs, but it&#39;s still only a single round-trip. That also makes you think about what to prefetch or not, maybe I want to also get the data to return if the request is OK and avoid another query.[0] https://github.com/nackjicholson/aiosql

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really interested to see what this does to Deliveroo. I live in central London on a pretty busy street and it&#39;s really wild how many Deliveroo drivers there are. In front of most of the popular takeaway restaurants there are 3-5 drivers waiting at any given time. The increase in delivery and decrease in normal foot traffic during the pandemic has made this really stick out.Deliveroo already totally robs these restaurants. Even for a click and collect order where I get the food myself Deliveroo takes ~20-30%. I assume this will cause Deliveroo to either increase fees or reduce service which may inspire more restuarants to hire their own delivery people again.Overall I think this is a good thing, especially now. These gig workers have been absolutely essential to society over the past year. People have been able to safely shelter in their home while these guys (it&#39;s mostly guys) go out and take all the risks. Let&#39;s pay them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The court made very specific arguments:1. Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn
2. Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them
3. Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides
4. Uber monitors a driver&#39;s service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improveEven if this does hurt Uber short-term, it sounds like the gig economy will be just fine, as long as companies change their behaviour with respect to the above points."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know anything about how the law works, but it seems to accord with the reality of how people tend to think of jobs.Have you ever met an Uber driver who didn&#39;t give the impression that this was what he did all the time? I haven&#39;t, though I imagine not everyone is full time. It&#39;s quite a way from the idea that anyone with a car can give someone else a ride. For instance, I&#39;ve never met a driver who happened to be going where I was going, or someone who thought they&#39;d just make few extra bucks on their day off. They must exist but it seems to not be the norm.At the same time, we&#39;re shoehorning old ideas of what&#39;s work into a modern setting, because it&#39;s reasonably quick to become a driver, and communications with the employer are minimal. Uber doesn&#39;t seem like the kind of firm where drivers might have a teambuilding excursion, though perhaps I&#39;m wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Raj thought that checking the &#34;principal&#34; checkbox and entering the number of a Citibank wash account would ensure that the principal payment would stay at Citibank. He was wrong. To prevent payment of the principal, Raj actually needed to set the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;fund&#34; fields to the wash account as well as &#34;principal.&#34; Raj didn&#39;t do that.I don&#39;t even have anything to add. The paragraph speaks for itself... You can&#39;t make this up"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The actual work of entering this transaction into Flexcube fell to a subcontractor in India named Arokia Raj.&gt; Citibank&#39;s procedures require that three people sign off on a transaction of this size. In this case, that was Raj, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware named Vincent Fratta.The names of these individuals seems like an unnecessary detail, especially since the article names the software interface as the culprit.  I can&#39;t help but think about the recent NYT/SSC incident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really is an awesome example of a bad UI. These are exactly the kind of UIs you see in the enterprise all the time, with the article containing the totally crazy description of what was expected plus the screenshots to show that there was absolutely no way to get this, if not being the programmer who wrote it (and even then, no guarantee at all to get it right). To have a somewhat exact approach of detecting and fixing issues like this, that is what usability is all about.So it&#39;s really the design of the software and not just the style of it that was wrong and had to be improved. A usability professional would have caught that immediately - and would have been way cheaper."</p>

So exited for all the sciencing this nuclear-powered, sample-drilling, laser-zapping behemoth can do when it joins its friends on the only planet (known) to be inhabited solely by robots.Edit: Percy is about to release its two 77 kg Cruise Mass Balance Devices (is this what NASA calls &#39;weights&#39;?) to setup the right lift-to-drag ratio for entry. Mars InSight will be listening for the 14,000 km/hr impacts of these weights, providing useful calibration data.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I don&#39;t understand: when they say &#34;X is 1 minute from happening&#34;, does that mean it&#39;s really 1 minute from happening or does that mean &#34;in 1 minute we&#39;ll receive the signal that X has happened&#34;?Maybe my question makes more sense in the case of &#34;X is happening right now&#34;, because then I should either understand &#34;we infer that X should have happened right about now&#34; or &#34;we have confirmed via signal that X has happened&#34;, and that&#39;s a big big difference.I know in some cases they explicitly say the latter, so I guess my real real question is, do they just keep the communication delay implied in all countdowns &amp; references in discussion, to avoid confusion?(ETA: No need to let me know about simultaneity problems in relativity — earth and mars are, relative to c and to macroscopic time scales, essentially not moving relative to each other AFAIK, so that simultaneity is essentially well-defined. My question was about a much more boring classical-universe problem.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a great achievement with some really interesting work done on the landing algorithms with terrain recognition and it seemed to have worked exceptionally well.Looking forward for the next landing in May of the Chinese rover and all the science these robots will produce. Also, the test of Ingenuity, the helicopter, will be very interesting to watch, that could really pave the way for a different exploration style in the future.And finally, maybe the next transfer window will already see some Starships, that would really change everything."</p>

It&#39;s going to absolutely blow away consumer-grade highly oversubscribed, bottom of the barrel ku and ka band geostationary satellite services (hughesnet, viasat in the USA, xplornet in Canada), and any WISP that can&#39;t keep up with a 150 Mbps figure.And eventually for really hard to reach places in the developing world, and much of the same offshore/aviation/maritime industry that right now pays tons of money to Inmarsat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was able to place an actual order just last week in St. Louis, MO.I will be using it and doing some tests in an area that actually has cable Internet (though spotty, and until very recently was limited to less than 20 Mbps up, no matter how much you paid).But you have to realize, when you look at the $600 initial cost and $100 monthly fee—this will bring 100+ Mbps down and 15+ Mbps up to so many places (even in suburbs) where people couldn&#39;t get more than 10/2 or so for any price.I already know a few people who don&#39;t even live in rural parts who would happily pay triple just to get off their junk DSL or flaky Cable connection, even with Starlink in beta. They are already used to spotty Internet, so Starlink is a massive improvement even if it&#39;s spotty (which it hasn&#39;t been, according to these users)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was at PowerBI in Microsoft, all the execs hailed it as Startup within Microsoft. Come work here instead of Uber. I worked like a dog, sometimes till 2am in morning. My manager would routinely ask us to come on weekends. I was naive, I thought we are growing customer base, this is what a startup looks like.The ultimate realization was in a startup you have equity, a decent amount in a good startup. At Microsoft it was a base salary and set amount of stock. What we did moved very little of the top revenue metric. It made little difference if I worked like a dog, or slacked. The promos were very much “buddy buddy” system.In the end I realized you can’t have startups in big companies (esp as an engineer you don’t have the huge upside  if the startup is successful, your upside is capped)Startups work because you have skin in the game, when you build something people want, you get to reap rewards proportional to it. That correlation and feedback loop is very important.At big companies you don’t have the the same correlation. Some big shot exec they hired reaps far far more on the work you did.Equity is what builds wealth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, sure, but it also misses the point a bit. &#34;Startup in a big company&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;yo take some cashdollar and try build and release something to the public&#34;, but it does mean &#34;hey, take a small team and do your own thing with less oversight and process overhead from higher-ups&#34;.The team I worked in at AWS was like this and it felt a lot like startup teams I&#39;ve worked with. That didn&#39;t mean we could take &#39;brand and legal risk&#39;, and if that&#39;s what you want then definitely go and start your own thing.If you want more autonomy and higher velocity than is normal at corporates, then a &#39;startup within a big company&#39; might actually work out for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure why everyone seems so focused on the cafeteria thing. I&#39;m not sure people and their attitudes towards amenities are really the problem here.From my understanding, the differerence is the companywide attitude to risk. A startup has a &#34;grow at any cost, or maybe perish&#34; attitude. If things go south, bankruptcy will take care of the leftover excess risk (barring criminal charges). A bigco cannot easily go bankrupt, even less a single department. There are tons and tons of capital to eat through if the accumulated risk is realized in cost. So a bigco has to do something about that risk somehow, because most of the company wants to keep what capital it has, only a small part of it really wants to risk things. So the only means to have a situation where you don&#39;t risk bigco for a single department is not making it a department. Make it a Ltd. in a holding or something."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good riddance, in my opinion. 40 million copies of a thick catalog with glossy pages means a couple shittons of not just trees but petroleum and petrochemicals for production, distribution, and disposal. Every year! And ten years ago, it was nearly 200. https://archive.is/rHAhGCan you even imagine a stack of one million catalogs?That&#39;s space, trees, plants, mammals, birds, insects, mushrooms, ... all being squeezed for a glossy catalog, most of which will get thumbed through once or twice and sent to the landfill to rot.These catalogs do not biodegrade well, by the way, because they&#39;re not just paper.I love paper books, and I enjoyed browsing this catalog just like many others in this thread, and yet I don&#39;t think I will miss this one. Hopefully, other thick glossy catalogs will follow suit.Production of catalogs like this squeezes our biome, and if we don&#39;t turn back, it will pop, and we&#39;ll be left with only enough resources for a small fraction of us to survive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am genuinely upset about this. I have such fond memories of thumbing through endlessly as a teenager and dreaming of having my own spaces that were so wonderfully busy and eclectic. My wife and I were just at IKEA last week picking up a new bed for our growing toddler, I glanced at the catalogs as we passed and decided against picking one up. I hope I can still get my hands on a couple old copies to keep on my bookshelf.Edit: Just placed an order for the specific catalog year I have so many memories of reading. One of my sillier purchases, but it feels like a piece of personal history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat unrelated IKEA has been brought to it&#39;s knees during the pandemic and it has made their online ordering completely useless.  For a company shifting focus to online only I would think they would want to be able to ship some things purchased online.Stock is also low in the Portland store, but even the few items available can&#39;t be purchased online and shipped to me. I&#39;ve tried to order a number of things recently and they won&#39;t ship anything to my house."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would normally be appalled by such an action, but the supply issues for RTX 30x0 cards are beyond ridiculous. Mining trashes the environment and, for the majority of crypto assets/volumes, does not provide genuinely valuable economic activity besides speculation (I say that as someone who has put thousands of dollars into crypto in the past). Why should people who want to try some ML/DL at home (maybe they even need it for a class they&#39;re taking), and might also want to play the occasional game, have to pay an arm and a leg to get their (remaining) hands on a modern, efficient card?I really wish Nvidia would do this across the RTX product line.Edit: the &#34;Syrian refugee crossing into Europe&#34; trope might pop up as a counter-argument for crypto. I am Syrian and still have relatives there. Refugees&#39; assets are a drop in the ocean of speculators&#39; mining and HODLing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like it&#39;s time to crack some NVIDIA drivers. I already do it for the video encoding limitations, why not this too? Miners are willing to go to some really hacky extremes, reflashing firmwares, custom fan mods, extreme overclock configurations, etc to maximize hashrates and certainly won&#39;t care if they have to jump through some hoops to patch a specific version of the Linux driver or enable unsigned drivers on Windows, as long as they make more profit.Good luck with this one NVIDIA but you&#39;re playing a losing game. As soon as one un-restricted version of the driver exists, this is as good as useless and demand will be the same as ever for these cards unless they&#39;re able to ship CMP cards at a very high rate, but my understanding is the restriction here is silicon.Let&#39;s not forget that last time they produced &#34;mining only&#34; cards, people managed to crack the drivers to render graphics too... this is no exception.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY4s35uULg4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gamers hate miners, they&#39;re driving the price up, make hardware impossible to get ect ... It&#39;s a really problematic situation. Almost 6 month after launching new graphic cards from AMD / NVIDIA good luck gettting an RTX 30xx or 6800.On a side note all those virtual currency are just plain wrong on the environment side, it does not make any sense in 2021 to have a currency that need heavy computation thus increasing power consumption. When people designed those currency they def did not think about that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A key part of this legislation is the requirements for tech companies to provide selected news organisations with advance notice about changes to ranking algorithms. This has been generally overlooked in the reporting and discussion but I believe it is the actually the most important part of the legislation. It will give the selected news organisations an enormous advantage over other companies not included and protect them from new competitors, basically entrenching the current media landscape for the foreseeable future.Given the current Australian government&#39;s cosy relationship with a particular media company that currently dominates the media landscape here, I don&#39;t think it is coincidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Australia and while I&#39;m excited to see less Facebook use, I see a lot of comments saying things like, &#34;good, Facebook monetized an addiction model and this curbs that&#34;. While true, the proposed law that has pushed them to do this is incredibly dangerous. The law doesn&#39;t just apply to Facebook, it applies to whoever the Treasurer of Australia[0] says it applies to - it isn&#39;t metrics/rules based: https://i.imgur.com/7RSqXDJ.pngThis means you as a business owner may wake up one day to find that you are now classified as a designated digital platform corporation and are on the hook to now negotiate contracts with every registered news business corporation, AND provide each of them with the secret sauce behind your ranking algos. The only thing that needs to be done to do this is for the Treasurer to file a decision in the Federal Register of Legislation[1]. It&#39;s a shocking amount of overreach, lack of visibility to the process, and a single point of failure in the system.Overall I&#39;m very curious to see how this plays out. Facebook took the nuclear option here, and I highly suspect that news corporations will feel quite a sting from the loss of traffic / platform. I truly feel like Facebook &#34;winning&#34; here and having the law dropped is the lesser of two evils.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer_of_Australia[1] https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/Results/ByRegDate/Legi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m about to say this, but I think I&#39;m going to side with FB on this. The Australian government is once again showing absolute disregard when it comes to understanding technology, and its signature heavy handed approach to regulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can certainly see a lot of parallels with Oculus / Facebook.Perhaps unusually, I actually wanted FB to impress itself more strongly on Oculus post acquisition because, frankly, Oculus was a bit of a mess.  Instead, Oculus was given an enormous amount of freedom for many years.Personally, nobody ever told me what to do, even though I was willing to &#34;shut up and soldier&#34; if necessary -- they bought that capability! Conversely, I couldn&#39;t tell anyone what to do from my position; the important shots were always called when I wasn&#39;t around. Some of that was on me for not being willing to relocate to HQ, but a lot of it was built into early Oculus DNA.I could only lead by example and argument, and the arguments only took on weight after years of evidence accumulated.  I could have taken a more traditional management position, but I would have hated it, so that&#39;s also on me.  The political dynamics never quite aligned with an optimal set of leadership personalities and beliefs where I would have had the best leverage, but there was progress, and I am reasonably happy and effective as a part time consultant today, seven years later.Talking about &#34;entitled workers&#34; almost certainly derails the conversation.  Perhaps a less charged framing that still captures some of the matter is the mixing of people who Really Care about their work with the Just A Job crowd.  The wealth of the mega corps does allow most goals to be accomplished, at great expense, with Just A Job workers, but people that have experienced being embedded with Really Care workers are going to be appalled at the relative effectiveness.The communication culture does tend a bit passive-aggressive for my taste, but I can see why it evolves that way in large organizations.  I&#39;ve only been officially dinged by HR once for insensitive language in a post, but a few people have reached out privately with some gentle suggestions about better communication.All in all, not a perfect fairy tale outcome, but I still consider taking the acquisition offer as the correct thing for the company in hindsight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"9 years @ Google, and I too came from a company acquired by Google. (In my case, Google did not keep our product or tech stack around, so.) And yes, I can say many Googlers are entitled. It&#39;s a fair descriptor. And the pace of work is slower than a startup. In general.And I too have many criticisms of Google. But.Google has entirely different revenue constraints. It can afford an entirely different way of working. That pace allows a more sustainable cadence of development. It can be a more humane place to work, in general.Google can on the whole accomplish its revenue goals without being a meat grinder. So why be one? I think there is a bit of a problem with this guy&#39;s POV where he&#39;s come to fetishize the actual process of the making of the sausage versus the sausage itself.Projects need not be run under insane stress if there&#39;s a steady supply of talent and money to make things happen. Google can afford that. Pace will be slower. Perhaps less competitive. But the core business continues to do excellently.For many of us Google is not an &#34;exciting&#34; place to work. But it&#39;s a pretty good job to have and it pays well and gives access to both great benefits and to interesting technology. And that compensation in _most_ people does yield a sense of responsibility for delivery. But maybe not the survival-of-the-fittest-meat-grinder panic that this guy somehow seems to love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While he has valid points of how corp life is different from startup, he seems like a horrible, entitled person to work for.General attitude that comes out of it to me, is that your employees growth doesn’t matter, only his vision of product matters. He complains about people being entitled, and at the same time he complains that as CEO of subsidiary of one of the biggest company in the world, he cannot say offensive things in his talks.And most entitled one - he’s sold his company (that he actually didn’t own, from the beginning, like with most startups) and he cannot control it fully anymore? And complaining that he cannot fire people on the spot?He should check his entitlement before complaining about other being entitled by not wanting to put his product vision above their wellbeing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It feels a bit hypocritical when Apple laughs at FB for complaining about their new tracking pop-up yet when the shoe&#39;s on the other foot and Apple may actually have to compete on its own platform they double down and defend their right to be judge, jury and executioner.Apple competing with third party app stores on iOS is going to be amazing. No computer platform should be allowed to prevent sideloading or other stores from competing.This isn&#39;t the case on Windows.
This isn&#39;t the case on Android.Or Linux for that matter.It&#39;s more disappointing it takes 10 years for regulators to step-in and say &#34;that&#39;s bad, no more, open up your platform&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit OT, but I still fail to grasp why Apple is allowed to restrict all browsers on iOS to the Safari rendering engine. Microsoft had to pay big because they didn&#39;t asked their users properly for alternative browsers, yet Apple doesn&#39;t even give other browsers a fair chance to compete on iOS.Consumers suffer because Apple controls about 50% of the mobile market and if Apple decides a certain feature will not be available in Safari (e.g. Push API), no other browser vendor can even offer a solution.Sounds to me like totally abusing their market position to uphold their anti-competitive behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can hardly wait to use Amazon App Store to install Amazon and then open up the Epic Game Store to install random game and then open up EA Game Store to install random game and then open up Facebook App Store to install Facebook and then open up the Apple App Store to install the Blizzard App Store to install Hearthstone and then go back to the Apple App Store and update the Blizzard App Store so I can get the latest Hearthstone updates.Going to be super fun!My gaming computer is already filled with like 8 different app stores each completely different then the other and a variety of privacy/security issues on each. All of them need their App Store running in order to play their games, so half the time my computer has 4-5 App Stores running in the background so I can play a single game. And they are all electron/qt webkit apps cause nobody builds apps anymore so each one consumes about 500mb of ram.And each App Store also has their own chat system along with the others like discord.I don&#39;t agree that Apple should have a complete monopoly, but the alternative is not better. And while Android does have the main Google Play Store, and there isn&#39;t to many &#34;alternative&#34; App Stores at the moment. Just give it time, the same thing that is happening to TV Streaming/Game App Stores will happen on Android."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As usual, context matters. If you&#39;re trying to convey complex thoughts about abstract matters, then language is the way to do it. If you are trying to convey deep emotional states, then a photo or video is probably better. You cannot convert the 1st amendment into photos, and you cannot convert the Mona Lisa smile into words.Just try to use words to describe either of these photos and see how they fall short:https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...Between recorded voice and written text, I personally prefer written language. I like the ability to consume at my own pace, go back and re-read tricky bits, and easily search or quote. Plus it&#39;s much easier to use TTS to convert text to speech than the other way around (at the moment). Maybe someday technology will remove this boundary but currently that&#39;s my stance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question is whether these advantages are because text is a better communication medium, or because of the limitations of our technology?Take using a computer to type a word versus draw a picture: Effectively everyone who uses a computer can type a word, but I&#39;d bet less than 10% could draw a circle.But put a piece of paper in front of someone and effectively everyone can draw a circle.This points to there being a limitation in the technology for working with other forms of media, not the effectiveness of the communication medium itself.This isn&#39;t to say that text isn&#39;t also a better communication medium, but it is to say, until the technology has improved for communicating with other media, it&#39;s difficult to compare without basing the decision on the limitations of the technology.In other words, most of the perceived advantages of text are really advantages of text being easier to represent digitally (or generally reproduced, e.g., printing press), not advantages of text as a communication medium itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Text is not the oldest - nor easiest to use -, text is a heavy abstraction born somewhat recently in human history.The oldest and easiest is the visual in 3D, then comes the visual in 2D.Those exist since we have eyes.Our brain have dedicated and sizeable infrastructure for that. Children can communicate in 3D (gestures, posture, expressions, objects) and in 2D drawings before learning textural communication with great effort.Text is more regular and reliable in certain contexts (not always, sometimes a pictogram or others are better), when the circumstances are proper for that.Text has its uses, just like all the other forms, not being paramount, not at all!(I&#39;d also argue about that we could read old texts. Sometimes yes, but sometimes we cannot read present ones neither if the cultural and knowledge background is inadequate. Which is just aggravated by the ages)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imagine having a business model so fragile that your only line of  defense is to obscure the cancellation process through these tactics. Do they really think that they can curve their churn this way?I mean best you’re doing is getting maybe another month or so of revenue from a customer who is just pushing the pain of cancelling because they are busy or lazy.And at the end instead of getting what could be a dormant customer who can sign up later again, what you get is someone who hates your company.What an incredibly stupid way to erode the brand of a publication, whose major asset to survive is precisely its brand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just cancelled and it was relatively painless, to their credit.When they asked the reason, I said that political coverage was unfair. Left is OK, unfair is not.I don&#39;t consider myself &#34;on the left&#34; but I really don&#39;t mind a publication being left of center or right of center. If it&#39;s good, I will pay for it (I subscribed tp The Atlantic at least twice, and the New Yorker once, and probably others in a mix of print and digital).But the NYT has drifted too far down the path of politically-correct fashions, and away from robust debate and discussion of challenging topics and how they intersect with real events.It feels more like they want to persuade me to hold a set of opinions (which shifts rapidly), rather than informing me and letting me form my own. &#34;Persuade&#34; is even the wrong word; more like &#34;pressure&#34; or &#34;coerce&#34;. If it&#39;s all ads, so be it; but when I pay, I expect that I am the customer and not the product. So I don&#39;t pay as of the end of my billing cycle.Also, the NYT cheers on, and even participates in bullying. Scott Alexander being a recent example, but there are a lot more when it comes to politically-charged topics.I should reiterate that this is not a right-left thing. I would have remained subscribed if the NYT had simply drifted left, and concerned itself mainly with arguments betweed various left-of-center factions. Lots of worthwhile things to discuss and debate there, and lots of events to tie it to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar issue with the Wall Street Journal a few years back, and despite having spent the majority of my career working on Wall Street, I’ll never buy a subscription again.I signed up for a really good deal for 6 months of digital + paper delivery, but my paper always arrived a day or two late, so before my 6 months were up I tried to cancel, but couldn’t figure out a way to do so on their website. I messaged support asking them to not renew my subscription, and told them that the paper always arrived late. They responded back that they were going to give me a free subscription until they could figure out the paper delivery. I should have held firm and cancelled, but it seemed lke they were trying to provide good customer service.Nothing changed with delivery, and I followed up a few times to see what was going on. I was told they were looking into it.One day, out of the blue, I received a large bill from them. I called to see what was going on and I was told that my trial was up and since I hadn’t cancelled that it had renewed. A proceeded to tell the about my problems with delivery and that customer service was supposedly working on fixing the problem and not charging me until they could. The person on the phone told me that that’s not possible since they don’t provide same-day delivery to my address. I recounted exactly what had happened, and they basically told me I was a liar, and would not refund the charge because the user agreement says they don’t have to, even though I called within a few hours of the new charge and subscription renewal.The part that really stung was that I was a PhD student and could get an entire year for less than what they charged me for a month. I’ve never had a company treat me so poorly before."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am sorry about the position you&#39;re in. For the last several years I have been balancing taking care of my terminally ill wife who recently passed away, all while working remotely in the web hosting industry. It&#39;s hard to balance. Harder than you think. Setting boundaries will be vital to being successful in any WFH role.Now that that&#39;s out of the way: You need to focus. You&#39;ve described your abilities and that&#39;s fine, but you lack focus. Your qualifications are great, but your presentation is all over the place. You need a single one page resume that focuses on one aspect of your knowledge and experience, and lightly mentions the others. Make multiple resumes, each with a focus on one thing. Use the resume that&#39;s best for the job. I recently saw somebody who must have had 20 different resumes to match the jobs they were applying for. It worked.Also, you might consider looking into the Web Hosting business. If your temperament is as you describe, and you like talking on the phone or live chat, most web hosts will overlook any technical gaps. Those can be taught. In fact that can lend to your focus! Focus on the fact that you know things that can&#39;t be taught: Customer Service, talking down angry customers, talented writing, friendly and always willing to find a solution under dire circumstances. Those are GOLD. Once those are on the table, the rest is negotiable. I&#39;ll email you a link to at least one that is hiring full remote entry level.Additionally, you need to step up your confidence level. Let an employer know that your family is important to you and that you&#39;re dedicated to working hard so that you can support them- and leave it at that. They don&#39;t deserve the other details, and they aren&#39;t relevant.I hope this helps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey anon, I feel for you, and most of the answers here are giving you a 12-month plan when you need a 1-month plan.If you know Linux well enough to configure Wordpress, how about tech support for a hosting company?  Try making some short email approaches to old-school hosting companies (I used to run one).  They might be flexible enough to take a chance depending on how confident your approach is.They have lots of customers bashing away at Linux, making mistakes, often without the patience to see their own problems through.  Their business problem is that these customers need hand-holding but only pay a fixed, monthly fee.  (the hope is eventually they stop asking and keep paying for years).The combination you can offer those companies could be basic Linux knowledge (no need for advanced cloud stuff) and whatever flexibility you can offer them - especially if they&#39;re not in your time zone.The larger ones might be a tall order, all listing locations by default (Gandi, Leaseweb, GoDaddy, Hetzner etc.), but maybe someone here will have an inside track.I agree with other posters - never mention difficult circumstances in a job application, particularly a cold application.  Just talk about how keen you are to solve their difficult customers&#39; problems, how well you work in a team, and keep the initial approach brief.Good luck! And please update us if you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just an anecdote for you- in 2009, I wanted to drop out of college because I preferred partying. I obviously needed income and was dissatisfied with the jobs I’d had in the past (fast food, waiting tables and hotel customer service). Like you, I had always been a tech “nerd” and had built websites and recycled computers for my church/charities in the past. One day I came across a job post for a small SEO firm that was looking for a “web developer” aka clicking around Wordpress, writing some CSS, and writing SEO content. It paid $11/hr. I sent an email and he agreed to interview me. I must’ve charmed him because he agreed to give me a 90 day trial. It worked out and I worked for him for about 2 years before a recruiter found me and got me a job at a “real” software company on a team of 15 engineers. After a couple years there, I founded my own SaaS side business (which went viral on HN circa 2014). It grew to become much, much more than a side business and was eventually acquired by a PE firm.I just wanted to say to keep your head up, remain persistent, keep learning and stay curious. It can be done and hard work (usually) pays off.Stay flexible - even if a job doesn’t seem super relevant to your core interests you never know when it’ll come in handy later. For example, my experience in fast food gave me great insights into POS systems (which I ended up building) and my time working at a luxury boutique hotel taught me how to provide excellent customer service even in difficult situations (one time I didn’t call a customer’s room at the request wake up call time and he missed his flight- eek).Best of luck to you!Ps- just sent you an email"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I previously submitted this story a few days ago[1], where it garnered some discussion and a bit over 100 upvotes, but never made the front-page due to some down-weights in HN&#39;s algorithm. I&#39;m reposting this story at Daniel&#39;s suggestion. He agreed it deserved a second chance to break out.--I noticed that it&#39;s commonly accepted that Bloomberg&#39;s 2018 stories on the Supermicro hack were bogus, costing them a huge amount of reputational damage. However, Bloomberg stood by the stories. I&#39;m very curious to see how this one will be received. I was never quite convinced by the naysayers or the denials by the government, Apple, or Amazon. I think it&#39;s quite likely that Bloomberg will be proven right in the end, this story having been accurate but suppressed for &#34;secrecy&#34; reasons all along.Notably, one of the criticisms at the time was that Bloomberg didn&#39;t name credible sources with first-hand accounts of the events — understandably given the sensitivity. This time, it seems they have been able to do so.Either way, I&#39;m thrilled to see an outlet do original reporting and stand by their work in the face of universal condemnation. We are better off for having strong dissenting views informing us and expanding the narrative. I&#39;m finding myself increasingly distrustful of the work of journalism outlets, but this (and those gone independent on Substack) gives me hope.[1]: Previous discussion here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26112436"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its weird to see a follow-up to this that doesn&#39;t even begin to acknowledge the broad skepticism of claims except for saying that the previous push-back from the alleged targets was a drop in the bucket.I don&#39;t doubt there are highly-targeted supply chain attacks that happen at the whims of state level actors but the specifics presented by this and its previous reporting still are difficult at best to believe with the reporting as it is presented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;They shared one other trait; U.S. spymasters discovered the manipulations but kept them largely secret as they tried to counter each one and learn more about China’s capabilities.Putting aside the concerns with the believability of this particular Bloomberg article... how many legitimate security holes are ignored in software purely on the basis of &#34;the NSA figures it&#39;s NOBUS (nobody knows but us) and it&#39;d be good to use it on China?&#34; I&#39;m personally convinced that the spymasters are more worried about keeping a good stock of security holes in reserve instead of actually securing infrastructure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is mine.It is something I wrote for my own use after looking at all existing options and finding them not to my liking. This is pretty much a weekend hack, it is from 2019 and it&#39;s still close to what I need. When I have time I plan to improve keyboard support, add color tags and archiving of completed items. It will also be redone to not use localStorage and to support a remote storage option. Shared use (with 2+ instances working with the same copy of the data) is also something that I&#39;d like to do, but that&#39;s on a back burner.The Show HN post from 2019 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20077177"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s impressive that it&#39;s all in single HTML file. LocalStorage could be a limitation if you often clear your browser history though.In the same spirit of Kanban, I had built an offline-first personal Kanban app - https://brisqi.comInitially I built it for myself but I decided to put it out there for folks who were looking for an offline Kanban app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an incredible visualization! Thanks for detailing how you tiled their huge dataset too. Packing the data into RGB channels as you did is really powerful - I&#39;ve only seen this done for elevation tiles. Do you have a code link to how you&#39;re performing the cursor-brush aggregations?This seems like it could be an awesome application of an cloud-optimized geotiff (COGs) for serverless tiling. I&#39;m curious if you ran across this tech in your research?I&#39;m not sure where your project will take you, but I&#39;d encourage you to continue!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crazy to see just how dense Europe is -- I&#39;ve been a few times and always assumed I was just &#34;in the popular areas&#34;, that&#39;s why there wasn&#39;t any open land. But no, CA for instance has many swaths of &lt;1k towers at the zoom level I tried, and to find similar density in Europe required going all the way over to rural Turkey/Belarus/Ukraine region. Pretty much all of the western European countries were entirely 10k+ at that same zoom level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is incredible. I&#39;ve been wanting a piece of software to stream high quality, low latency mac audio to my iphone, so I can use my headphones wirelessly while working. I&#39;ll have to play with it more, but I was set up in mere minutes and it works at extremely low latency.The fact that this does bidirectional audio is icing on the cake; can&#39;t wait to share this with some quarantined bands.Magic, well done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll chime in with the same intense positivity. In the early days of the quarantine I set up a &#34;walk in theater&#34; on my property where I wanted friends to be able to watch the film without bothering my neighbors with a massive stereo system. The natural option was headphones and I chose between setting up an FM transmitter and trying to get everyone to buy a walkman... or... trying to come up with a network streaming solution. I found the open source implementation of VBAN and tried to write a python script to launch the server and manage finding new connections. It failed absolutely miserably and I ended up setting up an amplified audio system in the rain, much to the trouble of my neighbors also.Needless to say, I love this. The only thing that&#39;s stopping it from being truly wonderful is an Android app &lt;3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ooh this looks great! I designed a pair of nice 3D printable headphones [1] and my plan was to make them Wifi headphones so I could roam the house while listening to them. I made a battery powered raspberry pi zero with a nice DAC and set up shairport sync as an Apple Airplay device. That works fine for Spotify, but there’s instances (watching videos while walking in and out of the office) where the latency is a problem. Maybe this will work for me![1] https://github.com/tlalexander/reboot-headphones"</p>

He argues that those other media should also have the stricter disclosure requirements that current only apply to social media.The video is fairly long (about 30 minutes), but goes into a lot of the history of advertising (explicit, product placements, paid endorsements, etc) in radio, TV, and movies in order to make a thorough case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.I had a similar realization during grad school about a lot of the popular topics at the time (early 2000s). I even used to call them &#34;the hoaxes of computer science&#34;. Things like grid computing or formal methods of software engineering had a lot of resources behind them, but nobody was able to use the results. Instead, very different formats of these ideas are what took root: cloud computing and advanced type systems.&gt; the low end eats the high end: that it&#39;s good to be the &#34;entry level&#34; option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you&#39;re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling.I wish every grad student had been forced to memorize this statement. Build something useable, not clever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment really resonated with me, I found myself in this exact situation at 25, in a &#34;very prestigious and selective place&#34; for AI nonetheless. It took me a couple years to realize the smart people are just playing the game, the unsuspecting losers are &#34;playing it straight&#34; and getting endlessly frustrated. I found my balance by, frankly, taking advantage of a system that is FUBAR. Incidentally, I also took some art classes and because they were not for credit, I just flowed and drew ( https://lingxiaolingdotus.firebaseapp.com/art ). Tbh I felt more alive placing some hasty marks on paper than I ever did doing &#34;research&#34; in a lab.&#34;I&#39;m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn&#39;t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn&#39;t require the students to learn anything.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did an internship with a very profitable Swedish mobile game before the pandemic, and it was really interesting to see the doublethink: everyone knew we were making a drug, but people avoided speaking of it in that way. It was always &#34;our most engaged players readily spend on in-game items&#34;, and never &#34;the most addicted users spend money so they can continue playing&#34;It was a great workplace, but I don&#39;t think it was adding much value to the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d add that algorithmic feeds are another part of the triad (quartet?), and probably the worst offender. Personalized addictive content is on the rise (tiktok, YouTube, even Facebook and Twitter curate your newsfeed &#34;for you&#34; ), and these ml-determined feeds drive engagement to the highest possible levels, leading to an incredible waste of time, a distorted world view (mostly the posts with the highest engagement will be those that call for outrage, which leads to radicalization [1]), and just in general a society where our information consumption is determined by black boxes with opaque goals that do not optimize for the common good.I attribute a significant part of the political rift and radicalization that has occurred in the western world in the past few years to specifically this feature, the algorithmically determined, engagement maximizing, feed.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still haven&#39;t fully grasped that we reached this point of perversiveness online. We have brilliant minds and a ridiculous amount of money working on making Alabama&#39;s soccer moms click more ads, and we have reached the point of making people addicted to websites to reach that goal.Obviously this is nothing new, and the cigarette industry has been profitting off addiction for decades, but I never expected the same thing (except the very immediate threat of lung cancer) to happen to tools that could have been optimized for so much good instead.And the worst part is that some of it is just so incompetent. I&#39;ve been trying to break away from Facebook for a while, and recently (the past year or so) I started realizing that my Facebook feed always shows me the exact same posts in the exact same order for days, to the point where I know exactly what post will be first when I open the website. Where is all the Facebook money going? What are these people working on? What are they doing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazon has a problem with fake reviews and it seems they are ok with it.I bought a replacement screen from Amazon and it wasn’t working properly. I thought I did something wrong so I contacted the seller/manufacturer and they told: oh yeah, it‘s defective, we‘ll just give you your money back. I agreed and then the person said „cool, now in order to process your request, please click these buttons on Amazon” and they sent me a screenshot showing how to leave a 5 star review. wtf.I refused and asked them to process the refund. First they said they can’t process the refund technically without me pressing those buttons and then that their job depends on it.I requested a refund through Amazon and tried leaving a 1-star review saying that the product was defective and the seller tried to condition me into giving them a 5 star review. This review was not accepted by Amazon, saying that seller feedback should be given on the seller page.  This does make sense if you have multiple sellers selling the same product, but it was not the case here. These guys were the only ones producing and selling it and if the score of 5-star reviews is from people being coerced to leave a review, then it should be there, not on the seller page where it’s very easily buried.In the end I also contacted Amazon support with screenshots and I had to explain the problem 3 times as the customer representative said they didn’t understand what more can they do since I already received my refund. I’m the end, they said “they forwarded the message to the proper department, have a nice day”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon loves fake reviews as long as they are 5 star. The more it looks like people buying stuff using amazon are happy, the better that marketing is for Amazon. Look at all these people who are so happy to be buying stuff on Amazon, so much better than the alternatives.Amazon could clean this up and then watch the average drop. From the removal of the fake fives but also it makes it look more &#34;socially accpetable&#34; to leave 4 and 3 star reviews. So it costs Amazon to do the right thing by the people parting with money for stuff so they don&#39;t.Amazon are well aware of /their/ incentives and when their incentives align with what looks to me a lot like fraud they&#39;ll play the plausibly deny game.Or perhaps I&#39;m wrong they don&#39;t know and there&#39;s nothing they can do. Amazon employees will probably confirm that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the fake reviews are merely the tip of the iceberg.Over the last 5-10 years, Amazon&#39;s main shopping website seems to have gone from a reasonably reputable location to an internet cesspool to rival ebay or craigslist.For example, looking for an item one is presented with a wide variety of almost identical products from a wide variety of almost identical, completely unknown brands, with no trust or confidence in any of them.Now obviously, these brands/products are most likely nothing to do with Amazon, they&#39;re just using Amazon as their storefront, and sometimes fulfilment, but it still reflects upon Amazon, and ultimately taints their brand with the same brush.Maybe Amazon makes more money in this way, by taking a cut of this flow through various service fees, but for me it makes Amazon less useful to go to when I don&#39;t know exactly what I want already, and more often pushes me to go direct to a more trusted source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t tried SQLite, please do. For years I ignored SQLite and used MySQL (it does the job) but once you see how fast SQLite is, and advantages of having a DB contained in a single file... just go play around with SQLite instead of ignoring it for years like me. It&#39;s neat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting consequence of this characteristic of SQLite is that it makes it a really good fit for GraphQL.GraphQL has the N+1 queries problem pretty much baked into it. You can work around it to a certain extent with a lot of effort implementing data loader patterns, but someone will still likely be able to cow up with a query that triggers a cascade of SELECTs.Or, because &#34;many small queries are  efficient in SQLite&#34;, you could use that instead.I built a Datasette plugin that exposes a GraphQL API to an existing SQLite database and it works so well that I switched from being a GraphQL skeptic to a GraphQL advocate.https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/7/datasette-graphql/Here&#39;s an example nested GraphQL query that executes 32 select queries. It&#39;s pretty snappy: https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Appropriate Uses For SQLite page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:&gt; &#34;200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page&#34;&gt; &#34;For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much.&#34;&gt; &#34;[This is] bad design&#34;Funnily enough, at a recent workplace the guideline was &#34;if it only does 200 queries, you&#39;ve optimized it enough&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder how difficult it would be to implement a language for specifying Factorio factories without worrying about physical layouts. This post provides a lot of good insights into how that could be done. Once a factory is specified, a compiler could turn the high-level specification into a blueprint or a valid save file to be loaded up in the game.Of course, the compiler would have no way to lay out the factory with respect to available resource deposits. Maybe that would have to be part of the specification as well? Or maybe the programmer (player?) could pass an empty map file as a compiler argument.Also, this doesn&#39;t give any consideration to the tech tree or enemies within the game. I guess those could be compiler flags, as long as we&#39;re dreaming.Look, all I&#39;m saying is that it would be really cool to be able to check factories into version control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can definitely see the point the author is trying to make, and I agree that it naturally lends itself to a functional model of how the game works.On the other hand, and this is speaking as someone who has played the game for an embarrassing number of hours all the way into endgame &#34;megabase&#34; territory: my mental abstraction of the game isn&#39;t really functional. It&#39;s directed graphs. Sure, the two views can be equivalent representations, but I find thinking about the game as a directed graph (and reasoning about throughputs in a graph representing a network) to be the perspective that gives actionable insights most readily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Factorio is a genre-defining game, and I think the number of clones is a testament to that.Factorio is often compared to programming, but it&#39;s closer to Excel where the logic and the output live in the same space. The game does a great job letting the user build with programming-like constructs without them ever having to understand any theory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, it is horrifying to think about how much air pollution we inflict upon ourselves. It&#39;s very hard to stop even in a two-person household, because so many of the &#34;products&#34; most people in the Western world are used to buying and using since an early age are violators. I am blessed with being quite sensitive to most of them, so it&#39;s an endless struggle with partners and cohabitants.Basically anything bought new has it: furniture, clothes, cars, anything plastic, dyed, glued, particleboard.&#34;Cleaning&#34; products: sprays, detergents, most &#34;soaps&#34;, shampoos, creams, conditioners, have this type of crap in them.Even most stuff which claims to be &#34;eco-friendly&#34; is bullshit, and has all the same crap in it if you look at the ingredients.And it feels like online there is a whole army of &#34;rational scientific defenders&#34; ready to jump into action anytime I mention it. It feels like there is a whole playbook for discrediting this type of comment, and calling into question how &#34;scientific&#34; it is, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep in mind this is a meta-analysis using data published in papers that are up to 30 years old and from overseas including China, then applying it to California&#39;s carcinogen list (prop 65) and California commute times.I am sure a followup study will be done to see if this is actually a problem in the USA in 2021.The article is published here (Open access) : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202...Edit: I found this news article from 2003 discussing the issue of carcinogenic new car smells and how manufacturers were trying to eliminate the the dangerous smells while simulating what consumers expect a new car should smell like:https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15133792/new-car-smel..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So here&#39;s what I&#39;d love if other people here could help me understand.Sensitivity to VOC&#39;s is extremely dependent on the person. My father, for example, had the carpet redone cheaply in his office, and worked there happily 8 hrs/day without smelling anything and without any ill effects.For me, on the other hand, the smell was noxious but bearable, but I&#39;d start to feel lightheaded after about 15 minutes in there. My brother would get a terrible headache after just 5 minutes. (And this is us as adults, same size as him.)Memory foam (e.g. in a pillow) also affects me, even after it&#39;s offgassed for weeks. I don&#39;t smell a thing, but it gives me a burning sore throat after I&#39;m close to it for a couple of hours. But again, zero effect on my dad.And so my big question is: I&#39;m well aware that people have drastically different responses to VOC&#39;s. But does that mean VOC&#39;s harm people differently too, or are we all harmed the same?In other words, does my dad have some kind of &#34;protective&#34; genes where the VOC&#39;s don&#39;t bother him because they harm him less, so he doesn&#39;t avoid them? Or are my brother and I better off because we&#39;re super-sensitive to them, so we escape the harm he might be suffering?It seems like such an urgent public health problem, especially given how many people use memory foam mattresses and pillows. It just boggles my mind that I get a sore throat after just a couple of hours with one, while other people sleep peacefully all night."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What went wrong is that the Texas legislature which owns Texas-specific grid process to avoid interference from the Feds didn&#39;t figure out how to also ensure Texas generator companies got compensated for weatherizing (and ensuring it was done).How many of the 24+6 recommendations from the NERC/FERC review of last time this happened in Texas (hint:2011) were taken up by the legislature or those at ERCOT they delegated responsibility to or the power generation providers?https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/ColdWeatherTrainingMaterials/...The eye opener to me from skimming the 2011 recommendations is that there was no explicit rating/SLA for a power plant&#39;s acceptable temperature operating that could be used by planners for assessing the risks of an upcoming weather event by policy planners. It&#39;d seem pretty basic to be able to ask &#34;How many plants do we lose when temperature drops below X&#34;? 
 Dunno whether they fixed trying to create such a basic measurement for Texas plants, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it.If you want to know some of the specifics about what &#34;winterization&#34; means in practice for a power plant including natural gas ones, you can read some of the details in that report. It&#39;s kinda interesting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dallas suburb here (Las Colinas). No power since Monday 6am. I had to get room at holiday inn. I actually got the room yesterday, but the hotel lost power after an hour, so I had to go back home and sleep in 5 degree apartment.Don&#39;t believe anything you read about &#34;rolling outages&#34;. It&#39;s only rolling, if you define that as &#34;out until it&#39;s not freezing anymore&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The result was &#34;an electrical island in the United States,&#34; Bill Magness, CEO of ERCOT, said. &#34;That independence has been jealously guarded, I think both by policy makers and the industry.&#34;https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/02/16/texas-power-...Maybe it’s time to rethink that. 
HaI has an interesting take on something similar:  Japan 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo88zA5nq4QRunning your own grid seems cool Texas style, until you have a regional problem and have no where to turn."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this. I started laughing when I read the description. I laughed because a Harvard physicist (funded by people like Bill Gates) had the same idea to use cooling towers for their DAC project in Carbon Engineering (linked in your post). But as you say, it is still expensive. They are bragging that their design took hundred of man years!And then you two guys come in with the idea that in hindsight seems completely obvious, use all the cooling towers already out there! The most start up thing ever.I used to be an engineer at an ammonia plant. Many of them already capture and sell CO2 from their process. So they have the infrastructure to compress and sell CO2 already on site. The plant I worked at was in Augusta, GA. Might be worth checking out ammonia plants as a growth market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, smart idea to piggyback off existing infrastructure. Have you contacted Stripe Climate? They are directing money from stripe businesses to fund carbon removal, and they just put out a call for new companies to contact them.Believe I saw it within past 7-10 days on Patrick Collison’s twitter. Here’s the link. Has details and an application: https://mobile.twitter.com/orbuch/status/1359926307149148162Btw for anyone with a business using stripe: stripe climate is now open for anyone worldwide. I set it up to contribute 1% of my revenues. And it should be deductible as a marketing expense: Stripe let’s you out it on your checkout, invoice and receipt. The founder of Nomadlist found it increased his conversions. Haven’t tested it personally but plausibly it’s actually profit generating.Probably the most impactful climate decision you can make with your business, takes 30 seconds to set up, and may boost your revenue.https://stripe.com/climate"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re not injecting the CO2 underground in a stable form, how does this reverse climate change? It sounds like it&#39;s simply a cheaper option in some circumstances for sourcing CO2 from the air (compared to traditional solutions by Airgas). Not to take away from your efforts! I think this is a fine improvement to CO2 process needs if you can replace more expensive air extraction techniques, but it doesn&#39;t contribute to improving climate change without sequestering the harvested atmospheric CO2."</p>

It&#39;s like Google Product Search that is actually successful and widely used for searching for specific products, or Amazon that doesn&#39;t swindle you left and right.It&#39;s basically just a large catalog of products, filled by third-parties a-la Amazon now, only it didn&#39;t sell anything itself (until recently). Instead, it had detailed characteristics for a lot of products, with corresponding filters in the catalog; and good user reviews. Since Yandex is good at dealing with unstructured text, even poor data exports by vendors end up organized decently on the service. Since Yandex had millions of users on its other services, they all could leave reviews without much hassle. And since Yandex is primarily a search engine, it knows when a bogus review is spammed across the web.Alas, it&#39;s only available in Russian since it works with Russian shops. Every time I need to look for a product on the English web, I lament that there&#39;s no service that is quite that solid. Amazon has filters, but search results usually look like simply a bit better Aliexpress. In regard to Google Product Search I don&#39;t even know anything particular—I tried to use it a couple times, and my general impression is that it... exists. Not much else."</p>

Compared to ZigBee or Z-Wave it&#39;s wired and the config is stored in the devices themselves, so there&#39;s no single point of failure. It has strict certification requirements so you can be guaranteed that products from different manufacturers will work together (this does mean its more expensive though). The quality of the hardware (esp. motion/presence sensors) is a lot better than what you can buy from Amazon or the &#39;smart home&#39; section in your local Walmart.There&#39;s plenty of content (in German) on YouTube about it, and forums:https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCiCPbFz0Ld6mera2fNDRWzwhttps://knx-user-forum.de/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Runet (Russian-speaking part of Internet) has LOTS of it. We have HN equivalent (habr.com). We have RSDN (rsdn.org), which is somewhat like StackOverflow, but in Russian.Social networks largely unknown outside of Russia? We have&#39;em (vk.com, ok.ru). Reddit equivalent? See pikabu.ru. IMDB? See kinopoisk.ru.There&#39;s a Russian browser (Yandex.Browser), Russian map service (Yandex.maps), tons of Russian e-mail, hosting and cloud services, Russian Spotify (Yandex.Music), Russian Netflix (several of them, actually), Russian Uber (Yandex.Taxi, which actually owns Russian Uber).You&#39;ll see lots of Yandex services here, it&#39;s sort of Russian Google (except it predates Google by a year or so). Yandex&#39;s primary business is search and advertising, but just like Google, they diversify a lot. And even in primary area, they sometimes manage to beat Google. Yandex&#39;s reverse image search (when you upload the image to search for similar ones) is FAR superior to Google&#39;s.And there&#39;s a lot of unique Russian content on global sites like Facebook, Livejournal (owned by a Russian company nowadays) or Wikipedia."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found my experience designing gearboxes for Boeing has applicability to software design. For example, the fundamental idea with airplane design is not to design components that cannot fail, as that is impossible. The idea is to design the system to be tolerant of failure. Every part in the system is not &#34;how can we make this part never fail&#34; but &#34;assume it failed. How does the airplane survive?&#34;This is a fundamental shift in viewpoint.It seems pretty well established that making secure software is impossible. Time to pivot to designing software systems that are tolerant of inevitable security breaches.One example of this is compartmentalization. A single breach must not have access to all the sensitive data. Another is backups must be air gapped (or put on physically read-only media) so ransomware cannot compromise them.Compartmentalization is used in battleship design, aircraft design, spy networks, etc. Time to use it in software systems design.P.S. Just to be clear, one still strives to design airplane parts so they won&#39;t fail, it&#39;s just that one does not rely on them never failing.P.P.S. It&#39;s really really hard to sink a battleship as they are so compartmentalized. See the sinking of the Bismarck and the Yamato."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Largest impact, sure. But architecturally it was a relatively simple formula - compromise a widely used package and sleep on it until it was pervasive enough to be a valuable hack. I disagree with this being the most sophisticated though. Unless I&#39;m missing something about this hack, the Stuxnet[1] architecture, complexity, and long term planning feel far more sophisticated than the SolarWinds hack.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, it&#39;s 100% going to happen again, and it was plainly obvious it was going to happen to begin with. We did a Black Hat talk about this (checks notes) 14 years ago, after being paid by a client to audit something like 12 different agent-based management systems:https://web.archive.org/web/20061215050427/http://www.matasa...Agent-based endpoint management is super convenient and is mainstream in modern IT management. But nobody grows up wanting to write the communications software for enterprise server inventory software, so the code quality on these products, which are ubiquitous, is awful. But 99% of enterprise buyers aren&#39;t even slightly motivated by software security when making purchasing decisions, and everyone knows it, so vendors buy fig-leaf audits from vendors who will sell public-facing documents for 2p1w engagements, and IT purchasers, whose performance reviews are based on completing projects and not protecting their companies from $500,000 purchase orders for what is effectively malware, accept those bogus reviews and get on with their lives.Nothing is going to change about this, because nothing is going to alter the incentives. Reporters like Nicole Perlroth will try to blame it on ex-NSA hired guns (as if you needed the exploit chains NSA buys to break any of these systems), but I can&#39;t think of any realistic policy that could be applied to stop these kinds of attacks, not without massively disrupting the technology industry at the same time.Best get used to it, is I guess my point. I mean that sincerely, not as a sort of appeal to right the ship; the ship is already upside down."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Israel feels like the only nation taking the importance and urgency of vaccination seriously.Here in Europe, articles are coming out complaining that the slow vaccination could be harming the economy which, well, fucking duh. (https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/154626/c...)Fast rollout. Involve pharmacies. Involve the army. Distribute widely and efficiently. Prepare for months before the vaccine is here. Follow-up campaign to convince vax holdouts. A real War Effort.There&#39;s barely any calls for volunteering here in Belgium. Hospitals and vaccination centers will complain to the government that they are understaffed but you seldom hear them urgently asking for new volunteers to assign to COVID teams and vaccination centers. We spent a ton of time debating whether the social bubble should be 2 or 3 large, whether kids should be 12 or 14 before they count for it, etc etc and those spending that time were the same people who didn&#39;t prepare for the eventuality of a vaccine, and started doing so in late December.Sorry this has veered off topic. The number of articles that can be summed up to &#34;Vaccines work, are good, and israel is doing it right&#34; frustrate little european me. :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Google COVID-19 statistics for Israel show that cases and deaths are declining, but not at a faster rate than elsewhere in the world. Reported deaths lag behind sometimes for weeks and new deaths were caused by infections weeks ago, so vaccination may not have much effect on deaths, yet. But the number of positive tests should have gone down considerably with 50% of the population vaccinated. Are all these aymptomatic cases or do the is this due to part of the population not keeping any rules? Does anybody have information why the numbers are sill that high?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The vaccine has 95% efficacy in initial controlled trials. It is almost impossible to reach (within 1%) of that same level of effectiveness in the real world as claimed here. The real world has a big chunk of the population with an immune system that doesn&#39;t respond nearly as well to the vaccine (such as the elderly).Here is an overview of an Israeli study that was finding a more realistic effectiveness of 70% https://dalewharrison.substack.com/p/israeli-vaccination-dat...If anyone has a link to the actual study, please post it! It is really annoying to see news articles posted about studies that don&#39;t link to them or even provide any basic information to find the study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related fun (and sad) fact: In Norway, the tax submission forms are online and so user friendly that you don&#39;t need a tax filing program like this. Edit: Here is a link to an explanation for the form, in English, which was revamped in 2020: https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/taxes/tax-return/tax-r...The submission form is essentially a wizard that asks you questions related to your situation and your past year. Depending on your answers, it expands different parts of the form. Other parts, such as tax exempt donations are automatically filled out based on information that the recipients filled out for you.I visited the UX department of the Norwegian equivalent to the IRS (Skatteetaten), and they had almost every device you could think of (eye-tracking being the most fun). No wonder they made good forms.I understand that some people object politically to taxes, but as long as it&#39;s one of the certainties of life (death being the other), I cannot understand why filling out the submission seems so hard in most countries..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool, and I&#39;d like to encourage work like this. I currently don&#39;t think I can recommend this to others because:It isn&#39;t immediately obvious who is running the site. whois info lists a Canadian privacy company. The site doesn&#39;t have an about page. Github has contributor info, which may help. Tax returns need to be private and accurate. If it&#39;s hard to verify that the authors are even in the US, it&#39;s had to know if this is a scam.I think the project is still young, and the above is likely something addressable. Partnering with some accountants may be a way to fund further development/maintenance through referrals. Good luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Germany the official application to submit your taxes as a private person to the state has been a windows application for years. Using the app was a 1:1 copy of the official paper forms. Disregarding the complexity of the german tax law, you had a reference to the papers. So it was kind of easy to use the digital counterpart one was accustomed to.It was disimproved by hauling it into a web app, which breaks with all the usual connections you built with the paper equivalent and is the most UX unfriendly monstrosity one could create. From this year on you HAVE TO USE IT. I deeply disrespect this regression, which forces many people into paying a tax office for their private tax submission.I wish for a swedish/norwegian system, where the state courts you for YOUR money. I don&#39;t know a single person in Germany which states: &#34;I love doing my tax submissions!&#34;EDIT: Typos plus last paragraph"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve brought this up before, but I wonder if a &#34;JS constraint spec&#34; could be added to the JS standard that guarantees against this sort of (already uncommon) dynamic behavior in certain cases, so that code can be more aggressively optimized when possibleIf you&#39;re already using TypeScript to constrain your code, why couldn&#39;t it generate interpreter/compiler hints?These could take the form of a language-agnostic metadata file, similar to source maps, that optionally ships alongside the JS bundleEdit: Several people have misunderstood, so I must not have articulated this well. What I meant was not a new/stricter subset of JS that forbids certain dynamic behaviors across the board. What I&#39;m talking about is having TypeScript (or otherwise), which knows things at compile-time about how specific pieces of code are and are not called, manifest this information in a way that V8 can digest and act on directly, for that specific codebase. V8 already tries to guess this information and uses it to decide which things to optimize and how, but it&#39;s treating the JS bundle as a black box even though in many cases, an earlier stage of the pipeline already had this information on-hand and threw it away.In addition to being more granular, this (like TypeScript itself) would allow parts of a codebase to continue being fully dynamic while other parts are well-constrained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By putting the number of arguments onto the stack, we end up making the stack larger for every single function call.   We also require every access to any stack variable to do math to figure out where on the stack it&#39;s arguments are.That seems an insane overhead for the common case...  If this really does make benchmarks faster overall, it suggests an even better solution might exist out there that does not add overhead for the common case...Perhaps it might be worth keeping track of how many arguments a function is typically called with, and recompiling code for each case?    Then all the checks for argument counts can be entirely removed in the optimized code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Salary is a negotiation between parties. Looked at soberly, you&#39;re the business, your employer is your customer, and the salary they pay you is really the price you charge for your services.They have no obligation to pay more for your services than they think they have to, compared to alternatives on the market. And you have no obligation to charge less for your services than you can get from other &#34;customers&#34;. Either of you can negotiate the price up or down, and the other is free to take it or leave it.It&#39;s not about who &#34;deserves&#34; what. It&#39;s a simple negotiation, like every other business transaction.The more valuable (and less replaceable) your services are, the more pay you can successfully negotiate for. I guarantee you there are plenty of people at these &#34;location-based pay&#34; companies who&#39;ve negotiated for considerably higher pay than others in their location. Just as there are many businesses (e.g. Apple) who&#39;ve found a way to charge more for their products than their competitors have.So it&#39;s worth learning to negotiate. And, perhaps more importantly, it&#39;s worth learning to provide massive value that&#39;s hard to replace. Or accepting the tradeoffs if you choose not to.Let&#39;s say you mould your skillset to fit perfectly into a commonly-open job description: front-end software engineer. Well great, the benefit is you have lots of jobs you can apply for, so you can easily &#34;fire&#34; one company to go work at another. The downside is you&#39;re now in direct competition with a million other people who&#39;ve shaped themselves to have the same common skillset, so it&#39;s easier for companies to fire you. Competition drives prices down and makes you more easily replaceable. But it gives you some safety due to redundancy. That&#39;s often a reasonable tradeoff to make, but you should be aware you&#39;re making it. If you want the big bucks, it helps to be rarer, and to work at places and in roles where it&#39;s easier to demonstrate your value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Bangladeshi, I can tell you that the workers in my country don&#39;t have proper unions. They can&#39;t negotiate. Salary is the last thing on their minds, they can&#39;t even negotiate safe working conditions. They are uneducated, so they don&#39;t know what they deserve. See here -&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Dhaka_garment_factory_fir...So, the cheap stuff that you&#39;re getting is because someone is getting a super bad deal, by exploiting the heck out of workers. Same in China.The garments factory owners are walking away with tonnes of money, leaving the workers high and dry.The more _subtle_ point that the author is making, is that, &#34;wait, if people realize that they can get awesome developers in developing nations for a lower price, I&#39;m not going to get hired any more in my over-priced city&#34;.Good, move to a place where your salary is worth more, and work to enrich that community. Why should SF and NY get all the benefits of economic growth?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re running a remote company, there&#39;s another reason (besides fairness) that location-based pay is a bad idea: it makes it harder to create a compensation structure that incentivizes high performance.If Person A is outperforming Person B, but is getting paid less because they happen to live somewhere else, you lose the ability to claim that you compensate people for performance without sounding like you&#39;re talking out of both sides of your mouth. Not only is Person A not going to be happy about that, Person A is not going to believe that compensation at your company is based on performance.Companies that want to hire and incentivize the best people need to be congruent in their messaging around compensation and performance. Claiming that compensation is performance-based and then including a factor (location) that has no bearing on performance is incongruent and will not help to develop the right culture in this regard."</p>

One would think that &#34;functional programming&#34; _is_ using those functions. That FP is all about Iterators and what things you can do with them.But I never see contrived real-world examples, those that really show how things are different from imperative or procedural programming. I want to see how you use stateless functional programming to control a garage door actuator. Or how you model a Car which can have their doors open or closed either by the class itself or external actors. How do you receive UDP packets, including a buffer implementation that is able to sort out-of-order packets and send retransmission requests for missing ones?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you read the trial data this is a foregone conclusion. The Moderna vaccine produces antibody titres over twice as high as an actual infection from the data I&#39;ve seen.My theory is that these companies knew they only had one chance to make a working vaccine, so they did everything they could to make it not fail. Double doses, 5x what was needed in monkeys, gold standard adjuvants.I would not be amazed in the slightest if they decide to half-dose the vaccine or do away with the second shot or even both. They probably didn&#39;t have time to run the trial any other way"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many people in the comments are just certain that more money wouldn&#39;t have made any difference to vaccine production, and that economic considerations had nothing to  do with it. The arguments they make fail to simple comparison tests:&#34;If we paid Tesla 2x as much per car, could they really not produce more cars?&#34;They also fail to privileging the status quo - &#34;If we paid Tesla half as much money, would they produce fewer cars?&#34;Obviously, they would. Money influences how easily they can produce cars.  At the margin there must be decisions related to turning money into efficiency every day. And the same thing must apply for vaccines.  The best vaccine expert in the world asked for a yearly sabbatical - 200k wasn&#39;t enough to keep them.  Double that to 400k?  Oh actually it can wait til next year.The question for people who deny money&#39;s ability to produce more vaccines is: why do you admit that any lower price for a vaccine would reduce supply - but you deny that any higher price would increase supply.  What magic is this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The results in Figure 3 are certainly promising. Has anyone been able to find the mentioned supplementary material though?&gt; A post-hoc exploratory analysis of immunogenicity in subgroups of participants aged ≥55-&lt;65, ≥65-74 and ≥75 years was performed (Tables S6 and S7). Increases in levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike bAb and nAb at days 29 and post-second vaccination at both the 50 and 100 ug doses were generally comparable across the age subgroups and with those observed in the younger (18-55 years) study participants. Seroconversion rates were also comparable across the age groups and with those in the younger participants. It should be noted that the small size of the ≥75 year-old subgroup (n=22) precludes definitive conclusions to be made.There doesn&#39;t seem to be any link to supplementary material at either the Elsevier page [1] nor the NIH page [2]. The clinical trial registration [3] suggests that there was an update just a few days ago, so perhaps they&#39;re just waiting to upload a new PDF?[1] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2...[2] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7871769/[3] https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04405076"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great response, in my opinion. Succinctly and effectively points out what was wrong with the NYT article, then tries to move on. Somewhat more of a sober tone than Scott&#39;s typical writing, but still with a dash of his typical wit:&gt; I don’t want to accuse the New York Times of lying about me, exactly, but if they were truthful, it was in the same way as that famous movie review which describes the Wizard of Oz as: “Transported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first person she meets and then teams up with three strangers to kill again.”I have only gained respect for Scott, and lost respect for the NYT, throughout this while saga. Hopefully this is the end of it.Edit: in the spirit of moving on, here are two of my favorite articles since his return, one enlightening, one funny:&#34;WebMD, And The Tragedy Of Legible Expertise&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/webmd-and-the-tragedy-...&#34;List of Fictional Cryptocurrencies Banned By The SEC&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/list-of-fictional-cryp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Steven Pinker maybe says it best, in a thread where he links to some notable SSC posts:A typical essay by Scott Alexander is deeper, better reasoned, better referenced, more original, and wittier than 99% of the opinion pieces in MSM. It&#39;s sad that the NYT can see him only through the lens of their standard political &amp; cultural obsessions.Perhaps Alexander&#39;s ultimate virtue is epistemic humility: His pieces are long, sometimes inconclusive, and accompanied by diverse commentary because he&#39;s committed to his own fallibility and lack of omniscience.  We should all live by such standards.https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1360787817459253251"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The NYT article[1] can hardly be called a hit piece at all, considering how little &#39;dirt&#39; it actually contains.What is telling however is the lengths to which they went to connect Scott to anything negative at all.Look at how they &#39;connect&#39; him to Peter Thiel for instance: Scott is a prominent figure in a loose group of &#34;Rationalists&#34;. Some rationalists are concerned about AI. Some people who are concerned about AI also donated to MIRI. Guess who also donated to MIRI? Peter Thiel!The author then goes on to rattle off a bunch of other names who are in turn connected to Peter Thiel in some ways.Like... really?I just can&#39;t figure out why that paragraph should even be the article. Speaking of which, what is that article even about? If there&#39;s supposed to be some story or thread stringing it together, I can&#39;t see it.It&#39;s essentially:1. He deleted his blog.2. Here&#39;s a list of unrelated things people he may know have done.3. He now has a new blog.Cool story, NYT.[1]: https://archive.is/b1tyQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat concept.  Exploring the difference between what successfully compiles vs. what won&#39;t seems like a great way of getting more familiar with the language.I&#39;ve written a little over 1,000 lines of Zig at this point and I really like it.  I think its key feature is a rich compile-time imperative programming environment (&#34;comptime&#34;).  If you can have full compile-time imperative code execution, you can get a lot of the benefits of more complicated language features (like C++ templates) &#34;for free.&#34;In C++ templates are &#34;a language within a language&#34;, but even templates with all their complexity cannot solve all of the problems you might want to solve at compile-time, so C++ has been gradually expanding its compile-time code execution features so that more and more of the language is available at compile-time (constexpr, consteval, etc). Zig jumps straight to the finish line by making most of the language available at compile-time from the outset, and in doing so avoids the need to add the complexity of templates in the first place.Having &#34;slices&#34; as a first class type feels like a general and powerful solution to the problems that std::string_view and std::span are trying to solve.I am comparing Zig to C++ a lot, which many Zig fans would probably take exception to as Zig does not aspire to be a better C++, but rather a better C.  Indeed many key C++ patterns like RAII are explicitly out of scope.  But to me Zig bridges the gap between C and C++ by solving many of the problems that make C feel too spartan without jumping to the incredible complexity of C++.There are a few things about Zig that give me pause.  I&#39;ve noticed that compile-time feels like a very lazy environment, meaning that functions do not seem to undergo full semantic analysis unless they are called from somewhere.  You can write a function that compiles successfully, leading you to believe the function is syntactically and semantically coherent, only to find that when you add an actual call to that function, the compiler now flags errors inside that function.  This adds some friction to development, because the act of writing a function is no longer a self-contained activity.  Writing the function feels more like sketching it; later when you actually call it you have a new set of compile errors to contend with.I also miss tools like ASAN to catch memory errors.  I&#39;m guessing things like that will come with time.Overall I feel very positive on Zig."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heh fun: this was inspired by Rustlings, which in turn was inspired by NodeSchool.Mozilla Berlin used to host NodeSchool and the Rust Hack &amp; Learn evenings. It became a bit of a hang spot, and at some point we had a pretty consistent group of folks who&#39;d go to both. Marisa realized Rust could use something similar to NodeSchool, and started hacking on Rustlings during these evenings — which now a few years later has really taken off!It&#39;s really cool to now see other languages in turn be inspired and follow from Rustlings ^^"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when GTA 3 came out on PC and I found just a simple human-readable text file you could edit to modify all the settings for all the cars.We turned the Karuma into a physics defying monster. It was 1000x heavier than the tank, so as you drove down the road other cars just bounced off and flew over the horizon, or exploded on impact.Yet it still did 0-100 in 0.1 seconds and could drive up walls.One time we jumped it from the third island, over the middle island and landed on a skyscraper roof on the 1st island.From there we spent about an hour dropping grenades on police cars and the army who had no way to reach us up there.Fun times.

We could really use someone with how to optimize OpenGL (especially on the pi).- physics have always been wonky beyond 30fps.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am not surprised that the cost of context switching due to I/O readiness can often be roughly equal between async tasks and kernel threads. Normal blocking I/O can be surprisingly efficient because of various factors, such as a reduced need for system calls.Think about it this way—if you have a user-space thread which wakes up due to I/O readiness, then this means that the relevant kernel thread woke up from epoll_wait() or something similar. With blocking I/O, you call read(), and the kernel wakes up your thread when the read() completes. With non-blocking I/O, you call read(), get EAGAIN, call epoll_wait(), the kernel wakes up your thread when data is ready, and then you call read() a second time.In both scenarios, you’re calling a blocking system call and waking up the thread later.Of course, there are scenarios when epoll_wait() returns multiple events, which reduces the number of context switches. But the general result is that it’s not always easy to beat blocking I/O and kernel threads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; People often see that there&#39;s some theoretical benefit of async and then they accept far less ergonomic coding styles and the additional bug classes that only happen on async due to accidental blocking etc... despite the fact that when you consider a real-world deployed application, those &#34;benefits&#34; become indistinguishable from noise. However, due to the additional bug classes and worse ergonomics, there is now less energy for actually optimizing the business logic, which is where all of the cycles and resource use are anyway, so in-practice async implementations tend to be buggier and slower.I disagree with this. I feel like using Async programming is actually much more powerfull and expressive than theaded programming, especially with Rust combinators on streams of futures (for examples: futures_unordered), which allow to trivially express complex concurrency patterns (such as: wait for the first two requests to return something and discard the third request&#39;s response, and btw also cancel that request). Async programming also allows for structured programming, where each task is an owned resource of a parent tasks, which means that lifetimes of tasks can be controlled and runaway threads can&#39;t exist (if one is avoiding tokio::spawn). I&#39;ve been developping [Garage](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage) for some time now (a simple distributed object store that implements a subset of S3, not ready for production!), and I&#39;ve been in awe about how easy it was to write these complex patterns using async Rust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The throughput increase in I/O scenarios with many tasks is due to the number of supported concurrent processes and Little&#39;s law; it has little to do with context switching time, which has a negligible impact on the throughput in these use-cases: https://inside.java/2020/08/07/loom-performance/Low context switch latency only matters when the number of tasks is very small (their data all fits in the cache), and the workload is entirely computational. Otherwise, even the fastest implementation is ~60 ns, which is the cost of a cache-miss, and the compiler can&#39;t optimise things into a simple goto because the dispatch goes through a scheduler that has a megamorphic call-site.So memory is much more important for I/O use-case throughput, and while it is true that the kernel doesn&#39;t commit the full stack memory on thread creation, it&#39;s misleading to think that you get good memory usage. For one, once the memory is committed, it&#39;s never uncommitted (although it can be paged out). For another, the granularity is that of a page, i.e. at least 4K, which can often be much higher than what a task requires.&gt; It is hard to pin down exactly how the alleged advantages would arise.For I/O use-cases the answer is here:&gt; the async version uses about 1/20th as much memory as the threaded version.This could translate to 20x throughput -- due to Little&#39;s law -- although usually less because there are other limits, like network saturation."</p>

So why should someone&#39;s education be tied to their school district or teacher quality?I would love to have the local school system provide lab space, athletics, support services and one-on-one tutoring as necessary.But the bulk should be delivered online.  Sal Khan is comprehensive and brilliant, but perhaps someone out there is better at chemistry or art history.  Regardless, every kid should be exposed to the &#34;best&#34; teacher of the subject.  Why should a child&#39;s Algebra education be school or teacher dependent, when the best Algebra teacher on the planet is just 256kb/s away."</p>

In a couple of hours, you should be able to see all of the posts ever made to: comp.lang.c group over at my Usenet Archives:Here it is, enjoy:
https://usenetarchives.com/threads.php?id=comp.lang.c&amp;y=0&amp;r=...BTW. I just reworked entire architecture of the site, which unfortunately  also means I have to re-synchronize over 1 billion posts back into the archive.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some fun comp.lang.c history:Dennis Ritchie posted, sharing an extremely early version of a C compiler. Richard Heathfield (well known C book author) jokingly chided Ritchie for posting something off-topic, as it was not part of ANSI C. In typical Usenet fashion, this triggered a huge thread, arguing over the appropriateness of the joke. Even Linus Torvalds got involved.Apparently Heathfield emailed Ritchie privately to apologize, and Ritchie&#39;s response is well known to anyone in clc: &#34;Usenet is a strange place.&#34;Original thread: https://groups.google.com/g/alt.folklore.computers/c/wbzzoyS...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fundamental challenge of GUIs is that they have state as a core concern. Unlike most systems, state is not an implementation detail that can be refactored away. It is central to the problem domain. The end user sees and cares about having a stateful system.The hardest part of dealing with state in a complex system is maintaining consistency in different places. Some instances of this this can be avoided by creating single-sources-of-truth, but in other cases you can&#39;t unify your state, or you&#39;re dealing with an external stateful system (like the DOM), and you have no choice but to find a way to keep separate pieces of state in sync.I should probably write a blog post on this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is my personal opinion on it (not sure if it&#39;s the right one, though): Write the GUI independently of the model, let the GUI components update and communicate among each other as they like, and perform some validation in these GUI components. Translate between model and view only at one well-defined point at which there is also a final validation at the model side, and make sure model and view are only loosely coupled.Good GUIs have way too many requirements to be controlled (via a controller) by the model. As a typical example, the fact that a button should only be activated if there is data in a textbox has usually nothing to do with the underlying model. The model should only ever contain valid and consistent data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great discussion on the challenges of designing UI for complex applications.In the aggregate, what ends up being most effective for me, is rapid prototyping, and “paving the bare spots.”[0]I find that I do a terrible job of predicting user mental models.The rub with prototypes, is that they can’t be lash-ups, as they inevitably end up as ship code. This means that a lot of good code will get binned. It just needs to be accepted and anticipated. Sometimes, I can create a standalone project for code that needs to go, but I still feel has a future.So there’s always a need for fundamental high quality.What has been useful to me, is Apple’s TestFlight[1]. I write Apple software, and TestFlight is their beta distribution system.I start a project at a very nascent stage, and use TestFlight to prototype it. I use an “always beta” quality approach, so the app is constantly at ship quality; although incomplete.It forces me to maintain high quality, and allows all stakeholders to participate, even at very early stages. It’s extremely motivating. The level of enthusiasm is off the charts. In fact, the biggest challenge is keeping people in low orbit, so they don’t start thinking that you are a “WIZZARD” [sic].It also makes shopping around for funding and support easy. You just loop people into the TestFlight group. Since the app is already at high quality, there’s no need for chaperones or sacrifices to The Demo Gods.I like that it keeps development totally focused on the actual user experience. They look at the application entirely differently from me.[0] https://littlegreenviper.com/miscellany/the-road-most-travel...[1] https://developer.apple.com/testflight/"</p>

I built something to upload markdown via ftp and copy a url with the filename as an argument to the clipboard.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminded - I noticed a while ago that being a computer science guy makes me think differently about physical storage and retrieval.For example - my wife likes &#34;shorts&#34; to be in one drawer and &#34;t-shirts&#34; in another. I like for one drawer to be &#34;workout clothes&#34; and have the mix of gym shorts and t-shirts. To me this feels &#34;obviously&#34; right because the use-case requires both items so why pay for two costly &#34;open drawer&#34; IOs?Similarly, she is very organized with her paper files, I just throw mine into a box. In the rare event I need something (eg when doing taxes) I don&#39;t mind scanning through the whole mess. Seems like a better strategy than making each &#34;write&#34; costly (neatly organizing) since writes are frequent and reads are rare.Anyone else like that?"</p>

After all, given that the NYT was now so much a part of the story, writing anything good would be pretty hard.But no, kudos to them, they found a third way: Just write a poorly written article that alternates between interjecting disconnected ideas and making vague attempts at guilt by association, and carefully ignore anything inconvenient.&gt; He denounced the neoreactionaries, the anti-democratic, often racist movement popularized by Curtis Yarvin. But he also gave them a platform. His “blog roll” — the blogs he endorsed — included the work of Nick Land, a British philosopher whose writings on race, genetics and intelligence have been embraced by white nationalists.So he denounced the works of one person who believes bad things, but he also linked to a second person, who may or may not believe bad things, but is liked by a third group of people who also believe bad things, so...logically...that must mean he actually does...support the first person? Despite denouncing them, because he didn&#39;t link to them, which proves...something...?It feels weird even writing this argument down. If you link to someone who supports X, then you&#39;re actually supporting every other person who has ever supported X?

He divides political views into quadrants, Competitive/Collective vs Optimistic/Pessimistic, then says &#34;The only public figure I can think of in the [Collective + Pessimistic quadrant] with me is Charles Murray.&#34; This is what is described as aligning himself with Murray.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Some types in Rust have specific limitations on what is considered a valid value, which may not cover the entire range of possible memory values. We call any remaining invalid value a niche, and this space may be used for type layout optimizations. For example, in Rust 1.28 we introduced NonZero integer types (like NonZeroU8) where 0 is a niche, and this allowed Option&lt;NonZero&gt; to use 0 to represent None with no extra memory.I didn&#39;t know about this, and it&#39;s super cool. It&#39;s part of a broader pattern where the rigid constraints Rust can impose on code allow both the compiler and the user to do things that would be wildly dangerous in a less-strict language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t use Rust often (sadly), but I really appreciate its goals and its steady progress. I read every one of these Rust 1.x stories on HN. Around Christmas I made an n-player chess clock with Rust and websockets [0] (because my friends are really slooow Agricola players :-), and it was incredibly easy compared to my first projects 5 years ago. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been that long. So thank you to all the folks working on it, and also thank you to everyone helping out 5-year newbies like me. Especially steveklabnik, I think you&#39;ve helped me personally several times. :-)[0] https://github.com/pjungwir/multiclock"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been doing Rust for a while now, but this is the first time I&#39;ve heard about the niche concept[1]. Sounds really useful.I know that other languages have subranges or refinement types but niches seem to solve a different problem - namely to use the &#34;holes&#34; in a data type for optimization. Does any other language have some comparable concept to niches in Rust?"</p>

Have contact with relatives &#34;on the ground&#34;.My own experience: Don&#39;t ever trust the Chinese government on issues that could potentially involve the reputation of the party. Note that I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t trust what CCP says, ever (sometimes they actually do good things) - just not on issues that involve anything to do with how the world might perceive them.Which is exactly what this issue is about.That&#39;s not to say we have compelling evidence that this was a lab virus, either. I think, for me, it&#39;s a, &#34;we don&#39;t know, but I wouldn&#39;t be shocked at all if it was a lab virus&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know whether SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab. But if it did, then not only is it probably not the first lab-origin pandemic, but it&#39;s also not the first time the WHO initially excluded that possibility.The 1977 Russian Flu pandemic was genetically near-identical to a strain from 1950, without the expected mutations that should have appeared after 27 years of undetected circulation among humans or animals. It&#39;s been widely suspected in mainstream literature to have escaped from a research or vaccine manufacturing accident, to the point that the NEJM casually wrote:&gt; The reemergence was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source in the setting of waning population immunity to H1 and N1 antigenshttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra0904322But at the time, the WHO said:&gt; Laboratory contamination can be excluded because the laboratories concerned either had never kept H1N1 virus or had not worked with it for a long time.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2395678/pdf/bul...And it&#39;s absolutely bizarre to me that people are asking why the origin even matters. After thousands of people died in Bhopal, did it matter whether better chemical safety standards could have prevented that? So with millions dead now, how could you possibly not wonder whether our current standards for the sampling and manipulation of poorly-understood pandemic-candidate viruses are adequate?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All the overthinking on motivations here is entertaining :)Disclosure: I&#39;m the Googler that got this funded. The process was roughly:- We have some extra budget at the end of the year! What are some ways we can spend this to get results while giving back to OSS?- Hey PSF, do you have any ideas for what you could do with some funding?- Looks good to me!We&#39;re just getting started, but we&#39;re working on ways to make this all more sustainable, scalable, and less ad-hoc.If you have ideas here, please reach out! I&#39;m dlorenc at google dot com, or join in the OpenSSF (openssf.org)!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to try and raise funds for the UK pycon (I was very bad at it) and my biggest takeaway was that most devs were infavour of their company forking over some cash, but &#34;charity&#34; was a tough sell internally.  The best results was selling &#34;booths&#34; at the conference.  But that had more cost to the sponsor than just the cash we asked for.I have been mulling on Something that makes it less charity - purchasing a &#34;not really support&#34; option.  This might be a annual membership, in return for which you get ... early access to annual roadmap pdf.  Or an online video from the main devs explaining what they are doing for five minutes (#)What if there existed something to Make the above easy and simply to do - a small foundation who&#39;s job is to keep membership rolls and accept payments from companies on behalf of any foss project that signs up (it&#39;s something I imagine patreon could offer). They then ensure that the (minimal contract) is adhered to in some manner.(#) Seriously - you could set up a zoom call with 1-5 devs and just hit record once a year - I promise that 99% will see this as unbearable imposition and then talk for two hours.  And that&#39;s &#34;actionable paid insights into the future of this tool we depend on&#34;So the point being, if your FOSS project gets traction, then sign up to this foss-patreon, tell everyone to click to subscribe and you might might get a sponsor or two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people here are accusing Google of embrace, extend, and extinguish, but you have to realize that the incentives here are different from Big Tech&#39;s point of view. I&#39;d first like to point out Python is a programming language, not an internet standard or file format. It gets its utility merely from the ability to develop in it, even without an established ecosystem or network effect. The barrier to jump in, or fork off and start over is far lower compared to a browser or file format.So what&#39;s in it for Big Tech? Well, in a situation where controlling the technology or suppressing it is difficult due to the low costs of starting over, it is in their best interest to promote the ecosystem rather than control it. When they put in the time, money, and engineers to make it better the return on investment can be massive, because of the help they get from the community to grow, maintain, and keep compatible this core component at less cost than if they did it themselves.The incentives align and benefit everyone, especially if there is a fair governance system mediating between all parties involved. The biggest threat to an open source project is therefore not Big Tech collaboration, but project abandonment and lack of maintenance. I hope this makes everyone a little more optimistic about the direction of open source, especially as companies realize the real value it can have for all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The argument of specialist vs generalist is futile. They simple fit in distinct parts of the journey and evolution of a software product.Generalists are highly valuable for many types of orgs and projects especially nascent projects. But sometimes you need the precise output of a specialist to achieve something.If my business has a product that is highly dependent of let&#39;s say OpenGL, then an OpenGL specialist will generate more specific output that someone who knows a little of OpenGL and a lot of other things.However, there&#39;s always the counterargument that generalists can compensate with their holistic view and understanding of problems throughout the whole stack. I understand this and agree with it, but I think there&#39;s a point in every innovation where the generalist contribution declines sharply. And I&#39;m saying this as a generalist.If you are a generalist and you feel undervalued, you&#39;re likely in the wrong project or too involved in phases of a project where your contribution can&#39;t move the needle significantly anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my career, I have met exactly one short fat engineer with &gt;5yrs of exp that I was impressed by. That person is now a Product Manager at a FAANG company (albeit PM-ing highly technical stuff).I bring this up because I think there is a very good analogy to the point that the author is making and the distinction between PM and Engineers. Broadly put, PM&#39;s are good at figuring out the theta, and Engineers are good at the r.I think that with the perspectives that short fat engineers have, they can play enormous roles as &#34;PM&#34; or &#34;Engineering Manager&#34;, and definitely as ICs during early stages of startups. But they clearly don&#39;t enjoy depth, and this can be counter-productive for that 1% of the time where you really, really want depth.I don&#39;t buy the knowledge vs wisdom thing though, there&#39;s plenty of wisdom to be gained from going deep into a subject. I&#39;d actually claim that wisdom can only come from depth - though what depth means is different for different roles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Chick Corea was a god.I learned Spain on the bass in the hopes that one day I could play my meager rendition for him. In a concert at SFJazz he picked people out of the audience to paint their portraits with his piano. How lucky was I to be placed upon such a seat where Chick dismembered me with his eyes, eviscerating my soul upon a platter. He stared at me with the eyes of a musician who had searched heaven and hell for the most tempestuous chordal mixtures. The two minutes I spent in that seat where he painted my portrait with his keystrokes are some of the most treasured moments of my life. I felt like I had been seen, chewed up, devoured, and reincarnated as the everloving Chick Corea sycophant I had always known myself to be.The man was a goddamn monster on the boards and we are all at a loss with his passing. Rest in Power Chick, you&#39;re in my heart forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The night I turned 18 I was drinking with Chick Corea.
It happened that in 1995 he had a classical music project involving some local orchestra musicians in Modena, Italy, where I was living at the time. One of the musicians was a friend of mine&#39;s brother who invited me to the dress rehearsal in a renaissance villa. Concert was good.After the concert, I got introduced to him and he asked me if I liked it. Shortly after I was drinking with him and others, and I turned 18 right there.:)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a huge fan of Chick Corea; he is my favorite jazz pianist.  I was saddened to hear this news this afternoon.  My very first jazz album outside of smooth jazz was “My Spanish Heart,” which was my introduction to jazz fusion.  I then discovered Return to Forever and the Elektric Band, and I also learned about Chick Corea’s post-bop work.  Chick Corea’s music has been a mainstay in my life for the past 15 years.  I love the playfulness of his piano playing and his compositions, which I feel is missing in a lot of music.  He has helped inspire me to play: I received an electronic wind instrument (EWI) for Christmas that I’ve been practicing.The jazz community lost a legend.  RIP Chick Corea."</p>

(maybe I am too cynical...).Overall, this is a fantastic index to some very interesting resources.There&#39;s an old saying that you learn more from failure than from success (whose analogue is a blogpost with a title &#34;look how easy it is to set up k8s in 15 minutes at home!&#34;).

During this ongoing process, my father, who’d been receiving chemotherapy treatments passed away.Being the “technical one” it fell to me to manage his various accounts. I logged into his gmail from the same browser I’d used LinkedIn, and started to contact people he knew but was out of touch with.The next day, I started receiving email, from my dead father, from LinkedIn. Claiming he’d just joined the service and wanted to connect to me.I still don’t have the words for this, years later.What exactly is wrong with these folks at LinkedIn? They seem like caricatures of actual humans to me now, and I no longer even bother to visit the site.If anything positive comes from cancel-culture, canceling LinkedIn would be my preference."</p>

This has been so helpful because any time an app wants to do anything with my address book, I assume that they will do the dumbest, most embarrassing thing possible.Also, I used to have the “I don’t care if people see what I do setting” turned on, because why not. Then LinkedIn started emailing people because I moused over their post and stuff. Some contact emailed me to ask what I needed from her and it was so weird.

I had high hopes at the beginning that S4TF - and the investment in Swift from Google - would help Swift break out of the iOS ghetto and cement it as a mainstream language.Swift&#39;s a delightful language to use.  It has a lot of the nice things about Rust&#39;s type system, but is a heck of a lot easier to use at the expense of a bit of performance.  For a lot of use cases, I think this is a great value proposition.  ML/data science is a great example where practitioners could benefit from a more grown-up type system than what Python has on offer, but would still be able to keep low level details at arms length.I think Serverless would be another ideal use-case for Swift, where the productivity, clarity and correctness tools it offers would be a huge benefit.Some very interesting things came out of the S4TF project - like the work on autodiff, and python interop.  It&#39;s a shame the project never really seemed to get legs, it seems like it just languished for years with no clear direction.These days I do most of my work in Rust, and I&#39;m happy to do so because the tooling, community, and ecosystem is really amazing.  But there are a lot of language concepts and features I miss from swift.  I guess it goes to show that the governance and availability of a language have a lot more to do with adoption than the merits of the language itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back when I was doing a lot of Swift programming, this seemed like such a great idea. Since then I moved on to Julia. And when I looked at the ML code for Swift and compared it to Julia, I was thinking &#34;How on earth could anyone think this was ever a good idea?&#34;Doing machine learning stuff in Julia is simply much more user friendly than doing the same in Swift. Swift is nice for iOS development, but I think in data science and Machine Learning Julia will always be a much better choice.It is a pity Google did not go for Julia. Julia has gotten exceptionally far despite limited resources. With Google style resources, Julia could have been massive.Despite modest investment, the Julia JIT beats almost anything out there. It would have been amazing to see what they could have pulled off if they had put the kind of resources that was put into the JavaScript V8 JIT into the Julia JIT.Julia uses a method JIT, which are quick to implement, but which makes latency gets bad. Meaning if you load a whole new package, running the first function can cause some delay. With a JavaScript style tracer JIT added into the mix one could have probably managed to have both high performance and low latency.Alternatively with more investment they could have had better precompile caching, meaning libraries that had been loaded in the past would JIT really fast. Julia does that today, but it could have worked a lot better than it currently does. It isn&#39;t that it can&#39;t be done, but it just requires resources."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"S4TF lost out, not to Python, but to Python&#39;s AI/ML ecosystem -- people, projects, libraries, frameworks.Despite its many shortcomings, Python has become the lingua franca of AI and ML, to the point that whenever I come across a newly published AI or ML paper that I find interesting, I expect to be able to find code implementing it in Python.For example, yesterday I saw a post on HN about approximating self-attention matrices in transformers, which have O(n²) computational cost, with a seemingly clever approach that has O(n) computational cost: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26105455 . &#34;Huh, that looks interesting,&#34; I thought, &#34;let me see if I can find some code.&#34; Three clicks later, I found myself at https://github.com/mlpen/Nystromformer -- the official implementation... in Python. A few moments later, I was playing with this thingamajiggy. No other language comes close to having this kind of ecosystem in AI and ML.Julia still has a shot at becoming a viable alternative to Python, especially if the Julia developers can shorten the &#34;time to first interactive plot&#34; to make it as fast as Python&#39;s, but they face an uphill battle against such an entrenched ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to say turbo tax wasn&#39;t that bad, and that free filing was easy if you just ignored their promises to save you money if you upgraded.Last year however I got all the way to the end of the process where they revealed I made too much and had to pay. That felt extremely unethical, as the information required to come to that conclusion was available far earlier in the process.And yet what am I going to do but use turbo tax again. The perceived risk and effort of using a non-automated system to fill them out doesn&#39;t seem worth the cost."</p>

Glad to see people find our work interesting thus far.We also encourage anyone interested to play with the linked Google Colabs [1][2] and read the other articles in the Distill thread. In the Colabs you&#39;ll find a bunch more pre-trained textures as well as a workflow to train on your own images, plus some of the scaffolding to recreate figures.[1] https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-research/self...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been involved in many web scraper jobs over the past 25 years or so. The most recent one, which was a long time ago at this point, was using scrapy. I went with XML tools for controlling the DOM.It&#39;s worked unbelievably well. It&#39;s been running for roughly 5 years at this point. I send a command at a random time between 11pm and 4am to wake up an ec2 instance. It checks its tags to see if it should execute the script. If so, it does so. When it&#39;s done with its scraping for the day, it turns itself off.This is a tiny snapshot of why it&#39;s been so difficult for me to go from python2 to python3. I&#39;m strongly in the camp of &#34;if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One tip I would pass on when trying to scrape data from a website, start by using wget in mirror mode to download the useful pages. It&#39;s much faster to iterate on scraping the data once you have it locally. Also, less likely to accidentally kill the site or attract the attention of the host."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m really tired of how much phone-home Apple products do these days.  At this point I don&#39;t even put a SIM in my phones any longer, and only permit them access via a travel router (which does have a SIM, for LTE backhaul) which runs a VPN client and on which I have root to inspect/block traffic.  My latest blog post shows the dozens of dozens of connections that a Mac running Big Sur will make just sitting idle at the desktop on a fresh install.Apple&#39;s products are only private if you want privacy from their commercial competitors. If you want privacy from Apple or the US federal government to which they provide tons of user data (without warrants(!) or due process), you&#39;re in for a constant uphill battle.Using everyday devices should not be creating hardware-serial-linked permanent records that the state can download at any time; to me that&#39;s stuff of a true dystopia.Apple has not yet integrated this viewpoint, and seem to regard privacy as only important against companies that aren&#39;t Apple.  Device backups (full message history and attachments), as well as Photos stored in iCloud, are not end to end encrypted permitting Apple (and by extension the state) to read and access all of it without your involvement.It&#39;s a bummer they&#39;re extending this attitude to browser-related traffic too. There seems to be a new trend inside of Apple that they&#39;re still figuring out here (see also: the addition of ContentFilterExclusionList in 11.0, and then its quick removal in 11.2).Did you know that if you entirely block access to all Apple hosts, you can&#39;t even add a Gmail account to an iPhone?"</p>
