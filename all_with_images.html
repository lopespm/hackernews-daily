								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s a really powerful article, and it’s hard to argue with any of it. What a nightmare it must be to have what happened to Amanda Knox happen to you. A totally innocent person, who was not only imprisoned for years for a crime she had nothing to do with, but also had her name dragged in the mud by the global press for years. To such an extent that most casual observers still think she had something to do with the crime.It’s clear that the filmmakers have no legal obligation to Knox (and she acknowledges as much in the article), but I think it is equally clear that they have a moral obligation to not slander her using a thinly veiled fictional character.It’s a shame too, because the real “Amanda Knox saga” would make for a much more interesting movie: what is it like to have your roomate murdered, your life destroyed, and your identity robbed from you by the global tabloid press? That’s the real Amanda Knox story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fascinating article.  I thought she was exaggerating when she complained about people accusing her of being a media whore, until I scrolled down to the [flagged] [dead] and saw someone doing just that.But I don&#39;t think she has a choice.  In the past, it would&#39;ve been possible for someone in her shoes to choose obscurity.  In the past, the real Amanda Knox and the idea of Amanda Knox that exists in the collective unconscious of the media and media consumers would&#39;ve drifted apart.  Now, it&#39;s hard to imagine how that could happen.  Even if she invented a new identity and moved to a small town in Alaska (which would be a new kind of prison sentence in some ways), it&#39;d be newsworthy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to me how the truth got lost, and how uninterested people are in the aftermath.  The real killer ended up with a sentence almost half the length of what Amanda Knox got.  And he is already out of prison.  Italy&#39;s justice system is very different from the US&#39;s, for better or worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m torn badly with Amazon. After read The Everything Store, and what has been written all over the place, Jeff Bezos is a massive turd. Employees are horribly treated, wages suppressed, and all sorts of terrible and abusive practices.Then it comes time for me to buy something. I needed a new pair of size 14 sneakers. I drove to Adidas, Footlocker, dicks, and a few other stores but I just couldn’t justify $100 sneakers that didn’t look like prison issued.Opened my Amazon app in my car after leaving the crowded mall, and find what appear to be a decent pair of shoes. FakeSpot agreed with the reviews, and I bought then for $35. They will arrive tomorrow.That kind of convenience is terribly addicting. I haven’t figured out the solution, but I remember what it was like when Walmart came to town, put others out of business, mistreated employees, etc. We were unable to stop it then, how the heck are we going to stop it now?So aside from “just stop buying from Amazon” what can we do ?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That makes Amazon #3, after the federal government and Walmart:     Entity        US Employees
  1. US Government         2.7M
  2. Walmart               1.6M
  3. Amazon                1.0M

If Amazon continues to grow at current rates, it will surpass Walmart&#39;s figure within 2 years.Looking at these figures, it&#39;s evident that these three entities are far larger, wealthier, more connected, and likely more powerful than the vast majority of US cities, the vast majority of small countries in the world, and maybe even a few smaller US states."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not sure why everyone continually romanticizes brick and mortar retail. Its terribly inefficient, and wasteful of time, energy, space etc.Think of all the Walmart, Dicks, Big Lots parking lots and strip malls that could be converted into better space. Think of how much waste there is when you have to pack, unpack, stage and repack merchandise.Amazon’s distribution is a superior business model which is why it is popular. I’d also reckon that the carbon footprint per package is lower if you account for the driving that is required for more traditional shopping.I’d rather see more competition using a similar business model than a return to concrete strip malls full of big box retailers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the referenced blog (and library) here. This is great!The full text search engine in SQLite is sadly not really good for this - one reason is that it uses standard B-Trees, another is that it forces storing all token positions if you want BM25 sorting, which is a huge overhead for articles as long as Wikipedia&#39;s.But that doesn&#39;t mean full text search isn&#39;t possible in a very efficient manner with statically hosted data! I wrote a proof of concept of making the Rust-based tantivy library work in the same way, which has a lot of internal things that can make the index much smaller and more efficient than SQLite&#39;s. It&#39;s also &gt;10x faster in creating the search index.Here&#39;s the demo also for Wikipedia: https://demo.phiresky.xyz/tmp-ytccrzsovkcjoylr/dist/index.ht...
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s more efficient than the SQlite version in this form, but it definitely has more upward potential and is more fun to work with.And the corresponding draft PR: https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy/pull/1067I sadly haven&#39;t gotten around to working on it more and writing an article about it.Other people are also working on using this stuff to make Sci-hub and LibGen more available by using this in combination with IPFS for distributed and &#34;uncensorable&#34; hosting which is pretty awesome.Edit: Just realized that the OP demo only searches in article titles, while mine searches in full article contents by default. You can search in only the titles in my demo by querying `title:harry title:potter`"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shocked to find out that this is very much a static website, it&#39;s &#34;merely&#34; downloading a small portion of the 43GB SQLite file in question with HTTP Range requests, and then it uses a WASM-compiled copy of SQLite to query the requested data. Very impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m nervous on your behalf for your S3 bill, have you done napkin maths for how much this will cost to host, especially given the relative inefficiency of the autocomplete queries?A trick that might help: create a separate SQLite table containing just the article titles to autocomplete against. That might give you queries that use smaller ranges of the file."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The new particle contains two charm quarks and an up and a down antiquark. Several tetraquarks have been discovered in recent years (including one with two charm quarks and two charm antiquarks), but this is the first one that contains two charm quarks, without charm antiquarks to balance them.This is not the first time a tetraquark has been measured, but instead it&#39;s the first time a tetraquark with two charm quarks and no charm antiquarks. That&#39;s still nice work, but I was initially confused by the headline (&#34;didn&#39;t they discover those already?&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Quarks are the fundamental building blocks from which matter is constructed.&#34;I sometimes wish would include &#34;In our current model&#34;,
&#34;We now think that&#34;, or some other qualifier.Such absolute statements have been made frequently prior to our current understanding.I have no special knowledge to lead me to believe that quarks are not the end all of parties.But I was happy with atom being the fundamental thing, 
and then electrons, neutrons, protons were the thing as well.The other day I read about Fractons &#34;quasiparticles or Partial Particles&#34;, so now I have to figure those out as well.I have lost track if the graviton has been found yet.
I dont think it has.From a purely layman&#39;s sense of esthetics the current model for particle physics is messy and a little spooky.I have an odd hobby.
I collect old paper encyclopedias from pre 1970
For every language that I speak.  
It takes up MASSIVE amounts of space.The oldest I have been able to acquire on a limited budget
Is 1880.It is always fun to track concepts over time.They all state what the world is like, and how it works as bombastic facts.Yet over time, most of it gets replaced or at least highly refined
and things are removed.Particle physics is an active field with much still to learn or figure out.
Let us keep that in mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve gone full circle - CSS components to inline CSS-in-HTML back to CSS components.But I actually think I will use this. A big problem with CSS is that you end up making overrides no matter how composable you make the classes. And some simple things (e.g. responsiveness) are unintuitive and / or annoying to do in CSS. Hence Tailwind&#39;s &#34;CSS-in-HTML&#34; mini classes. But that doesn&#39;t fill the core purpose of CSS, bigger general-purpose classes to avoid repetition. Combine the two (general classes + mini classes for slight case-by-case fixes) and you get the best CSS experience I&#39;ve seen so far (at least I think, I haven&#39;t tried it yet)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not saying this is ugly but the visual execution of some of these components is poor. No good usage of padding in some examples, poor ratios between the typography and the containers, inconsistent use of different line widths and border radius, weird and incosistent design choices in spacing and proportions…I mean. This looks alright and it will certainly make any UI look pretty decent, but the execution is not superb like the actual TailwindUI library which is incredibly well thought from a visual design perspective. Those components are perhaps less shiny than these but they are incredibly functional and way more intentional.This is a good effort though and I hope to see it improving."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, I&#39;ll guess I&#39;ll be the lone voice of dissent here. I don&#39;t like it. I think it goes against the concept of utility classes / functional CSS. As soon as you start making component-level classes, things begin to become opinionated and you lose the universality.My understanding of the functional CSS approach was that you&#39;d make a button component, and use the variety of &#34;atomic&#34; classes to style it. If you&#39;re using a &#34;btn&#34; class etc, it muddles the distinction of where the semantics live, and things get harder to reason about / debug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Beautiful. The nostalgia hit me very hard with this.I remember in the original version you had all sorts of options, and could even combine screensavers.For people who may not remember: screensavers used to be a neccessity as old CRT tubes would &#39;burn in&#39; an image if they held it static for too long - leaving a shadow of the static image permanently. Screensavers kicked in after a few minutes and displayed something dynamic so as to save your screen from burn in.In the 90&#39;s, having a cool custom screensaver was cool (around the same time that having a custom ringtone on your 3210 was cool), and you&#39;d pay money for software like After Dark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://uxfactor.ca/1151/I know one of the authors of Flying Toasters and sent him the link. Here&#39;s what he had to say:&#34;It&#39;s a rough approximation, which is super cool, but misses all of the nuance.&#34;You see, back in the day, there were very strong competitors to After Dark that had as much or more animations. The thing that set After Dark was a &#34;je ne sais quoi&#34; that felt like an elevated experience. Both the customers &amp; the competitors thought this was some sort of accident, or that the animations were important, but neither of these things was true.&#34;The secret was that people loved the nuance of interacting with the product (&amp; subtlety in the animations) and it was very carefully designed with cognitive science. I pushed the team very hard before I would let anything be released because I insisted on the nuance.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a kid in the 90s learning to program, writing screen savers was one of the best ways to demo your &#34;skills&#34;. Also just something creative to do when you didn&#39;t really have a project in mind. I still think they&#39;re an underappreciated art form, and it&#39;s kind of disappointing that OSX only ships with a couple really basic ones. Apple should bundle in all the AfterDark modules (there were several releases).There was also an amazing set of screensavers which I don&#39;t remember the name of, but one of the set was called &#39;kaos&#39;, and a lot of them were based on fractals. If anyone recalls the name of that software...[edit] I found it! DarkSide of the Mac by Tom Dowdy. Brilliant. http://poubelle.com/DarkSideDocs.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working remote for about 10 years.I&#39;ve had &#34;real&#34; offices.  I&#39;ve worked in open-plan offices.  I&#39;ve had a home office.  I&#39;ve worked from bed.There are tons of good ways to do it.Lately I swap between a kitchen table and a chair on my porch. I no longer use multiple screens, I&#39;ve just gotten really fast at swapping windows on my 15&#34; laptop; I&#39;ve gotten good at figuring out how wide my terminal window breaks should be and where my browser dev tools should sit.Surely there are more optimal ways of doing stuff.  Odds are that there is a Taylorist approach that would pull more productivity out of me.  But much like my typing speed (~50WPM) isn&#39;t really the limiting factor in my programming skill, screen real estate isn&#39;t a big factor in getting stuff done for me.But the big thing for me is that, in the end, it&#39;s fine for me to switch stuff up on a monthly or quarterly or yearly basis.I could never have done that when I was in an office.  I couldn&#39;t take 20 min and play banjo or accordion and come back to my problem with a fresh eye.  I couldn&#39;t put on my laundry and hang it up while I listen to other folks on the daily stand up.  I couldn&#39;t start my lunch cooking in the instapot while waiting for a script to finish running.It would take a hard, hard sell to get me back in an office, not matter how much real and legitimate enjoyment and utility other folks get in an office."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the past 2 weeks, I&#39;ve been working from a treadmill. It has been incredible. I got a small under-the-desk treadmill for my standing desk and I walk at about 2.5km/hour and get around 20,000 steps in per day. It has improved my mood, my clarity, and also has improved my sleep (because I&#39;m tired of walking). I also find it easier to focus on tasks for some reason.If you can make a setup like this work for you, I highly recommend it. Your body will thank you in the long run.EDIT&gt;&gt; A few of you are asking about the model. I actually bought 2, one for myself and one for my partner, who also loves it.This one is mine https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V7F8QYK. I got it when it had a $100-off coupon, so the price wasn&#39;t as steep. No real complaints so far, except you can&#39;t store it upright. I just roll it out of the way when I want to sit.The one for my partner is https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0895DRWVY. She likes it. It&#39;s a little smaller and can be stored upright and out of the way, which is nice. There have been complaints about the remote (and it only comes with 1), but the manufacturer claims to ship new remotes free of charge if yours breaks.They&#39;re both a little quirky with a very simple LCD screen. Supposedly mine has an app integration for step counting, but I just use my phone in my pocket. They both get the job done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Survey seems pretty flawed and potentially biased. The survey was done by a contractor/home improvement company so maybe they used customer&#39;s as their population?While SWEs might need/want a good desk setup, many office jobs just don&#39;t need it. I&#39;m not sure people are really improvising but rather find sitting with a laptop is how they normally work anyway.And working in the bedroom can be misleading... it&#39;s often a private place you can put a proper desk.I WFH and went from living alone to having 3 roommates who all WFH. I have my bed, desk, and theater setup all in the (master bedroom). It&#39;s actually better than a 1bdr apartment, it&#39;s quieter (no leafblowers!) and I don&#39;t have dirty dishes right behind me.I have a small desk but a 4K 32&#34; monitor and a vertical 1080p one. A microphone on an arm and NO webcam; I use screen sharing 90% of the time but I don&#39;t need to see peoples faces. (I really wish video calling didn&#39;t compress &gt;1080p screens so much). If I need a webcam, I use my laptop.Maybe the pandemic changed things but you could get decent chairs for $20 at goodwill.I guess I&#39;m just skeptical that a majority of people have difficulty working from their home... You know the place you live and pick your own furniture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Grew up watching Arthur every morning before school well into middle school (have a sister who&#39;s three years younger). Arthur&#39;s family and life was more precisely like mine than any other I ever saw on TV growing up, and for that it will always be special. Standout episodes include the time the Brain sleeps over and Arthur gets mad about how clean and well-mannered he is, then goes to the Brain&#39;s house and finds out he&#39;s a slob, the lesson being he was just being a good guest, something childhood me took to heart; the Hurl-i-whirl ep; the ep where Arthur hits DW with the swing and gets in trouble (very relevant to my life with a little sister); and of course the seminal &#34;trapped overnight in the library&#34; ep."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; What’s your favorite bug and what caused it?&gt; A: It’s probably boring for me to say, but I just can’t beat the drunken cat bug... That was the one where the cats were showing up dead all over the tavern floor, and it turned out they were ingesting spilled alcohol when they cleaned their paws.I think that bug explains very well just how deeply complex Dwarf Fortress really is. Drinks can be spilled. Some drinks have alcohol. If cats step in something it sticks to their paws. Cats clean their paws, causing them to ingest what&#39;s on them. Enough alcohol will kill a cat. Put together: dead drunken cats."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Making the item system polymorphic was ultimately a mistake, but that was a big one.Q: Why was this was a mistake?A: When you declare a class that’s a kind of item, it locks you into that structure much more tightly than if you just have member elements. It’s nice to be able to use virtual functions and that kind of thing, but the tradeoffs are just too much. I started using a “tool” item in the hierarchy, which started to get various functionality, and can now support anything from a stepladder to a beehive to a mortar (and pestle, separately, ha ha), and it just feels more flexible, and I wish every crafted item in the game were under that umbrella.We do a lot of procedural generation, and if we wanted to, say, generate an item that acts partially like one thing and partially like another, it’s just way harder to do that when you are locked down in a class hierarchy.Preach:https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/27/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/30/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/04/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/07/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/11/wizards-and-warriors-part...I have certainly committed all of these sins, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO that&#39;s one of the best ways a single programmer can spend his career. No weird requirements, no deadlines, no nothing, nada. Just one&#39;s passion and a product. Whether it is successful is irrelevant.Kudos Mr. Adams for making the achievement and moves gaming history.Going back to the interview, I found this line (and the logic attached) interesting:&gt;Making the item system polymorphic was ultimately a mistake, but that was a big one.&gt;When you declare a class that’s a kind of item, it locks you into that structure much more tightly than if you just have member elements.I guess when the game becomes moderately complex then ECS or something similar suddenly makes a lot sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Facebook seems to be censoring so much because Facebook believes that most people will actually believe whatever bits of misinformation are floating around out there.But is everyone that easily manipulated? More importantly, does everyone actually believe that they can be easily manipulated, or do they just think that everyone else is so easily manipulated, but somehow they&#39;re above the fray?And at what point does the censorship to protect me from manipulation become manipulation itself?Facebook is fighting a losing battle if they think they will survive a battle with their own users. This is way past censoring Alex Jones. You can&#39;t possibly censor every crackpot conspiracy theorist. Actually, we&#39;re probably all crackpot conspiracy theorists in some way. We probably all believe some conspiracy about 9/11 or the NSA or elections or vaccines or masks or aliens or royal families or whatever.The rate of censoring is almost certainly accelerating faster than facebook&#39;s growth, and once you&#39;ve been censored once, you&#39;re likely to radically curb your use of that platform. I can&#39;t imagine that FB doesn&#39;t have stats on how many people keep using FB after they&#39;ve been censored just once.FB only works when you and 99% of your social group are on there.And the network effect works in reverse, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually verified this yesterday on my own FB acount.https://imgur.com/a/5tgkbFLNot sure if it&#39;s still happening, but you can test it if you make the post visible to only you and you wait ~5 minutes for that misinformation message to show up.Even if the fact checker had some kind of point, I don&#39;t know how labeling an authoritative source as &#34;false information&#34; helps anyone understand anything just because part of the information might be outdated.Nevertheless, the level of carelessness upon which this mechanism seems to have been built upon is an embarrassment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this is why Facebook has no business being part of fact checking.While it may look different, this is no different than two folks on the phone getting interrupted by ATT and being told they are incorrect on their assumptions about topic X.Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are the carrier, and should be treated as such."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cut my teeth on Diablo, and played Diablo II for probably fifteen years after its release off and on as a way to stay connected with a friend who loved it similarly. More recently, I have consistently played Starcraft II since its release and enjoy a sense of mastery over that game unparalleled by my experience in any other.I haven&#39;t purchased new Blizzard products since the Hong Kong censorship debacle[1] and quit playing Hearthstone at that time. However I had still played some of my other old favorites, reasoning that I was not providing them further financial support. The recent announcements about their terrible, sexist culture had challenged that notion for me, and I was not sure what to do.This news is the straw that breaks my back. That Activision/Blizzard would double down on their despicable behavior and stance in this way is completely beyond the pale, and I for one will never again fire up those games that I loved so much.Thanks for ruining that for me, Blizzard.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzchung_controversy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Steve Jobs quote on why Xerox failed [1] strikes again. The finance people have taken over Acti-Blizzard and they&#39;ve been coasting for 10+ years on their original franchises. All we have is annual CoD releases and Blizzrad coasting on their old properties where Blizzrd hasn&#39;t had a significant original release in 10+ years.This effort seems like it&#39;s part of the ruthless approach to controlling costs that slowly strangle a company from within.I believe WoW is the #2 property (after CoD) at Acti-Blizzard and it&#39;s clearly changed from one of delivering a game to simply extracting as much money as possible from each customer much like how almost all mobile games do.The state of California&#39;s complaint is bad. I mean really bad. The fact that 3-4 different people from AB all released different statements in the last week should tell you exactly how bad it is. That&#39;s classic panic mode. There should only be one.This latest move tells you the company believes it will blow over and they&#39;re looking to do the minimal required to appease the detractors and get back to business as usual without having to pay people more or pay out a bunch of lawsuits.Honestly, the heads of J Allen Brack and Bobby Kotick in particular should roll over this lawsuit.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIMEDIT: commenters have noted (correctly) that I overlooked Overwatch. This was a significant release but it seems to also have waned in popularity and Overwatch 2 is inextricably going in some weird PVE direction.Other than that you have a poor received Diablo sequel, a series of lackluster to bad WoW expansions, a disastrous Warcraft 3 remaster and complete abandonment of the RTS genre that propelled them to success in the first place.WC3 Reforged (&#34;Refunded&#34;) was significant in that it was not only underwhelming and plagued with problems it made the original game worse with a forced download and loss of functionality.The most significant change however was Blizzard not wanting a repeat of missing the MOBA boat with Dota 2 by adding a condition that all the IP for third-party maps belong to Blizzard, completely killing that ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Clickbait title for a highly opinonated piece that would never see the light of day in a respectable publication like the Washington Post, WSJ, NYT, Economist, etc. WilmerHale is a well-known top-100 law firm with a long history -- it&#39;s definitely not a &#34;notorious union-busting firm.&#34; I&#39;m flagging this story because it doesn&#39;t belong on the front page of HN, IMHO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No relation to the link, but does anyone else remember these books?Algebra the Easy Way - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6781.Algebra_the_Easy_Wa...Trigonometry the Easy Way - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2077099.Trigonometry_the...Calculus the Easy Way - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3074478-calculus-the-eas...I read these in 5th grade or so and learned most of middle school and high school math just from those.They&#39;re written as a fantasy novel in which the characters discover the relevant math concepts as part of the story. I know, you&#39;re thinking that&#39;s a silly gimmick and it can&#39;t possibly be any good, but it was actually done quite well. At least until the later parts of Calculus where the situations have to get pretty contrived.Highly recommended, at least for precocious kids who like math and fantasy novels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking of books about calculus, I like Robert Strichartz&#39;s The Way of Analysis. Robert develops intuition and motivation of key concepts in an amazingly detailed way. He often starts with an intuitive but flawed idea, and then gradually revises the idea to a mature definition or proof. The whole book focuses on &#34;why&#34;: why real numbers are defined that way, why limit uses the delta-epsilon notation, why we need to topology, etc and etc. Reading the book is more like an adventure than following a set path. The author explains his approach eloquently: &#34;Mathematics is more than a collection of theorems, definitions, problems and techniques; it is a way of thought....My goal in writing this book is to communicate the mathematical ideas of the subject to the reader. I have tried to be generous with explanations....I believe that what you learn through a process of struggle is more likely to stick with you than what you learn without effort....Understanding mathematics is a complex process. It involves not only following the details of an argument and verifying its correctness, but seeing the overall strategy of the argument, the role played by every hypothesis, and understanding how different theorems and definitions fit together to create the whole. It is a long-term process; in a sense, you cannot appreciate the significance of the first theorem until you have learned the last theorem.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When learning Calc, I always appreciated anyone who could teach the main points without slipping into formal textbook descriptions and terminology. The more advanced one gets in Math, (eg, your teacher or professor with an advanced Math degree), the more they tend to do it, even of they try not to.I like this text - reminds me of &#34;the complete idiot&#39;s guide to calculus&#34; which I used as a companion to my Calc textbook (Stewart) when learning. Not sure I would have faired as well without it.https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Calculus/dp/002...It gives a great and sometimes humorous understanding, which formed a nice framework when I moved on to Vector Calc, Differential Equations, etc later on. At that point in your math career, you can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t try to) rely on mindless algorithms/processes to solve problems like you may have in high school. You&#39;ve got to understand what you&#39;re doing.Ps, I doubt many on HN really needed to hear that, but it may be a useful note for somebody."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a VIM-only dev, spend all my day in a Tmux session, and I use the command-line probably a lot more than average.The single best improvement to my command-line workflow I&#39;ve done in the last few years has been switching shells. First I moved from Bash to ZSH, but about 2 years ago I switched again to Fish.Why I love it:
- history completion searches by default, so I can just type part of a command, hit arrow-up and look through only the relevant results (ZSH also did this, but Fish is better)- tab completions are shown to you in advance (in light gray in front of your cursor)- Basic configuration (which is good enough, honestly) can be done via a web browser. Just run &#34;fish_config&#34;, and it starts a web server, pops open your browser and any changes you make there are saved to your actual config files. No more looking up syntax.- aliases (which are called abbreviations) are actually expanded after typing, so the full command appears in your history. You can also edit the full command before running it, if you need."</p>

Just check out its man page: http://eradman.com/entrproject/entr lets you watch files and re-run a command any time they change. Whenever I&#39;m working on a script, or go tests, or whatever test-like thing I&#39;m doing that&#39;s not in its own bloated test harness, I reach for entr.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The first step is to actually encrypt your drives.  Far too few people and places even do this step.Either use the OS-provided solution (Like LUKS, FileVault, or BitLocker), or use a cross-OS solution like Veracrypt &lt;https://veracrypt.fr/&gt;.Secondly, to avoid the problem in this article, you should have an external password necessary to unlock the drive; not a TPM.  This is, of course, not what most people do, since typing in passwords is tedious.However, if you mostly need to boot up the laptop when connected to a specific network (e.g. on company premises), and it’s acceptable to require a manually typed password when the laptop is not present at that location, and if you use a Debian-based OS, there is a solution!  Shameless plug: https://www.recompile.se/mandos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;All BIOS settings were locked with a password&#34;This is trivial to override for every laptop I&#39;ve ever had, with sites like https://bios-pw.org/  You have to read carefully, like doing &#34;&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;&#34; and not just &#34;&lt;enter&gt;&#34;, but it&#39;s worked many times for me.Source code is here: https://github.com/bacher09/pwgen-for-biosI do see that Lenovo (brand of laptop in the article) isn&#39;t on their list, though many others are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There will always be a way in a network.  The question is can we eliminate the network?Now that computers in a LAN/WAN barely &#39;talk&#39; to each other, and the apps are rarely on the same network as the users&#39; computers, is there enough value in networking the computers relative to the risk of creating a valuable target for attackers?Consider for example what the business case for attackers would look like if their target was an island of one.Of course networks have benefits such as simpler ways for IT or MSPs to manage devices and updates, shared auth structures, directories and policies, etc.  If we look at all those benefits, and consider the alternatives, are they worth the risk of a network in today&#39;s topologies with today&#39;s threat vectors?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember while trying to figure out why Microsoft was blocking emails that IPv6 SMTP source addresses had a much higher risk of being blocked despite having done all the required stuff like PTR, SPF, DKIM. Microsoft&#39;s form to submit delisting an IP address does not even accept an IPv6 address: https://sender.office.com/Stuff like this really hinders adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If only ISPs actually bothered giving out IPv6 addresses to their customers. It&#39;s 2021, I have a 1 Gbps FTTH connection and still no trace of IPv6. This is a complete disgrace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m still waiting for Hetzner to support servers (physical and virtual) without public IPv4 addresses. I could easily free up the ~50 public addresses I&#39;m using. One public IP will do, I can reverse proxy everything else.But there&#39;s no support for that. So every time I spin up a 1 vCPU tiny VM, which will never connect to the public internet, I&#39;m wasting an expensive resource. Sorry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just want my own office. That&#39;s all. I&#39;d be pretty okay with going in if I had my own office with 4 walls.First job of my career, they told me I would have an office of my own. First day I come back do for full time (I had interned there too with my own office), they tell me they&#39;re switching buildings to go open office in about a month&#39;s time. I got a precious few weeks with a personal office, and then it was all gone. I hated this change of scenery mmediately, but I guess I got used to it after a few years.Working from home took me back to that zen. I didn&#39;t even know how much I missed it - how much I needed my own space to feel productive.I&#39;ve since changed jobs, and I kinda dread having to go to the open office nightmare once this is all over. The facilities are way nicer than my last job, but it&#39;s still an open office.Open. Office. As. Implemented. In. Our. Industry. Is. Stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like the relationship is dysfunctional in both directions.On the one hand, the employer set up a panopticon in the office, with crappy furniture, lots of interruptions, a crappy office kitchen, no decent food (i.e. needing to bring food from home). Garbage in, garbage out. Of course nobody is happy to sit in traffic to come to an environment like that.Then we have the author, who has the mistaken idea that the number one most important thing that you do at your job is your directly measurable productivity. Not relationship-building, just pure &#34;shut up and let me sit down and get my work done.&#34; Personally, I&#39;d prefer it if engineering work didn&#39;t go the way of Amazon warehouse workers, because if &#34;productivity&#34; is the sole metric of an employee&#39;s performance, just wait until your employer decides to try and optimize it.Best of luck to the OP at the dice roll that is the next company he works for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I noticed is that while more experienced people are productive working from home, it is devastating for fresh starting employees. Work from home eliminates learning through osmosis. If anyone has a work around this let me know. I am surprised no one else has mentioned it here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At my last job I made a feature to deploy arbitrary user code (most likely a trained model in Python) to a subdomain running a JS server that could take input parameters when called at that URL and would respond with the answer from the model. This effectively cut down DS deployments from potentially days to about 45 seconds. It was seen that be hard and I had a good amount of help from our awesome devops person and worked through a number of issues with the lead dev. When this was delivered everyone loved it, lots of kudos and compliments because it was seen as hard. I felt like a bit of a fraud as I felt I had a lot of help and it really was a team effort, I made efforts to highlight this.I also worked on my own (with the exception of some nginx issues) on a feature to keep an in browser file browse up to date for all users via web sockets. This was really a view on a git repo accessed through the Gitlab api, it was a nightmare to deal with because of the way Git tracks (or doesn’t really) folders. This feature was seen to be easy and I slaved on it for days and eventually weeks because of edge cases and feature creep to no kudos or compliments. Which is fine, it’s my job.It matters, I think, not if the task is easy or hard but if management/product view something as easy or hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch. This hits close to home.I _constantly_ get passed over for the interesting work, despite being _extremely_ qualified for it.  (e.g. I keep getting told I don&#39;t &#34;have a scientific background&#34;, so I&#39;m not qualified to work on problem X, despite the fact that I have a PhD in the field and extensive experience on closely related problems)It&#39;s because I&#39;m seen as a technician, not an engineer or a scientist.That&#39;s because I&#39;m the person everyone picks for the &#34;hey, just whip up this quick demo / generate this report / prototype this idea for me&#34;, and therefore I get critiqued when it&#39;s not fast enough / polished enough, despite it being a &#34;drop everything and have this done by 10pm&#34; situation every time.The big things I&#39;ve accomplished, other people have _always_ gotten credit for.  The things that fail, I get the blame for.So serious advice from someone who&#39;s too old to change it now:  SAY NO TO URGENT ONE-OFF REQUESTS FROM MANAGEMENT!!!  Once you start, it&#39;s a trap that&#39;s really hard to get out of and gets you nowhere career wise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A classic &#34;easy&#34; thing that appears &#34;hard&#34;: write a little bit of assembly. Note, a little bit[1].Writing assembly, again, in small amounts, is exactly the kind of thing that is difficult to start, and fails spectacularly if you have little experience. Debugging is a pain. But you can totally get the hang of writing assembly, and as long as you are doing it for the right reasons (TM), it&#39;s justified, and heroic. The key is you need to write and debug a little at a time.Case in point, I wrote an entire Wasm interpreter[2] in x86-64 asm over the past few months. I wrote it a little at a time, had lots of unit tests, and am working in an engine that was already completely functional (with a slower interpreter).[1] If you find yourself writing more than a hundred or so assembly instructions in a sitting, you are going to fail. If you find yourself writing more than a few thousand assembly instructions, total, you have probably have already failed.[2] https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine/blob/master/src/engi..."</p>

She pierced two layers of latex gloves and drew blood&#34;Later in the article:&#34;&#34;We conduct research only on mouse-adapted sheep prions, which have never been shown to be infectious to humans,” Aguzzi [neuropathologist at the University of Zurich] says.&#34;It sounds like the assumption that mouse-adapted sheep prions can&#39;t infect humans may be flawed."</p>

It&#39;s really funny that everybody resisted it until somebody mentioned that there was a plausible physical mechanism of refolding catalysis."</p>

But Amazon would insist on showing:1. batman movie ads2. the same ad for a C++ course over and over and over and overSo I wound up removing those from the site. Instead, I created a list of good programming books myself, and would randomly cycle through that list to show an ad.It would be so much better if I could enable:&#34;Only show books from this category.&#34;as my aim is to only show advertisements that would be of interest to the people reading the site.Google has context sensitive ads, and one would think this would work. But it doesn&#39;t. For example, I have a page on the American Revolution. Google&#39;s context sensitive ads are usually for travel agencies, presumably based on the place names on the page.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Orbiter Space Simulator (http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) has been one of the major realistic-ish space simulators of the decade.Development has slowed down in the last years due to the obligations of its sole author, so seeing it be open-sourced with a free license (MIT) is a great opportunity to rekindle its development! It seems that the first priorities would be to upgrade the code to 64-bits and transition to a more recent version of DirectX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh, fond memories of it. It was the first time when I understood that when you fly to the Moon, not only you have to cross the Moon&#39;s orbit, but you have to do it when Moon itself is nearby. If you are 1/4 orbital period ahead of it, you are screwed.It also ruined space movies like &#34;Gravity&#34; for me, because pointing the nose to the space station in 50 km and applying thrust towards it turns out to be a sure way to NOT get  to that station!Edit: fixed the thrust direction"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have some experience on this field. Around two years ago i was a DevOp for the company running Dagbladet, Norways #2 newspaper. One of the things I did was keep an eye on mysterious traffic.I managed to find a huge spam network that set up a proxy service that delivered normal content, but injected &#34;you  can win an iPhone!&#34; spam to all users visiting them.Since I was in the position of being able to monitor their proxy traffic towards many sites I managed. I could easily document their behaviour.In the same time, I wrote a crawler that visited their sites over a long, long time. I learned that they kept injecting hidden links to other sites in their network, so I did let my bot look at those also.By this time, I also got a journalist with me that started to look at the money flow to try and find the organisation behind it.My bot found in excess of 100K domains being used for this operation, targeting all of westeren Europe. All the 100K sites contained proxied content and was hidden behind Cloudflare, but thanks to the position I had, I managed to find their backend anyways.We reported the sites to both CF and Google, and to my knowledge, not a single site were removed before the people behind it took it down.Oh, and the journalist? He did find a Dutch company that was not happy to see neither him or the photographer :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google search has progressively deteriorated in quality over the last 10 years, to the point where I see it becoming useless in the relatively near future. And it&#39;s mainly not even their fault.I&#39;ve been using Google search for all kinds of research for 15 years. There used to be a time when you could find the answer to pretty much anything. I could find leaked source codes on public FTP servers, links to pirated software and keygens, detailed instructions for a variety of useful things. That was the golden age of the web.These days, all the &#34;interesting&#34; data on the Internet is all inside closed Telegram chats, facebook groups, Discords or the rare public website here and there that Google 
doesn&#39;t want to index (like sci-hub, or other piracy sites).The data that remains on SERPs is now also heavily censored for arbitrary reasons. &#34;For your health&#34;, &#34;For your protection&#34;. Google search is done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen the same here in Germany but they do appear only if you use the results within the last 24h functionality.
It looks like the German content is generated through GPT2 or 3. It makes no real sense if you read it.
If you go on the page you are immediately redirected to a scam just like the article mentions.
Interestingly they use &#34;.it&#34; domains here. It also looks like the domains might have been hacked or are expired domains that have been bought.For example if you check havfruen4220.dk on archive.org you can see that it appears to have been a legitimate business website before. https://web.archive.org/web/20181126203158/https://havfruen4...How do they rank so well?I&#39;ve checked the domain on ahref and it has almost no backlinks. But if you look closely you will see that all the results that rank very well have been added very recently.
On the screenshots in the article you can see things like &#34;for 2 timer siden&#34; which means 2 hours ago.
It looks like google is ranking pages that have a very recent publishing date higher.Edit: Here is what the content of such a site looks like: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Bk0VsM..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For folks interested in this space, there&#39;s a few other resources of which I&#39;m a fan.First, there&#39;s Micro.blog (https://micro.blog/).  They can host a blog for you, or you can publish to their service for free using your own blog by pointing Micro.blog at your RSS feed (I do the latter).  Think blogging but with a social element, facilitating both interaction and content discovery.Second, there&#39;s the IndieWeb movement more broadly (https://indieweb.org/), which advocates for a whole ecosystem of distributed, open technologies for enriching the blogging ecosystem and encouraging interoperability.Third, believe it or not, webrings live on!  The indiewebring (https://indieweb.org/indiewebring), for example, is a fun way to find additional bloggers out there.As you can tell, I&#39;m a fan of blogging and the IndieWeb movement... :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome, I agree, personal blogs are great.I can&#39;t help but notice all the blogs tagged &#34;software&#34; in the list (so far). In fact, I think if there was a filter to exclude software blogs, there might be only a few remaining?I missed out on the whole RSS thing when it was popular. My sense was that it solved the problem of knowing when, among a whole bunch of blogs, a site had new content.Perhaps it exists, I want an app/site that will scrape a list of sites I give it (blogs for example) to show me any new content each day. A personal home page with titles and perhaps a hundred or so words from each site I track that has new content.In the broader picture, I feel overwhelmed by the amount of technology these days, spend too much of my time browsing, etc. (HN, case in point). So I am looking for something I call TRAoT, The Right Amount of Technology.Maybe it&#39;s a &#34;magic mirror&#34; that displays this overview, home page. Interactivity is minimal or nil. No ability to comment, follow links, etc. Like the morning newspaper of old, I spend a little time in the morning with it and then go about my day &#34;offline&#34;.In short I am looking at ways to take the open-ended and stress inducing (anxiety inducing?) relationships I have with technology and replace them with a more staid, maybe even serendipitous, relationship that allows me back more free time, less stress.Maybe this &#34;Solar Punk&#34; thing is something of the Zeitgeist of our time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am afraid to blog. I could write about my career and my hobby, but those do not seem to be interesting for others. My opinion may be interesting, but it is risky because something I write may come back to offend others one day, or get me in trouble. One time ago I considered blogging anonymously about the economy but doing so anonymously felt disingenuous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sumatra, alongside maybe Everything and IrfanView, is my favorite piece of software on windows.

Still, absolutely wonderful project deserving of the highest praise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing to see the drive of &#34;I know what I want to make and I do it the way I want&#34; carry the project for so long. More than any development ideology just having the passion to continue working on whatever it is you&#39;re doing is an extremely powerful force for creating useful software. And SumatraPDF is definitely useful software, has been for a long time.&#34;ideology doesn&#39;t matter as much as doing&#34; being said the syntax valid semantic invalid error at the end of this excerpt in the section on extensive tests being overrated gave me a chuckle:&gt; Dogma is powerful. Sometimes in my corporate life I felt like writing tests was just going through motion. Maybe we should spend more time writing code instead, I though?In all seriousness I agree though. In a project where you write the majority of the code it is possible to overdo tests in a way that you are wasting more time than you&#39;re saving yourself and in a passion project efficiency isn&#39;t always as important as interest anyways."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I&#39;ve wasted many an hour combing through Google and my search history to look up a good article, blog post, or just something I&#39;ve seen before.This is the fault of web browser vendors who have yet to give a damn about book marks.&gt; Apollo is a search engine and web crawler to digest your digital footprint. What this means is that you choose what to put in it. When you come across something that looks interesting, be it an article, blog post, website, whatever, you manually add it (with built in systems to make doing so easy).So it&#39;s a searchable database for bookmarks then.&gt; The first thing you might notice is that the design is reminiscent of the old digital computer age, back in the Unix days. This is intentional for many reasons. In addition to paying homage to the greats of the past, this design makes me feel like I&#39;m searching through something that is authentically my own. When I search for stuff, I genuinely feel like I&#39;m travelling through the past.This does not make any sense. It&#39;s Unix-like because it feels old? It seems like the author thoroughly misses the point of unix philosophy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My version of this is https://dogsheep.github.io/ - the idea is to pull your digital footprint from various different sources (Twitter, Foursquare, GitHub etc) into SQLite database files, then run Datasette on top to explore them.On top of that I built a search engine called Dogsheep Beta which builds a full-text search index across all of the different sources and lets you search in one place: https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-betaYou can see a live demonstration of that search engine on the Datasette website: https://datasette.io/-/beta?q=dogsheepThe key difference I see with Apollo is that Dogsheep separates fetching of data from search and indexing, and uses SQLite as the storage format. I&#39;m using a YAML configuration to define how the search index should work: https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/templates/d... - it defines SQL queries that can be used to build the index from other tables, plus HTML fragments for how those results should be displayed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this idea, but the name “digital footprint” sort of implies it’s what effect you’ve had on the Internet for helping keep your online persona under control: your tweets, comments, emails, et cetera.But this is a great idea! Having a search engine for vaguely _anything_ you touch very much does look like it’d increase the signal:noise ratio. It’d be interesting to be able to add whole sites (using, say, DuckDuckGo as an external crawler) to be able to fetch general ideas, such as, say, “Stack Exchange posts marked with these tags”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few key differences with other OSS companies that IMHO are positive:1) Element or other matrix components do not require a copy right transfer. That means Element is hard to re-license under another license than its current one.2) The license for Element is Apache 2.0. A fine choice for any OSS project looking to maintain a healthy ecosystem of contributors for decades to come.3) The ecosystem has a diversity of stakeholders and contributors outside of Element the company maintaining various components, integrations, etc. It&#39;s an ecosystem that already serves many millions of users.4) Not all the Matrix components are under the Element umbrella (see 3). Element is probably dominant in this community but it&#39;s based on merit rather than ownership. E.g. the Matrix foundation is mostly run by people outside of Element. Even the Element apps have contributions from outside Element the company (see 1).5) Decentralization is at the core of the Element sales pitch. They are unlikely to want to walk back on that; or even be able to do that without damaging their credibility. For better or worse, that&#39;s what they are selling and stuck with. And they seem successful with it too. Hence the investment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Element foundation should use some of that sweet money to:1) buy FluffyChat and some serious UI designers, because Element is probably one of the worst matrix clients in terms of UX.2) fix decryption issues that happen randomly even by just using Element on the matrix.org server: https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/issues/1721 as it&#39;s a real show-stopper once you hit it3) add support for multiple accounts and identities (too many requests to list on the issue tracker), since federation is great, but it&#39;s not always wanted.Disclaimer: I managed to convince a group of technical users to switch over to matrix. We stay for the principle, but not really for the experience so far. FluffyChat is the best client we tried on mobile. On desktop, I&#39;m glad weechat-matrix and gomuks exist, because all the other clients &#34;reek&#34; to us. And even if you like the modern chat UIs, they&#39;re really not bug-free either.Overall many clients and some severs to choose from, but I did prefer irc just for the simple-no-BS-clients alone (the protocol has nothing to do with it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fluffychat is mentioned a lot here as a good UI/UX alternative to Element. Just wanted to bring up another that I&#39;m working on called Syphon. It&#39;s not at the stage where it can compete with Fluffychat in terms of spec parity or maturity, but I think it&#39;s worth discussing as an effort.https://syphon.orghttps://github.com/syphon-org/syphonLike I said, it&#39;s still very much in Alpha and needs quite a bit of work, but the UX flows and design have been well received by others. Though there is an opinionated default UX and design paradigm, there is a focus is to make everything customizable and the theming options are growing over every release.The goal is to eventually find a sweet spot between Discord and Signal and bridge the gap to Matrix between those communities.I have a demanding day job and other obligations that keep me busy, but I spend nearly all my free time and every vacation in the last year working on this project. We&#39;re constantly looking for other contributors and there&#39;s several other ways to help including donations. Feel free to  join the official room for updates to track progress and please feel free to reach out with feedback!https://matrix.to/#/#syphon:matrix.orgAdditionally, I just merged Multi-account support this week and it will be in the next release. Not sure of any other Matrix client that has this feature, so there&#39;s some unique features that we&#39;re focusing on to set it apart."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something about this reminds me of the &#39;Winning Ticket Hypothesis&#39; in artifical neural networks: that some &#39;random&#39; initializations prime a network far better for later faster learning. From https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635 - the abstract:Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90%, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance.We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the &#34;lottery ticket hypothesis:&#34; dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (&#34;winning tickets&#34;) that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective.We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.Are these innate patterns of activity priming mammalian brains in a similar way?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To put this into context, retinal waves (essentially self-propagating excitations along the retina) pre-birth have been known to exist and help neural organization for what must be 20-30 years. What&#39;s new in this paper is that they additionally confirmed that the direction of the propagating waves coincided with the mouse&#39;s typical optical flow pattern, essentially helping priming motion-detection neurons in addition to the well-known edge-detection neurons early.I wouldn&#39;t compare this to dreaming really, it&#39;s a very different process where top-down connections hallucinate sensations. This is a completely bottom-up process, it&#39;s more or less like a test-bench connected to the optic nerve generating moving edges pre-birth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A new Yale study suggests that, in a sense, mammals dream about the world they are about to experience before they are even born.&#34;In a sense&#34; ... A bit of a click-baity title for what amounts to suggesting that brain wiring is primed for sensing the world, which is not news.The study itself looks to be more about how the brain primes itself (visual systems specifically). It may or may not have anything to do with dreaming."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is amazing. I built one to help my nephew walk, and now selling commercially ( http://trexorobotics.com )I am fed-up at the lack of options available to individuals. People thought that everyone will get an exoskeleton and be able to walk with it everywhere. But the industry ran into many challenges.A big one that many dont understand is getting insurance coverage. The way the US healthcare system is designed, it will only cover restoration of mobility, not a restoration of function. So, from their perspective, a wheelchair and some pain meds can do the job easily.I believe that they key is to start with children, this is where you have families desperate for a solution, higher costs due to them growing and spending their entire life in a wheelchair, and the option to truly have a life changing impact.But things are changing, people are starting to notice the work that we are doing. We need a lot more people building exoskeletons and similar powered orthotics!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been making my own, purely as a pipe-dream to have some hope of walking again, it&#39;s not easy but I&#39;m hoping it&#39;ll be a better fit than consumer ones, and probably cheaper.I feel like we&#39;ve made leaps and bounds in prosthetics this past decade but orthotics and exoskeletons haven&#39;t been following the trend for some reason. As an engineer I imagine there are some significant design constraints that make it hard but seeing what we&#39;re capable of doing in any other industry I can&#39;t help but feel the problem has to be something other than purely technical limitations.  
The price is also a big issue, 10k for the cheapest exoskeletons, 150k for the one in this article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Because IE was seriously outdated, lacking support for cutting-edge web APIs and technologies enabling the modern websites and web apps we use today.This is just false, or at best only half of the story to make a false equivalence. IE was cutting edge until Firefox. The biggest problem with IE was all the insanely weird shit it did, not missing features. It would “fix” missing tags, that would then be broken on every standards compliant browser, had active x, and had an absolutely insane amount of security bugs.Mobile safari ain’t the IE of the modern day. It’s just fucking not. I’m sorry. Chrome is closer to IE than Safari because of market share AND developers developing exclusively for it forgetting anything and everything else.Does mobile safari still suck? Sure. But we don’t need to call it IE or constantly drone on with comparisons to IE. Let something suck in its own unique and shitty way, please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple has its own opinions about what web standards it should implement. It’s as simple as that. Google has been extremely successful in convincing developers that browsers that don’t behave like Chrome are behaving wrong.Don’t get me wrong, I wish Safari had more features, fewer bugs, and an evergreen release cycle. It’s clear Apple do not see themselves as competing with Chrome, largely because of iOS, and I do want them to take it more seriously. But the people who write Chrome explicitly do not care about other browsers, and think that the world would be a better place if Chrome were the only one. Between that behavior and the whole AMP fiasco, I’m surprised so much of the blame gets thrown at Apple for destroying the web. Am I supposed to be writing PWAs now, or AMP pages? If Reddit can’t figure it out, how the fuck am I supposed to?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt;Why did developers and software engineers hate IE so much? Because IE was seriously outdated, lacking support for cutting-edge web APIs and technologies enabling the modern websites and web apps we use today.

Nonsense. The almost universal contempt for Internet Exploder amongst web developers had nothing to do with lack of support for cutting edgw APIs. It was because Internet Exploder refused to follow basic web standards and was stuffed it full of proprietary and  non-standard rendering quirks.This meant you could guarantee that any website you designed and that you ensured followed web standards and rendered perfectly on every browser known to man would either break or display completely differently on IE. So you had to then pollute your lovely clean code with countless ugly hacks and conditionals just to ensure your site rendered the same on IE as it did everywhere else.That was why every web developer not working in a Microsoft bubble loathed that browser."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t read the state of California&#39;s claims here you should. It&#39;s the result of a two year investigation and the claims are.. shocking.I want to make a point about &#34;culture fit&#34;. &#34;Culture fit&#34; in a company typically comes down to &#34;we like you&#34; and the reason why people like other people is that they are like them. Similar age, background, whatever. It&#39;s why Stanford grads probably like other Stanford grads.This &#34;we like you&#34; can and does lead to discrimination.But here&#39;s the even darker side of this. Toxic cultures of sexual harassment as alleged in the complaint against Activision-Blizzard always come down to a few key individuals who then &#34;spread&#34; by hiring or promoting other people who are like then. I doubt this is ever explicit. It&#39;s more that you can sense a fellow predator (make no mistake: they are preying on vulnerable staff).So without intervention this toxicity will tend to spread. Those who oppose it will leave. Those who tow the lines get promoted.And it&#39;s leadership&#39;s responsibility to root this out and eliminate it. Heads should roll here. Maybe even J Allen Brack&#39;s and/or Bobby Kotick&#39;s. If you want to take credit for the successes you also have to take responsibility for the giant failures here.Oh and whoever wrote and sent out that statement about how the state was pursuing this was why so many businesses are leaving California needs to be fired. It was so utterly tone deaf and irrelevant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to largely match a lot of the same things that happened with Riot Games over the last couple of years. I am hoping that these actions can help spread awareness of any issues that may be present at Blizzard and past, current, and future employees won&#39;t face the same issues. It is a long road to be traveled to get there.I hope that the current WFH situation doesn&#39;t detract from the walkout. A lot of the visibility raised when Riot went through this was outside of the Riot gates where employees were congregated.Without speculating on the claims, I do find it interesting that the DFEH has lawsuits against both Riot Games and Blizzard for similar issues. I recall reading that Riot&#39;s response was that the DFEH was not working in good faith: are both of these companies aligning their responses, is the DFEH out of line, or is the industry just that broken?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Appeal to public opinion is generally a great idea but there is a risk.  Activision gets no sympathy from me, but I also don&#39;t think the answer will come from the masses. 
 I&#39;m not sure that most gamers really care about sexism in the gaming industry.  Video games are synthetic, we don&#39;t really see the people behind them.  At least in movies we see the actors.  If push comes to shove, I think most gamers will still be lining up for the latest AAA title no matter what they hear about the company that created it.  Imho change therefore has to come from something other than public opinion.  This lawsuit is exactly that: the government enforcing a code of behavior because the market clearly cannot do it on its own.  The system is working."</p>

It produced propellers that were 90% efficient, about double the efficiency of other experimenters&#39; ad hoc propellers.Double the efficiency meant the Wrights needed half the horsepower to get into the air."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zulip&#39;s search is powered by this built-in Postgres full-text search feature, and it&#39;s been a fantastic experience. There&#39;s a few things I love about it:* One can cheaply compose full-text search with other search operators by just doing normal joins on database indexes, which means we can cheaply and performantly support tons of useful operators (https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages).* We don&#39;t have to build a pipeline to synchronize data between the real database and the search database. Being a chat product, a lot of the things users search for are things that changed recently; so lag, races, and inconsistencies are important to avoid. With the Postgres full-text search, all one needs to do is commit database transactions as usual, and we know that all future searches will return correct results.* We don&#39;t have to operate, manage, and scale a separate service just to support search. And neither do the thousands of self-hosted Zulip installations.Responding to the &#34;Scaling bottleneck&#34; concerns in comments below, one can send search traffic (which is fundamentally read-only) to a replica, with much less complexity than a dedicated search service.Doing fancy scoring pipelines is a good reason to use a specialized search service over the Postgres feature.I should also mention that a weakness of Postgres full-text search is that it only supports doing stemming for one language. The excellent PGroonga extension (https://pgroonga.github.io/) supports search in all languages; it&#39;s a huge improvement especially for character-based languages like Japanese. We&#39;re planning to migrate Zulip to using it by default; right now it&#39;s available as an option.More details are available here: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/full-text-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually built a search engine back in 2018 using postgresqlhttps://austingwalters.com/fast-full-text-search-in-postgres...Worked quite well and still use it daily. Basically doing weighted searches on vectors is slower than my approach, but definitely good enough.Currently, I can search around 50m HN &amp; Reddit comments in 200ms on the postgresql running on my machine."</p>

Billions here in CA have been spent on a &#34;hydrogen superhighway&#34;. Meanwhile, for some reason the EV / Tesla charging network is getting built out naturally - I just did an EV plug at home for my relatives with electric cars -&gt; no govt subsidy needed. If we get an EV (we want to) I will leave the house every day with a &#34;full&#34; tank.The conversion losses are a lot less with electric -&gt; Hydrogen you start with electricity, make hydrogen, compress it, transport it, pump it, use to to make electricity again, run engine.Electricity you can also make locally (solar etc) and hopefully one day use as a battery backup to your house (100kW house battery would be great)."</p>

These challenges will naturally yield better laws considering the huge wave already behind the electric vehicles.&#34;Toyota’s Indian subsidiary publicly criticized India’s target for 100 percent electric vehicle sales by 2030, saying it was not practical.&#34;, the keyword being not practical, country which struggles with electricity during summer and rations farmers electricity is legislating 100% electric?"</p>

Now that Apple has released a patch for it widespread reverse engineering will begin immediately and it&#39;ll only be a matter of time until packaged exploits become part of standard mass-use toolkits. Having a patch ready to deploy is great, but simultaneously means it&#39;s all the more important to get it deployed fairly promptly if it&#39;s something that could have serious root/remote execution potential.Though I suppose if this bug can be used for a jailbreak there may be some people who&#39;d actively want to stay on 14.7 as well. It&#39;s too bad on iOS Apple forces people to choose between security and control of their own systems and doesn&#39;t at least allow a purchase-time option to have the ability to load ones own root signing certificate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you once again for writing such an excellent article &lt;3In contrast to some other comments here, I love the narrative style. After all, these are half tutorials half entertainment - and the entertainment keeps it enticing. I would not have spent nearly two hours reading about the nitty-gritty of futures implementation details today if it weren&#39;t for the way you write about things.To put it the other way - if I wanted to read a super condensed, concise reference of how these things work, I would, you know, read a reference. The narrative style of building things on your own, solving problems as you face them, picking tools and libraries on the way, feels relatable as the everyday lived experience of software development. It feels appropriate for the medium - it&#39;s a blog after all!Besides, blogs are the perfect place to mention the tiny useful tools and libraries people might not have heard of. References and books might err on the side of being &#34;neutral&#34; and not making opinionated recommendations, but this can also lead to unknown unknowns. People don&#39;t know what they are missing out on! Luckily, blogs have more freedom here. Mentioning things like `cargo-edit`, `serde` and others can probably make some readers feel like &#34;one of today&#39;s lucky ten thousand&#34; - enjoying the newly-gained quality of life improvements."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I don&#39;t know! Why do they truncate stuff like that?Because Linux limits thread names to 15 bytes (not including the required terminal nul).Other unices are better though not great, macOS is 63 I think.By comparison Windows allows 32… kilobytes.Though “runtime” is probably what should be shortened here, “rt” is literally the name of the tokio features for configuring the runtime, so that would likely be more understandable than the trailing “-w”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, most people reading this aren&#39;t looking for the marketing section. But I wanted to point something out I see all the time. Take a look at the roles under CMO at a 125 person company:--CMO (15)Director, Product Marketing, plus 3 PMMs (4)Director, Demand Gen, plus 3 marketers (4)Director, Sales Enablement, plus 2 marketers (3)Director, Brand Marketing (3)PR &amp; Analyst Relations (1-2)Events/Community (1)--What I posit is that Product Marketing is useless as a position and should be eliminated most of the time.The role ends up being:
- Jane Doe is the Product Marketer for product X. She&#39;s responsible for growing it as much as possible.
- She works with Anne X. in demand gen to make ads to promote the product to new customers.
- She works with Hillary Y. in email marketing to cross promote to existing customers
- She works with tech to do landing page/funnel testing.However what I find is that the role just adds friction and useless tests to show value. Let the subject matter experts (in demand gen, email, website testing) create the plan for each product holistically. Product Marketers are dead weight 80% of the time.I would only say this anonymously but its true. Source: I&#39;m a marketing consultant that has worked with dozens of fast growing SaaS companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good rough outline. As the author says, it&#39;s not meant to be a perfect target that fits every company. Adjust accordingly.I like how he limits the number of C-level titles in the early stages to just a CEO and CTO. It&#39;s a common mistake for startup founders to hand out too many C-level titles to their cofounders and early hires. This causes problems when the company outgrows some (or most) of those people. If you need to bring in a more experienced CMO, CRO, CSO, or other C-level, your only options are to demote the existing C-level and replace them with a new boss or to arrange their exit from the company. Neither are good looks, and neither make people happy.Much better to start with Director and VP level titles in the early days. You can either bring in a C-level above them when the time is right, or promote them to C-level if they grow into the role.That said, most SaaS I&#39;ve worked with would want more people on backend/devops at the earl stages. Having 3 people total handle combined devops and backend development is a big risk, especially if any of them want to go on vacation or leave for other jobs. Downtime and server outages are not a good look for a growing SaaS, so don&#39;t skimp on people who can keep it up and running."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do the number of front end devs exceed the back end? Does anyone else see a problem here? Front end effort has always been a fraction of back end effort on the systems I&#39;ve developed. If that&#39;s not the case, I can only hypothesize it&#39;s because front end toolchains have gotten overly complex for what they accomplish. Not only that, but I would posit that for most SaaS ventures, the back end is where the differentiation and value is delivered, so that is where the bulk of dev resources should be deployed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat. I’ve been looking for something like this for gamedev — being able to model pseudo-realistic simulation of planetary evolution (for my interest, just starting at plate tectonics and going up until wind patterns) to provide a “basis” for further simulation.It’s surprisingly hard to google though; almost all content is simple perlin noise generation that looks kind of correct but ultimately produces total nonsense (so any further derived rules have to also be total nonsense) — generally constrained with further nonsense rules to produce higher level concepts like “animals” and “biomes” that can’t be touched meaningfully.Other material I can find is far too involved, and far too slow — targeting actual simulation of the earth. The few that do it with the goal of “just realistic enough” still end up being 10+ minutes generation time for small worlds. Modeling erosion processes being the main culprit, afaict.Definitely stealing this one, for all my nefarious deeds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would like to see more work being done to simulate abiogenesis. Essentially, it&#39;s a search problem -- take some elements and probabilistically form increasingly complex molecular machines to the point where they become self-replicating and exhibit the basic properties of life. Once this bootstrapping has begun, it&#39;s a matter of subjecting the proto-lifeforms to evolutionary pressures, and over time, they will &#34;evolve&#34; to become increasingly complex organisms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great work. Interesting that he didn&#39;t simulate the impact that formed the moon, though. I&#39;m interested in how that impacted (ha) plate tectonics. I&#39;m not aware of a scientific theory that posits a causality between the impact and plate tectonics, but we are the only rocky planet that has both plate tectonics and a natural satellite created by impact, so I have to wonder if they&#39;re related."</p>

If you want to give Facebook nightmares, talk about the idea of making it legally liable for any and all leaks of our personal records that a jury can be persuaded were unnecessarily collected.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not going to comment on Snowden&#39;s view of what liberal western states do when it comes to surveillance. I have my own opinion, but he&#39;s been right about stuff I&#39;d disagreed with him in the past before so I&#39;m gun shy about confronting his ideas again.On the topic of unsafe language though, he&#39;s absolutely right. We don&#39;t have to put up with this. We could pass a law and ban new code in unsafe languages from national security threatening devices like phones or cyberphysical devices like self-driving cars and we would be the better for it in under a decade. We could even have taxes to give breathing room during a transitionary period to encourage it before outright banning it, but we don&#39;t. We don&#39;t because so often it is less of a hassle for the government to trust the private sector that it is to take some real position on the regulatory issues that matter. This will probably always be the case until the government is able to evaluate talent and pay salaries in accordance with that talent as the private sector is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think you&#39;d have to ban unsafe languages but you could pass a law that slowly decreased the amount of money the government could spend on &#39;unsafe&#39; software (either through direct licensing or renting through clouds).  The government is such a huge client to these companies that it&#39;d immediately create a large financial incentive to migrate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did a Ph.D. in number theory, published a few dozen research papers, and have programmed a lot and this post sounds about right to me.  I did CS as an undergrad, before doing a math Ph.D., and remember being very surprised that math papers weren&#39;t a lot more wrong than they actually are (since computer software is so often full of bugs, and all it takes is one single bug to completely invalidate an entire paper).  When I was a grad student at Berkeley, I once asked Serge Lang (who I think wrote the most advanced math textbooks of anybody who ever lived) why mathematics research papers don&#39;t have a lot more incorrect results in them.  He responded that it was because people secretly &#34;proved&#34; everything to themselves in multiple ways, but only wrote up one proof, and it was unlikely that multiple very different reasons for something being true would all be wrong.  Of course, there are serious mistakes and gaps in the literature, though what one person considers a gap, somebody else who knows more might not consider a gap.  For example, I remember once that Ernst Kani was complaining to me about a big gap in a paper by Ribet; I didn&#39;t believe it, so I read the relevant section and was able to fill in the gap in a few hours sufficiently to satisfy him.   In any case, I&#39;ve spent decades both programming and doing number theory, and despite some similarities, they are very different things.    Another related way these threads come together is with Kevin Buzzard&#39;s big project to formalize mathematics using LEAN; he&#39;s another number theorist, and he told me that a few years ago he started really worrying about the correctness of a lot of number theory papers, and that strongly motivated his interest in LEAN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone is interested in number theory and would like to help some incarcerated people that are working on a number theory paper:I&#39;m a director of the Prison Math Project: http://prisonmathproject.org/We have a few advanced mathematicians in jail who don&#39;t have access to computers. They need help with formatting their work in LaTeX and stuff like that to make it ready for publication (credit offered).They have previously co-authored some papers from within jail eg&#34;Linear Fractional Transformations And Nonlinear Leaping Convergents Of Some Continued Fractions&#34;&#34;Math And Art In Prison: A Collaborative Effort Across The Ocean&#34;please reach out if any interest in helping them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my takeaways: When I see &#34;stitch together black boxes,&#34; to me that says that aspects of academic math are becoming similar to opportunistic software development.When such an effect happens in group psychology it is typically part of the &#34;grounding&#34; effect happening. There is a high supply of theory without the energy to go into analyzing so many individual black boxes anymore, and a correspondingly high demand arises for integrative applications which bring the high-minded ideas down to more fundamental, widely-scoped, or practical effect. Down to earth, so to speak.Some would think of this as an economic-benefit effect. The point is, it tends to bring all those stitched-together black boxes much closer to the end user space, where application is key, not so much theory.So I wonder if in the coming years we will see a dramatic closing of the gap between direct access to mathematics inputs and daily living. It may be that the typical non-math-minded individual will soon readily and happily bootstrap themselves into the language of mathematics via the closing in of a perception of direct competitive or economic value.To share an example, in 2003 I started to use a node-based editor to edit 3D textures for graphics projects. This node-based tool gave more control than standard sliders, color pickers, and checkboxes. But soon I discovered that in a lot of cases it was easier to enter a math formula in a node than to chain nodes together. Maybe a single checkbox designated whether the function was periodic, but other than that, enter math here, please. Your mathematical wish is our graphics-producing command.So I wonder if we&#39;ll soon get to the point where formulaic systems control with direct mathematic input will be more desirable and common in unified system interfaces that are found in office and household work.Let&#39;s say you want to write the perfect formula for a given air quality factor in your office...Or your competitive game which allows you to program AIs is made much more efficient if you can tweak formulae by hand...Or you need to design a new form of printed steak, but simple toggles and switches just won&#39;t do...(Then...when the time is right for the black-box theory end to pick up a lot of momentum again, imagine how large a pool of new mathematicians will be ready...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi there, Signal-Android developer here. I updated the issue to reflect this, but this bug has been fixed. I was tracking it on a separate issue, and had forgotten to close this one.We do, in fact, take issues like this very seriously. This bug was extraordinarily rare, and because we have no metrics/remote log collection, there was an initial period where we had to spend time adding logging and collecting user-submitted logs to try to track it down. As soon as we were able to pick up a scent, it was all we worked on, and we were able to get a fix out very quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several years ago, when I worked at FB, I ran into a similar bug on an early internal version of a Messenger rewrite. Sent pictures to one chat, showed up in another.My bug report on it kicked off an absolute maelstrom of dev activity and investigation. High level engineers showed up in the comments. Lots of immediate followup. The severity was clearly understood and resolving it was clearly prioritized.I exclusively use Signal now, but the discrepancy between what I see here and what I saw there is pretty disheartening. This kind of bug is not only a massive privacy risk, but it also massively erodes user confidence and trust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; [..] his Signal randomly sending images to me that he didn&#39;t intend to, even without initiating the addition of any attachments on the GUI... he even sees one of my messages displayed on his side with a random image attached to it, as if i have sent that image to him, even though that image is not even present on my phone.https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10247#iss...Yikes.&gt; [..] I&#39;ve also recently had a probably unrelated issue where my mic was still audible to the other party after I hung up the call.https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10247#iss...Double yikes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some additional context for those who don&#39;t follow professional cycling: the Dutch women&#39;s team was incredibly strong coming into this road race. All 4 riders on their team are stars in their own right, and the only reason there wasn&#39;t a clear favorite for the race overall is that people weren&#39;t sure which Dutch rider would win.So you have a complicated group dynamic, where the majority of the peloton has no interest in pulling the group to catch the break, since they would just get beat by one or more of the Dutch riders, and the Dutch riders didn&#39;t seem to have a clear plan on how to control the race and who would sacrifice their chances and work on the front for the rest of the team.As others have said, there were no radios allowed for riders in the race, so all information about the breakaway came from the race director&#39;s car trailing the peloton. This was a well known fact about the race coming in, and it&#39;s the same way that the annual World Championship race is run. It&#39;s normal for riders to drop back to the team car to get information about the break, and the lead moto for a group of cyclists will occasionally show time gaps on a whiteboard.At least one of the Dutch riders claimed to have known about the lone rider off the front [1], but somehow that information didn&#39;t make it to the rest of the team. It seems that most of the peloton didn&#39;t know (or didn&#39;t care) how many riders were up the road, and the Dutch team failed to communicate amongst themselves and establish a plan.All that leads to Kiesenhofer&#39;s solo move working out. All credit to her for an extremely strong ride.[1]https://netherlandsnewslive.com/miscommunication-and-underes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic ride and if you follower her Twitter she&#39;s been doing a lot of very detailed exploration of her endurance limits in preparation.When the lead group fell to 3 they had an 11 minute lead.She broke free and went solo with 40km to go.When she finished that lead had eroded to 2 minutes as the front group she dropped had been caught.So in those 40km she lost 9 minutes of lead she had built with the help of the breakout group.This was all strategy and then a tremendous physical performance on her part.Dutch team needs a serious kick in the ass for underestimating an &#34;amatuer&#34; in this regard.  It was obvious she was in it for the gold or nothing; and they fatally assumed it would be the later.Fantastic win when you consider training, strategy, and performance all came together to pull it off.  This is what olympians are all about!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(More related to the comments than the article) I&#39;ve seen tons of takes on this since watching the end of the race this morning and, although it certainly played a part in deciding the outcome, it&#39;s a shame that more focus has seemed to be on making excuses or how the Dutch riders messed things up instead of Dr Kiesenhofer&#39;s incredible story and ride.Kiesenhofer was on a fantastic day: van Vleuten&#39;s earlier attack from the peloton made no inroads to Kiesenhofer, assuming the time gaps shown on the TV were correct.Watching on the TV we knew there was still a rider out front and, even if the race &#34;ardoisier&#34; (blackboard holder) wasn&#39;t the best, team management should have figured out a way to get that information to the chasing pack. I mean, the race finished on a motor racing circuit with pit lanes containing team helpers! It&#39;s not like it was like stage 16 of this year&#39;s Giro, where poor weather stopped race images being broadcast[1].[1] https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/gallery-amazing-images-from-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty much. The best way to insert supply chain exploits is to embed them in a stack exchange answer to a beginner&#39;s question.This isn&#39;t new, we&#39;ve always had programmers who programmed by &#34;recipe&#34; rather than first principles, and DRY paints that as a feature, but it underlies a lot of pain and cost over the years.To give some context, I inherited some kernel code when I worked in the Systems Group at Sun Microsystems in the 80&#39;s that was written by a mathematician who had become a programmer because the money was in programming, not applied math. They had cut and pasted code they didn&#39;t understand in order to achieve the result they wanted out of the code they were &#34;writing.&#34; When I inherited it I read through it and found a couple of dozen ways the code would panic the kernel[1]. Once fixing those obvious issues, it became clear that the original owner of the code didn&#39;t really understand what computation did. They had an idea, and mathematically they could show that it was correct, but literally no ability to express that algorithmically.This is not a &#34;new&#34; problem but it is an important one that managers of software engineers need to watch for.[1] At the time the only difference between &#34;kernel&#34; programmers and &#34;application&#34; programmers was that kernel programmers recognized that unsafe code crashed the whole system, not just the application. So they tended to be cultivated from paranoid programmers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I freelance fixing and maintaining legacy web apps, almost always PHP.Anecdotally I see SQL injection vulnerabilities  in about half the code I look at. It’s one type of problem among many other problems and vulnerabilities in code written by amateurs and often copy/pasted.PHP programmers can find lots of resources online. Some of those are terrible, either very old or written by amateurs excited to show how they got something to work.I have seen the same kind of thing with Java and Python, but the popularity of PHP means there’s a lot of junk info and examples online.PHP has supported safe SQL and safe HTML for decades, but the programmer has to understand the problem and the solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago I found this video series on YouTube about how to build a PHP application from scratch. Ten hours worth of XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, badly coded authentication, you name it. When confronted, the instructor said that he did not want to confuse the beginners with all of that security stuff. I just thought &#34;ok&#34; and moved on.Now I went back to this guy&#39;s YouTube channel and saw that half a year later he finally did upload a bonus episode on how to mitigate SQL injections. One person in the comment section actually thanked him for the much needed video because their site was getting hacked. It is pretty hilarious to see this unfold but I do feel bad for the ~10k people who watched his videos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the Damn Interesting post here. Internally we worried that there would be some fallout from abandoning our Facebook page--by the numbers we had more followers there than any other social media platform, by far. But the response from our audience has been almost 100% positive, even from our Facebook followers[1]. It put only a tiny dent in our site&#39;s daily traffic. It resulted in many new subscribers to our email list. There was a flurry of new donations, with attached supportive comments about the amputation. Facebook was exactly the gangrenous thing it appeared to be, and we are better off without it. If you will permit me the indulgence of quoting my own post:&gt; Some call it a “necessary evil,” but if that’s the case let’s do all we can to make it unnecessary.For any organizations considering the same move, I cannot recommend it enough. It feels like cutting off contact with a toxic acquaintance--equal parts relief and optimism.[1] https://www.facebook.com/DamnInt/posts/10158097374656961"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just wish more people and especially companies would join this movement to leave.I hate that the city I live in has almost zero online presence.  If I want to sell something, everyone says &#39;use FB market.&#39;
As someone who refuses to, I have a ton of stuff waiting for the yearly yard sale.The neighborhood I live in also only posts updates to FB.  So cue the monthly surprise(garbage not picked up, road repaving, etc) and never knowing about it in advance.And don&#39;t get me started on companies with zero website and only some FB page.I know it&#39;s &#39;free&#39;, and at this point it feels petty, but I&#39;m literally holding out until the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Facebook is no longer showing all posts to people who intentionally subscribe to a page? If so, what, if anything, does “subscription” or “following” mean, then?I realize I’m showing my age here, but I remember when missing an issue of a paper “subscription” was cause for anger and resulted in an apology from the publisher (and usually a redelivered copy). But I also remember when “follow” meant “show me all new posts from this user” on Facebook, too, back before they fucked up the News Feed in the 2010s and turned it into their manure delivery system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just as a point of comparison, one of the programs San Francisco introduced during the pandemic was &#34;safe sleeping sites&#34;, which are parking lots where homeless can have their tent without it being periodically swept by police. To that, they add chemical toilets, a water supply and (I&#39;m not sure why) 24/7 security staff. For this, the city pays around $60k per tent site per year. I&#39;m not sure if this is in part due to some unsavory relationship between the org administering the program and some city official.
Recently the program was extended. It would be cheaper to rent apartments at current market rates, even in San Francisco.Our revealed preference seems to be that we&#39;d rather have homeless people live in tents than have poor people get free or nearly free housing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fundamental problem with Agile is the fundamental problem with all product development:The customer doesn&#39;t know what they wantAgile assumes as a first principal that including the customer throughout the development process will align the building team and the customer to come to the same conclusion.This is almost never actually true. Having built and managed a lot of products I can state fairly confidently that the amount of time the customer has, and clarity about the problem they want solved is orders of magnitude more ambiguous than is required to actually build and deliver something to their satisfaction.In my opinion successful products, and I mean ones with significant flywheels with customers and viral growth and stickiness are with few exceptions - accidents. It was someone who had an interesting thought and a lot of people for whom the product was good enough for their desire that they often didn&#39;t even know they hadYou can&#39;t write down how to do that, it&#39;s like asking a nobel prize winner how they came up with their discovery. It&#39;s not repeatable. Some people have better intuitions than others and these are the people who are repeatably successful with products. But it doesn&#39;t generalize.That said, the fundamental problem isn&#39;t wrong in theory, it&#39;s just naiive in practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Agile is a generic umbrella term that involves a vast array of complex, subtle knowledge and skills. It&#39;s like saying &#34;Engineer&#34;, or &#34;Chef&#34;. Each has a shared skillset, to be sure. But each category&#39;s members can&#39;t just work the same way at all jobs, and there&#39;s no book on how to be an Engineer or Chef everywhere.The Agile Manifesto is a failure at trying to make Agile happen because it can&#39;t tell you how to make it happen, because it varies wildly. No manager can read a book on how to &#34;Agile-ify&#34; their org, they have to apply their brains and figure out how their specific version of &#34;Agile&#34; will work. But the skill-set required to do this is not a Managerial skill, it is a lower-level-worker skill. But it&#39;s also a very advanced lower-level-worker skill.And that&#39;s why things like &#34;Agile&#34;, &#34;DevOps&#34;, etc will fail. People at the higher end have no clue how to make it happen, and people at the lower end who have an idea how to make it happen don&#39;t have the power to make the organizational changes to do so. You need a way for the lower-end people to tell the higher-end people what to do, and have the higher-end people listen to them, and make the changes happen. This is very hard in a traditional organizational hierarchy, because higher-end people have big egos and bigger concerns over things like politics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert on this subject, but I feel like &#34;agile&#34; could be summarized as &#34;a process for actively incorporating feedback early and often&#34;.That doesn&#39;t mean you need points or tshirt sizes or constant status meetings. You just need channels of communication with the right people and a chance to adapt to what they say."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Since the storage media in these IoT devices would not last long if true deletions were being performed constantly, “deleted” data is often simply invalidated and moved to an unused page in the block (in a process called “wear leveling”). These invalidated pages, which still contain the data, remain present until a block fills up with them and a true deletion is initiated.&gt;Accessing flash memory that has been factory reset in this way does require some amount of technical skill and specialized equipment, but nothing that is a real barrier to the average enthusiast working at home.By that logic my iPhone 11, my Android phone, my Mac or my Windows PC doesn&#39;t wipe personal content either after factory resetFeels like a bit clickbait-ishBut at least Macs have a built-in 7-pass erase option to comply with DOD standards https://techpatio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/disk-utilit..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This explanation infuriates me so much. 
They use technical terms and true technologies to lie about their security issues and measures. Flash memory should easily withstand north of 10k write/erase cycles, base on type.
Even if there was somehow some very low limit, users’ request to delete personal &amp; sensitive data should be honored and any cost.
But then again, we’re talking about people paying actual money to have these devices in their homes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"User/config partitions can be encrypted and factory reset can delete the user/config encryption key.  Minimizes writes to physical blocks, user data becomes unrecoverable.

Once you start enjoying the control over the system and data, you want to self host everything.The most important aspect is the security and you learn this by doing it.My entire self-host apps are hosted behind a private VPN called Pritunl, it provides self-hosted corporate VPN like setup where you can manage users and access to servers.I host these following apps/products right now:- Pritunl (corporate like VPN)- Superset (Analytics)- Bitwarden (Password Manager)- OpenVPN with Pihole (Personal VPN with Adblock)- Wireguard with Pihole (Personal VPN with Adblock)- Drone.io (CI/CD)- Posthog (Web Traffic Analytics)- Papercups (Web chat support)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article touches on something interesting: community hosting.I&#39;d like to explore that. Specifically, the idea of small communities where a group of people maintains the underlying tech, and - kicker here - everyone in the community knows more or less everyone else in the community.That offers a bit more security/safety/continuity than just self-hosting everything, while still not ceding control to a faceless corporation.Granted, there will always be other reliances outside of the community - like internet and electricity providers - but a line has to be drawn somewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest most successful and best run organizations I&#39;ve worked for have not worried about hosting their software. They&#39;re concerned with delivering value to customers and doing it quickly.The most fractured and worst run companies have been concerned with self-hosting and frankly they sympathized with a lot of the stuff I&#39;m seeing on here.But I recognize we still need people self-hosting because it drives innovation and competition. I believe there are ways of doing things well while self-hosting, but I&#39;m not sure what those ways are."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun fact: you can overload the Python import system to work with other languages that you create.I use this for my Python-based Lisp: https://github.com/shawwn/pymen/blob/ml/importer.py  import foo

checks for &#34;foo.l&#34;, and if found, compiles it to foo.py on the fly and imports that instead.It&#39;s so cursed. I love it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two things that are annoying about Python&#39;s import system.Number one is that relative imports are weird. My intuition about imports is good enough that I never bothered to learn all the rules explicitly, but sometimes something simple is just not possible and it bites me. I think the case is importing files relative to a script (and not running with python -m ...).Number two is, in order to do package management, you have to create a fake python installation and bend PYTHONPATH. Virtualenvs are the canonical way to do it, but to me it feels like a hack - the core language seems to wants all packages installed in /usr. So now I have all these virtualenvs lying around and they are detached from the scripts.Why couldn&#39;t the import system resolve versions, too? You could say `import foo &gt;= 1.0` and it would download it to some global cache, and the import the correct versions from the cache."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Python import system is by far the worst one I dealt with. Using Setup.py and regular or namespace packages, relative import, having complex sub packages and cross importing, running a script from somewhere inside one of your sub packages, and many more craps like these. Import system must be intuitive and easy to use!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In particles physics, they have a different explanation of electromagnetism that is also very natural, almost inevitable. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#Mathem... The explanation in particle physics is compatible with Quantum Mechanics and Special Relativity, but no one is sure about how to extend it to General Relativity. I&#39;m not sure how compatible is it with the proposal in the article discussed here.Non technical version (ELI25):In quantum mechanics the wavefunction Ψ is has complex values. If you multiply everything in the universe by -1, nothing changes because all the physical results use ΨΨ* (where * is the complex conjugation). You can also multiply everything by i or -i. Moreover by any other complex number of modulo 1 because ΨΨ* does not change. (The technical term for this is U(1) global gauge symmetry.)But you can be more ambitious and want to multiply each point of the universe by a different complex number of modulo 1. ΨΨ* does not change but the derivatives of Ψ change and they are also important. (When you use the same complex number everywhere, the derivatives is just a multiple of the original derivative. When you use a different number in each point, it changes.)The only way to fix the problem with the derivative is to add a new field A. When you and multiply each point of the universe by a different complex number of modulo 1, then A changes in a simple to calculate but not obvious way. The change in A fix the problem with the derivatives of Ψ.So now the equations of the universe with Ψ and A don&#39;t change when you make this change. (The technical term for this is U(1) local gauge symmetry.) When you write carefully how a universe like this look like, the new field A is electromagnetism. (Actually, you can get the electric field and magnetic field using the derivatives of A.)This explanation looks more complicated than the explanation of the article, but the article is full of technical terms that you really don&#39;t want to know, like:&gt; Riemann curvature tensor is more than just Ricci curvature—electromagnetic fields stretch and bend the spacetime"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert in GR, but the linked paper seems nonsensical[0]. It postulates a highly degenerate decomposition of the metric tensor, for which they postulate a contrived action which then seems to correspond to the Einstein-Hilbert, through mathematically unsound manipulations (how can you raise indices with the metric being nowhere even close to invertible?).Besides, how can you talk about unifying general relativity and electromagnetism without mentioning Kaluza-Klein theory[1]? And what about one of the most beautiful principles in physics, gauge invariance[2]?I don&#39;t want to be rude, but I&#39;m very curious as to how this got through peer review.0: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1956/1/...

2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is not really coherent. It seems like a bunch of random statements about physics, strung together without explanation. This paragraph for instance is a bunch of true-ish sentences but overall is gibberish:&gt;  The metric tensor of spacetime tells us how lengths determine in spacetime. The metric tensor also thus determines the curvature properties of spacetime. Curvature is what we feel as &#34;force.&#34; In addition, energy and curvature relate to each other through the Einstein field equations. Test particles follow what are called geodesics—the shortest paths in the spacetime."</p>

Asking because my military unit used individual cables to exaggerate numbers.  i.e. 6 strands at 1 mile would become &#34;6 miles of cable run&#34;.  Either way, great they are doing this.  I hope they prevent some fires and save some lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re taking a different approach in Australia (the state of Victoria specifically), and not only are we replacing bare wire overheads with buried cables [0], we are also implementing Rapid Earth Fault Current Limiter (REFCL) technology to lower the risk of bushfires due to downed wires. [1]When powerlines come into contact with the ground or a tree, arcing can occur. If the line remains live and continues arcing, the risk of fire is quite high.REFCL tech works by detecting the phase-to-earth faults that occur when a one of the three-phase powerlines breaks and falls to the ground. REFL instantly reduces the voltage on the fallen line, and boosts the voltage on the other two phases. REFCL will then test the faulted line after a few seconds, and if the fault was intermittent full service is restored. If not, the whole line is removed from service to prevent fires and make the line safe to work on.On Total Fire Ban days (very high risk of fire due to weather conditions), the REFCL settings operate at increased sensitivity.There&#39;s a requirement in Victoria that by 2023 all high risk zone substations have to install REFCL technology, and all HV customers connected to those zone subs have to be REFCL compliant (their equipment must be able to handle the over-voltages that occur during REFCL operation).[0] https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/electricity/powerline-replacem...[1] https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/safety-and-emergencies/powerli..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question I haven’t seen anyone address so far: how much can we expect this to reduce the frequency of wildfires? Intuitively, to me, the effect would seem to be negligible. All of the conditions for wildfires will remain in place. It’ll simply be something else that lights the spark. If it’s not power lines it’ll be lightning.So then to follow up: what is the point? To deflect blame from PGE? And who pays for it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the author that the real estate agent described something most people want, and not necessarily what the author himself wanted. I think it&#39;s unfortunate that the agent didn&#39;t hear what the author wanted and just pointed him to the general public&#39;s preference anyway.However, I disagree with his take that America&#39;s housing development model is to develop into outskirt suburbs, let middle class move in, let it deteriorate in 30 years, and build more outskirts.Now, maybe I live in California and things are different. In the bay area even old areas with very old houses rise in values, and in fact, they rise more than newer developments. Demand for housing everywhere in the bay area + surrounding areas are high regardless of how new they are and how deep in town or out in the outskirts they are. Areas developed 30+ years ago continue to have high demand from middle to wealthy families. These areas didn&#39;t just not deteriorate but have grown into larger and more modern areas and in some cases developed their own downtown.Admittedly California and bay area specifically is probably a bubble and behaves differently than much of America. But I have a feeling more than a few popular cities are going through something similar. Appleton might not be, and maybe he&#39;s right that the new development outskirts will deteriorate in 30 years, but I doubt that&#39;ll be the case in new developments around Phoenix or Denver."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"| All of America’s institutions are focused exclusively on churn.Planning prior to 1990s was predicated on the assumption of continued  upward mobility, middle class persistence and strength of US production of goods and services (a/k/a wealth).Instead, the US exported all of that to China, and praised its new service-led, consumer-based, greener economy. Of all the self-inflicted (likely fatal) wounds inflicted upon great societies throughout history, the civic ignorance (and arrogance) of our body politic is the greatest."</p>

I understand the overall point of the article, but I&#39;m having trouble parsing the last paragraph, where he seems to assume that one reading of that expression is somehow obvious. Is it the ship that&#39;s ephemeral, or the iceberg? (It seems like a reference to the Titanic, and at least in my mind, both the Titanic and the iceberg were ephemeral.)"</p>

Important structures like BRCA1 (a well-studied breast cancer associated protein) are just structures for the BRCT and RING domains surrounded by a low-confidence string of amino acids, likely shaped to be globular: https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P38398Maybe I was wrong for expecting the impossible here, but I was excited to see this specific structure and it appears that there is still work to do. Nevertheless, kudos to Deepmind on their amazing achievement and contributions to the field!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an ex biomedical researcher I was trying to think what protein I should enter and see, and couldn&#39;t come up with a protein that I know of, that didn&#39;t have a structure already (at least a crude one). That is, we roughly know how most known important proteins look like. This is an amazing tool, and will he indispensable in labs (I&#39;ll expect any lab to use this site at least once a year?) But it&#39;s not as transformative as some might think."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; In 1995, 2% of schizophrenia diagnoses in the country were associated with cannabis use disorder. In 2000, it increased to around 4%. Since 2010, that figure increased to 8%, the study found.Worded that way, causation isn&#39;t the first thing this suggests to me. If percentage of cases associated with marijuana rise, it could also be that a larger percentage of the population is smoking and admitting to smoking marijuana regularly. If cases themselves rise, it could also be increases in the percentage of cases that actually get diagnosed, etc.It could very well be that marijuana puts you at higher risk of schizophrenia - I certainly have an acquaintance in mind for whom recreational drug usage seems to have led them to a paranoid and narcissistic personality described here in other comments - but the connection in this article feels weak. Certainly weaker than the connection we see between marijuana law enforcement and the negative fallout of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can only speak from personal experience, which is of course limited.  I smoked occasionally in my 20s, but not since (I&#39;m middle-aged now).  I&#39;ve been friends and acquaintances with many people that smoke a lot.  I see a trend among these people - not necessarily schizophrenia (I&#39;m not a psychologist and probably wouldn&#39;t even notice a mild case) - but instead a consistent arrogance and self-importance.  It&#39;s peculiar - they may be contributing very little to society (or maybe a lot), but regardless there&#39;s a sense of superiority that seems to crop up among them all.  Maybe even narcissism?I could be completely wrong.  I don&#39;t express this to assert it, but rather to ask if anyone else has noticed anything similar."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As usual, a sensational headline averring a research article&#39;s causal hypothesis, of which the PI even calls for reproducibility. Reading such paltry science articles makes me really appreciate papers like Quanta, whose reporters seem to actually have a semblance of domain knowledge.Indeed, no discussion of the existing link between schizophrenia and tobacco smoking, in conjunction with the increased availability of marijuana?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On the Hotel California EffectIf it&#39;s expensive to move data out of AWS, it&#39;s not just about making it hard for customers to leave AWS. It means that any third-party service that wants to sell to AWS customers must also use AWS.For example, Snowflake can&#39;t really run its own data centers. They need to rent from AWS. If you&#39;re a company on AWS, you won&#39;t want to spend $0.08/GB sending things to Snowflake.The high egress cost gives Amazon a lot of power to keep the third-party ecosystem within AWS and without as much negotiating power on things like EC2 costs. Snowflake can&#39;t say to Amazon, &#34;if you don&#39;t give us a great discount, we&#39;re going to move our operations to DigitalOcean&#34; because Amazon would just say, &#34;no you&#39;re not. Your customers aren&#39;t going to pay $80/TB to load things into Snowflake when you&#39;re charging them $23-40/TB for storage. They&#39;d be paying 2-3.5x your storage costs just to load the data into your system!&#34; Yes, I&#39;m sure that Snowflake does get a discount from AWS, but having less negotiating power can make discounts smaller.There are other reasons to want a third party to use AWS if you&#39;re on AWS. Still, the egress pricing seems to make it very hard for third-party tech providers not to use AWS if their customers are using it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working in realtime games that require high bandwidth usage, AWS and basically every other public cloud is fundamentally unusable for us because of this exact problem. Our bare metal infrastructure for the Hypixel Minecraft network uses 3-4PB per month, so we simply lease a 100gbps transit link billed at 95th percentile.Last I checked, AWS wanted ~$200k per MONTH, for just bandwidth (no compute, memory, storage, or anything else). We&#39;d love to be able to use the cloud, but not at the cost of increasing our monthly expenses by an entire order of magnitude, so we just stick to bare metal colocation.I honestly believe that if you have the technical skill in-house, and are spending more than, say, $30k/mo on public cloud hosting, that you should seriously evaluate whether bare metal could significantly decrease your costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS Egress - $0.09/GBAzure Egress - $0.0875/GBGCP Egress - $0.11/GBAlibaba Egress - $0.123Interesting that no mention is made of the other cloud providers pricing here when AWS isn&#39;t even the most expensive egress...Oh! I wonder if it is because Cloudflare has data transfer agreements with GCP, Azure, and Alibaba! But that would mean this is a shoddy hit piece to strong arm AWS into an agreement with them. Nonsense, I&#39;m sure Cloudflare would never do that...Edit: I&#39;ve removed claims about Cloudfront&#39;s pricing since it isn&#39;t actually clear what they charge for egress and seems to vary on a number of factors. Thanks Dylan16807 for pointing that out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had this idea nearly 10 years ago when my wife and I started dating and she introduced me to (very amateur) birding. I even talked about contacting Cornell for their database. But it was always going to be a hobby project.So when she read about this a few weeks ago, she literally smacked me for not building it. Now if I tell her it&#39;s on the front page of Hacker News AND everyone here loves the idea even more, I&#39;m going to get another, harder smack because she knows how HN is full of others like me!(yes I&#39;m aware that this community more than others will agree that ideas by themselves are a dime a dozen, but nonetheless, it would&#39;ve been a really fun project)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly the kind of thing that keeps me coming back to HN year after year. 99% may be a quick, mildly entertaining read, but that 1% tends to be empowering or life changing for me. I&#39;ve had a continuously growing interest in plant and bird identification as a hobby (animals are a bit  easier). I&#39;ve gone so far as to research apps, put Audobon society books on my wishlist, and try to look up some specimens I see in my area. Unfortunately it&#39;s, frankly, a steep learning curve and not a habit yet for me to take pictures, remember to look at them later, search their characteristics, etc. This will be the perfect tool to help me jumpstart my newfound interest and get more familiar with the flora and fauna around my home."</p>

Probably that doesn&#39;t matter for the exports though since the paper and original version are both there.More interesting thing is that they&#39;ve been making the dataset available [3] for $20 (even before BirdNet).

I am sincerely sorry that this was the case. No offense was meant.@peteretep, you have my sincere apology. It was a flippant remark. At the time I wrote it (mid-1990s), Perl was the best way to write portable server-side code. I took the time to learn it, and got fairly good at it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In university, I learned Perl out of curiousity. It was the first scripting language I tried; I was only familiar with Java, C and Scheme at the time.After reading Programming Perl from cover-to-cover, I suddenly felt like I had superpowers. I probably would have felt the same if I&#39;d taken the time to learn bash scripting, but that&#39;s not how it worked out.I tried to automate everything in my life with Perl. I&#39;d walk to class in the morning and a script had already scraped and downloaded my lecture materials and sent a print job for me. It emailed me if it couldn&#39;t find notes for one of my scheduled classes. Others would manage my assignment submissions. I wrote scrapers to detect what events on campus might offer free food.This was the first time I felt like I could write programs that actually had the power to improve my life. It changed my perspective on what I had the power to do as a programmer. I&#39;ll always be grateful to Perl for that.I also learned how to quickly develop a thick programmer skin by asking questions on comp.lang.perl, but that&#39;s another topic altogether."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Syncthing is one of the &#34;fire and forget&#34; kind of programs. It takes some time to setup when doing for first time, but then you pretty much forget its there, and when you need it, you realise it has been chugging along doing its job.Two things I like about it in particular, are1. It can and favors syncing over local network. This has a huge cost savings in developing world. Even when you do have massive bandwidth, local network sync still has more throughput and lower latency. My music is shared between devices and if I add a track, it takes less than a second to appear on my other devices.2. You can set conditions, such that delets can be ignored. Eg. I have a WhatsApp message+media backup going back almost 7 years now, ~65GiB. But I don&#39;t need all that on my phone. So I just disable syncing delets on my storage. Now my phone can get away with ~3 GiB of whatsapp data (only because I don&#39;t delete very often) and I still have complete backup in case I need it.3. Absolute rock solid stable. At $DAYJOB we use syncthing to sync multi dozen GiBs of new data every day, total file count in 10s of thousands in about ~300 directories. And in past 5 years we have had about 3 instances where we had something that needed attention, out of which 2 were not syncthing&#39;s fault.I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years and have absolutely zero complaints against it. Everyone with 2 or more devices should give it a try, just to see there are better options out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years now, between ~10 Linux servers, Linux desktops, Linux and Windows laptops and Android smartphones, over LAN, wired and wireless Internet.I&#39;m synchronizing less than 100 MiB of data, but it&#39;s changing all the time. I&#39;ve not yet had a single issue with it. I&#39;ve a few conflicts every week when the same file is changed in different locations at the same time, but Syncthing keeps all versions of a file until I resolve the conflicts; I can&#39;t see how it could handle that better.Long story short: I highly recommend this tool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On of my favorite program, and it keeps getting better.You can even set an encryption key per share, and if you want to use an untrusted device in your nodes, you can simply not provide it with the encryption key and it will simply synchronize the encrypted payload across nodes.So if you have a shady/cheapo VPS, you can use its storage without worrying about the plaintext data being stored there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fantastic blog post. I highly recommend reading it in full, and also checking out the work of the European Spreadsheet Risks Group, and Felienne Hermans specifically (referenced in the original post). I&#39;ve been working on a spreadsheet startup [1] for the past 8 months or so and those folks have a large amount of absolutely upsetting-but-helpful research on spreadsheet usage/errors.After the past few years working with spreadsheet power users, here&#39;s how I like to think about them:
1. Most spreadsheets are just used a lists/trackers [2].
2. Some spreadsheets are very calculation heavy, and are better understood as complex software projects (usually modeling something; s/o to those PE mfs) than as anything else.
3. Spreadsheets make the transition between (simple list/tracker) and (complex software project very fluid. This flexibility usually means that the (complex software project) that is created is buggy as hell.Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users an incredible visibility into their data. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users a way to program data transformations in what I would argue is the most generally intuitive way that exists. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users tools to build software without introducing them to proper software development methods. Ya know, like maybe a test. Or a code review. Or no global variables. Etc.If you want to see how we&#39;re attacking the spreadsheet problem, check us out. Feedback highly appreciated! [1][1] https://trymito.io/hn

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;000s of rows of data in a spreadsheet - sigh. But say &#39;database&#39; to some people and they hear &#39;The Devil&#39;.Excel is a glorious tool which welcomes all, the savvy and the unskilled but imaginative newbies alike. There is something about all those little cells that presents an itch everyone wants to scratch, and you just know that for some that scratching is going to produce something akin to a spreadsheet version of gangrenous melanoma.On the other hand, some people are happy to say that the complexity of sophisticated Excel models means they would have been better off built in a code interface. Ha ha ha!Even with the right mix of functional and object-oriented code and suitable documentation and version control applied to code, I respectfully disagree.Data handling capabilities could benefit from skill in all of these tools: error checking (including analytical review); pen &amp; paper; calculators; databases; spreadsheets; math &amp; stat techniques; Word processors (&amp; clear logical explanations).Together, they form a rich menagerie of tools which will probably all be around until we have an AI that follows us around and we just tell it what we want. Actually, even then, it would be good to know them so that we can grasp the underlying logic and frame the concepts leading to the actions that we ask the AI to assist with..."</p>

I had credits at large companies, posted talks online (interviewers rarely looked at them), but if I forgot how to write binary search in 10 minutes in an interview it didn’t matter.This actually made me realize being just an IC wasn’t actually my goal though. Once I started interviewing for management and sales, all of those things _really_ mattered. Now that I’m running workshops and talks professionally, posting publicly is _critical_.Moral of the story: if you enjoy posting in public and teaching in public, but you feel like its getting you nowhere career wise, maybe you are in the wrong career like I was.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two modes of hiring:1. General purpose: Typical FANG like where hire first and then do team matching later2. Targeted hiring: Companies want specific people and they try to recruit themA sizable number of top open-source contributors get recruited are in #2. Eg. 1) Top contributors in Rust lang hired by AWS. 2) FANG companies targeting top AI researchers from academia.One&#39;s open-source presence needs to be really prolific and the project has to make an large impact to be in #2 category.For #1 category folks, your public profile does not matter that much (atleast for FANG companies)Other way to think is #1 are treated as cattle, #2 are treated as pets.The famous incident where author of homebrew was rejected by a top company because he could not invert a binary tree got in the wrong channel (#1) to begin with where he was treated as a cattle.Note: Recruiter from FANG calling you still goes in #1 category for most people"</p>

I&#39;m very lucky because I can talk about things on the spot very easily. If that&#39;s not you, make a list of the few main points that you want to talk about and try to memorize it. If you always get the same questions, it may be a good idea to address them before people even ask them, or to memorize an answer to them too.I really underestimate the amount of stress that can be felt when you&#39;re alone facing 6 people for a job that you want. I don&#39;t have a good answer on how to handle it, although I think having my canned answer ready helped. It got better once this started to be a conversation. The good part is that I developed a lot of empathy for people that talk about interview stress.It&#39;s going to be my first &#34;real&#34; job so these are probably obvious, but it might help someone so I&#39;d rather share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In his reflections, Brewster Kahle mentions his goal of creating “a library available to anybody, anywhere in the world.” He doesn’t mention, though, the costs of making that library available to the world for free or the fact that the Internet Archive accepts donations. So I will:https://archive.org/donate/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice they&#39;re there. At the same time, it&#39;s amazingly easy for content to be removed from there - if someone objects or even if things are murky.For example, all content from the old ezboard site was been removed based on the configuration of the current URL owners&#39; robots.txt, and current URL owner is just a domain parker. Ezboard hosted a lot of content back in the day.https://archive.org/post/560730/ezboard-is-there-any-hope"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Deploying k8s has gotten a lot easier these days -- some alternatives in this space:- https://docs.k0sproject.io (https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s)- https://k3s.io (https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/)k0s is my personal favorite and what I run, the decisions they have made align very well with how I want to run my clusters versus k3s which is similar but slightly different. Of course you also can&#39;t go wrong with kubeadm[0][1] -- it was good enough to use minimally (as in you could imagine sprinkling a tiny bit of ansible and maintaining a cluster easily) years ago, and has only gotten better.[0]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/[1]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried a few incarnations of self-hosted k8s a few years ago, and the biggest problem I had was persistent storage. If you are using a cloud service they will integrate k8s into whatever persistent storage they offer, but if you are self-hosting you are left on your own, it seems most people end up using something like nfs or hostPath - but that ends up being a single point of failure. Have there been any developments on this recently, aimed at people wanted to run k8s on a few RaspberryPi nodes?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Full disclaimer - I&#39;m an engineer at Talos, but I believe it&#39;s pretty relevant here)If folks are interested in this kind of K8s deployment, they might also be interested at what we&#39;re doing at Talos (https://talos.dev). We have full support for all of these same environments (we have a great community of k8s-at-home folks running with Raspberry Pis) and a bunch of tooling to make bare metal easier with Cluster API. You can also do the minikube type of thing by running Talos directly in Docker or QEMU with `talosctl`.Talos works with an API instead of SSH/Bash, so there&#39;s some interesting things about ease of use when operating K8s that are baked in like built-in etcd backup/restore, k8s upgrades, etc.We&#39;re also right in the middle of building out our next release that will have native Wireguard functionality and enable truly hybrid K8s clusters. This should be a big deal for edge deployments and we&#39;re super excited about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an employee of Hashicorp, I&#39;m very excited for this change. Not that Mitchell was anything less than a great leader—on the contrary, I thought he was excellent. It&#39;s just that he&#39;s also got such a great ability to identify the right abstractions when tackling a problem. The fact that he&#39;ll be &#34;in the trenches&#34;, so to speak, gives me even more confidence that Hashicorp will continue to make tools that strike a nice balance between power and simplicity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done. A very graceful and transparent announcement.I decided to leave senior leadership and return to IC engineering work last year. I was met with shock and, frankly, negative feedback from my peers. It has been a difficult transition, and it&#39;s easy to miss the benefits of leadership, but I knew engineering was the right place for me.It was difficult to do this as a veritable nobody, I can&#39;t even imagine the difficulty of the decision for Mitchell. I wish him luck and continued success."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a great guy. At Hashiconf a few years ago he was just one of the normal people, a load of us all went to the speakers’ dinner and he just found a seat and sat down - opposite me, as it happened, and we had a laugh. Armon is a top chap too, we would talk motorbikes if I ever bump into him. Their tech skills are top-notch and I wish them the best of luck. So many tech companies would be better off this way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m “unlocking” that this will be dead within 18 months. It will get too hard and bored engineers will head back to Google Corp where the promotion game is better.I’m in manufacturing. Machinery is highly specialised. Making a generic robot without taking up huge amount of floor space and/or huge leaps in programming is like… Kubernetes being good for hosting your moms book club blog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Makes sense. The end state appears to be that humans should only be supervising ML that generates goal and outcome based behaviors for robots, and the machines will construct tools to solve problems themselves.The leap from an AI model learning how to replicate a behaviour (e.g. evolving walking to solve problems https://unitylist.com/p/2id/walking-ai ) to reasoning about it in terms of actuators and physical feedback, to assembling a physical model out of a relatively small list of parts seems like a solvable engineering problem when it is broken out into a pipeline.Those robot parts are basically a version of mechano with actuators that a model would map a behavior to, and the robots in the article would assemble them. When you look at something like Lego or Mechano as an intermediate representation to construct buildings out of, where all objects made from it are essentially a directed graph of those elements, robots designing and building robots seems like less than 20 years away.e.g. we could functionally specify to an ML model, &#34;produce a digraph of these element parts that has these degrees of freedom, and then load or derive a model that solves for this outcome within the domain of those degrees, where outcome is &#39;plug cables into a board&#39; &#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s sort of mentioned, but not emphasized in this review that connection dropouts happen every few minutes for a few seconds. That makes starlink fine for any kind of asynchronous content like web browsing, torrenting or video streaming, but unusable for video calls, stream hosting, voip, or online gaming. It&#39;s implied that this is due to the trees obstructing a full view of the sky, but I have actually heard these connection dropouts are just about universal due to the constellation not having enough infill. Just a warning that for most of us we are still several hundred satellites short and some connection handoff updates away from this being a useful internet connection.I have a property where Starlink would be perfect and I would pay triple the price to be able to do zoom calls over the connection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had Starlink for about 6 months and it is a massive improvement on upload speed at 10-25 Mb. Download speed is a mixed bag wildly oscillating from 5 to 100 Mb and back. It&#39;s okay for downloading things but it&#39;s terrible for any sort of video conferencing. There are brief dropouts on average every 6 minutes or so and my obstruction map is better than the author&#39;s. My neighbor up the street got slightly better service by mounting his dishy on a 20-ft antenna pole above his house.Local ground service is 20 Mb download and 2 Mb upload. And that&#39;s just barely sufficient for watching streaming video and video conferencing. Gigabit service is but a mile and a half away but no one is going to pay to lay the fiber into our neighborhood. So the last mile and a half is copper from 20 years ago. I think that&#39;s going to require political will to fix and I don&#39;t think that political will exists right now nor will it in the near future. We could have paid $5,000 per house to lay it ourself but our own neighborhood couldn&#39;t come to consensus on that. Now imagine that at a national level.So if they just deliver 100/100 within a year or two, this is an epic win IMO and I will cancel ground service. And if they don&#39;t someone else will so I&#39;m not worried. But it took Teslas to spark the electric vehicle industry. Now there&#39;s a lot of choice. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if something similar happens here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m typing this message from Starlink. For me it&#39;s absolutely transformative; 10x the bandwidth I can get from any other source and very reliable.Except for outages related to obstructions. That&#39;s a real problem and the author&#39;s situation is not good. There&#39;s ways to work around it on your property; a taller mount, a tree install, cutting some trees. But ultimately Dishy needs a clear view to the north and there&#39;s no getting around it.I have some smaller obstructions for my install and it was a little annoying but fine. But in the past week or two it&#39;s gotten way better: my packet loss went from 2% to 0.6%. Details here: https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/2021/07/20/starlink-improve..."</p>

This is one of my chief annoyances with Lenovo&#39;s connector, and it smacks of planned obsolescence, since there is no other conceivable reason for it. I think every brick I&#39;ve had has failed in the same spot: between the connector and cord at the laptop, which, of course, is the non-replaceable cable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article doesn&#39;t mention it - and I can&#39;t find it anywhere - but in any neighborhood what is the highest proportion of units that are short-term rentals. Five percent? Ten percent in the super touristy areas? I have no idea and even before the other flaws in the study I am skeptical than anything short of 20% would make an impact on any major attribute of an area.I see one stat in the paper that &#34;40% of buildings had airbnb listings in some tracts&#34; but if the buildings had 10 units in them each this still may mean a relatively small number of total listings were from Airbnbs. In fact, even in Boston there are some tracts where I suppose that the average building must have 30+ units which would meant that if 60% of buildings had no listing the total percentage of listings that are Airbnbs is relatively small.&gt;higher levels of violent crime did not appear immediately after Airbnb listings became available to tourists, but rather developed over the course of several years, the researchers said.Alternative theory. Every area had some Airbnbs. In neighborhoods that were being wealthier/more popular/had more jobs decided it was easier to just do long-term rentals. In areas where landlords had trouble renting them out to anyone long-term (because locals know if a neighborhood is nice or not) they turned more units into Airbnbs because outsiders don&#39;t know/don&#39;t care."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh. This appears to be one of those cases of media exaggeration for eyeballs. The study says:&gt; the effect on violence was only consistent visible for the measure of Airbnb penetration–or the extent to which buildings in the neighborhood have one or more listings (and for the measure of density, or the listings per household in the two-year lags). It was never present for overall usage, or the estimated quantity of Airbnb guestsAnd&gt; A second and related concern could be the potential bias due to omitted variables. Though the DID models control for the initial conditions of neighborhoods, they do not necessarily control for trends in these variables that parallel the increases in both Airbnb presence and crime. For example, there is some evidence that gentrifying neighborhoods experience increases in certain types of crimeAnd&gt; we have tested this hypothesis in a single citySo there&#39;s apparently a correlation between a single metric and a single class of crime in a single city, and there&#39;s a multi-year delay in the effect. The author speculates that erosion of social fabric is the culprit, but doesn&#39;t actually back this theory up with either data or references. One would at least expect some references to some other study about the correlations on emigration and violence (my two cents here is that it feels more likely that the former is caused by the latter, if a correlation exists at all). They even acknowledge that the correlation could be due to a factor that isn&#39;t being accounted for.But then the article writer drops all nuance and blasts a title pegging blame squarely on AirBnB, even though it isn&#39;t even established that correlation is consistently true everywhere, let alone causation.I mean, yeah, I get that people don&#39;t like predatory real estate renting, and want to hear that there&#39;s a neatly convenient evil entity to blame, but come on now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m really surprised that Blizzard thinks a state suit against them for sexual discrimination, harassment, and a litany of odious behaviors by managers is best answered by calling them &#34;unaccountable State bureaucrats,&#34; as they did in their PR damage control release. It&#39;s like they think it&#39;s 1995 and MeToo never happened.In the suit, the state even attempted a mediated resolution to prevent it from going to court. But Blizzard refused to cooperate, essentially taunting the state to bring a case, which they now have.It really makes you question whether Bobby Kotick is the right guy as CEO. Not only did he fail to demonstrate ethical leadership, but his handling of this crisis is massively destructive of shareholder value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blizzard&#39;s full response: &#34;The DFEH includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past. We have been extremely cooperative with the DFEH throughout their investigation, including providing them with extensive data and ample documentation, but they refused to inform us what issues they perceived. They were required by law to adequately investigate and to have good faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation, but they failed to do so. Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court. We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Story time!I grew up in eastern Europe in the communist era, in a country where entire factories were run using Commodore 64 computers that were smuggled in, bypassing export controls and sanctions.The programmer at one such factory was a friend of my father, and we&#39;d go over to his place for dinner semi-regularly. He didn&#39;t have kids, and I was six, so I was bored to tears. No toys and nobody my age to play with!He did have a C64, which was the only other one in town apart from the one at the factory. He was using it to practice programming after-hours at home. There were no games on it, but he did have a book of games.As in: a literal printed book of the source code for several simple games. That you were supposed to type in to be able to play!So I did. I had nothing else to do, so I whiled away the hours while the adults chatted poking away at the keyboard, typing in the BASIC code of the shortest, simplest game first.It didn&#39;t work at first. There were some errors. With help, I fixed the typos, and hey presto, the game worked! I still remember the elation, the feeling of accomplishment after all that work. I didn&#39;t even play the game for more than a minute or so, I immediately got to work on entering the next, longer game&#39;s code. I was hooked.Eventually I tried all three or four of the games in the book, and got bored. However, I was allowed to borrow the BASIC introductory problem set book, which I took back home with me to study. I solved the problems one at a time on grid paper (to match the fixed-width screen layout). I &#34;ran&#34; the programs in my head, debugged them by working out the variable values step by step on paper, and then tested my solutions on the real C64 computer whenever my parents went over for a social dinner. Most of my programs worked, and ran at ludicrous speed compared to the glacial pen &amp; paper solutions I had worked out. I instantly understood that Computers were levers for the mind. Learning to control that raw power was intoxicating.We fled across the iron curtain as political refugees, and I took that textbook with me. I had no access to computers for nearly a year, but when we finally got settled permanently in the West my dad bought a used C64 at a garage sale for a few dollars. This was a computer that back in my homeland would be the carefully guarded control hub of a factory. Here it was a discarded plaything. Even at that age, that blew my mind.I learned more programming languages in quick succession. Pascal at the age of 11, C and Assembly at 12, C++ at 13. I had written 3D engines by the time I went to University.Statistically, if you know programming, you probably learned it in a tertiary education setting, most likely in your late teens or early twenties. Just like learning a foreign language at that age, you&#39;ll never be perfectly fluent. You&#39;ll always have an accent, no matter what you do.To me, programming is my mother tongue. I&#39;m perfectly fluent and unaccented. You probably can&#39;t even tell, you can&#39;t hear the difference.Programming for you is something you do at work.I&#39;ve had dreams in C++"</p>

When you look at his character model the proportions make more sense once you know that they were designed to fill out a spherical shape. How many companies would change the character design of their most iconic franchise to make their physics engine simpler?"</p>

Maybe it would work better as a wiki, or could start as such."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"TI is Telematik Infrastruktur. So TI-Messenger is just a messenger running on the VPN used for patient-data.It&#39;s good to see this happening. One of the biggest German healthcare contractors - famous for terrible code - had managed to creep their S/MIME demo implementation derivative code as a standard for secure communication in the healthcare world. With a MITM at each Kassenaerztliche Vereinigung(i.e. the people that represent the doctors and that charge ~2% per transaction for charging the public insurance companies). So it&#39;s unaudited &#34;E2E&#34; with a MITM by design. Given the complexity of this codebase, I do hope that they just use it unmodified.EDIT: one of the reasons why the KVs rolls/ed their own is because of inherent distrust between the physicians or the institution representing them and the governments health ministry getting that data. They believe that the government is incentivizing hospitals to take over physicians share of the cake. I wouldn&#39;t say that the distrust is misplaced, but unfortunately these crappy half baked own solutions born out of nepotism don&#39;t help their case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d be curious what a better alternative looks like.I&#39;m a huge fan of keeping things simple (vertically scaling 1 server with Docker Compose and scaling horizontally only when it&#39;s necessary) but having learned and used Kubernetes recently for a project I think it&#39;s pretty good.I haven&#39;t come across too many other tools that were so well thought out while also guiding you into how to break down the components of &#34;deploying&#34;.The idea of a pod, deployment, service, ingress, job, etc. are super well thought out and are flexible enough to let you deploy many types of things but the abstractions are good enough that you can also abstract away a ton of complexity once you&#39;ve learned the fundamentals.For example you can write about 15 lines of straight forward YAML configuration to deploy any type of stateless web app once you set up a decently tricked out Helm chart.. That&#39;s complete with running DB migrations in a sane way, updating public DNS records, SSL certs, CI / CD, having live-preview pull requests that get deployed to a sub-domain, zero downtime deployments and more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Kubernetes outsider, I get confused why so much new jargon had to be introduced. As well as so many little new projects coupled to Kubernetes with varying degrees of interoperability. It makes it hard to get a grip on what Kube really is for newcomers.It also has all the hallmarks of a high-churn product where you need to piece together your solution from a variety of lower-quality information sources (tutorials, QA sites) rather than a single source of foolproof documentation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the basic problem with *nix is its permission model.  If we had truly separable security/privilege/resource domains then Linux wouldn&#39;t have needed containers and simple processes and threads could have sufficed in place of Borg/docker/Kubernetes.There&#39;s a simpler and more powerful security model; capabilities.  Capabilities fix 90% of the problems with *nix.There&#39;s currently no simple resource model.  Everything is an ad-hoc human-driven heuristic for allocating resources to processes and threads, and is a really difficult problem to solve formally because it has to go beyond algorithmic complexity and care about the constant factors as well.The other *nix problem is &#34;files&#34;.  Files were a compromise between usability and precision but very few things are merely files.  Devices and sockets sure aren&#39;t.  There&#39;s a reason the &#39;file&#39; utility exists; nothing is really just a file.  Text files are actually text files + a context-free grammar (hopefully) and parser somewhere, or they&#39;re human-readable text (but probably with markup, so again a parser somewhere).Plenty of object models have come and gone; they haven&#39;t simplified computers (much less distributed computers), so we&#39;ll need some theory more powerful than anything we&#39;ve had in the past to express relationships between computation, storage, networks, and identities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on engineering productivity research and measurement at Google for two years until about a month ago. (Opinions my own.) Compared to my former colleagues, I&#39;m an infant in this area, so take this with a heaping of salt.In general, I think the author&#39;s cynicism about productivity research is justified, but I think it could have been directed more productively. (NB: the following comments say nothing about areas of software engineering research outside of productivity.)Commercial software engineering is a creative endeavor; it is not a science, nor is it a manufacturing process. It does not have natural, universal laws. What makes a team &#39;productive&#39; varies massively based on constraints imposed by business model, product, customer expectations, leadership values, and of course the individuals of which it consists.I do not believe in the possibility of a &#34;General Theory of Productivity.&#34; I&#39;m highly skeptical of attempts to quantify the precise relationship between error discovery stage and cost in a way that is generalizable, although I think it might be possible given a large group of engineers using a highly homogenous process, tools, and accounting. Google is pretty close to this (common dev infrastructure across tens of thousands of engineers), and even across Google this kind of generalization would be extremely difficult.There is no universal physics of software engineering. As a result, academic research into productivity can be difficult to generalize (which is why, I think, you often see researchers twisting themselves into knots). Instead, my rec is to focus on a few key metrics that are aligned with your business&#39; or team&#39;s goals (search for DORA for a good starting set) and to reflect often on what you feel makes your team work well and what doesn&#39;t."</p>

It got me comparing precision machine design to  software engineering.A big part of why we&#39;re able to design extremely precise machines (the author worked on a lathe used for machining optical parts for the National Ignition Facility) is because we can characterize exactly where errors will come from (e.g. structure isn&#39;t rigid enough, temperature variation causes parts to expand by different amounts, parts not round or flat enough, etc.). Once we know what errors we need to control and their rough order of importance we can start improving the machine design to control them better.In theory, something similar could be done in software engineering (formal methods are part of this, but not a full solution). Rather than an error budget, you&#39;d have some sort of bug budget, where you tracked what sort of bugs were caused by what sort of constructs, and design your program in such a way to minimize their chance of being introduced. I&#39;ve never heard of anyone except Dan Bernstein[1] actually doing anything approximating this. Probably because the perceived level of effort is too high.I actually don&#39;t think it would take that much effort, but it would require quite a bit of organization to track where bugs are introduced and what their root causes are. This is probably why Bernstein, an individual, is able to do this, while no large team (that I&#39;m aware of) has done anything similar.Of course, just like your toaster doesn&#39;t need to use precision machine design techniques (an over-engineered toaster is a bad toaster), most software doesn&#39;t need the effort/expense of a rigorous design process either, but some would benefit from it.[0]: https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/9414[1]: https://cr.yp.to/djb.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went into this software engineering productivity research rabbit hole a decade ago and came away similarly depressed with the lack of rigor in our field.What I’ve come to believe:- Software engineering is not an engineering discipline, it is a craft. It may or may not one day become an engineering discipline, I find this impossible to tell.- The difference between a feature and a bug is largely one of semantics, not of substance. A defect is a mismatch between expected behavior and actual behavior. A bug is when the expectation was that of the programmer that wrote the code. A feature request is when the expectation was that of a user. There is no real difference for the user between a missing feature and a broken feature. Hence why we so often get side-tracked into fruitless “bug or feature” discussions and why users don’t care when we say it is by design.- Errors will happen. People are flawed and produce errors at a more or less set average rate for each person (unless they’re tired or enjoying a ballmer peak). Errors in every step of the process, from design to deployment, are inevitable. We can however catch these inevitable errors, with automated error detection tools, or by having a fresh set of eyes look at the work. The consequence is that making high quality software necessitates taking a look at the whole process and introducing error detection steps in every part of it, whether they be automated like linters and unit tests, or human like design and code review or mentoring and pair programming.- Errors in design are more costly because they cause entire features to need to be written or rewritten, which is the most costly kind of defect to resolve. We do not need research to know this to be true. We solve this by having short feedback loops with real users, which is the only real form of agile development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See the section titled “What the Magnuson-Moss Act Does Not Require” of the FTC’s “Businessperson’s Guide to Federal Warranty Law”[1] to understand why this is not even close to “enforcing right to repair”. Aside from the fact that the FTC can’t enforce a right to repair law that doesn’t exist, the promise to enforce the Magnuson-Moss Act doesn’t even scratch the surface of what right to repair aims to accomplish. For example, farmers who have famously campaigned for right to repair for years (decades?) aren’t covered by the Act because their equipment is for commercial, not consumer, use.Edit: Even though I think it’s beyond ridiculous to paint this as “right to repair” I am absolutely going to report Microsoft’s Xbox to the FTC for their egregious Magnuson-Moss violations. Maybe that stupid sticker will finally disappear.[1]https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/bus..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;First, the Commission urges the public to submit complaints and provide other information to aid 
in greater enforcement of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and its implementing regulations. 
While current law does not provide for civil penalties or redress, the Commission will consider 
filing suit against violators of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act to seek appropriate injunctive 
relief.&#34;&#34;Second, the Commission will scrutinize repair restrictions for violations of the antitrust laws. For 
example, certain repair restrictions may constitute tying arrangements or monopolistic 
practices—such as refusals to deal, exclusive dealing, or exclusionary design—that violate the 
Sherman Act.8 Violations of the Sherman Act also violate the prohibition on unfair methods of 
competition codified in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. &#34;We&#39;ve had these laws on the books for a long time. I&#39;m not confident that they&#39;re going to be effectively applied, unless the FTC has significantly increased in size and capability recently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I bombed an interview at a game company because I gave a right answer that I couldn&#39;t get them to understand.I don&#39;t remember the exact problem they wanted me to solve, but the answer involved a dynamic collection and they wanted it to grow with constant time complexity. They were probably looking for a linked list. But I said I&#39;d use a dynamic array because those have constant time when averaged over a series of appends.I don&#39;t know if I remembered the term &#34;amortized complexity&#34; or not, but it was clear that they had never heard of doing amortized analysis across a series of operations and they absolutely did not get my answer. They got hung up on the idea that some appends force the array to grow and get copied. I tried to explain that that was only true for a predictable fraction of them, but they were stuck on the idea that this meant dynamic arrays had O(n) worst case performance. They clearly thought I didn&#39;t know what the hell I was talking about.I&#39;m pretty sure that was the point where they decided to pass on me.But now I&#39;m a senior software engineer at Google and I just finished writing a textbook that explains dynamic arrays including their amortized analysis, so joke&#39;s on them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t really comment on whether that was the correct way to handle the situation, given that passing the interview was the goal. However, I would have a hard time giving an incorrect answer on purpose. I also consider an interview as an opportunity to learn about the company I&#39;m going to work for, and especially my future colleagues.I would probably try to give a full answer, such as &#34;there&#39;s a widely-held concept X, but my understanding is that this is not completely correct, and in fact a better model is Y.&#34; A technical lead that can&#39;t work with an answer like that is one I probably don&#39;t want to work with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s not a lot of context given about the behaviors exhibited in this interview, but as many others here have said, red flags abound in this anecdote.&gt; But the problem was, that this guys manager was sitting next to him. If he didn’t know, I would totally humiliate him in front of his boss. So either he would stick to his guns and refuse the correctness of my answer, to save face. Or he needed to agree that he was wrong, and lose face.I would love to ask the author if their team lead ever confirmed these suspicions. I would doubt it, but happy to amend my position if wrong. Regardless, to me this sounds like the exact type of culture I wouldn&#39;t want a new hire bringing in. I don&#39;t need to be managed or protected, especially from my own manager. I need honest answers, not what I want to hear. I wasn&#39;t in the room, I can&#39;t read the vibes like the author did, but I&#39;ll consider the omissions here telling-- there&#39;s no description of an anxious or frazzled team lead, or an imperious manager peering down. It seems like the only thing the author saved the team lead from were problems in their own head."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The other peril of M1 ownership is the lack of alternative operating systems. The other way I reinstalled an older Macbook through &#34;internet recovery&#34; and it downloaded the version it was originally shipped with - macOS Mojave.The UI was a breath of fresh air compared to Big Sur. Despite the screen being smaller than my M1 the information density was higher and it felt more like a tool than a toy. The lack of bullshit apps such as Apple TV, News &amp; co and useless &#34;widgets&#34; was also good (for all of iTunes&#39; flaws, it&#39;s still better than its modern successors), and it somehow felt faster despite being less than half the processing power of the M1.I now wish I could run this on my M1 but alas I can&#39;t. At least with PCs and older Macs you could always switch to Windows or Linux, but with the M1 you&#39;re currently screwed - if Apple drops the ball or decides to take their OS in a direction you don&#39;t like you currently have no alternative (and all the &#34;security&#34; around locking out the user from their own machine doesn&#39;t bode well for alternative OSes)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow I&#39;m so happy I&#39;m moving away from Mac administration. I currently manage a big userbase but we still don&#39;t have M1s in our environment as our antivirus solution (Cylance) is really slow in supporting it.Apple is introducing more and more mechanisms in the name of security but they keep access and information very close to their heart. All us Mac admins have struggled with SecureToken in combination with AD accounts and it took two major releases for Apple to actually introduce a way for us to manage these properly through MDM. In the mean time most information had to be gathered through blogs such as this one.Another issue is that more and more enterprise management features are becoming dependent on managed (federated) Apple IDs. But Apple requires that the email and identifying account address (UPN) are the same which will never happen in our 200k user environment. So we&#39;re stuck with more and more things to work around.This is really something that should have been considered from the start. And this owner key thing sounds worse. Security is good but the end user or corporate admin should have the keys to every lock. Not just the vendor. Now my successor can deal with this stuff.I used to be a big fan of macOS personally too but I moved over to FreeBSD 2 years ago and I&#39;m glad I did. I really want an OS that answers to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like these changes have good intentions (i.e. improved security), but introduce a lot of complexity that can have unintended consequences for end-users. This reminds me somewhat of my process setting up UEFI Secure Boot on my Windows PC that wasn&#39;t originally configured for it. Not in the exact steps, but in that there is a ton going on behind the scenes and the UX is horrendously bad.Unfortunately, vendors haven&#39;t really thought about how to explain these changes to end-users. They are trying to make them fairly transparent, which probably works at least 95% of the time, but for a small percentage of people, becomes a big PITA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fire up the throwaway!Not 100% related to the article, but directly related.I worked as developer for a product in the same niche (&#34;democratizing adult content&#34;). I spent almost 2 years working on the frontend, devops, and building out the  analytics engine (all pre-covid).Anyway, on to the comment at hand.We had a small number of users compared to OnlyFans (when I left, there were about 20K active content creators). The average monthly payment was $5000 (skewed massively by the top 5%).We had phone support for our larger creator. One very common request was to instantly delete all data and stop processing future orders. Usually, the requester was in a pretty agitated/distraught state (I&#39;d occasionally get escalated calls to &#34;confirm&#34; that all data would be deleted ASAP and no copies would be kept).I spoke to a few of our creators and most would be desperate to scrub all of their content form the internet because:a) A parent/relative found out.b) A fellow employee at their 9-5 stumbled on their account.c) A &#39;fan&#39; went nuclear and was waging all out digital war. One creator had a former subscriber sending data dumps to all their Facebook and Instagram friends (they also spammed every public email address at their &#39;normal&#39; workplace, which was a local government).We would occasionally get demanding letters requesting the removal of content from third party sites (Pornhub, Reddit, etc). The creators would somehow be surprised when they realised we couldn&#39;t remove content from other websites.The experience was very depressing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So our kids are getting older so I&#39;ve been paying more attention to popular social networks and it&#39;s wild how many YouTubers, Twitch&#39;ers, TikTok&#39;ers, Instagram&#39;ers have OF content directly linked from their non-porn bios.I don&#39;t like it, but I&#39;m not sure what a good solution is. I mean, people are free to do what they&#39;d like, but it&#39;s hard to police screen time 100% of the time and their peer group has a lot more access than they do so even if I can block it 100$ they&#39;ll be exposed to it somewhere else. We&#39;ve talked about it and I feel like that&#39;s all I can do now. I just hate how normalized it feels when many of their social media &#34;role models&#39; turn to porn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not anti-sex or anti-sex work, but I think onlyfans is evil.  They have a business model, that is perfected to extract as much money from whales as possible.  Performers appear to have ‘relationships’ with their subscribers, encourage them to tip, buy ‘customs’, and ‘engage’ with them.These sad lonely sexless men spend all their money on this shit.  It consumes them, until they are out of money, then it destroys them.  It warps their expectations of relationships further impacting their datability, driving them even more towards onlyfans.Now, this is only a minority of their users, but makes a large proportion of their revenue.  For healthy people, only fans can be great."</p>
