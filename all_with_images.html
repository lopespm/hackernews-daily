								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built out a simple &#34;technology access&#34; solution for my late grandma about five years ago.  It was just some simple scripts running on a raspberry pi. The scripts would fetch emails from a gmail account, extract the attachments, and display them on loop. The subject line of the email, sender and the date were overlayed on the image.The advantage over those IoT picture frame products was that I could use any display I wanted. A cheap 32&#34; TV was perfect. This was key as her vision degraded.  The approach also allowed anyone in the family with email to send her photos, no proprietary apps or accounts required.She passed away mid-Covid and I didn&#39;t get to see her in her final 6 months, but she always bragged of her &#34;picture machine.&#34; I think she was the envy of many of her fellow nursing home residents!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many beautiful UI hints with this.1) The shape of the microphone positively urges the user to lean forward and talk into it. Compare to a modern smartphone where it&#39;s not at all obvious where the microphone is.2) The giant red button next to the microphone positively scream &#34;press me to talk&#34;, and it&#39;s obvious that the red LED will light up when the button is pressed. Removes any &#34;is this thing on&#34;? thoughts.3) The patch panel is quite genius, it&#39;s obvious how to target the desired recipient. One might quibble with the plug systenm, but using the large style plugs is a great choice for unsteady hands. These plugs have more leeway if not plugged all the way in than micro style plugs.4) The recipients are all in a line, and due to the design, one of them is always selected. That removes any &#34;did I select someone&#34;, sa I sometimes experience when sharing on my phone to some social network.5) What&#39;s more, the last selected recipient is persistent, even in the event of a power cut.6) Thermal printer is genius. Yaya can tear off important messages and carry them with her."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two interesting things about this project.1. Just about 100% of the code already existed, it just needed to be stuck together in a classy box. That&#39;s pretty damn cool: there&#39;s no need to re-invent the wheel for some advanced components, and it means more sophisticated ideas can be built quickly.2.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This should not come as a surprise, and it was largely predictable from the outset.The flu has a base reproduction number (R0) less than 2 (https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/2020/12/07/covid-19...).  Covid has an R0 in the vicinity of 2.5 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scena...).In the meantime, public health measures like masking and distancing will work against both viruses.  If people become reluctant to socialize because of covid (whether or not there be legal restrictions), they will also not spread the flu.As a broad conclusion, if public health measures reduce the effective reproduction number of Covid to about 1 (stabilizing exponential growth), they will also reduce the effective reproduction number of the flu to something substantially below 1.  Since the flu would have also had a low baseline prevalence in the summer of 2020, it is no wonder that we failed to see a flu season.There&#39;s really no need for conspiracy theorizing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was just commenting to a co-worker my entire family hasn&#39;t been sick since the pandemic started. That is very unusual for a family with young children.No flu, no stomach viruses, absolutely nothing for more than a year now. Thankfully no covid-19 either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I caught the flu, how would the government/scientists studying this stuff even know I got it? If you&#39;re anything like me you probably just take some time off and get over the illness without ever seeing a doctor or taking a flu-test. How do they measure such things? I suspect they use some elaborate statistical model to try and generalize the results to the whole population."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google is saving $1 billion per year because of COVID-19, not because employees are working from home. This is literally mentioned in the article, but the headline is twisted (for clicks no doubt):&gt; During the first quarter, Google parent Alphabet Inc. saved $268 million in expenses from company promotions, travel and entertainment, compared with the same period a year earlier, “primarily as a result of COVID-19,” according to a company filing.Even if they hypothetically continue the WFH setting for all employees indefinitely, other costs will still creep back up once the world starts getting back to normal. They will still hold conferences (and send employees to conferences). Team events and corporate retreats will still happen. Launches won&#39;t be digital-only. Advertising will pick back up. None of this is related to whether employees are at their desks in the office or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google may save $1B this year on the P&amp;L, but I can assure you that a large cohort of employees are vastly less effective (especially parents!).  Time will tell how wfh pans out in terms of long-term enterprise value creation, after confounding variables (i.e. COVID) are removed.Source: A lot of my Googler friends are itching to get back into the office -- whether parents or people whose social lives centered around work.Ninja Edit: Google has already announced their return to work plans, which involves substantially returning to physical office spaces.  From early April: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/04/01/google-wan..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always remember:  numbers without context are meaningless. Google had 180bn revenue in 2020.In normal circumstances , even with much more WFH, they&#39;d still pay for regular company get togethers. They&#39;d pay for more satellite offices. They&#39;d pay for conferences because making cross industry connections and promotion is important.These savings don&#39;t mean much. Even more so if they lead to a potential dip in efficiency (not arguing that&#39;s the case, mind you) or reduced employee retention. Less personal engagement leads to less attachment to the company.The effects of that are barely visible after a year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is it just me, or is it really obvious that Wout won?https://i.imgur.com/g78YNla.pngEach pixel column is a specific point in time. I added a few landmarks: when the front of the wheel passes the camera view, when the axis of the wheel passes the camera view, and when the end of the wheel passes the camera view. Blue for the top biker (Wout) and green for the bottom biker (Tom).Every single event happened earlier for Wout. Both wheels are the same diameter. Therefore, the entire period where the wheel intersected the camera view, Wout&#39;s wheel was ahead. Including the exact period where Wout passed the actual finish line.If Tom would have passed Wout, you would expect that the bottom wheel would be more &#34;squeezed&#34; such that the end of Tom&#39;s wheel would have passed the camera line earlier than Wout. Same for the other landmark (centre of wheel).You can add more landmarks if you want (e.g. approximate when the wheel passes for 25% and for 75%), but it should be clear by pure margin that Wout had the lead for the whole duration where the front wheels passed the camera view. Pretty much all the computation in this article was unnecessary.Amstel gold made the good call, though I agree that it was probably more luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work with these line-scan photo finish camera systems (we used FinishLynx) timing track meets.This error is pretty comical to me because aligning the camera is the first thing we do after putting the camera up and looking at their images, it&#39;s pretty clear it wasn&#39;t aligned properly. The cameras can auto-align, but we didn&#39;t trust it and manually aligned it, but I&#39;m wondering if maybe the event organizers auto-aligned and didn&#39;t bother to check? The cameras are mounted on a motorized base that can move in 3 dimensions with very fine precision [0]. In the OP, you can see the event organizers have a black line across the finish on a white base. In order to manually align it you just have someone run back and forth across the line and move the camera with the computer until you pick up the very left edge of the black line, which is very clear because you can see the ground change from black to white in the image (or vice versa depending on where you start).We also used to always put a white piece of wood behind the line so that the images would always have a white background. This makes it so much easier to detect the edge of a torso when clicking on a person to indicate their time. In the OP, if their camera was aligned correctly, red would&#39;ve been a tough background color. Also a black line is questionable. I would&#39;ve had a white line on black base for the same reasons.[0] https://www.finishlynx.com/product/accessories/camera-mounti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a arguably better, higher level writeup at https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/making-sense-of-the-controve... which concludes:&gt; The black line is a visual approximation of the placement of the finish, but the image from the photo finish camera is the true arbiter of the result – not the other way around. It’s technical and it’s a bit confusing, but it’s clear-cut and the riders and officials are playing the same game with the same known set of rules.&gt; According to UCI regulations, the photo finish verdict is final, because the finish line is what the photo finish says it is.Which makes most of the detective work here sadly pointless.Pidcock probably didn&#39;t need to tweet his take, in the same way he didn&#39;t need to post that ridiculous bogus 5k time! https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-column-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I totally agree this is a very balanced review of the affair.The fact that &#34;kernel maintainers ... are overworked and do not have the time to properly review every patch that passes through their hands&#34; is not a situation created by the group of researchers.If the Linux kernel is so crucial to the real world industry, and the kernel team is so distressed at their work, this is a problem need to be seriously addressed. Proactively punish the whole UMN does nothing to address the real issue here.If the team is so distressed at this tremendously important work and they constantly feel they are on the edge of collapsing, may be you really really really should ask for outside help and even demand more contributions from the big techs.Nobody should overwork, especially those work on something so crucial to the whole industry.Edit: I just read a line from the Rust Foundation page [1]: &#34;Good software is built by happy, well-supported people.&#34;1. https://foundation.rust-lang.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Linux is arguably one of the most important software projects on the planet right now.It is vital in so many aspects of society now,
Android, AWS/AZure, IOT, routers, etc etc.It should be taken as a serious given that bad actors are working hard, with huge budgets to nefariously gain some advantage in the development of Linux.They will have far better engineers, much larger budges, and have been working on it for many years.I would imagine ever intelligence service on the planet would love to have obscure exploits embedded in the kernel.I can easily imagine a scenario where a single exploit was introduced over many months one tiny bit at a time. Each patch a fully working fix for unrelated problem. Fully Legit.   But when they are all combined something wonderful happens. (for the nefarious player).This stunt was a few students who were not well funded nor were they uber kernel coders. Yet they had some success (depending on what you call success).I imagine the NSA has a team on this, with some exceedingly well skilled kernel coders working on embedding things, and I am sure they have a second team to find possibly implants by foreign services and so on.Had this been security researchers who managed to get changes into the WindowsNT kernel I think the reaction by the core Linux devs would have been different. 
(and yes I am 100% there are people spending just as much time doing this for Windows as for Linux, well maybe not).This highlighted a vulnerability, which is frankly quite real and needs to be taken seriously and contemplated over time.The guys were jerks, yes. 
What they highlighted is real
and a lot more serious than what this little stunt did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key takeaway from this update:One final lesson that one might be tempted to take is that the kernel is running a terrible risk of malicious patches inserted by actors with rather more skill and resources than the UMN researchers have shown. That could be, but the simple truth of the matter is that regular kernel developers continue to insert bugs at such a rate that there should be little need for malicious actors to add more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is just such a weird fight. As someone who freelanced for long stretches of time, I think there are a lot of positives about freelance / gig work, and I also think that the majority of people who take these jobs understand the position they’re in and are happy with it. They chose to freelance and drive for Uber for reasons.The legit concern is whether Uber or any other freelance company misleads its gig workers on their earnings, and to me the best solution to that is not to force reclassify them as employees or prohibit gig work, but to regulate transparency in compensation. For example, require freelance employers to include expense tracking and calculate workers earnings after expenses. That by itself would fix most of the problems for the percentage of gig workers who don’t realize they’re extracting depreciation from their car more so than getting paid by Uber.The other issues of healthcare, etc., the US needs to solve at a societal level, not an employer level. I think humans have a right to health care. But I don’t think people have a right to a particular job, nor an entitlement for that employer to provide a particular mix of benefits.This idea that we need to provide our social contract / safety net exclusively via employers is so strange to me, compared to simply owning that if we want these to be rights of our citizens then the government should be providing them as tax-paid services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It blows my mind that these platforms refuse to let workers set their own rates, choose their clients, choose how the work gets done, where the work gets done and how the work gets done. Those are the defining characteristics of what makes a worker a contractor or not.Instead, platforms like Uber dictate rates, dictate how, where and when the work gets done, and penalize workers if they don&#39;t take the clients Uber wants them to take. Uber even dictates what cars they can and can&#39;t use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems backward that the government, instead of fixing government policy and laws that disadvantage independent workers, wants to force independent workers to become employees so that the government doesn&#39;t have to fix anything. It is abdication of responsibility for social outcomes.Many gig workers explicitly do not want to become employees, as there are many disadvantages to doing so. In these cases, the only people that benefit are the politicians that can go on ignoring the real problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of the more adult 100$ debt riddle. Found it at econlib.org by David Henderson, but I&#39;ve heard multiple variations before, so I have no idea where the original comes from.&#34;It’s a slow day in some little town……..
The sun is hot….the streets are deserted.
Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.
On this particular day a rich tourist from back west is driving thru town.
He stops at the motel and lays a $100 bill on the desk saying he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.
As soon as the man walks upstairs, the owner grabs the bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.
The butcher takes the $100 and runs down the street to retire his debt to the pig farmer.
The pig farmer takes the $100 and heads off to pay his bill at the feed store. 
The guy at the Farmer’s Co-op takes the $100 and runs to pay his debt to the local prostitute, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer her services on credit.
She, in a flash rushes to the motel and pays off her room bill with the motel owner.
The motel proprietor now places the $100 back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.
At that moment the traveler comes down the stairs, picks up the $100 bill, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money &amp; leaves.
NOW,… no one produced anything…and no one earned anything…however the whole town is out of debt and is looking to the future with much optimism.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one figure that this didn&#39;t quibble with is also wrong.Net profit definitely adds to shareholder value. But suppose that I make  $30 billion, reinvest $20 billion, and create something that is worth $90 billion.  My net profit is now $10 billion.  But I actually added $100 billion in shareholder value!Jeff Bezos knows this, and knows this well.  For many years Amazon ran at a net profit around $0 because it was reinvesting all of its profits in new businesses.  So it was adding shareholder value like crazy!  (And people who didn&#39;t understand this were walking around saying, &#34;Why is Amazon worth so much?  They don&#39;t even make a profit!&#34;)Of course doing this calculation correctly includes estimating the present value of the thing I created.  And that is notoriously hard.  So the proxy used in the real world is market cap.  However market cap is volatile and subject to change based on the emotions of speculators.  Certainly Amazon&#39;s actions last year are not the whole story for why they added $600 billion in market cap!So while net profit is the wrong measure, there is no measure that can be used which really is right for &#34;added to shareholder value&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a very smart piece. It exposes very clearly that money is not value.You can bundle existing value from one side, add maybe an extra bit here and there and collect money for the process.
But how much money you collected in the end has very little relation to how much value you added to the system.
Especially since some of the shareholders did absolutely no value creation.Jeff Benzos is a very smart person and an excellent CEO. He used to work for the Renaissance Fund as well. I really wish I could hear his honest opinion on this piece. He will most likely never read it but I hope he would and I hope he took the time to reply with honesty and no ego."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d extend this even further: never use a single account for more than one purpose. Create a separate account at the same company for the other purpose. Some examples:- Every product/project you manage should be on a separate account on Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.- Nothing tied to your consumer accounts should be used for anything business related.- Your Amazon shopping account and your AWS account should definitely not be the same account.- Don&#39;t use services where you&#39;re required to mix accounts like this.Some examples:- If the issue in this thread is actually an automatic ban, account siloing very likely would have avoided the issue. ([edit] likely, it would not have been possible to silo accounts in this case, as a child comment points out)- Facebook apparently lacks the willingness to block an account from Marketplace, but they will block an account from all Facebook properties.- Paypal has banned businesses because the account was created years ago by someone who at the time the account was created was 17.The point of this isn&#39;t that it&#39;s impossible to connect the dots that you are the same person. The point is to make it difficult for an automated system to deal too much damage to you, and make it difficult for someone looking at a single account&#39;s history from accumulating too many &#34;strikes&#34; against that account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With the way the system is designed, it&#39;s trivial to game the system in such a way that your ad-supported competitors get purged from the play store. Just extract the AdMob ID and submit it to click farms all around the world, and within a few days your competitor should be dropped from AdSense forever.Like any Google product, partnering with them is a major risk for your business continuity. I&#39;d never combine Google Ads and Google Play, just like I wouldn&#39;t combine a Google-hosted email domain with a Play account. Hell, even a Youtube account that&#39;s shared with your personal email is a data risk.I do wonder what happened to get the app flagged. Maybe someone found a way to use the app to automate their ad fraud (it&#39;s an IDE after all), and Google determined this app to be the culprit? Maybe one of the app&#39;s dependencies had a piece of malware added? Who knows at this point. Google&#39;s lack of transparency makes it impossible to build any sort of business on their products. I don&#39;t get why people still try to do so."</p>

He escalated and appealed it with my help. It was no use. He lost everything. Files. Photos. Email. Calendar. Even his business domain registrations. He was paying for Google services like YouTube and storage. He couldn’t even get a download of his data.This is why I never used Google Cloud. I’ve heard these stories for years. You can lose everything and have no recourse. It’s not worth it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Collins&#39; role in Apollo 11 is often minimized in the public conciseness, but I find it particularly fascinating from a human perspective.  In certain ways it seems even scarier than Armstrong&#39;s and Aldrin&#39;s jobs.  They at least had more direct control over their success in landing on the moon.  Collins was largely powerless to help if something went wrong.  If that did happen, he would have been faced with the choice of abandoning his crewmates to die on the moon and fly back to Earth himself.  Meanwhile no one had ever been as far from other life as he was on that flight.  When he was on the far side of the moon he was truly alone in a way that no other person had ever been in human history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always thought the CSM commanders had the most incredible and challenging role of the three Apollo astronauts. They were undoubtedly the &#34;most alone&#34; humans ever — at least on a physical level.  Every other hour they&#39;d transit to the far side of the moon and would be 2200 miles (3600km) away from the nearest two humans and hundreds of thousands of miles/km away from everyone else who&#39;s ever lived.  Not only that, they lost radio contact.  The silence and solitude must have been wild.For upwards of three days.From the NYT obit:“I am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life,” [Collins] wrote in recreating his thoughts for his 1974 memoir, “Carrying the Fire.”“If a count were taken, the score would be three billion plus two over on the other side of the moon, and one plus God only knows what on this side,” he added. “I like the feeling. Outside my window I can see stars — and that is all. Where I know the moon to be, there is simply a black void.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the photo he took, where in the frame there was literally every human who was alive and has ever lived, except Michael Collins himself:https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/a11_h_44..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article seems to make fantastic jumps from the believable -- mortality from overall air pollution (e.g. in Delhi) to the frankly unbelievable -- your ultrasonic humidifier supposedly reducing your life by nearly an hour each night, or that a daily commute between Newark and NYC takes half a year off your life.According to this logic, anyone who works in the subway should be dying, what, 10 years earlier? Which is obviously not happening.Similarly, it seems impossible to believe that the minerals in the air from humidifiers are equivalently dangerous to factory pollution or cigarette smoke. Different categories of particles are going to affect the body differently, no? I mean, our body requires minerals -- we&#39;re drinking them in our water all day long -- while certain factories may be belching out straight-up poison.These statistics are just not passing the smell test. They seem to be extrapolations of extrapolations of extrapolations. This article&#39;s conclusions don&#39;t seem even remotely convincing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for this extensive resource on air quality. Yes, it needs to get more attention as it is one of the main drivers of mortality of environmental risks.One thing one has to bear in mind is that often when you optmize your home for low PM (e.g. with air purifiers and fixing of air leackage) your CO2 will get very high causing headaches and reduce cognitive performance.So it always makes sense for indoor air quality monitoring to measure PM and CO2 in parallel.We have open source, open hardware build instructions for a very reliable Air quality sensor that can be used to measure PM2.5 and also CO2 [1]. It is very accurate for the fraction of the costs of commercial sensors. You can build it for less than USD 20 (or with CO2 for less than USD 50) and send the data to our cloud server or any other backend.I am more than happy to send you some free PCBs (you just paypal me the cost of the postage) and you can build your own sensor and log the data. Contact me if you are interested.[1] https://www.airgradient.com/diy/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest pitfall I see with this is we’re extrapolating from large doses of air pollution to very tiny ones.Clearly we have enough evidence to say that smoking a pack a day or living in a smog-filled city will cut years off your life. But we would need truly gigantic samples to show that blowing birthday candles or broiling fish once a week will cut weeks off your life.Instead these conclusions are being derived on linear extrapolations from large air particulate doses. Yet many things in biology follow the principal of hormesis, where a small dose or a toxin may be harmless or even helpful.Similar models have been used for years and are still the gold standard when predicting the health effects of radiation exposure. Yet mountains of evidence show that radiation workers, who are regularly exposed to small dosages of otherwise harmful regulation do not have anywhere near the cancer rates we’d expect from the linear extrapolation models."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can have third-party Android app stores. Can you say the same about Apple? While I agree that Google has market-dominance, they are not anti-competition or anti-consumer in the same sense as Apple. Android is open source, Chrome OS is open source, etc. Google is actually providing and contributing something back to the community. Apple intentionally locks people to specific hardware and to their app store."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This report is somewhat bipolar. On one hand it&#39;s arguing that Google and Apple exert too much control over smartphone app marketplaces.On the other hand its proposed remedy asks that Google and Apple exert even more control over these app marketplaces by stamping down on anti-consumer practices like subscription traps and scams.On the other other hand it proposes that Apple and Google should allow third party payment options, making it harder for Google and Apple to thwart subscription traps and scams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The ACCC has put forward a series of potential measures in response to its findings, including that consumers be able to rate and review all apps, that consumers have the ability to change any pre-installed default app on their device, that app developers be allowed to provide consumers with information about alternative payment options and that information collected by Apple and Google in their capacity as app marketplace operators be ring-fenced from their other operations.Does anyone know what power the ACCC has to make these more than just &#34;proposed&#34;?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The internet is split roughly into 3. The top 100 websites get a third of the page views, the remaining top 10k get another third and millions of websites get the last third.The top 100 have dedicated engineering and policy teams teams that will disable FLoC because they&#39;re either not interested in ads (Wikipedia) or have their own first party implementation that doesn&#39;t need FLoC (Facebook). They&#39;ll ditch FLoC.The next 10k might have engineering teams that can make the change, but might be more interested in finding out about their audience so they can monetize more easily. They&#39;ll keep FLoC.As for the remaining millions, only a tiny minority of them will even know this is a thing, let alone care enough to make the change or contact a developer who can do it. These are the folks who have hosted their wordpress site with GoDaddy because it was cheap and quick when they needed a site. They&#39;ll keep FLoC.So the upshot is that github.com, instagram.com and amazon.com might opt out, but the vast majority of the web will not. Me prediction is that at least half of all web pages loaded by users won&#39;t have this header."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"alright 41 comments and everyone seems to know what FLoC is so i’ll be that guy.What is FLoC and whats the big deal?I googled https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-goog...  and it seems like an attempt by Google to add proprietary cohort based tracking to replace third party cookies. well intentioned but could have flaws. anything else i should know?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FLoC is basically something implemented in a browser. Why website owner should be bothered by it? If client decided to use browser with FLoC than it&#39;s their decision. The only interesting thing might be to inform user that they are using shitty browser that doesn&#39;t respect their privacy and make sure that website works in other browsers.What if Google decides that they will ignore that header? Is there anything preventing them from doing that? Do we know why they decided to even implement this &#34;workaround&#34; with header?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s unlikely that prosecutors don&#39;t realize how Signal works.  It&#39;s more likely they assume that, much like the rest of the tech world, there has been an increase in data collection efforts and they want to test the waters again to confirm/deny this data is available via Signal internals.  Subpoenas are the only mechanism by which they&#39;re able to do so.  That Signal are able to pivot to the media and say &#34;yup, still court-tested, still privacy-focused&#34; is a good thing for Signal.  No need for the derisive tone I don&#39;t think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The subpoena is from Homeland Security Investigations at LAX airport.They deal specifically with crimes that involve international transport. So this is human trafficking, drug smuggling, money mules, etc.To be honest the rest of it is just standard &#34;we have some phone numbers&#34; boilerplate. Same thing was probably sent to Facebook, Twitter, etc. with the hopes that someone was dumb enough to login and check their messages from a burner phone.Edit: Rereading it, this is a grand jury. They likely already know the who, what, why, and how. Signal&#39;s response will go to support other evidence that they may have recovered from cell phones or cell network. Grand juries historically result in a 95%+ chance of indictment so this isn&#39;t a fishing expedition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s probably unwise to think prosecutors and federal agents are stupid. They were in the 1990s crypto wars, but not now. What we tend to perceive as &#39;stupid&#39; is in reality, &#39;powerful.&#39; They don&#39;t need to explain themselves, because they put the onus of compliance on you.Gaming out the subpoena, Signal does not have this user information because it does not exist, but it does have server locations, 3rd party service providers relationships, and staff who can all be dragged into the process and system, where they can be charged with other arbitrary process crimes to put pressure on them.It&#39;s a mistake to interpret any official action as a serial, single point transactional request. Like mice, if you think you see one, you have, and it&#39;s guaranteed there are many more behind it. Given where they have used the action to draw your attention, where in relief is the second part of the pinch or funnel they are creating?If the legal system wants to destroy you, they can and do. Signal has antagonized them, and the current political climate is all about getting rid of any resistance to official powers and their unofficial private arms. Politically, there is ample incentive to take out Signal and cause users to switch to more amenable apps from friendly platform companies. They may even be able to compel friendly app stores to patch apps before they are distributed.To me, this subpoena looks like the Cellebrite takedown was analogous to injuring a cop, where the response will likely be disproportionate and even extra-legal, because it is about maintaining public perception and belief."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/gop-plan-for-bro...Remember that Republicans tried to ban municipal broadband federally only two months ago! Just an absurdly, transparently corrupt move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are a software engineer, working on municipal broadband or starting a local ISP is a really intense way to expand your skills.For the past year, I&#39;ve been volunteering at NYC Mesh (nycmesh.net), which is a non-profit that provides fixed wireless broadband in New York. I thought I knew a thing or two about networking — hell, I&#39;ve even given a talk in the network track at LinuxCon in the past — but working on NYC Mesh really showed me the limits of that knowledge and has helped me learn a ton more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Municipal broadband really isn&#39;t the solution here. Sure, it&#39;s miles better than private infra, but we down here in NZ have a much better solution. (Not claiming we invented it, of course.)In 2011, Central government started a big infrastructure project to roll fibre out to ~80% of the population. (Called UFB - ultra fast broadband.) However instead of making this just be state owned, the money was paid as cheap loans with a competitive bid system. Companies bidding had to agree to a significant number of regulations, including a requirement to not act as an ISP and to offer wholesale access to the network for a set fee. They could also offer their own services above and beyond the regulated maximum.So to start an ISP in NZ, all you need is some national and international transit, and at least one server to do billing and core routing. As a result, we have dozens of major, actually good ISPs and many more niche ones. Most of them service the whole country - at least the UFB service area.I actually like my ISP. I have IPv6 and a static public IPv4. Peering is excellent and international bandwidth plentiful. Gigabit bandwidth with no usage call and no fair use policy (at least no policy regarding days usage).Municipal internet is great until you realize you just turned a monopoly into a duopoly. Without competition, what drive your new ISP to do better? If you&#39;re super lucky, the goodness of their hearts, I guess. Because you know the old incumbent will just match the new ISP and do not better.EDIT: Folks in other threads have pointed out how bad US government bodies have historically been at investing in infrastructure maintenance. I&#39;d like to note that the NZ model neatly deals with those concerns too. The companies which build out the networks are made the owners presumably when the loans are paid off. These companies become very profitable even though they can&#39;t become ISPs themselves, and are thus heavily incentivized to invest their profits back into their networks to keep them working well and to come up with new products to sell. Already a NZ fibre company has deployed 10gbit fibre commercially, with no extra government support."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So this was deployed in 2014 and we’re just connecting all the dots now? It really makes you wonder what’s being deployed at the moment.The fact that they can determine all this from some binary is amazing. Security researchers really are techno-archaeologists."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re lucky that we can still catch some of them now. The current status of closed CPUs running proprietary firmware talking with closed chipsets running proprietary firmware blobs would make trivially easy to move the malware injection to the iron level for agencies funded by governments. Once they accomplish it, detecting their spyware using software, at any privilege level, will become impossible.
I fear the scenario in which magic packets with a signature that turns off detection in network hardware (proprietary firmware) and interfaces (again, proprietary firmware) can directly instruct a system (proprietary firmware) unbeknownst to the user; it seems impossible today, however all it takes is having enough closed software and firmware so that a covert channel can be created from the CPU to the external world. Governments have enough funds and motivation to tell most network iron manufacturers to produce hardware according to some additional specifications."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two weeks ago, the NSA accused the Russian SVR (intelligence agency) of exploiting vulnerabilities in US networks and suggesting that they were behind the SolarWinds compromise[1].Now, Kaspersky (which is suspected to be affiliated with Russian intelligence - possibly unwillingly) claims to have found CIA malware (effectively &#34;burning&#34; it, if it&#39;s real).The timing does not seem to be a coincidence.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In a previous role I worked, law enforcement would send over requests for information from time to time. Once my scripts became better at gathering information requests turned from providing highly specific information (ex: details about this individual, on this date and time doing this particular action) to blanket statements (we think this person is called X or Y - can we get all info covering these two years).General security/crime prevention concerns were being provided as reasons for these searches. I had voiced my concern to my managers but they said as long as we had a paper trail which clearly tied each request to the info provided, they didn&#39;t really care. I left the place shortly afterwards, but it highlights, I think, how quickly these things spiral out of control. How specific turns general, how true belief turns into mere suspicion or blanket statements (ex - everyone in THAT area is a criminal so we need all the info)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The company claimed that the patches had “been released to address a recently identified security vulnerability. The security patch strengthens the protections of the solutions.” However, Vice also reports that the company did not “specifically say whether the addressed vulnerability is one and the same as the one disclosed by Marlinspike.”IIRC Marlinspike didn&#39;t disclose one vulnerability, but a massive class of them: Cellebrite must process media in every possible format and thus relies on components from outside sources, FFmpeg being just one example. Cellebrite inherits security vulnerabilities from all those components, and doesn&#39;t appear to be diligent in keeping them patched (not that a perfect record of patching would protect them - the attack surface is enormous and probably most component developers don&#39;t provide sufficient security).Integrating insecure code is likely a necessary decision for Cellebrite: Writing, maintaining, and updating their own code to process all types of media, and keep up-to-date with all changes to all those types of the media, seems impossible and certainly uneconomical. What could they do? Maybe they could sandbox each component but then they&#39;d need a lot of horsepower in their device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Previously, data extraction was primarily used in only certain types of cases—typically child pornography or, sometimes, drug offenses. Now, however, cops’ first move is typically to find some sort of incriminating evidence on a suspect’s cell phone, he said, regardless of what kind of case it is....What? Are cops frequently scanning people’s entire phones as a first move now? I had heard that this occasionally happened at borders or with serious crimes, but I had no idea it was this widespread."</p>

    ...

    &lt;script type=&#34;module&#34;&gt;
      document.documentElement.classList.remove(&#39;no-js&#39;);
      document.documentElement.classList.add(&#39;js&#39;);

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few notes:&gt; It must come before the &lt;title&gt; element to avoid faulty characters in the page title.This isn’t quite true. Rather, any meta element declaraing a charset should occur within the first 1024 bytes, or it may be ignored.———Print styles: you might think that putting print styles in a separate file would let the browser not load them unless the user actually seeks to print, but in practice browsers load all stylesheets, even for media queries that will never match. I think this may be for fingerprinting reasons, but I don’t truly know. In the distant past (maybe a decade ago), print stylesheets would block rendering while they loaded in most browsers. No idea whether they still do, but I’d guess (uneducated) that they may be deferred a bit now.In light of all this, I generally recommend a small @media print { … } block in your existing stylesheet, rather than a separate print stylesheet file.———The favicon prefers-color-scheme thing: don’t put too much weight on this, it doesn’t actually do what people are commonly saying it does: there is only a slight correlation between prefers-color-scheme and the colour the favicon is rendered atop. prefers-color-scheme is for content, not chrome. If I recall correctly, Chrome’s incognito mode renders the tab bar dark; and in Firefox the concept of browser theme (light/dark/all kinds of custom) is completely separate from prefers-color-scheme—so I have dark browser chrome but light content.Understand that the favicon could be being rendered atop anything at all. Any solid colour, any image, anything. Very light and very dark greys are the most common colours for them to be rendered against, but you want to make it so that your favicon is at least not horrifically bad on any background."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is big news, because it shows that Google will permanently yank your Android app if your website violates AdSense&#39;s secret fraud detector! If you&#39;re running Google AdSense ads and you have an Android app that you care about, take down the ads immediately and switch to another vendor.AdSense is the product where Google pays you for running banner ads; they can and frequently do kick people off of it for secret reasons. When my company was kicked off of AdSense back in 2010, I wrote about it extensively. https://www.choiceofgames.com/2010/08/were-banned-from-googl...Google will never tell you why they ban people from AdSense, and there&#39;s no effective way to appeal. (They have an &#34;appeal&#34; process, but what are you supposed to write in the appeal when the charges against you are secret?!)At least we can still publish Android apps, right? (We now run Facebook ads instead.)But Google&#39;s email to DroidScript saying that the DroidScript app was removed from Google Play Store for &#34;Ad Fraud&#34; says otherwise.    Publishing status: Suspended

    Your app has been suspended and removed due to a policy violation.
    Reasons of violation
    APK:206 Ad Fraud
    App violates Ad Fraud policy.

Surely Google could have just revoked DroidScript&#39;s access to Google ads, while allowing DroidScript to ship on the store, like they did for us.If Google ever yanked our Android app over &#34;ad fraud,&#34; we&#39;d have no recourse. We&#39;ve appealed our AdSense rejection a dozen times over the last 10 years and we always get a form letter rejection. We have no idea what they think we did wrong, and we never will, so we can never fix it.Thank god we don&#39;t run AdSense ads anymore. Based on this, I never want to run them again!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a lot about the sexual events in this post that, to me, highlights something I feel is important which is: we parents need to get better had having conversations with our children around sex.This girl was feeling uncomfortable and crying but at the same time &#34;didn&#39;t think those behaviors were problematic&#34;.  I can&#39;t help but wonder if her parents never sat her down and discussed situations like this and, I get it.  That&#39;s a really uncomfortable conversation to have with your child.  It is, however, an important one.This doesn&#39;t just apply to girls by the way.  We parents need to be telling our sons what kind of behavior is and isn&#39;t acceptable.  It&#39;s not enough to expect them to figure it out.  Who are they figuring it out from if not us?  Probably other inexperienced boys.Please don&#39;t rush to put words in my mouth by thinking I am suggesting the guy in the article is innocent of the accusations.  I&#39;m making no commentary on either party from this article.  That&#39;s for the courts to decide should one or both parties choose to take that course of action.I&#39;m simply saying it is important that parents overcome their discomfort around discussions of sex with their children so that the children can make informed decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"General PSA from someone who has studied such things:1. Alcohol is the number one date rape drug and it&#39;s problematic in part because men tend to have a much higher tolerance than women.2. Date rape frequently involves two people from different cultures with different social expectations. This often fosters terrible misunderstandings.3. It&#39;s always problematic to &#34;try a case&#34; in the court of public opinion. Probably better to try to use a piece like this as a jumping off point for general discussion of the problem space and not an attempt to determine what &#34;really&#34; happened in this instance.4. It&#39;s good to think about what women can do differently to try to protect themselves. Trying to talk about that is not, per se, blaming the victim anymore than it is blaming the victim to say &#34;It&#39;s a bad neighborhood. Make sure you lock your car.&#34;5. When someone is a habitual offender and genuinely a predator, their victim can do all the right things and still get assaulted.6. Whether a woman did or did not do all the right things, a man choosing to assault her is still on him, just like you are still a thief even if someone failed to lock their car."</p>

tbf. I dislike the title.
the real title is sexual harassment from Jon Pretty a leader of certain Scala Community standups.because the current title actually sounds like it&#39;s the whole commnity, but the blog is about a specific guy.---second I really do not understand, how other people can be so horrible. he basically abused her in a moment where she was really really desperate and I think such a thing is really really bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/  The nice thing about that library is that you actually can have a self-contained HTML page with a diagram, like:    &lt;html&gt;

    &lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;


And this will draw render a sequence diagram in any browser.  I&#39;ve used this to have as documentation in the /docs folder of project Git repository for some of my teams.  It is great because it is pretty easy to update and maintain changes via VCS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would really like a sequence diagram that allow for diagonal arrows, not just horizontal ones. A message takes time to arrive to its destination and sometimes it&#39;s interesting what else could happen during this time, for example the backend sending another response to the requester. Also requests don&#39;t arrive to the destination in the exact order they where made. All of these are impossible to represent with horizontal arrows."</p>

People informing their fiends/family “hey I just got Covid you should probably test/isolate” was what practically can make a difference.Ventilators were the critical thing until we realized they were a very sub optimal treatment.All the surface cleaning was a massive waste too... and the chemicals used in some places destroyed a bunch of furniture.Masks, fresh air, don’t go out when sick or after close contact with someone when sick. Simpler things that make the most difference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m confused as to why this headline has to be so close to clickbait. I&#39;m not even one to stand up for people like Lambda, I think a lot of bootcamps are shady at best, and actively deceptive at worst (Trilogy).It is definitely important to note that that these loans can be discharged in bankruptcy. But as far as I know, isn&#39;t this less stringent than typical student loans, which can&#39;t be discharged in bankruptcy? Is the point here that there was a population of Lambda students who weren&#39;t aware they could discharge their loan, and this contract prevision was preventing them from doing so? Or was the school deliberately making that process more difficult? The article makes none of that entirely clear.On the whole this doesn&#39;t scream &#34;deceptive educational financing practices&#34; to me. That sounds like a government agency press release making a mountain out of a molehill and trying to knock Lambda down a peg, but I might be wrong.Edit: after reading how dischargeability impacts people&#39;s ability to take out the loan in the first place, yeah, this matters quite a bit, and I was wrong because I didn&#39;t understand how education financing works. I&#39;ll own that. Seems Lambda was being less than equitable in how they approached the matter, and hoping no one would notice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It makes me sad that many of the prominent boot-camps now have such a bad reputation, and seem to be run so poorly, or recklessly.I feel lucky to have enrolled at, now defunct, The Iron Yard at it’s peak in the end of 2016. I owe them everything for teaching me and coaching me into how to break into my new career as a web developer. It was life changing.I can only speak for my particular campus, but I imagine it was similar at every other location. Never once, starting from my first interview, did they mislead me or make empty promises. They never guaranteed us anything.They basically said, “You’re going to pay us $15K for 3 months, and it’s going to be one of the hardest things you’ve ever done. We can’t guarantee you a job but we will do our damndest to teach you &amp; help you navigate the application process.”And I still respect them for that. The people there were super smart and amazing mentors. The onus was always put on us to work our asses of and make our dream of being a coder come true on our own accord. RIP The Iron Yard.I hate reading stories about Lambda and others, and reports from students who got chewed up and spit out by the system. They give ‘boot camps’ a bad name, and I’m hopeful soon there will be a school who rises to the top and will be as upstanding as the people I worked with. Someone needs to give coding bootcamps a good name again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wanted to clarify two things, since I saw some confusion.The law changed to make a deceptive statement about what can and can&#39;t be discharged in bankruptcy illegal, but it was always false to say that it couldn&#39;t be discharged in bankruptcy, even before the law changed.This isn&#39;t a new California department, it&#39;s the old DBO under a new name as the DFPI, with enhanced powers to regulate financial matters that were previously unregulated and protect Californians against unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices. Basically there have been lots of innovative financial agreements that weren&#39;t well regulated under California law. They also weren&#39;t well regulated federally, but that&#39;s a whole other issue.More info on the law here.https://dfpi.ca.gov/california-consumer-financial-protection..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"$30-50/month is a wild price point for this. Who is going to pay that? It feels too expensive both for enterprise (existing remote desktop solutions run about half the cost) and for end-users.I worked on a similar solution to this and we had a price point of $5/month per user...EDIT: 16GB of RAM and 16vCPUs. What a weird balancing of resources. Chrome is typically memory bound, not CPU bound. This also explains why it would be so wildly expensive compared to anything else out there.EDIT2: A lot of the replies I&#39;m getting seem to think my implication here is that no one would pay for this or it would be easier for people to build this themselves. I&#39;m not saying that at all, I&#39;m just critiquing the price point. There&#39;s huge market demand for browser isolation, I&#39;ve worked on products in that field, I just haven&#39;t encountered any customers willing to pay $30-50/month for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Cloud is just someone else&#39;s computer.As a self hoster, nothing irks me more that more software that takes control from the user to some random third party.And I fail to see why anyone would use this, you need high speed internet capable of streaming 4k for one and if you have access to that, then chances are you also have access to a sufficiently powerful computer capable of running chrome locally.Coming to security, this is a complete disaster. All your traffic including passwords are going to a third party server and you have to trust that server to not do anything shady.This cant be economical either, or will be too expensive.And the testimonial on the website, I find it hard to believe that a CEO of a company cannot afford a powerful computer but can afford a (presumably expensive) subscription service giving them access to a video stream of a browser running on powerful hardware.Like another user said VNC can already do this, and much more without the electron wrapper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe I&#39;m biased (I certainly use powerful-ish machines, so maybe I&#39;m not the target market), but I genuinely can&#39;t relate when people on here talk about the web being slow as a category.Sometimes a heavy web-app like Twitter will be slow on first load, but Mighty wouldn&#39;t help with network speed, right?Slack is slow because it&#39;s slow to load actual conversation data; the iOS app is just as slow as the Electron app. This is not UI jank; it&#39;s a slow API and/or insufficient prefetching.Jira is slow because it sucks; I&#39;ve used native apps that are slow because they suck.Other than that, I don&#39;t have many relevant experiences to point to. I&#39;m sure for people running older machines the picture is different (the state of web engineering as a whole could certainly be improved on several dimensions), but I also doubt people stuck using slow computers can afford to spend $30-$50/month on something like this.I&#39;m genuinely asking: what things are slow for you? Is it just the fact that the code has to load before it can request the data (or render anything) that makes it feel slow? Or is there genuine sluggishness? What web apps are you using that I&#39;m not?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m impressed by how clear the article is for a layman. I only know the very basics of graph theory and Ramsay theory and I understood the topic perfectly. This is in comparison to the paper [1] which at a glance seems terse and difficult to understand.If anyone likes Ramsay theory and these kind of articles, I recommend Erdős&#39; biography &#34;The Man Who Loved Only Numbers&#34;.[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04994"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does that mean something for our usage of graph?

I smiled at &#34;well, we can&#39;t do a general proof at the moment, and it might be a lot of work to do so still. But, if we put a hat on the pentagon, we can prove it&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Given where ML and CV are today, I&#39;d bet on open source models trained on weeds within 3-5 years. This company can scale, but their unit price is going to plummet. Also, it sounds like they&#39;re using cameras, where it&#39;s concievable that other future sensors could be more efficient. An iteration of this with higher resolution cameras and small flying drones seems like an intuitive next step.This is a super interesting problem because the confusion matrix (fp/fn/tp/tn) rate that makes this economical is going to be variable across both crops, and market demand.If there suddenly there was a demand jump for peas, you could afford to use a model with less accuracy, because you are optimizing betwee a sunk labor cost and margin on your yield. You could literally tune your detection parameters  based on futures price data, since if if prices were high, you could optimize compute on your model. Anyway, spoken as a total outsider, but what a cool and interesting set of problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to see details on power source and energy usage. That&#39;s where I&#39;m a bit skeptical. To do the 20 acres they&#39;re talking about you&#39;d need one hell of a huge battery, assuming it&#39;s electric. Even just to move the thing. Then add power draw for the laser on as well.Also seems odd to have it be something that is self-powered and autonomous rather than just something you pull behind a tractor on the three point hitch (where you could power off the PTO of the tractor). Seems excessively novel, given most farmers are already spending time going up and down the rows cultivating, etc. anyways. Adds to the cost, and complexity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love seeing advances in this space. I have an 80 acre farm and I’m waiting for an autonomous slope mower.Question about this tech is, does it really kill weeds, or just defoliate them? Like, is this laser strong enough to get down to the roots, which are often very deep with weeds?If not, I’m wondering why lasers instead of something mechanical that can corkscrew down and tear up the entire root?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a great blog entry I just read about this, &#34;On Politics At Work&#34;. I think the author effectively hits on a real problem with a lot of these discussions.https://json.blog/2021/04/26/on-politics-at.htmlTo some folks, &#34;politics at work&#34; means &#34;endless battle royale political debates among coworkers in a Slack all day long; why wouldn&#39;t you be against that?But to others, &#34;politics at work&#34; means &#34;are we paying women and men the same for doing the same job?&#34; and &#34;are our recruiting practices leading to a non-diverse workforce and missing out on great people who should work here?&#34; and &#34;what problems does our company sole, and for whom?&#34;. These are really important questions. Why wouldn&#39;t you want to bring them up at work?I&#39;m giving Basecamp the benefit of the doubt and assuming they&#39;re trying to stave off the former. But it&#39;s not that easy to do that without also affecting the latter, because if you ask questions that boil down to is our company discriminating, even unintentionally and do our LGBT and minority employees feel as safe and valued as our straight cis white employees, someone will be super upset that you&#39;re &#34;bringing politics into the workplace.&#34; (I guarantee someone reading this is thinking &#34;ugh, &#39;cis&#39; is a slur, why you gotta be so political,&#34; and, bang: somebody has just made recognizing the existence of trans people into something inherently political, and now we get to argue over whether that somebody is me or the cis-is-a-slur guy.)Here&#39;s a thought: if your goal is to try to keep company Slack channels civil and focused on work, then don&#39;t say &#34;don&#39;t be political.&#34; Say &#34;keep company Slack channels civil and focused on work.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wasn&#39;t expecting to like these changes after seeing a ton of tweets from rubyists I respect criticizing them, but after reading them... I love them all.Companies becoming vocal political entities over the past few years has been mind-blowing and I&#39;m glad to see companies starting to reel it back and get back to, well, being companies. They make products; they don&#39;t need to have opinions on unrelated things.IMO people (even the people in charge of companies) can (and should) have political opinions! _Companies_ shouldn&#39;t.&gt;You shouldn&#39;t have to wonder if staying out of it means you&#39;re complicit, or wading into it means you&#39;re a target.This line speaks to me a lot. I find 99% of political conversations at work are just pontification and/or signaling; I don&#39;t want to waste precious time at work chatting into echo chambers (or starting fights!) -- especially in a context where my opinion (or my coworkers&#39; opinions) literally _do not matter_.Seems like they handled the paternalistic benefits well also by just providing direct compensation instead. I&#39;ve felt left out of benefits at companies in the past because I didn&#39;t want to use a gym, or buy certain things, etc. It&#39;s kind of the same vibe as smoke breaks at some jobs -- you&#39;re missing out if you&#39;re not a smoker. This seems more inclusive for everyone, and I really appreciate companies recognizing their place in a worker&#39;s life: they sign your checks for what you do during work hours.All in all, these seem like really great changes in theory. With all corporate policies though, we&#39;ll see how they&#39;re implemented in practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can there ever be a non-work related conversation between employees that is not a &#34;societal and political discussion&#34;? In the past week I have spoken to coworkers about high housing costs (bunch of us are testing the market right now), property taxes, EV rebates, weed legalization, homeless/drug use problem on the streets. All of this is apparently a fireable offense at Basecamp?People are going to say &#34;obviously stuff like this is okay&#34;, but to me that&#39;s even worse. The company can and will apply arbitrary rules to whatever they think is unacceptable political speech.And if they do strictly enforce that employees must only ever communicate about work (and the weather or whatever), then that sounds like a very depressing and dystopian workplace.Is it really that hard to hire adults who can have reasonable adult conversations (with sometimes differing opinions) without it being a &#34;major distraction&#34;? And is the best response to this really to bow down to the loudest voices on either side and shut down conversation for the 99% who are just...normal?"</p>

They probably have the same problem in  their Ads business which tries to optimize revenuesVoice recognition on the other hand keeps getting better because there&#39;s no tangible benefit for someone to game it.Perhaps, crawling the web is the worst way to go about creating a thinking AIIncidentally, i think the solution to web search is peer review: websites ranking other websites, and having themselves punished when they mis-rank (which is what pagerank was originally)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The commercial opinion bit is incredibly annoying. Ask for an opinion and you’ll get 5 pages of custom built “review” sites that offer nothing useful besides copious ads and paid click-through to Amazon.Even when Google knows where I go with my searches, they still refuse to show those sites for anything that might have commercial interest. So much for customized search. I get tired of being the product. Can we get a subscription search engine that’s actually good? I’d pay for that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pfizer is keeping schtum about the detail of the lab tests it has completed but says it has demonstrated “potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2”, as well as activity against other coronaviruses, raising the prospect of a cure for the common cold as well as future pandemic threats.I have wondered if the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to some results, like extermination of the common cold, that humans would look back on and say that it was a net benefit. Something along the lines of, &#34;yes, 4 million people died, but in fighting COVID-19 we created highly-effective therapeutics for the flu and common cold. Over the following 10 years, these inventions saved 4 million lives and saved 15 million days of lost work/school&#34;.It&#39;s hard to think about these things as we are going through the pandemic, but hopefully there will be some good that comes of it. (Of course, it&#39;s also possible that by thinking we&#39;ve &#39;cured&#39; the common cold, we will open ourselves up to a once-a-century pandemic, where millions are wiped out by what used to just be a common cold.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome!  They should totally go all out investigating this.The rest of us should totally not get too excited.  Many drugs go into phase 1.  Few come out.  There are more phases after that.  Tamiflu got through all of that and still hasn&#39;t been a game-changer for something that kills tens of thousands in the U.S.A. alone every year.But, hey, you have to take a lot of shots on goal before you get one, so I&#39;m glad they&#39;re going after it with a sense of urgency."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really, really wish I could opt out of having accounts with the big 3 credit bureaus. Freezes don’t appear to work - they usually say that I don’t have an active freeze whenever I go to lift one. Or their website is down entirely. Or they won’t let me get to the freeze section without clicking no on their paid monitoring services 8 times. For Transunion all I needed to lift a freeze was the last 4 of my SSN, so how does that help?I don’t want to have my information with these companies. Please let me not participate. It’s like every American was given a Chase Bank account at birth that we can’t close, it’s weird."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite part of this system is when they give you a year of it as compensation for a data breach, saying it’s worth 12x its monthly fee (which they make up). That’s not even touching on the fact that their solution to losing your data is asking you for more of it.I’ve never been lucky enough to be compensated with such a service. But it wouldn’t surprise me if they were so helpful that they even auto-enroll you in another (paid) year at the end of your free trial!One also wonders why reforming the credit bureaus is not a bipartisan priority in Washington. Congress is apparently only interested in fighting over the issues that nobody can agree on. Don’t hold your breath for any progress fixing systems that anyone except a lobbyist can clearly point to as broken.The problems might get some attention if the corporate media chose to hype them, but guess who buys a bunch of advertisements on their news channels?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; The best part about this lax authentication process is
  &gt; that one can enter any email address to retrieve the

  &gt; at Equifax. Also, when the PIN is retrieved, Equifax 
  &gt; doesn’t bother notifying any other email addresses 
  &gt; already on file for that consumer.

Hang on, so the attacker doesn&#39;t even need to break into somebody&#39;s email account first, they can just guess the questions and put in their own email address?! This is insane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HBO Max was delayed in appearing on Roku because of negotiation breakdowns. In the case HBO it was Roku that seemed to have the demands. They are looking at revenue anywhere they can, but if their position weakens look for Google, ATT, and others to simply forgo working with them.I think Roku is in a perilous position in general. They generated a lot of buzz on Wallstreet with their high user counts. They also purchased a DSP to get more into the advertising game. However they are at risk of being disrupted. They do not offer much that is unique and have largely gained and held market position by being the cheapest and easiest to use.Cheap Android TV devices are starting to compete with them on price and tv manufacturers have mostly chosen to create and maintain their own ecosystems.Unless they make some big strategic maneuvers I see them slowly being squeezed out like Tivo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Roku alleges Google has asked it to favor YouTube music results from voice commands made on the Roku remote while the YouTube app is open, even if the user&#39;s music preference is set to default to another music app, like Pandora.&gt; Roku says Google has threatened to require Roku to use certain chip sets or memory cards that would force Roku to increase the price of its hardware product, which competes directly with Google&#39;s Chromecast.That&#39;s just straight evil - overriding user preferences to favor your own products... Some growth PM and/or business head is trying way too hard to hit their OKRs. I&#39;d be surprised if Google could defend this in court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ehh... I would wager on Roku being more dug-in here.  For them, control over their hardware is an existential concern.  For Google, streaming television is one of their many dalliances that may or not still be active 5 years from now.Every television that I&#39;ve bought over the past 5-10 years has Roku built into it.  I know that some people prefer to plug in Amazon devices instead, and that&#39;s perfectly fine (not that Amazon is any &#34;less evil&#34; of a company than Google or Roku).  But I use Roku&#39;s platform because it&#39;s usually the hardware default, and I like the UI well enough.I&#39;m already pissed that Google has raised their prices to the point where I no longer save any money compared to what I used to pay for cable+internet.  And then dropped sports coverage for my local baseball team anyway.  If YouTube TV disappears from Roku&#39;s platform, then I&#39;ll just sign up for Hulu or whatever 5 minutes later.  Or fuck it, I might just go back to cable.  These over-the-top, &#34;skinny bundles&#34; have been a bait and switch in practice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was just having a discussion about this with my manager during 1:1. I&#39;m curious how any fellow devs with ADHD have managed the transition to remote work over the last year? I love the freedom and ability to focus that working from home provides, but I often find myself taking advantage of that freedom and focusing instead on podcasts or reddit for 3 days to avoid 3 hours of writing unit tests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like most engineers are pretty good at working remotely (c.f. all of open source).Managers however seem to have a very hard time adjusting. If I were to give some &#34;best practices&#34; for remote management, they would be:* Don&#39;t worry about how your reports are spending their time. If someone doesn&#39;t get back to you, they are busy.* Don&#39;t factor an employee&#39;s location into their compensation.* Minimize meetings (this is for non-wfh too, but it&#39;s much easier when people are remote).* Allow people to leave their cameras off during calls.* Don&#39;t worry so much about flying people to meet IRL. It&#39;s expensive and disruptive. It may also introduce politics that won&#39;t exist if everyone stays remote.* Realize that a lot of what people think of as &#34;management&#34; is actually unneeded babysitting that&#39;s a vestigial cargo-cult from the industrial revolution. Your job is to hire, motivate and unblock. That&#39;s pretty much it.I wonder if the role of manager will go away and be replaced with more specialized roles. I actually think it might be nice for a company to provide a therapist for people to to privately talk to. That&#39;s always been a weird roll that managers often play. It would be nice to vent to someone who doesn&#39;t get to decide your next raise. Between some level of HR outlet, product management and mentorship, I don&#39;t really see a dedicated role for what we now call &#34;manager&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Barking at the wrong tree. In my view, most experienced software engineers can self organise and self manage. Not saying everyone can or that everyone should do remote work but many that enjoy and prefer remote work can.“This Viewpoint is intended for remote software engineers who are facing new challenges to thinking about routine, responsibility, and goal setting.”This viewpoint should be intended for non technical managers as they are the ones who tend to clutter project delivery with time management tools and meetings. This applies to onsite work as well. I feel like there is a lot of effort put in educating devs on doing the right thing while management is educated in the opposite direction."</p>

I&#39;m thinking about switching jobs, so I wanted to learn some new frameworks and concepts to help with that, and I decided to make my personal projects a bit more &#34;professional&#34;. Use continuous integration, focus more on web stuff, build and automatically deploy containers and so on.Big mistake. I don&#39;t want to spend my leisure time fighting with tools, debugging build processes that break all the time, make sense of docker&#39;s tagging system and so on. I don&#39;t mind programming all day, because I love programming, but I do mind working all day.So I let it go. I&#39;ll come up with my own tools. They won&#39;t be great, but I&#39;ll have fun making them. And then it&#39;ll feel nice using them. And then I&#39;ll work on whatever excites me.Once in a while someone will ask me &#34;how do you know all these things?&#34; and my answer has always been &#34;I don&#39;t know that much, I just randomly got interested in this particular topic and decided to play around with it&#34;.

This breakthrough all lead from an observation that had no apparent use beyond fulfilling a whim and to have fun with it.I try to live my life by the ludic principle of &#39;playing&#39;. It&#39;s honestly been the lifeblood that&#39;s fueled me, kept me sane at work and allowed me to do OK in my career.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you pay a man a salary for doing research, he and you will want to have something
to point to at the end of the year to show that the money has not been wasted.In
promising work of the highest class, however, results do not come in this regular
fashion, in fact years may pass without any tangible result being obtained, and the
position of the paid worker would be very embarrassing and he would naturally take to
work on a lower, or at any rate a different plane where he could be sure of getting
year by year tangible results which would justify his salary.The position is this:
You want one kind of research, but, if you pay a man to do it, it will drive him to
research of a different kind. The only thing to do is to pay him for doing something
else and give him enough leisure to do research for the love of it.-- Attributed to J. J. Thompson by Lord Rayleigh, c. 1940"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"UML&#39;s promise was that that with detailed enough diagrams, writing code would be trivial or even could be automatically generated (there are UML tools that can generate code).  It was developed during a time when there was a push to make Software Engineering a licensed profession.  UML was going to be the &#34;blueprints&#34; of code, and software architects would develop UML diagrams similar to how building architects create blueprints for houses.  But as it turned out, that was a false premise.  The real blueprints for software ended up being the code itself.  And the legacy of UML lives on in simpler boxes and arrow diagrams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reason we stopped with UML and other front heavy planning methodologies is that what we planned was always wrong.Software projects always used to go massively over budget, were delivered late, and usually didn&#39;t meet the customers requirements anyway.It turns out that customers don&#39;t know what they want, or at least can&#39;t articulate it properly to business analysts.By delivering early and often, we&#39;re not only releasing value to our customers early and often but we&#39;re getting feedback, allowing us and the customers to go on a journey of understanding their needs.Also, it turns out that engineering teams know better how to develop a piece of software than architects.We solve the complexity problems by breaking a project down into (as he says) &#34;pizza team&#34; size components and focus on defining the interfaces between those components, rather than go into the weeds of how information flows within the code. This leads to other complexities, of course, but they don&#39;t lead to the same sort of delivery problems that large, monolithic designs have.All in all, a switch away from a design heavy approach has improved delivery, value to our customers, and enabled staff to be more productive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"UML suffers from false precision. Nobody cares about most of the specific rules and grammar of the language because the output is designed to be generally readable by a lay audience. The time your spend making your diagram compliant with UML is better spent making and remaking good general diagrams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A very interesting trick! In my opinion, the big takeaway here is that if you are willing to write your C code in tail call style, you can get a lot of control over which variables are stored in machine registers. In the x86-64 ABI, the first 6 function parameters are guaranteed to be passed via registers.Obviously, this is architecture-specific. Other architectures may use a different calling convention that ruins this kind of manual register allocation. I&#39;d imagine that it would be bad for performance in 32-bit systems, where function arguments are passed via the stack.--------&gt; I think it’s likely that all of the major language interpreters written in C (Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, etc.) could get significant performance benefits by adopting this technique.I know that at least Lua and Python use &#34;computed gotos&#34; in their inner loops, which also helps the compiler generate better code. The architecture-dependent nature of the tail-call trick could be a problem here. Some of these interpreters also need to work well on 32-bit systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a related Zig proposal: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/8220Relevant section pasted here:&gt; Other Possible Solution: Tail Calls&gt; Tail calls solve this problem. Each switch prong would return foo() (tail call) and foo() at the end of its business would inline call a function which would do the switch and then tail call the next prong.&gt; This is reasonable in the sense that it is doable right now; however there are some problems:   * As far as I understand, tail calls don&#39;t work on some architectures.

     * (what are these? does anybody know?)

   * I&#39;m also concerned about trying to debug when doing dispatch with tail calls.

   * It forces you to organize your logic into functions. That&#39;s another jump that
     maybe you did not want in your hot path.

See also https://dino-lang.github.io/learn/dino.pdf, section 3.1 &#34;Byte Code Dispatch&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Scheme has had tail calls as a basic idiom (some call it Proper Implementation of Tail Calls; others call it Tail Call Optimization) forever, and I keep them in mind any time I&#39;m implementing anything nontrivial in Scheme.There&#39;s no special syntax -- there&#39;s just the notion of tail positions, from which tail calls can occur. For example, both arms of an `if` form are tail position, if the `if` itself is.  And if you introduce a sequencing block in one of those arms, the last position in the block is tail position.  (A specialized IDE like DrRacket can indicate tail positions, and DrRacket will even hover arrows, tracing the tail positions back to the top of the code.)When implementing a state machine, for example, a state transition is simply a function application (call) to the new state (optionally with arguments), where the the called function represents a state.  It&#39;s satisfying when you realize how elegant something that used to be messy is, and you can imagine it being very fast (even if your Scheme implementation isn&#39;t quite up to getting as fast as a C or Rust compiler that can recognize and special-case tail calls.)(For the state machine example, compare to more conventional approaches in C ,of &#34;state ID&#34; variables, `switch` statements on those, and record-keeping for additional state.  Or doing it in data, with state ID being index into arrays, again with any additional recordkeeping.  Or lots of function calls when you didn&#39;t really need the time overhead and stack usage of function calls with full returns.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, it doesn&#39;t matter how powerful the iPad is if the software experience is subpar. Multitasking is cumbrous enough that it might as well not exist, multi-display setups can only mirror at a fixed aspect ratio, it lacks multiple user profiles requiring a family to be under a single user, and the few apps that take advantage of the keyboard/trackpad are nowhere similar to their desktop counterparts.Take Excel for example. Try right-clicking on a cell or dragging down a formula, and you&#39;ll see that it only picks it up a fraction of the time, and you have to click multiple times with gesture-like latencies in between to get it to work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;ll be interesting to see if iPadOS 15 steps us any closer to laptop/desktop class usage. The biggest thing holding back iPad from being a real laptop replacement for so many is the software. It&#39;s also not as simple as porting macOS to iPad. I get Apple&#39;s hesitancy from a usability and a product cannibalization standpoint, but it&#39;s time they step things forward."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&lt;3 RustThe only thing I find difficult in Rust is lifetimes of e.g. &#34;String&#34;s in data structures, e.g. in Scala I have:    case class CustomerSale(name:String, item:String)

and because of GC I don&#39;t have to think about life times, copying etc. - data gets removed after a request or when nothing is used any longer.In Rust it is  struct CustomerSale{
    name: String,
    item: String,
  }

which rarely works that simple. I need to think of the life times of name and item, e.g. when I get them from a database, and I don&#39;t want to own it, or if I want to copy them or have &amp;str etc. And in web frameworks in Rust there is no notion of request life times which would make things much easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The amount of energy Microsoft is pouring into these front-end efforts is pretty incredible. A more recent development that has me very excited is Blazor Desktop:https://medium.com/young-coder/blazor-desktop-the-electron-f...&gt; This leads to the second difference — in a Blazor Desktop app hosted in WebWindow, there’s no built-in web server. Instead, it’s pure .NET all the way down. And while we haven’t seen exactly how this will be implemented, it offers the chance to simplify the hosting model quite a bit. If everything comes together just right, it will be like using Electron without needing to learn Node.I honestly believe this model is going to revolutionize front-end development. The productivity uplift of not having to fuck around with JSON APIs alone is worth the price of admission. We already use Blazor (server-side) for several of our webapps. I have been able to implement things in 4 hours that would easily have taken 4 weeks if I had to argue with other developers about the shape of a JSON blob on the wire. Need a projection involving 3 collections to produce a table? No problem. It&#39;s literally 3-5 lines of LINQ in your razor file. With a &#34;proper&#34; JSON API, you would probably have to fetch 3 different resources to the client or develop a special unicorn method for each unique projection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">".NET 6? Hold up, WPF was never really finished. This is demonstrated by existence of companies which sell lacking components that should otherwise have been included with WPF: Telerik, Infragistics, Syncfusion etc. Heck, creating a Report with out-of-the-box WPF is an unforgettable nightmare.I, for one, would prefer that Microsoft, instead of pumping all these half-finished &#34;cool new toys&#34;, ships stable, performant, feature-complete software. We either have to buy 3rd party components, or write our own components from the ground up. Sure, they provide a Button or a Combobox, but good luck if you need anything slightly more complex, like a searchable GridView, autocomplete Combobox, Charts etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Whenever this comes up, I think of this quote from The Practice of Programming by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike [0]:&gt; As personal choice, we tend not to use debuggers beyond getting a stack trace or the value of a variable or two. One reason is that it is easy to get lost in details of complicated data structures and control flow; we find stepping through a program less productive than thinking harder and adding output statements and self-checking code at critical places. Clicking over statements takes longer than scanning the output of judiciously-placed displays. It takes less time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to the critical section of code, even assuming we know where that is. More important, debugging statements stay with the program; debugging sessions are transient.I found this lines up with my personal experience. I used to lean on interactive debuggers a lot, and still enjoy using them. They&#39;re fun and make for good exploring. But the act of figuring out where you want to print really makes you think in ways that interactive debugging cannot. I find the two forms really complement each other.[0] https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I think my biggest reason for using print debugging is.. it works.In C++ I often find the debugger doesn&#39;t find symbols on projects built with configure/Make. If I have a Java Gradle project I have no idea how to get it into a debugger. Python debuggers always seem fragile. Rust requires I install and use a &#34;rust-gdb&#34; script -- except on my current machine that doesn&#39;t work and I don&#39;t know why.I&#39;m sure in each case I&#39;m sure I could get a debugger working given enough time, but the only error I&#39;ve ever had in print debugging is failing to flush output before a crash, and it&#39;s never been hard to search for &#34;how to flush output&#34; in whatever language I&#39;m current using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the point about seeing the state over time is a great one.But also I want to nitpick because the title is one of my “favorite” pet peeves: “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of ...” thing is now used (as in this article) by people who are trying to say that something is remarkably or surprisingly effective, but that’s not what the original essay was about at all!“The unreasonable effectiveness of the mathematics in the natural sciences” was a philosophy of science piece whose thesis was that there is no reasonable (rational, provable) basis for the degree to which our math abstractions and syllogisms happen to correspond to the physical universe.It is self evident that they do in fact correspond super well, but the original piece was about how weird and spooky that actually is, if you think about it at all. Math is super effective, and there is no reasonable basis that we yet know that it should be so effective. It’s unreasonably effective.It’s such a perfect title for that piece, and it feels dirty or diluting when it’s just used to mean “remarkably effective.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will miss him terribly. He was the guy who let me crash in his room at Defcon when I was a minor and was too young to book my own room. This kicked off 20 years of friendship. He was brilliant, zany, ADD x 1000, and always endearing and loving.In 2008 I was lucky to collaborate on DNS issues with Dan when he discovered a new form of DNS cache poisoning and spent years helping the Internet upgrade and defend against a serious and significant vulnerability. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for this and so much of his other work.He was a hacker&#39;s hacker, and the guy you want in your corner. Very sad to hear this news."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember attending Dan Kaminsky’s talk at DEFCON 12 and being blown away by it. Three years later, I went on the original “Hackers on a Plane” trip and ended up seated next to Dan on one of the flights. We quickly became friends. His mentorship over the years had an enormous impact on me.We both went back to CCCamp in 2011. I excitedly told him about a reverse DNS scanning project (0.0.0.0/0 in 12 hours on AWS for like $50), and then we ended up talking about the Debian RNG bug and password security, walking around camp watching the lightning in the distance.When I was doing my original brainwallet research back in 2013 and cracked the woodchuck wallet the first thing I did after showing my ex (then girlfriend) was call him. I told him I’d found something but didn’t feel comfortable discussing over the phone. He invited me over.My ex and I hopped on BART headed into SF and met him at the loft he was living at above a motorcycle shop. We talked and carefully planned and then I accidentally made 250 BTC vanish.Dan looked at me and said “[my ex] and I are going to go for a walk and return with burritos. You’re going to calm down and have this fixed by the time we get back. It’ll be okay.”It was, and I did. I’d simply forgotten about change addresses for a brief moment of terror.I think the first time he mentioned wanting to hire me was a few months later at a Bitcoin conference in San Jose. He believed in me. I went on to work alongside him at White Ops (now known as Human Security) in 2014. He brought me on stage with him at DEFCON that year.He spent a lot of time helping me put together a CFP submission about my brainwallet research for DEFCON the following year and then helped me put together slides, rehearse, and had a professional help me refine everything. I couldn’t have done it without him.My wedding was about six weeks before DEFCON - Dan showed up in an Uber, about an hour late. He explained that he’d confused Menlo Park for Morgan Hill when planning to leave. I was just thrilled to have him there.Dan was a supportive friend, a great mentor, and a delightful colleague. I really can’t overstate what a positive impact he had on my life. It’s hard to believe he’s really gone. That I’ll never get to swap stories about our respective side projects with him again.I miss him.https://rya.nc/threads/dakami-eulogy.htmlhttps://twitter.com/ryancdotorg/status/1385989257638993922"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RIP, Dan. I work with a lot of very smart people. So, I&#39;ve gotten a bit used to it and don&#39;t normally find myself in awe of many people&#39;s intelligence. Dan was a person that I was absolutely in awe of. The fist time I met him very long ago (almost 20 years), he showed me code he wrote to share movies through abused DNS slaves... building a p2p network like Napser/Gnutella from the technology. No one had ever thought of such a thing. I don&#39;t think anyone else in the world knew DNS well enough to be inspired to think of it. He was so kind and friendly to everyone. It was fun to talk with him about tech/security because he had such enthusiasm and excitement... like a little kid on Christmas or a puppy. :) I learned a lot from him. I have nothing but great memories of him. I remember once when someone hacked him. He even took that in good humor and didn&#39;t let it bother him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Super excited for your project. I have been using map tiles from Mapbox, MapTiler, OSM Buildings for my project and am coming to the point that I need to merge elevation data with building height data in order to cast realistic shadows across the earth. Unfortunately elevation data and building data come from two different tile sets from two different tile providers and it&#39;s a lot of download/processing overhead to merge the two data sources. I need to make my own tiles!I spent part of today on the OSM wiki trying to wrap my head around Mapnik, how tiles are generated, how I am going to host this cheaply because my project is non-commercial, and then the HN gods smiled on me. Thank you for taking this on and I&#39;m coming along for this journey!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very nice! Happy to see a few of my libraries in the dependencies :)Also check out https://github.com/kothic/kothic-js, an older but similar attempt at making a full-fledged map renderer using 2D Canvas. It has a pretty good label rendering in particular which you might find useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really interesting to me. I do a lot of mapping of natural surface single track trails (for hiking and mountain biking) along the way be sure to properly name things, add intersection markers, and create relations (routes and superroutes) to document the systems.The biggest downside thus far is a good way of displaying the data. mtb.waymarkedtrails.org gets close, but I&#39;d really like something that displays relations in the specified color, has sane intersection markers, etc.I feel like there should be something out there which effectively lets me design a style sheet and then apply it to a map which I embed somewhere (maybe even in an app).This... feels like it? Or if not this, can any of you recommend another system?Ideally I&#39;d love something I can self-host. I tried getting a copy of waymarkedtrails going and then modifying that, but it&#39;s a bit too specialized and I kept running into quirks getting the toolchain set up.EDIT: Looks like this might not include the highway=path data that I need, much relations. Alas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve kept an eye on Blender for the last 15 years and tried it again recently after having almost exclusively used Maya.  It&#39;s continually improved in just about every way, is relatively easy to use with just a trackpad, and it performs really well.In contrast, Maya is has more features overall but is... a piece of shit in many ways.  It doesn&#39;t matter what hardware I&#39;ve used; it&#39;s a rule that Maya has to crash randomly when doing basic things.  I used to be able to just open the Hypershade, but with Maya 2020 merely opening it causes the entire application to crash.So I&#39;ve decided to ditch it for Blender.  I&#39;m not doing character animation anymore, but I still enjoy modeling and rigging some things I want to conceptualize in 3D space, as well as create 3D printables, and Blender is absolutely up to the task.It kind of baffles me how little interest the motion picture and television industries have had in Blender.  Big studios are still using Maya, which I know also crashes for them and has performance issues.  They could pour all their money into improving Blender and eventually not have to pay Autodesk anymore for licenses for poorly managed software that seems to rarely receive bug fixes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Deprecation&gt; OpenCL rendering kernels. The combination of the limited Cycles split kernel implementation, driver bugs, and stalled OpenCL standard has made maintenance too difficult.I am not really up to date on the GPGPU world, but is OpenCL in such a bad shape that it is not really usable? If so that is very sad. Are there any alternative open hardware agnostic GPGPU apis or has CUDA eaten the entire market?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Watching Blender become more and more prominent over the last several years has been extremely satisfying. This looks like another great step."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note how this is built in the &#34;stacked&#34; method, i.e. old school Lego.  Even with technical parts, this was uniquely accessible.  My proudest achievement was a smooth running, jamproof pump for elevating marbles; you can see it from about 0:27 in this old camcorder video:https://youtu.be/Mw3dUbRfMSw?t=24These Legos encouraged engineering thinking all the way and were the defining toy of my childhood.Modern Legos are stunning.  Look, for example, for the Rubik&#39;s cube solve machine that can twist a (lubricated) cube to completion in a few seconds.  However they&#39;re no longer stacked from bottom to top; they&#39;re built &#34;inside out&#34; and the best tool to come up with a design for them is probably a CAD program.  Stunning results for those who have put in the time, but not so encouraging for tinkerers just starting out.  So it&#39;s nice to still see &#34;old school&#34; stuff being built."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s been over 50 years since humans have been outside of low earth orbit. It&#39;s like we sprinted forward so fast, going from horse drawn carriage to space flight in a generation, only to get frightened and recede back from the highest point, never to go back.Granted there has been an enormous amount of innovation in the last 50 years, but by some accounts we&#39;ve been going backwards. Humans are no longer capable of mach 3 flight, or making Roman concrete.I think we assume that technology will keep progressing. We assume Moore&#39;s law will continue into the future and we forget that there are people behind the progress. The technology that produced those pictures are gone, we might be able to take ones like them again, but never with the same rockets and never with the same photo-chemical processes. Progress is fragile, not inevitable and everything we have can be lost in a generation just as easily as it was made."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW, if you wanted to get the static from-scratch go image a lot smaller, try running the binary through UPX. It typically improves compiled go binary sizes by absurd amounts: https://upx.github.io/Also, https://busybox.net is a 1.0MB static binary that provides all of the standard posix-compliant tools (sh, grep, tail, etc) and actually comes with an httpd implementation. So if you wanted a more useful container at about 1MB, you could use it.Edit: here&#39;s a previous thread on UPX that has 80 comments talking about the tradeoffs it makes. You should definitely consider these if you intend to use UPX: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15456980"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;m wondering -- why are people obsessed with container size? A lot of enterprise is Java shops which deal with huge dependencies, huge distributions, and generally pretty heavy software -- with internet speeds what they are today, it&#39;s not hard to throw 100-500MB around internal networks (building the code closer to the deployment area is also a solution). Even gigabyte size containers are not impossible to deploy these days with the right caching (lord help you if you invalidate a bunch of layers though).In a world of xTB thumbdrives, why are we so worried about containers being &lt;1MB? Security is one thing, minimalism is another, but I do sometimes wonder about this.Anyway, if you want to build minimal containers and want to do it with a bit more backing than this one (pretty well written) blog post, probably also check out distroless:https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distrolessI personally find most of the time alpine-based containers are more than small enough and good enough with nice ergonomics (sometimes you just want to shell in to the container), but maybe it makes sense to build containers with and without debugging/inspection tools (a `project:vx.x.x` and a `project:vx.x.x-debug`) and switch them out when problems arise."</p>

The fast-moving rotor blades allow for latent light to enter into the sensor during the image scan, causing the rotor blade itself to appear slightly lighter.

It&#39;s just a recipe for disaster and all these recent issues (see also: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26908076) make me wonder if the Github flow model of a wild west of public pull requests just isn&#39;t compatible with how people use workflows and automation in practice.  No one in their right mind would leave a Jenkins server open for anyone to trigger some workflows.  It&#39;s silly that everyone effectively does that because they see some Github branding on a page and feel safer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most comments I&#39;ve seen on this and other related articles on HN are too focused on the high-end chips doing fancy stuff. There are not only supply constraints on these sorts of high-compute chips, but also big shortages on practically all ICs in general.I&#39;m a hardware engineer for a medical device company, and we&#39;ve been dealing with supply constraints not only with our MCUs but other ICs like high-side power switches, LDOs, memory, and more. It&#39;s tough when we&#39;re low volume (a few thousand a year) and the huge automakers and other huge consumer electronics giants are gobbling up all the parts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What has made the auto industry particularly vulnerable is its reliance on just-in-time delivery, where parts are brought in when needed, rather than being stockpiled.It&#39;s fascinating that the response is to close production rather than increase prices.Those warning of inflation point to events like this as support. But inflation requires that higher producer costs be accepted by consumers.And for that price transmission mechanism to work, there needs to be supply actually available at the higher price. It appears that just-in-time economics mean that in the event of a shortage your supply just goes offline. You don&#39;t get higher prices, just empty shelves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thibault Duplessis is actually an ex co-worker of mine, and this guy is truly impressive.Not only he is a very talented developer, he really sticks to his beliefs and made what Lichess is today.He used to take up a job for a year or so, save money, and travel the world for a year or so until money runs out. Then he would come back to France and take up a new job. All working on Lichess during his free time.For a few years now he has enough donation to pay himself enough money for his expenses, while he could have been a startup millionaire if he had decided to take a different path.But he proved that you can have a successful non-profit, free of charge, free from ads service. Not just source code, but an actual service hosted with millions of users.We need more people like Thibault."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I made a site heavily inspired by lichess (specifically AGPL, no ads ever, free forever), but for crossword board games (think Scrabble, Words with Friends, etc). You can see it here at https://woogles.ioIt has been growing steadily and we&#39;re about to hit 400K games played; it&#39;s the site of choice for the streaming community and we just finished hosting the World Blitz Championship this past week :)Thibault is sort of my hero. We&#39;ve talked about doing some sort of cross-promotion but I&#39;d like to polish our app a bit more before I follow up again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lichess is truly on a class of its own. It delivers a better service than any of it’s alternatives (in my opinion), and it’s actually 100% free with no BS.Funny enough, I’ve donated around $30 in total which is $30 more than I would’ve ever thought of spending on a chess site. Hats off to thibault and the open source community for creating such a wonderful gem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seams the core of Apple&#39;s defence:  Apple contends that &#39;[n]o reasonable consumer would believe&#39; that purchased content would remain on the iTunes platform indefinitely

which is a flagrant difference between ownership of physical items and non-cloud items vs cloud items.This strikes at the root of our society&#39;s definition of ownership.  Clarification should not depend on Apple, or even a court.  This should be enshrined by an explicit law.  Using the word  &#39;license&#39; or &#39;rent&#39; instead of &#39;buy&#39; for something you can&#39;t own seems the minimum a consumer should demand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen the phrase &#34;Own it in {HD/BluRay/4K}&#34; so many times and always cringe. You&#39;re just owning a limited license (extremely limited, in the case of digital goods) to watch.The average HN user can spot the difference and say &#34;of course you don&#39;t own it, and in case of streaming, you only have access for as long as the service is around&#34;, but that&#39;s not what the average consumer sees. &#34;Buy&#34; and &#34;own&#34; have very strong meanings and repurposing those for marketing purposes to mean &#34;limited lease&#34; is bending the truth to the point of breaking.But of course, &#34;lease it for a limited time, to watch on a limited set of devices, in a geographically limited region&#34; doesn&#39;t sound so valuable as &#34;buy and own it&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What blows me away is in a study group of 734 infants, which benefited from maternal antibodies against malaria, 717 were infected by malaria in the first year of their life. That&#39;s nearly 100%, in the first year since birth. That&#39;s devastating.The vaccine is showing 77% efficacy in trials in Burkina Faso.That&#39;s an ongoing pandemic that makes covid-19 look like a case of the sniffles. Malaria deaths peaked around 930,000 a year in 2004, and is around 600,000 a year now. I believe covid-19 death toll stands around 3 million deaths, most above the age of 70. Malaria is over 100 million, most under the age of 5.Source: https://ourworldindata.org/malaria"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to urge everyone to consider contributing to cost-effective charities that work on alleviating the scourge of malaria.GiveWell, a charity evaluator recommends Malaria Consortium and Against Malaria Foundation as cost-effective ways to directly reduce instances of malaria.https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great news which will save many lives.We will need to do more though. There are species of Plasmodium which survive on non-human hosts which means the disease will always be waiting - and this vaccination regimen is very demanding, so interruption or underinvestment will make Malaria come back.IMHO to finish off malaria we&#39;ll need some other approaches to complement it, and my suggestion is to get rid of the specific mosquito species that carries the disease. That&#39;s what happened in all developed countries long before a vaccine ever existed, and that&#39;s a good solution for poor countries (this time, we can use more discriminate methods)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is missing several operators that are useful. Like  inurl:, intitle:, allintitle:, etc.The &#34;AROUND&#34; proximity search is neat as well, especially for words with dual meaning. like:bootstrap AROUND(6) cpuFinds &#34;bootstrap&#34; within 6 words of &#34;cpu&#34;, which culls out most (not all) of the unwanted results about the bootstrap js library.This article seems to cover most of the ones I&#39;m aware of: https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/Edit: Changed around(6) to AROUND(6).  Apparently the lowercase version doesn&#39;t work, as it&#39;s highlighting the word &#34;around&#34; in the results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 1. Use quotes to force an exact-match searchAlmost never works these days. Google now usually just quantizes your search terms into an ad or ultra popular news article written 3 minutes ago. It also ignores all your operators most of the time.Bonus: If you use something like inurl: You get blocked for a &#34;hacking attempt&#34;. Google also has blocked Tor and VPNs since 2006 or so. In fact, they are the one big search engine who has done this the longest. Google search right now is like one of those dinky websites from the early 2000s that follows all kinds of insane practices like blacklists and filters.What Google Search is trying to be is a thing you can ask questions and get an answer back. For example converting feet to inches, or where is Starbucks. I don&#39;t even understand why the niche (really, this is how academic research is done, but i guess you can just discount the entire web as an invalid soruce) of &#34;searching for strings over a set of websites&#34; is not even attempted to be filled. People are crazy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great list, but what is the most important in search is not operators. It is context.Every time I work with students and they are stuck, I ask them to Google the issue. 9 out of 10 they will write something like: how to upload an image?Instead, they should first specify the context. Is it an issue on the front end? Are they looking for the correct input type for file upload? Or is it the php method to receive the file on the back end. Or is it in nodejs?Search engines cannot infer the correct context because there are hundreds of correct answers. So we have to specify:- nodejs file upload async (no need to talk to it like a human)- html file upload input type- php file upload tutorialMost likely, the answer will be in the first few links."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing which I don&#39;t think has been commented on is the marketing effort behind the M1.It&#39;s getting a lot of prominence and its use across lots of computers means that there can be a consistent message that &#34;M1 is great - get a new Mac and get an M1&#34;.It also provides an opportunity to distinguish between M1 and the next generation M2 (presumably).I&#39;ve always thought Intel&#39;s marketing was a bit confused - i7 stays the same over 10+ years with only the obscure (to the general public) suffix changing from generation to generation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You get an M1 with the new iPad Pro as well! I hadn&#39;t thought of the situation as the article presents. When shown in that light, it made me pause to reflect. The M1 doesn&#39;t make sense when its in every darn product. The only differentiator is screen size, RAM, and OS?I will admit that I switched to Thinkpad and Win10 about two years ago when I had to return my butterfly for the 5th time. I am not looking back either. If anything, I am more focused on AMD Ryzen and Nvidia 30 series chips in MSI, Lenovo Legion and Asus offerings. There is nothing I can&#39;t do with one of those machines. Going Apple is a backward move for me as I like to program, design in CAD, play steam VR, and run blender sims.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there&#39;s a lot of truth to this, but I&#39;m going to make an additional suggestion that I&#39;ll readily admit is biased by my own feelings:I think Go is in a honeymoon phase and people will hate it in 10 years; I think Rust will continue to be liked even when it&#39;s a legacy language (perhaps no language can continue being loved once it becomes &#34;brown&#34;, but I think Rust will be a lot less dreaded than others).Go, like Ruby (mentioned at the end of the article), is optimized for building. You can do things quickly and easily with minimal ceremony. Some people love that. But that&#39;s exactly the trait that&#39;s starting to weigh on Ruby, and it&#39;s exactly the trait that has put PHP and Perl in the &#34;dread&#34; category over time (remember when people were in love with those?).Rust on the other hand is optimized for maintaining (it&#39;s right there in the name: software should be allowed to become old and &#34;collect rust&#34;). Rust APIs are very hard to misuse, everything is constrained and specified very explicitly. Documentation and testing live inline with your code. You know exactly what a piece of code can and can&#39;t do - you even know whether it&#39;s allowed to mutate an object you&#39;re passing it. And of course certain mistakes are impossible to make at all without (again, explicitly) dipping into unsafe { }.This kind of forethought is what makes a language that survives the honeymoon phase."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A big problem and reason why &#34;brown&#34; languages come to be dreaded is because very few software houses take code UX seriously.I&#39;ve worked on codebases built with UX in mind and codebases without, and it&#39;s a world of difference.Code with UX has descriptive names, functions whose names intuitively describe what they do, using parameters that can&#39;t be accidentally misused. APIs are clearly delineated, domain edges clearly defined. Reading such code feels almost like reading a high level recipe, with the nitty gritty details available on demand using CMD-click. Weird edge case code is documented with a block comment explaining why it was done in this unexpected way. Nesting is minimal. Aptly named temp variables that only exist to aid readability are common.And the irony of it all is that by eschewing code UX, you&#39;re mortgaging your future: making it progressively harder to maintain your codebase, and harder to bring new people up to speed. Changes take longer, and testing is more difficult as fewer and fewer people understand what it&#39;s doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems to completely ignore the possibility that language designers get better at designing languages over time, and people simply prefer to develop new projects in well-designed over poorly designed languages.This to me seems to be the null-hypothesis, and I see no evidence on the page that use in &#34;greenfield projects&#34; vs &#34;brownfield projects&#34; provides any more indication than a simple underlying &#34;well designed&#34; vs &#34;poorly designed&#34; metric.For instance: why do people dislike Objective-C but like Swift? Could it be simply that Swift was expressly designed to ease pain points of Objective-C? Or is it, as this author claims, that Objective-C is in more legacy projects and if Swift were to have been invented first then replaced with Objective-C, people would suddenly love Objective-C and hate Swift? Same reasoning holds for C/Rust, VBA/Python&amp;TS, Assembly/LiterallyAnythingElse [1], Java/C# [2], and R/Julia.[1] I imagine if this author were to have been around to write this in 1980, they&#39;d make a claim something like &#34;People say the enjoy C projects more then Assembly ones, but in this essay I describe how this is actually just because Assembly is more likely to be used in existing codebases, and if Assembly had come around after C people would certainly prefer Assembly and detest C&#34;[2] Note C# is incredibly enterprise/legacy, yet well-designed. This supports the null hypothesis perhaps the most."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an excellent tool to have as a security consultant, and it just keeps getting better and better. When approaching a large codebase, it enables you to write custom rules that match on certain antipatterns you&#39;ve spotted that may be unique to the codebase. That&#39;s the real value of the tool, but the repository of per-language rules is also convenient for quickly finding low-hanging fruit (like every use of a potentially injectable function such as exec,system,etc. in PHP).For example, a webapp may have been designed such that authorisation needs to be explicitly added with a line or two to each controller. A semgrep rule can be written to match all the controllers which are missing this line. Then these controllers can be manually reviewed to assess whether unauthorised access should be allowed. Depending on what you are trying to match, this is something that may be very complex or even impossible to implement accurately in plain grep. Some languages like Ruby have powerful static analysis tools (Brakeman) that can also do this, but the benefit of Semgrep is the flexibility across multiple languages and how readable the rulesets are.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The name &#34;Semantic Grep&#34; does not give a good idea for what this tool is and what it does.The web page states:  &#34;Static analysis at ludicrous speed.  Find bugs and enforce code standards&#34;&#34;grep&#34; is short for &#34;global regular expression print&#34;.  It finds matches for the given regular expression and prints them.&#34;Semantic Grep&#34; is a static analyzer with configurable rules, style checks, etc.  It does much more than search and print.Perhaps a better name is needed?Edit:  How about &#34;omnilint&#34; or &#34;omnicritic&#34; since semgrep is more of a &#34;lint&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) or &#34;critic&#34; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl::Critic)  type of tool that handles multiple languages?Edit2:  &#34;Static analysis at ludicrous speed&#34; ==&gt; &#34;turbolint&#34;? (&#34;ludicrous speed&#34; reminds of the hilarious Space Balls scene :)   &#34;turbolint, GO!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a more complete example of how to call semgrep from pre-commit (which gets called before every git commit) in order to prevent e.g. Python print calls (print(), print \\n(), etc.) from being checked in?https://semgrep.dev/docs/extensions/ describes how to do pre-commit.Nvm, here&#39;s semgrep&#39;s own .pre-commit-config.yml for semgrep itself:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Folks - this is what we are outsourcing and externalizing.When foreign entities are able to bid for a lot less, and pay a lot less, a lot of it has to do with the fact that they will not bother with &#39;end of life&#39; for ships, or getting insurance, or worrying about the lives of people who are &#39;expendable&#39;.Those very nice buildings in Dubai come from some nasty labour practices.If every piece of this puzzle from end-to-end were to have happened in a &#39;rich country&#39; there&#39;d be legal issues, PR/media, litigation, and a separate kind of bureaucracy altogether, meaning the &#39;alternative&#39; for a lot of corporations is just &#39;wash their hands&#39; of it, pay 1/2 the price, and get all the ugly parts &#39;off the books&#39;.We are to the point now where we have ample material surplus - we don&#39;t need any more &#39;plastic stuff from China&#39; - it&#39;d be worthwhile to start integrating a lot of &#39;off the books&#39; stuff into trade deals. Ironically, it would be good for &#39;them&#39; as well, because in chaotic, quasi-lawless systems it doesn&#39;t make sense for participants to invest in anything further ahead than what is in front of their noses (i.e. don&#39;t hate the Lebanese shippers for doing the only thing they can do to remain profitable, i.e. don&#39;t hate the player, hate the game) ... forcing some degree of transparency and accountability in these systems might raise prices a little bit, but the benefits would likely be immensely positive in the system overall.It&#39;s nice that the story is made personal, about a real individual (think: that Tom Hanks film about someone stuck in international airport limbo) but that&#39;s not really the story here is it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His ship has been sitting still for so long that you can see it on Google Maps:
https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%86%D...Edit: a few more story details here: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/19/ever-giv... When he rows to shore to get supplies he can only stay for two hours at most as the area is a restricted military zone. Other crew members were repatriated in September 2019, so Mohammad was not alone for 2 years but only for 7 months (which is no less unacceptable). The only reason Mohammad was allowed to leave was thanks to a local union representative who agreed to take his place as the ship’s guardian."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there something that could be done by people otherwise uninvolved - like myself, or my fellow HN readers - to help the other ~250 people who are currently stuck in similar situations?I don’t even know how to go about enumerating who those people are, their ships, or where they are anchored. With that information a well-organized and/or funded group could at least get someone out to these people to check on them, provide basic supplies, and perhaps some form of reliable communications.A lot of problems seem insurmountable large and complex, and even this one seems so if your goal is to free these people of their legal liabilities - but if you set aside trying to solve the reason they’re stuck onboard these ships in the first place, providing basic humanitarian aid to them seems doable.ETA: This looks like a good place to start - https://www.ilo.org/dyn/seafarers/seafarersbrowse.home"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case you don&#39;t know who Proctorio is:(like me)Apparently it&#39;s a supervision software that students are forced to install on their private computer and (as expected) it&#39;ll do its worst to invade your privacy and flag &#34;suspicious&#34; things, based on which the university might punish you.&#34;Suspicious&#34; here means wearing glasses [3] or looking around in the room or blinking too much [4] or having eye and/or skin colors [1] that are difficult for AI to track or reading questions out aloud [2]. Because everyone knows that a good student is white, sits in a bright room, and will continuously stare at his/her PC screen while thinking about a difficult math problem, I guess. WTF?I am so glad that this kind of abuse was not yet common when I was in university. I love sitting in the (dark) basement, it helps me concentrate. And I tend to close my eyes a lot because it helps me visualize the problem. I&#39;m sure this kind of misguided software would have failed me.And the worst part is: Bugs in this software will fail students in the real world. [4]So it is crucially important that this type of software receives a lot of scrutiny to make sure it works as planned. But it seems that Proctorio is suing this guy for doing exactly that: Documenting how the software is supposed to work by linking to Proctorio&#39;s YouTube videos.[1] https://twitter.com/uhreeb/status/1303139738065481728[2] https://www.insider.com/viral-tiktok-student-fails-exam-afte...[3] https://proctorio.com/frequently-asked-questions[4] https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/g2ub05/god_kicked_out_..."</p>

In the US, they tend to be red, and the word “EXIT”. Everyone else does green, with the man running through the door.In Japan, medical facilities were denoted by a green cross. In the US, it tends to be blue or red.Color can be an important factor, but that’s tangential to the Unicode set.[0] https://www.iso.org/news/2013/10/Ref1787.html"</p>

I&#39;m also well versed and shipped games in UE4.All I can say is working with Godot is an absolute bliss. Seriously, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s &#34;easy&#34; and it gets out of the way. Within a couple of weeks, you can be focusing on making your game, rather than a constantly evolving tech-demo.There are only two caveats: understand what Godot is not good at, 3D open world / large landscape, and console development.Godot 4.0 was a total mess the last time I tried it though. The Vulkan stuff was completely half baked and the UI was acting out. Godot 3.2 though, solid fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been using Godot for the last month. It’s been so fun to get back to game development as a hobby (it’s how I got into software development). I’ve tried many other game engines in the last few years but Godot just really ... works for me. It just clicks. Love it. Excited to try the new version!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using tmux for quite a while, though at a fairly casual level.The first thing I noticed is that this interface is discoverable - it shows me what I can do, which is incredible and makes me want to use it. The main reason I&#39;ve been a casual tmux user and not an advanced one despite using it for years, is because every time I want to try something new I have to google if it&#39;s possible.The second thing I noticed is that it uses ctrl-r as a core shortcut. Mega problem: ctrl-r is a built-in bash feature which I use every day to recall previous commands. This makes me think I can&#39;t use this tool at all.I would suggest to consider taking a page from tmux&#39;s book. Just use a global modifier key. Ctrl-b is what tmux uses, so you know it&#39;s safe. Other software being developed knows they should avoid it, because tmux uses it. By also using it, you&#39;d no longer have to dance around the global space of what shortcuts every software in existence is using. Additionally, if you use ctrl-b to enable your commands, you can minimize your interface. Currently you&#39;re using two entire lines to display your menu. That&#39;s going to become tiring as I use zellij 8 hours a day for years. I&#39;ll have to hide it eventually. Instead, what if you reduced it to zero lines? Put &#34;ctrl-b: menu&#34; in the upper right of your title bar. Pressing ctrl-b now enables commands and shows what your next keypress will do. You have now (1) avoided breaking existing shortcuts, (2) aligned with established standards (3) given some familiarity to welcome tmux users (4) expanded visible screen space and (5) simplified your menu system. You can also now remove ctrl-g since the interface is &#34;locked&#34; by default until I want to start interacting with it.Anyway that&#39;s my 2 cents. Thanks for this exciting demo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love that the UI can be explored by the user, since it shows available keyboard shortcuts. This is something where GNU screen or tmux suck, because you really have to lookup how to operate these tools. In some manual or with google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure I could untrain all my muscle memory I&#39;ve built up over the years with my TMUX configuration, but I truly believe in the next 10 years all of my current command line tools will be slowly replaced with rust equivalents (with the exception of neovim). ripgrep and fzf are already a large part of my workflow, and I love seeing WebAssembly becoming the universal plug and play standard.&gt; Build a web client to allow users to connect to a running Zellij daemon through the browser (on a local or remote server).That&#39;s the future feature I&#39;m most interested in over TMUX."</p>

There was a feeling that the attacks of 9/11 could have been prevented if existing disparate info had been better collected and collated.So it’s not that surprising that these agencies will seem to stray out of their lanes. If Postal is monitoring broadly for threats against their systems, but sees other concerning info, they are supposed to share it.This is all intended to be explanatory; I’m not saying that it’s how things should be.I will say that personally I have fewer concerns about programs to monitor public content on the Internet, than programs that seek to access, monitor, and store content that people intended to be privately communicated to other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of sentiment today that the USPS is way out of its zone of expertise in doing this -- and that is possible.But it&#39;s worth noting that the USPS has had its own legion of postal inspectors going back to the 19th century, when they were a (comparatively) huge part of the U.S. government, and the FBI, etc. did not exist.Some 1,200 postal inspectors are still around, and they play important roles on federal prosecutions related to mail fraud, drug shipments, etc. There&#39;s a good Wikipedia entry on it all: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Inspectio..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a tough issue for a government. We do have crazies out there and we do need to investigate potential dangerous groups and individuals and reel them in before they do something crazy.On my FB feed I have seen friends and friends of friends call for armed revolt many times over the past few years. Most all of them are blowing steam and many are in their 60s or older and couldn&#39;t run a block in gym shorts, and much less if they were carrying any kind of real military gear, but they like to think they can. We all grew up with &#34;Rambo&#34; movies.But some of those who&#39;s comments I&#39;ve seen I don&#39;t know at all.The ordeal at our Capital proves there&#39;s a problem that needs to be monitored. Most of those who went there were not armed or dangerous, but there were enough kooks to cause some real damage and lives were lost. And last year we had the guy who blew himself and his motorhome up on a Downtown street.If we had another &#34;Timothy McVeigh&#34; event people would be howling, and if we had several they&#39;d be freaking out and demanding something be done.We all have good reason to be wary of &#34;Big Brother&#34; type surveillance but we also have to acknowledge that we have a problem with people getting crazy and shooting into crowds and blowing things up.There&#39;s not always a good solution to a shitty situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"[DISCLAMER: I used to work at Google in general, but not at Google Cloud]I&#39;m not sure whether this has been discussed here before, but I&#39;d love to take this forum to share an angle from the tech side of things:IMO, Google is _cursed_ to keep deprecating its products and services. It&#39;s cursed by Google&#39;s famous choice of mono-repo tech stack.It makes all the sense and has all the benefits. But at a cost: we had to keep every single line of code in active development mode. Whenever someone changed a line of code in a random file that&#39;s three steps away on your dependency chain, you will get a ticket to understand what has changed, make changes and fire up every tests (also fix them in 99% of the cases).Yeah, the &#34;Fuck You. Drop whatever you are doing because it’s not important. What is important is OUR time. It’s costing us time and money to support our shit, and we’re tired of it, so we’re not going to support it anymore.&#34; is kind of true story for internal engineers.We once had a shipped product (which took about 20-engineer-month to develop in the first place) in maintenance mode, but still requires a full time engineer to deal with those random things all the time. Would have save 90% of that person&#39;s time it it&#39;s on a sperate branch and we only need to focus on security patches. (NO, there is no such concept of branching in Google&#39;s dev system).We kept doing this for a while and soon realized that there is no way we can sustain this, especially after the only guys who understand how everything works switched teams. Thus, it just became obvious that deprecation is the only &#34;responsible&#34; and &#34;reasonable&#34; choice.Honestly, I think Google&#39;s engineering practice is somewhat flawed for the lack of a good solution to support shipped products in maintenance. As a result, there is either massively successful products being actively developed; or deprecated products."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in GCP support for over 4 years. My opinions are my own. I try to stay as impartial as I can about my employer. I know there are a lot of valid criticisms to be made about GCP. As one of the people often bearing the brunt of the fallout whenever there is a painful outage or deprecation, I share some of them.But it never gets easy to read posts like this. This one appears to be a collection of old hacker news posts. And I can&#39;t help but think about all the posts that are never written, submitted, or upvoted about every time someone had a good experience with support. No one talks about their GCE VMs with years of uptime.I&#39;ll spend hours on video calls with customers, going through logs, packet captures, perf profiles, core dumps, reading their code, conducting tests. Unpacking the tangled web until the problem is obvious. It&#39;s always a good feeling when we get to the end, and you get to reveal it like the end of a mystery novel. For me, that&#39;s the good part. Sometimes it takes a couple of hours. Sometimes weeks. Months even. And then the customer goes on with their life, as they should.That&#39;s how it always should work. But no one talks about when a process works the way it&#39;s supposed to. People want to read about failures. And trade their own analyses about why that failure happened and how Google is fundamentally broken for these N simple reasons.I don&#39;t want to diminish the negative stories as they are about people who went through real pain. I also realize that I&#39;m just one person, and I can only work with so many customers in my time here. I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going with this.I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, keep an open mind. This is a highly competitive field. There are strong incentives for GCP to listen to its customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know, seems to be mostly filled with speculation and anecdotes. I can find similar anecdotes of bad behavior by Amzon, for example claims of using AWS to steal its users&#39; business ideas[1].Admittedly, the original author&#39;s title of &#34;Why I distrust Google Cloud more than AWS or Azure&#34; much better describes their position than the editorialized title of the HN submitter (&#34;Why Google Cloud is less trustworthy than AWS or Azure&#34;).1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23929044"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me a bit of &#34;The game of life&#34; back in the 90sOptimizing life for filling the savings account as fast as possible at the expense of everything else has consequences and your game should reflect this.You should have stats including your characters age, health, happiness and social skills and have some kind of social media app with your friends constantly trying to invite you out for concerts, nights out, dating? and so on so that you have constant distractions to spend your money on to make it more challenging. Not building up the happiness and social skills stats should have consequences. You should be able to buy a gym membership to keep your health stat from deteriorating.The consequences of not building up those stats early in your life is poor health, shit social skills and no friends except for the people you work with. But yay, you&#39;re a millionaire I guess?The real game of life is that it&#39;s all a balancing act between having your financial house in order while also having a fulfilling social life, health, and happiness"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played for around 10 minutes, quite fun. Some comments:- how would you get 4% gains in real life? it makes a massive difference, but you&#39;re unlikely to reach this unless the money is put into the stock market- was unable to sell my property (the &#34;request valuation&#34; button does nothing)- the university option never showed up- there were no further jobs after ~12 years of career (stopped at something like engineering manager at ~45k/year which is very low for London)- advancing month-by-month is pretty slow. there should be a way of fast-forwarding to important events (new job, promotion, housing market goes up/down, etc)- had to transfer $ to savings / pension in batches every year or so, losing out on a lot of interest. should be possible to set a monthly amount- the expenses are way too stable to reflect real lifeI ended the simulation at 35 years old, with €200k savings, €60k mortage equity, and €80k on a pension fund. Living on a €100k house, no car, no gifts, no travel, no family. It&#39;s not bad, but for someone saving fiercely from 18 years without any major expenses it&#39;s not a great result. Getting a high-paying job (80k+) around your 30s will land you in the exact same place, while giving you 12 years to live more liberally."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The professor gets exactly what they want here, no?&#34;We experimented on the linux kernel team to see what would happen. Our non-double-blind test of 1 FOSS maintenance group has produced the following result: We get banned and our entire university gets dragged through the muck 100% of the time&#34;.That&#39;ll be a fun paper to write, no doubt.Additional context:* One of the committers of these faulty patches, Aditya Pakki, writes a reply taking offense at the &#39;slander&#39; and indicating that the commit was in good faith[1].Greg KH then immediately calls bullshit on this, and then proceeds to ban the entire university from making commits [2].The thread then gets down to business and starts coordinating revert patches for everything committed by University of Minnesota email addresses.As was noted, this obviously has a bunch of collateral damage, but such drastic measures seem like a balanced response, considering that this university decided to _experiment_ on the kernel team and then lie about it when confronted (presumably, that lie is simply continuing their experiment of &#39;what would someone intentionally trying to add malicious code to the kernel do&#39;)?* Abhi Shelat also chimes in with links to UMN&#39;s Institutional Review Board along with documentation on the UMN policies for ethical review. [3][1]: Message has since been deleted, so I&#39;m going by the content of it as quoted in Greg KH&#39;s followup, see footnote 2[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH%2FfM%2FTsbmcZzwnX@kroah...[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/3B9A54F7-6A61-4A34-9EAC-95..."</p>

your University.Understandable from gkh, but I feel sorry for any unrelated research happening at University of Minnesota.EDIT: Searching through the source code[1] reveals contributions to the kernel from umn.edu emails in the form of an AppleTalk driver and support for the kernel on PowerPC architectures.In the commit traffic[2], I think all patches have come from people currently being advised by Kangjie Liu[3] or Liu himself dating back to Dec 2018. In 2018, Wenwen Wang was submitting patches; during this time he was a postdoc at UMN and co-authored a paper with Liu[4].Prior to 2018, commits involving UMN folks appeared in 2014, 2013, and 2008.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, that video made my day. This bit is key:&gt; &#34;For example, by including a specially formatted but otherwise innocuous file in an app on a device that is then scanned by Cellebrite, it’s possible to execute code that modifies not just the Cellebrite report being created in that scan, but also all previous and future generated Cellebrite reports from all previously scanned devices and all future scanned devices in any arbitrary way (inserting or removing text, email, photos, contacts, files, or any other data), with no detectable timestamp changes or checksum failures. This could even be done at random, and would seriously call the data integrity of Cellebrite’s reports into question.&#34;They&#39;ve may have just got a lot evidence collected using Cellebrite from phones with (or without) Signal installed on them thrown out of court.I don&#39;t recall the details, but there was an absolute unsubstantiated speculative and surely fictional rumor of at least one entirely theoretical zero-day non-gif formatted image file that exploited a similar class of vulnerability in what was probably not a market leading tool used tangentially for the same purposes, floating around well over a decade ago as well.I for one am very glad that these hypothetical issues have almost surely been fixed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cellebrite doesn&#39;t even have a bug bounty programme or contact to report their bugs.Last year I&#39;ve managed to gain partial access to one of their systems and it took me weeks emailing their internal email addresses to finally fix the bug. They were total ass about it.Now I&#39;ve got complete access to their entire database and I don&#39;t know what do. Can HN advise?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is truly a hacker’s retort.It attacks Cellebrite&#39;s ability to operate by casting doubt on the reports generated by the product that their customers may wish to use in court.It places them in legal peril from Apple, and removes any cover Apple would have to not take legal action. (I assume someone at Apple knew they were shipping their DLLs?)It makes a thinly-veiled threat that any random Signal user&#39;s data may actively attempt to exploit their software in the future and demonstrates that it&#39;s trivial to do so.edited to add a bonus one:Publish some data about what they are doing to help create a roadmap for any other app that doesn&#39;t want their data to be scanned."</p>

https://twitter.com/lorenterveen/status/1384955467051454466&gt; I do work in Social Computing, and this situation is directly analogous to a number of incidents on Wikipedia quite awhile ago that led to that community and researchers reaching an understanding on research methods that are and are not acceptable.and https://twitter.com/lorenterveen/status/1384966202301337603&gt; Yes! This was an IRB &#39;failure&#39;. Again, in my area of Social Computing, it&#39;s been clear for awhile that IRBs often do not understand the issues and the potential risks/harms of doing research in online communities / social media.An interesting question is IMHO who people actually tried to contact in the first round of this getting publicity (and I guess how many did so at all), and if leadership should thus have been aware earlier that there was controversy worth looking into."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat! I checked out your source code, and if there&#39;s one comment I have, it&#39;s the way you query for comments. Currently, response times are around 300-400 ms for just 79 bytes of data. That&#39;s likely because you recursively fetch nested comments from a serverless function, which potentially has to make multiple network request to talk to the database. Coincidentally, a past Disqus employee has a great write up on the faster solution (recursive CTE): https://cra.mr/2010/05/30/scaling-threaded-comments-on-djang...Regardless, great work!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I LOVE Prisma. I’ve used Django, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize,  Knex, and TypeORM in the past. all had rough edges that continually frustrated me or didn’t provide the functionality i needed.Prisma is different. It’s absolutely got rough edges, but the extremely strong type safety makes Sequelize look like a joke. The query engine itself, written in rust, combines and optimizes queries inside every tick of the event loop so GraphQL N+1 issues are a thing of the past.Also, the team and community behind it are amazing! I never thought having an active dev community behind an ORM would be important, but as the author of Sequelize-Typescript was forced to abandon it late last year and the author of TypeORM was also pretty much absent, Prisma was a breath of fresh air. I REALLY hope they can find a way to build a sustainable business out of it. Support packages, feature development contracts, something to keep them financially incentivized to keep making it better.Happy to answer any questions about my experience using it if anyone has any."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like ORMs, but Prisma is one of the better ones. It avoids a lot of shortcomings of popular ORMs. I hope they find a way to make it work as a company. I&#39;ve been following them over the years from the beginning of their journey through various pivots.To use an ORM effectively you must learn both the API of the ORM and SQL. It does not absolve you from learning SQL, which I think was one of the unstated attractions to junior developers. Then you have to map between the API of the ORM and how it translates that to SQL under the hood. Then you have to understand how it handles caching and sessions and how that all works under the hood. This has been the source of so much complexity and so many bugs over the years that I no longer think the benefits are worth the cost. As always, there are exceptions and caveats, but I now believe it&#39;s better to use SQL directly than to use an ORM. In general there is too much complexity in all the layers of abstraction in software development these days, and I think the industry is strangely blind to the consequences of this. Complexity is death to software, and it should not be taken on lightly. The entire craft of a software engineer boils down to eliminating complexity and simplifying problems, the better you can do that, the more productive an engineer you will be.[1][1] https://github.com/sqljoy/sqljoy/blob/master/docs/pages/orm...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“ Application developers should care about data – not SQL”Anyone who has been bitten by an ORM generating inefficient SQL (and subsequent having to learn and care about SQL) knows the above not to be true."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some people are quoting the recent Tesla safety report [1] as evidence that Autopilot is on average much safer than a human driver. This is a classic case of the Simpson&#39;s Paradox [2].On the first look it seems that Autopilot is 4x safer than driving without any safety features (1 accident every 4.19 million miles vs 0.978 million miles). However, the data used to compute the stats is different in two important ways:1. Autopilot cannot be always activated. This means that is some particularly difficult situations, the driver needs to drive himself. These are more dangerous situations in general.2. If a driver disengages Autopilot to avoid an accident and engages it again straight away on a 10 miles drive, then you will have 9.99 miles driven on Autopilot without accident. The statistic misses the cases where the human driver intervened to avoid an accident.This means that we are comparing the same measure (accidents) on different datasets and therefore in different conditions. This is dangerous, because it may lead us to wrong and often opposite conclusions (see Simpson&#39;s Paradox [2]).I&#39;m not saying that Autopilot isn&#39;t safer than a human driver, given that the driver is at the steering wheel and alert, but that this data doesn&#39;t lead to that conclusion. If the driver is not sitting at the driver seat, then it is certainly much more dangerous.[1] https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport
[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Authorities tried to contact Tesla for advice on putting out the fire; it’s not clear whether they received any response.This will become a massive issue in the years to come unless we find a way not only to drastically reduce the number of crashes but also massively improve reliability.High voltage battery fires are probably the worst kind of fire a regular emergency responder would have to deal with, between the hard to put out fire and the risk of electric shock. It also causes some massive damage to the surroundings (the actual road surface, surrounding cars, or any garage unfortunate to house the car at that time).Today very few emergency responders are even trained to properly deal with such a fire, and it&#39;s a topic really lagging behind everywhere compared to the rate EVs are popping up on the streets."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“They just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It’s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It’s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do.”Hmm, that seems like a rather stark contradiction.Elon I think has some character flaws and when people are dying it&#39;s not the time to be defensive. I&#39;m one of the least naturally empathetic people I know and yet I wouldn&#39;t be talking about anything other than condolences.Finally he can&#39;t continue to defend the term &#39;autopilot&#39; - in Public Communications, you&#39;re talking the masses, the lowest common denominator, and the &#39;laziest mode&#39; of even high functioning people - you gotta use words that will shape outcomes. &#39;Autopilot&#39; is just a bad choice - he needs to change it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great project, well done. Algorithmic music is fascinating to me, I feel like there&#39;s a lot of untapped potential in the concept particularly with more &#39;complex&#39; genres where higher levels of composition and structural continuity are required. This tends to work much better with loop-based genres but I&#39;d personally love to do a side project on something that could write melodies from some sort of generative grammar for example. A lot of these exist but the results are mixed very often.For me the interesting part is not just in getting a computer to do all the work but using it as a compositional aide. You can think of it at writing music at a higher level of abstraction. Rather than writing a score you can write the rules of the score and use a stochastic process to spit out permutations for example. Eg imagine writing a program that could spit out Eric Satie-esque melodies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This generates much better patterns than any other music web project I&#39;ve tried. Awesome work.If you had no music experience, snuck into a club, impersonated a DJ, and just pressed play on this, I think even without touching it, no one would notice anything&#39;s amiss. If you messed around with it occasionally, you&#39;d probably get hired back. (And that&#39;s a compliment to the app; definitely not a diss of acid techno.)"</p>

Since it will just notify a thief that the bike they just stole is being tracked, and they can look for the AirTag and throw it in the nearest trash can?Not criticizing Apple here -- anti-stalking is super-important -- but just looking for clarification if this will help you find lost items, but not stolen ones."</p>

If the choice had been made 8 years ago to make Kibana less-permissively licensed, it&#39;s very likely Grafana wouldn&#39;t exist right now.And for historical fun, here&#39;s the first commit from Torkel after the fork from Kibana v3:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I applaud this decision.I would like to see all major SaaSS projects be AGPLv3. End users still have freedom to user, modify, and distribute the software. Cloud providers must share contributions.This is how I like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t want to weigh in here with a huge value judgement on whether this is the right decision. However, I do want to say that what they&#39;re saying regarding SSPL vs AGPL is totally right. One of the biggest sticking points with SSPL is that it&#39;s not even really plausibly open source, and it tries to create restrictions that implicate software that is not even &#34;linked&#34; with the program that is licensed under it, which calls into question whether it&#39;s even legally enforceable.[1]AGPL is somewhat controversial, but the reasoning for AGPL to exist is chiefly to protect the end user&#39;s rights, however misguided that may be in your opinion. In this case Grafana presumably retains the copyright to these programs, so presumably they are not beholden to these restrictions in any way. On the other hand, though, it does mean that other providers will have to distribute their patches back to the community, which is pretty much the entire goal of copyleft open source in the first place.In any case, this is, in my opinion, a lot better than SSPL or the Timescale license.[1]: https://www.processmechanics.com/2018/10/18/the-server-side-...edit: wording regarding AGPL was changed, because the claim that considering AGPL as not open source is “somewhat controversial” isn’t quite accurate; it’s more correct to say the license itself is simply controversial."</p>

Xfire came close multiple times, but never got the voice part right, though for the time the client was acceptable.Granted, the server model was very different for TS and Vent (more so the latter), but it was normal then. Kudos to the Discord team on making a solid product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Discord does not give users a choice to opt-out of their wildly invasive data collection methods including logging executables running on your system while the desktop client is open, not just games. This data alone is very valuable.Comment from a 2019 support thread &#34;I am pretty flabbergasted that people aren&#39;t making a bigger deal of this than they are. Discord actively monitors your executables, but the larger concern for people now seems to be its inaccuracy in identifying them as games. As if to say &#34;make it better at identifying games&#34; instead of &#34;stop scanning my programs&#34;.&#34;https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/3600307..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As utterly brazen, shameless and just completely and utterly unself-aware as this is, look on the bright side. A quick glance at the like/dislike ratio and comments shows, most people are not impressed with that kind of bullshit.People aren&#39;t buying it and overwhelmingly seem to recognize what shitty hypocritical utterly bullshit behaviour youtube engages in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This award would have made sense when YouTube really took off.Lately YouTube has engaged in unpersoning - deleting people from the social consciousness. Stefan Molyneux and Alex Jones come to mind. Others have their accounts and videos merely suspended or demonetized for inane reasons, e.g Louder with Crowder.Even doctors merely expressing opinions contrary to WHO officialdom get taken off.This process has happened very quickly over the past few years and is the reason why alternatives are set to prosper.Awarding this CEO merely means the award is not to be taken seriously."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let this be a lesson to all: intelligence does not in any way correlate with self awareness. It&#39;s likely that &#39;smart&#39; people are just as likely to be unaware of their own follies or inabilities, I would argue, maybe more so as a lot of smart people tend to be &#39;inwardly focused&#39; and less concerned about their direct environment.This kind of thing happens all the time among Exec. level, but normally we&#39;d expect it from Ford CEO, not Google types. It may be an odd sign of industry maturity.That said, we shouldn&#39;t discount how often this kind of stuff actually does work. Watching the crowd at the Oracle conf. eat up Larry Ellison&#39;s huffery as through he was some kind of market visionary was the lesson at the other end of the spectrum, and it&#39;s that &#39;If you&#39;re rich and stand on stage and say something that &#39;sounds credible&#39;, a lot of people with just believe it&#39;. Of course there&#39;s more to it than that.But this one is Comedy Gold.It might be a sign that Susan does not have a fully trusted team around her ... I would beg my boss in stark words to not do something so ridiculous to themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You should watch the video of her accepting the award. She talks about censoring people for violating the terms of service and the four responsibilities, one of which is to their advertisers. All this in an acceptance speech for freedom of speech. Talk about digging your own hole."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think people here are fundamentally misunderstanding what happened here. There is a nonprofit, the &#34;Freedom Forum Institute&#34; that awarded this award. Only the award ceremony was sponsored by YouTube. It&#39;s common practice for nonprofits to use awards like this as an opportunity to ask for donations, and for the company associated with that person to offer to sponsor the awards ceremony.I don&#39;t see anything to indicate that this award was created by YouTube or that YouTube decided to award this to her."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Do Spotify actually manage to sell any significant number of subscriptions due to podcasts?Personally when ever I hear about an interesting podcast, and it&#39;s followed by &#34;available on Spotify/Podimo, whatever&#34;, my reaction is always: Okay, never mind then.There are so many great podcasts on the open web. Those available on platforms like Spotify always seems to be people with existing celebrity status trying to &#34;cash in&#34;. Those shows are rarely that interesting, and even if they are there are so many competitors.Assuming you have an existing successful podcast, I don&#39;t get why you&#39;d move to something like Spotify. Are you really going to make that much more money? Your share of $10 per month cannot be high. Of cause it Spotify throws a large sum at you, to effectively buy your listeners, then I see the profit motive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Joe who?Seriously, I think that there are a number of reasons why this won&#39;t pan out as predicted:- There aren&#39;t really any tent-pole, must listen podcasts. They thought Joe Rogan was one but I&#39;m hearing a lot of people have stopped listening to him on Spotify (I have).- Spotify (and others) don&#39;t have the money to buy out the whole podcast ecosystem and many podcast makers I think would resist going Spotify exclusive.- I like my podcast player a lot and there is no way I&#39;m giving it up for the inferior Spotify experience.I see podcasting as being more like YouTubing - sure there are outfits generating substantial revenue from advertising but many have more diverse revenue streams and reaching the largest audience is more important that an uplift in advertising revenue. Plus not everyone on YouTube is there for the $$$"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post is essentially a funding pitch for Spotify. I talks a lot about they are going to try and kill the open podcast ecosystem but no evidence that they are making any progress. The podcast ecosystem is very different from other media markets-- it started open, it grew up open, and people are actually willing to directly pay content producers either for bonus content, to avoid ad reads, or just to keep the train chugging along. 
I immediately  unsub from any podcast where there is some jarring dynamic ad insertion. I&#39;ve watch all of the once great Gimlet podcasts wither, and some die since their acquisition.Yea there is a market for the low-est common denominator stuff like low-brow true crime stuff and the joe rogans, but I don&#39;t see those as competition, either for sponsors or ears to the healthy, robust, mature open podcast ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; There’s no evidence that the deal directly affects coverage in either the news or editorial departments. Before the Facebook News deal, the Times famously published an op-ed titled “It’s Time to Break Up Facebook,” by Chris Hughes, a cofounder of Facebook turned critic. And since the deal, columns from Tim Wu and Kara Swisher, among others, have been similarly critical. In December, the editorial board welcomed a lawsuit calling for Facebook to be broken up.It&#39;s kind of a throwaway passage in the article but it feels like a crucial point. Maybe I&#39;m wrong but &#34;buying off&#34; to me strongly suggests something along the lines of a bribe. We&#39;re going to give you this cash, nudge nudge, wink wink, maybe that negative stuff you print about us goes away. My question is: is this actually happening?The core conflict here isn&#39;t new, surely. Newspapers have taken advertising money from news-making companies since time immaterial. The question has always been whether that money affects coverage. And so far it seems like &#34;no&#34;, or &#34;not yet&#34;. And there&#39;s a very worthy debate to be had here, much as there always has been about advertising in news media, but the headline doesn&#39;t do that debate justice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is worth remembering the Australia fiasco. The Australian media led by Murdoch basically shook down Facebook until they came to am agreement to give the media kickbacks. Then Australia agreed not to apply its law.The European media has also demanded payments, even though the value flows from sending traffic to news sites and not the other way around.The media seems to believe it is entitled to be send traffic AND to be paid for it. Common story all over the world.So, to reduce those demands in America, Facebook pays kickbacks to the biggest media orgs.Here, the media publication is presenting it as a grant for favourable coverage. But the far more likely explanation is Facebook knows the media will shake it down for more money unless it gives them a payoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s always been the case that big advertisers influence the media that cover them. In the quaint old days there was a metaphorical &#34;wall&#34; between the business side and the news side, and neither could influence there other. In theory, that is. In practice, at a high enough level, the wall was less of a 16&#39; fence topped with razor wire and more like police tape.Of course, we don&#39;t live in the quaint old days. There&#39;s no distinction between news as journalism and news as business. Writers are measured not on how good their reporting is, but on how much &#34;engagement&#34; it gets, which is just a proxy for how profitable.Is it a bribe or buyoff? Or just a failure of credibility? Newspapers used to have a position called the ombudsman to address just this scenario. The New York Times had a position called Public Editor. That position was eliminated in 2017[1]1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_editor"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The semiconductor supply chain is now almost completely disaggregated ie everyone specialises in just a small part of the value chain. ARM’s speciality is in CPU design and it has carved out for itself the enviable position of being the defacto standard for mobile applications - almost every single phone on the planet has ARM processor(s) running it. And their products are in dozens of other end applications segments as well. These chips are embedded in System on Chip IC’s and manufactured by third party companies like TSMC and UMC etc to end customer specifications, like Apple or Samsung for example.The problem with the original SoftBank deal, and now the Nvidia deal, is that these companies will simply hollow ARM out (slash R&amp;D, cut staff etc) to pump up the target’s value, before flogging it off or breaking it up. The stock market doesn’t value synergies, although it is quite happy to punt this aspect when M&amp;A deals are in the offing.  Given its strategic position as the defacto standard for mobile comms, that’s a serious threat.ARM also gives the UK strategic leverage in any trade negotiations. Would we knowingly allow Rolls-Royce Jet Engines to be flogged off? No. Ditto ARM.So, I think this is the right policy and hopefully the government will see fit to step into other deals like this and block them.I’ve been through a PE acquisition. We were stripped bare and bits sold off before finally getting our mojo back. I benefited handsomely but we were not the company we were before and the job losses in the process were huge. It will be no different with Nvidia’s proposed take over of ARM.(disclaimer: I was a semiconductor executive in a global MNC)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess governments are suddenly much more interested in keeping key industries on-shore.I believe HMG didn&#39;t do anything to stop Astra-Zeneca being sold out of the UK a few years ago, and it&#39;s just luck it didn&#39;t go through. They probably see the need now."</p>
