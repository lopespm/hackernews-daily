								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will never forget the day a postdoc in my lab told me not to continue wasting time trying (and failing) to reproduce [Top Institution]’s “Best Paper Award” results from the year prior. He had been there when the work was done and said they manipulated the dataset until they got the numbers they wanted. The primary author is now a hot shot professor.My whole perception of academia and peer review changed that day.Edit to elaborate: like many of our institutions, peer review is an effective system in many ways but was designed assuming good faith. Reviewers accept the author’s results on faith and largely just check to make sure you didn’t forget any obvious angles to cover and that the import of the work is worth flagging for the whole community to read. Since there’s no actual verification of results, it’s vulnerable to attack by dishonesty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue is that the authors of bad papers still participate in the peer-review process. If they are the only expert reviewers and you do not pay proper respect to their work, they will squash your submission. To avoid this, papers can propagate mistakes for a long time.Personally, I&#39;m always very careful to cite and praise work by &#34;competing&#34; researchers even when that work has well-known errors, because I know that those researchers will review my paper and if there aren&#39;t other experts on the review committee the paper won&#39;t make it. I wish I didn&#39;t have to, but my supervisor wants to get tenured and I want to finish grad school, and for that we need to publish papers.Lots of science is completely inaccessible for non-experts as a result of this sort of politics. There is no guarantee that the work you hear praised/cited in papers is actually any good; it may have been inserted just to appease someone.I thought that this was something specific to my field, but apparently not. Leaves me very jaded about the scientific community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More specifically, this paper is focused on the social sciences. That&#39;s not to say that this isn&#39;t present in the basic sciences either.But one other thing to note here is that these headlines about a &#34;replication crisis&#34; seems to imply that this is a new phenomenon. Let&#39;s not forget the history of the electron charge. As Feynman said:&#34;We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle some of the ways we fool ourselves. One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It&#39;s a little bit off because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It&#39;s interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bit bigger than Millikan&#39;s, and the next one&#39;s a little bit bigger than that, and the next one&#39;s a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.
Why didn&#39;t they discover the new number was higher right away? It&#39;s a thing that scientists are ashamed of—this history—because it&#39;s apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan&#39;s, they thought something must be wrong—and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong. When they got a number close to Millikan&#39;s value they didn&#39;t look so hard. And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that ...&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment#Millikan.2..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article isn’t about if you should join a startup vs. a big company. It’s about if you should join a startup vs. a FAANG company, which offers outrageous compensation &amp; benefits. From that perspective, FAANG is the obvious choice 99% of the time.The more and apt comparison would be if you should work at a startup vs. a corporate job at a HP or Qualcomm.  At those type of companies, compensation is not competitive (they often off-shore), benefits are tight, and the work is not interesting. It could very well be argued that a startup, even with high probability of failure, would be more fulfilling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is success? The article assumes for the most part that success is mainly monetary, and further it makes the classic mistake of comparing success monetarily to companies like Facebook. Success is different depending on many factors.  For example, if a person needs or likes guidance and structure, a startup is likely not a good fit, especially when they are inexperienced. There are some good points about the strong community in startups and how it can be used to encourage excessive work hours and lower pay. However, that same community feeling and sense of purpose is what I remember fondest from working at startups. In addition, startups give you access to other capable and driven people that you might create a startup of your own with … much less likely at a large company full of risk-averse employees who work on a small piece of the company’s “mission”.What personality type are you? The author likely comes from a structured, religious background and prefers the “certainty” of a corporate environment.  Some of us were raised by hippies with little or no religion and high structure. People like that are miserable in highly structured environments in which gaining a sense of the “mission” is impossible.The main point here is that career decisions are highly personal and one person’s hell is another person’s heaven."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I agree with everything said in this article I wouldn&#39;t trade my years at a start up for anything. Both financially and emotionally it was awesome. I didn&#39;t get rich, and I worked way too much, but it was awesome. I loved the constant change and chaos. I learned so much, way more than I would&#39;ve in any other type or work place. I made great friends too. It was as bad as the article, but it was way waaaay better too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d like to highlight the Introduction of nmcp.pdf which explains in a very compressed form how it works which encompass all the magic.&#34;The lossless data compressor employs the traditional predictive approach:  at each time t, the encoder uses the neural network model to compute the probability vector p of the next symbol values t knowing all the preceding symbols s0 up to st−1. The  actual  symbol  value st is  encoded  using  an  arithmetic encoder  with approximately −log2 ( pst ) bits. Then the model is updated knowing the symbol st. The decoder works symmetrically so there is no need to transmit the model parameters. It implies both encoder and decoder update their model identically.When  no  preprocessing  is  done, st represents  the  byte  at  position t. Hence there are Ns= 256 different symbol values from 0 to Ns−1.&#34;For those usually familiar with Huffman coding this is using an Arithmetic coding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_codingIt allows adaptive coding (i.e. changing the probabilities of symbols dynamically). Here these probabilities are modelled dynamically using a neural network.The magic is that the neural network parameters are defined implicitly : You don&#39;t need to transmit the neural network parameters, therefore you can use as big as you want neural network.During the decoding the from scratch network is continuously trained using the freshly decoded data, in the same way that it was during the encoding. The more data you compress, the more you train the internal neural network parameters, and the better the prediction for next character gets.You decode 20 bytes, you update the model with this new data, you decode 20 new bytes with the new model, you update the model,... , every 1000000 bytes you can even update your model multiple times using all currently available data to make the network converge faster.Of course this only works if everything is exactly deterministic, which Fabrice Bellard took great effort in guaranteeing, which is no small engineering feat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Compression speed is around 2 KB/sec.The figure is given in nncp_v2.1.pdf. This is 1000x slower than xz, which in turn is 1000x slower than gzip.I have always wondered if a compression service could be a viable commercial offering and with NNCP rates and its compression speed, it looks like it could! That&#39;s for cases when you need to really compress the heck out of something, e.g. prior to distributing a large static piece of data to a very large number of recipients. I think there was a service like this, used by AAA game developers for distributing patches, but it didn&#39;t take because it had a very slow decompression... and, now reading further through the paper, it looks like an issue with NNCP too -    The NNCP v2 decompression speed is similar to its compression speed.

So it&#39;s a no-go for my brilliant and lazy startup idea, but fascinating stuff nonetheless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fabrice Bellard is proof that 10x programmers exist. Or even more than 10x; he single-handled wrote a software 4G LTE base station (https://bellard.org/lte/), something that would normally take a team of hundreds to develop due to the complexity of the specification."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postgres is one of those pieces of software that’s so much better than anything else, it’s really incredible. I wonder if it’s even possible for competitors to catch up at this point - there’s not a lot of room for improvement in architecture of relational databases any more. I’m starting to think that Postgres is going to be with us for decades maybe even centuries.Do any other entrenched software projects come to mind? The only thing comparable I can think of are Git and Linux."</p>

Or does it still rely on problematic, 3rd party tools?Last time I was responsible for setting up a HA Postgres cluster it was a garbage fire, but that was nearly 10 years ago now. I ask every so often to see if it has improved and each time, so far, the answer has been no."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brilliant work.  And it makes me think - we produce tools, that are part of two phase spaces - the idea and the knowledge of how to create it.  Firstly I simply would not have thought of it, &#34;like button inflation&#34; is a pretty off the wall concept.  On top of which I don&#39;t know where to get an HN data feed or how to make a chrome extension etc.
Yesterday I was on a call with a collegue and the conversation turned to a useful feature we did not have (internal use) - and 30 minutes after the idea we had coded it up - because we had the knowledge but only lacked the idea till that moment.Without that knowledge even the best idea moves the process from &#34;yeah let&#39;s do it&#34; to &#34;I should schedule some time and make a project plan and ...&#34;The difference is important somehow.  And most of our working lives would be better if we stopped with the project plans and just built useful stuff.Edit: To try and clarify - exploring a new and uncharted phase space is exploration - it cannot be planned in advance, or driven in a particular direction.  Sun-Tzu teaches that Climate, Landscape and doctrine all affect our success as much or more than mission and leadership - so we should stop trying to control and actually find the flow.I think we search for product-market fit, we do not decide product market fit.One tool I realise i have been trying to build on and off is a post-hoc reporting tool that makes it look like my exploratory development style was actually planned (it&#39;s always something like, I am going to explore this inferring hill over there, and just make sure the roadmap, docs and timesheets are up to date.)  This way I don&#39;t get people bothering me so much.  It works better than grumpy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not sure where we go from here, but not being able to escape anxiety-inducing situations in a workplace is the definition of a toxic work environment. I don&#39;t think the answer is a return to 20th century &#34;no politics at work,&#34; but at the FAANG I worked at, politics was impossible to avoid. Even the desire to be apolitical is itself criticized at worst and not respected at best. Work doesn&#39;t afford the use of the &#34;block user&#34; button. I hope we figure out a better way that respects some people have a hard time immersing in it the way others do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; according to a new Harris poll commissioned by Paradigm, a diversity consultancy, more than two-thirds of adults in America want to be able to discuss racial-justice issues at workI just plain do not believe this poll."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Boards should have more apprehension about their companies being exploited as political platforms by employees.It&#39;s as though there is a bargain where in exchange for boards tolerating staff radicalization, these employee groups cheerfully overlook the dystopian, totalitarian surveillance infrastructure, environmental devastation, and political corruption machines they seem to have zero problem building and managing on their behalf, and decieving users into depending on them. One doesn&#39;t even need to take a side to recognize the bitterness and contempt in tech toward red state denizens. I&#39;ve sat through numerous meetings where all the shibboleths were trotted out to make sure we were all on the same political page before senior executives engaged in what would be considered hate speech against working class people in any other context. If calling people &#34;trash&#34; isn&#39;t hate speech, I really don&#39;t know what is.There still exists a group (perhaps even a majority) in society who are good and charitable people with an immense amount of tolerance for this stuff because they believe tolerance is the price of principles, and they&#39;re only principles when they are hard to keep.Radicalized platform company employees do not have a single moral leg to stand on in this regard. Bringing your whole self to work to build defacto social credit systems and partisan social engineering and surveillance tools is just moral licensing. Maybe that&#39;s how they sleep at night. While they found a new way to take a few more minutes of peoples time to show them outrage and advertisements, at least they mouthed the right party lines in favor of distant oppressed people they don&#39;t know personally?I know a number of people in tech who sincerely believe they do not need to be good men or women by any standard because they are self justified by being engaged not in discourse, but ideological warfare. I used to think they were misguided idealists and I thought their passion could be used for good, but I&#39;ve come to realize they are just dispicable.All I can recommend is, don&#39;t let yourself be bullied."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Jonathan Blow, in a talk about how software is getting worse, points to the example of Ken Thompson&#39;s text editor, which Ken built in a single week.This kind of sentiment drives me crazy. Yes, internationalization makes things harder and more complex than they were in the old days. But, back then, only people who lived in one small part of the world were able to usefully use computers in their language. (Simply supporting the Unicode character set is not enough.)  Nostalgia for the simplicity of the past ends up having ugly cultural implications. It&#39;s easy to say &#34;let&#39;s go back to the time when things were simple&#34;; it&#39;s a lot harder to say &#34;folks in (e.g.) Israel shouldn&#39;t be able to type in their native language&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding the vertical cursor movement, back in the day there was an alternative behavior. You can see this in QuickBASIC/QBasic[1]. Here, Microsoft treated the entire screen as a grid. I always thought that was a great UI. It hides the fact that there are line endings (\n on Unix or \r\n for DOS). And why shouldn&#39;t it? That&#39;s an implementation detail. And as evident by DOS using CR+LF it goes back to the days where you had an actual physical carriage on a typewriter. Nearly every modern text editor you have to type out the spaces/tabs you want to reach the area you what to add text. In QBasic, you just move the cursor wherever you want on the screen with arrow keys and start typing. Because, unlike a typewriter, a computer screen is 2D. Vim has block mode but, AFAIK, can only work on selections. Of course, this is not universal and only works with monospace fonts in certain languages. But back in the day it made it easy to create ASCII/ANSI diagrams and art.Modern text editing is a multilayered mess. Rendering, input methods, variable width fonts, and the special codes (markdown, etc.). On some sites it&#39;s not even self-consistent. Take Jira. Last I checked, they have one editor for creating a ticket and an entirely different editor for editing that same ticket[2] (one of these editors sucks more than the other, but I can never remember which... but neither one is remotely what I would consider a &#34;good&#34; interface). How they got there is truly the 8th Wonder of the World.[1] https://archive.org/details/msdos_qbasic_megapack[2] https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Software-questions/H..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s such a pleasant surprise to me how effectively and quickly people have become concerned about this issue. The recent WWF report came out less than 2 years ago [1]. Microplastics were obviously known for a long time, but that&#39;s when conversations about microplastics re-ignited. And now we can see an entire country declaring plastics toxic and restricting them. If you&#39;d asked me an hour ago, I&#39;d have predicted it&#39;d take at least another decade before concern about this would spread widely enough to prompt a national policy shift. Great to see that raising public awareness can actually do something![1] https://wwf.panda.org/?348371/Could-you-be-eating-a-credit-c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a lot of misleading and false statements in this article.They claim plastic recycling doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s true that most plastic isn&#39;t recycled, but that&#39;s because of lackluster government involvement, not some technological barrier.British Columbia has the most sophisticated recycling equipment in North America. Two plants there first use lasers to identify different types of plastic (PP, HDPE, PET, etc) in the incoming stream and then use air blasts to categorize it.These streams are then separated by color. The material then goes to a plastics reclamation facility where the material is shredded, washed, dried, melted and forced through a filter, and turned to pellet.The result is that 74% of plastic beverage containers in BC are recycled. Why isn&#39;t this done elsewhere? It&#39;s because BC has a tax on plastic packaging, and this tax money is then used to subsidize the loss from converting recyclables into new plastic pellet (the cost is higher than the revenue). And other governments don&#39;t want to do it, partly due to lobbying from plastics packaging manufacturers.Plastic recycling does work when society wants it to. But instead we turn to paper. Paper produces double the CO2 emissions of plastic, and it requires vastly more energy: a European study showed that switching to paper in Europe would consume 57% more energy and 61% more greenhouse gases from packaging than are produced today. In a world where human existence is threatened most likely from runaway climate change, this seems like a bad idea.And while we&#39;re so focused on transitioning plastic packaging to paper, we ignore the real problem with plastic in the oceans: plastic netting dumped from illegal fishing. Plastic netting wraps around animals and drowns or suffocates them. It can also drag along a seabed, killing the seabed life.But this is considered a difficult problem to solve (international waters, policing is difficult, etc) so we ignore it.The idea policy would be:1. Tax plastic packaging. Use the tax money to pay for recycling that works, which has been proven to work.2. Develop international treaties and enforcement mechanisms to prevent illegal fishing and find ways to reduce fish consumption.3. Implement carbon taxes that reflect the cost to human survival imposed by any kind of packaging, or other activity, in accordance with the degree of GHG emission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there are restrictions, I hope they target major microplastic sources like tires and textiles, rather than easily scapegoated but very minor sources, like plastic bags and drinking straws. Based on precedent, I am not holding my breath, but I hope so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this is the second or third time that I&#39;ve seen this browser hit the front page.  Each time I get a little more interested.The concern that I have is that there&#39;s going to be a learning curve to picking this up.  Normally, that&#39;s fine, but this is my browser.  I live in the thing and there&#39;s no other piece of software outside of my IDEs that affects my productivity more.  When I took the time to learn VIM a few years ago, retrospectively, I could have about spent half as much time learning it as I did and skipped a handful of things I don&#39;t use.  The tone isn&#39;t meant to be negative -- that 50% is tremendously useful and it&#39;s rare that I don&#39;t over-learn something (I enjoy it).I&#39;m hoping someone who uses Nyxt as their &#34;primary browser&#34;[0] might be able to provide their thoughts on any of my questions --I use VIM/VIM plug-ins, but Firefox; what&#39;s the experience of becoming proficient with Nyxt?Is there any tool/first-timer/quick-start that works better/worse for acquiring the muscle-memory?Outside of &#34;keyboard&#34; ... As a full stack web developer (various front-ends, mostly .NET web FWIW), what are the &#34;big reasons&#34; that I want this (killer app?)?  Put other ways: Are there any interesting &#34;one-liners&#34;[0] that solved real problems developing web-sites?  Is there any feature that is so amazing that you agonize over it not being available when you&#39;re not on your own hardware?Basically, I&#39;m trying to answer (for myself) whether or not it&#39;s worth the effort to explore integrating this into my work tooling, so I&#39;d love any other input.[0] I&#39;ve not used the product; I&#39;m referring to its programmability -- I can see its use (and do this, today, kludg-ily) -- but I&#39;m wondering if there are any use cases that were surprisingly &#34;magical&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a cool project that I have tried a few times in the past. To me, the big draw is that it is written in Common Lisp. I was a patron contributor for a while, but when I had problems building from source, I stopped. Interfacing Common Lisp to things like WebKit, GTK, or Qt to build Nyxt was probably the reason I failed building from source, IIRC.This is probably a bad analogy, but forty years ago Lisp Machine subsumed the operating system. In modern times, in some sense the web browser is like an operating system layer, or at least a portable application platform. So, my bad analogy is that Nyxt is like a Lisp Machine.If I have time, I will try to build from source today. I just reread the dev source install instructions, and it does look straight forward. Hopefully being on a M1 MacBook won’t affect the build process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Nyxt is web engine agnostic. We utilize a minimal API to interface to any web engine. This makes us flexible and resilient to changes in the web landscape. Currently, we support WebKit and WebEngine (Blink)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the content lead for web.dev. Just wanted to give a quick shout out to the people who made this happen because it&#39;s not clear on the site. I think this is also useful information because you&#39;ll see that a lot of CSS experts we&#39;re involved in this project.Adam Argyle [1] and Una Kravets [2] created the podcast series. Una mainly drove the overall project to convert the podcasts into this written series. Adam provided technical reviews on the written content and I also believe he created most or all of the self-assessments (i.e. the &#39;check your understanding&#39; quizzes). Andy Bell [3] wrote all of the content (and demos, I think). Rachel Andrew [4] edited all the content. Rob Dodson drove the engineering work behind creating this new &#34;courses&#34; infrastructure on web.dev. I was hands-off on this project so I may not have gotten everyone&#39;s roles exactly correct, but I do know these were the main people involved.[1] https://twitter.com/argyleink[2] https://twitter.com/Una[3] https://twitter.com/piccalilli_[4] https://twitter.com/rachelandrew[5] https://twitter.com/rob_dodson"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks great! Small pet peeve regarding tutorials: When learning a new technology I don&#39;t care about the headaches people had 20 years ago. My first concern is how I use the technology and what it can do for me.The section about layout starts with: &#34;In the early days of the web, designs more complex than a simple document were laid out with &lt;table&gt; elements. Separating HTML from visual styles was made easier when CSS was widely adopted by browsers in the late &#39;90s.&#34; etc. etc.This history lesson is not really relevant for newbies. It is basically a &#34;you kids have it easy, when I was your age...&#34;, something which every generating find really tedious to listen to, since it is irrelevant for their current situation.Knowing history is fine when it is relevant (e.g encountering legacy code), but it shouldn&#39;t be the first thing in a tutorial. Put it at the end or in a footnote or appendix.I think it happens because writers tend to explain stuff in the same order they learned it themselves. But this is not always the most natural order to learn things for newcomers."</p>

It works for web-based CSS as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hot take: this, as some like Ars Technica have observed, stands a decent chance of being a real game changer.Everything about this vehicle launch appears masterful, from its technology to its branding to the obvious care taken to ensure that in almost every respect it is so superior, and offers so many no-brainers, as to make anyone who can (both individuals and especially, fleet managers), buy these as fast they can.This thing has more than one killer app.The biggest by far IMO is its ability to power high voltage high draw tools at the jobsite.If you have never worked on a jobsite, this is a BFD.This is itself a game changer, it offers the ability to &#34;disrupt&#34; in a material way a whole class of project. Logistics just got 20% simpler and projects 30% cheaper.Sure, it can go super fast; yes, you can lock your stuff in the truck...But the other killer feature for fleet owners is that these are remotely manageable.Your fleet now has detailed telemetry and its only going to get better.And this is on launch.We just got a RAV4 Prime and if I didn&#39;t live in SF proper, I might be seriously regretting not waiting for this thing. (I don&#39;t, and don&#39;t think this makes sense in the city.)If we move to e.g. Sonoma and work remote? This would be that no brainer.Hallelujah. Now, to invest in Ford..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, the frunk on electric trucks is a game-changer. Complementing the bed with an enclosed, waterproof, secure place to carry things (and no mucking around with insecure bed covers) is a killer feature. No more springing for a crew cab just to carry groceries in the rear seats. In terms of practical carrying capacity this dominates an SUV."</p>

This is amazing.I would suggest to pgboswell that it may be interesting to reach out to a few local professors who teach introductory circuits at some nearby universit(y/ies) and do an in-person demo of the components. You may find you have a significant educational market you could tap into. I could well believe there&#39;s a lot of people who just never quite make it over the abstraction gap to understand circuits who would be able to follow them if they could physically interact with a mechanical circuit running at human orders of magnitude."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A competitive market would enable me to sort by salary and benefits and apply for the best job.However companies don&#39;t want to compete on salary, and potentialy drive them up - they want maximum leverage. They get more leverage if process is obscure, so that you only agree salary late in the process and for the applicant, pulling out is risky.The market is not really free - its being manipulated by one side.Similarly with healthcare you don&#39;t know how much you will be charged upfront, so there is no competition on price.With housing (in UK) there is no competition on quality because the seller doesn&#39;t have to disclose any problems with the house. If it falls of a cliff the minute you sign on the dotted line, it&#39;s your problem.You have to pay for the surveyor to find out any issues the house might have, and that means you can only view a few houses before you&#39;ve paid the house price in survey fees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one reason why this is difficult for companies that are hiring software engineers, is that they can hire at multiple levels of experience. They just need good developers! A company that needs, say, a Golang developer, or Scala, or React, might be willing to hire a junior, mid-level or senior developer- they&#39;ll take whatever experience level they can get. Remember, saying that you don&#39;t want to hire someone too experienced is pushing the envelope on age discrimination laws....So if they&#39;re willing to hire someone with 2-20 years of experience, the salary range may be so broad as to be meaningless. $80-180k doesn&#39;t really tell anyone anything, and I&#39;d imagine regulators can&#39;t do much if that&#39;s what companies put down as their range. I find that a lot of people imagine an open job &amp; job description to be Very Rigid Categories, whereas in practice companies hiring in high-demand fields have to be flexible to find people. From the employer&#39;s point of view, that&#39;s why we find demands for the salary range to be frustrating- lots of companies really don&#39;t have a specific range in mind!If you mandate that companies use a tight salary band, they&#39;ll simply say OK, our Software Developer 1 pays $70-90k, Software Developer 2 pays $90-11k, etc. However- we haven&#39;t decided which level of software developer we&#39;re going to hire you for. Tough for regulators to beat that approach too"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Coloradan another thing that&#39;s happening is companies are listing their jobs as Remote, only advertising in CO, and just mentioning it&#39;s a CO only job verbally. They do the thing where they sit in the gray area due to pandemic &#34;Oh, it&#39;s remote, FOR NOW, but it&#39;s a CO job&#34; Or listing the job as Denver and a few other cities, but it&#39;s really just Denver/Boulder (Twitter currently doing this).Another pattern is listing the range as 40-250k so the disclosure is effectively nothing. Consulting companies Accenture, PwC, Deloitte are doing that one.A few companies are completely rejecting this whole law too. I&#39;ve spoken with a few that still won&#39;t disclose (usually &#34;We aren&#39;t CO based and it doesn&#39;t apply&#34;) or they just straight up aren&#39;t doing it with no comment. Experienced many recruiters completely flustered by it."</p>

Thanks to everyone for checking out voice2json!The TLDR of this project is: a unified command-line interface to different offline speech recognition projects, with the ability to train your own grammar/intent recognizer in one step.My apologies for the broken packages; I&#39;ll get those fixed shortly. My focus lately has been on Rhasspy (https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy), which has a lot of the same ideas but a larger scope (full voice assistant).Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcomed and appreciated!"</p>

Similar trick of using line density, but in this case it&#39;s using a randomized curved flowfield for texture. The fun thing is the experimental &#34;flow along image edges&#34; feature where you get some lines tracing edges in the original picture. https://github.com/serycjon/vpype-flow-imager"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Although I ~never used Apple products, a good ten-fifteen years ago I ran through a quite expensive &#34;Apple Human Interface Design&#34;[1] book. After that, whenever another &#34;book&#34; / blog series / etc came out about &#34;UI&#34;, I was discarding them saying &#34;and now what, that&#39;s just common sense&#34;.It. Is. Not.The more companies and people I had been working with, the more I started to see that most of the UI design (or for that matter, displaying information on a UI / document / advertisement) what I thought had become &#34;common sense&#34;, hadn&#39;t. Most of my colleagues cannot properly position / color a button. Cannot structure a document (headers, tables, bulletpoints) to be easily comprehensible, consumable. Struggle to summarize information in an email.This 50 UI tips is great! Thanks for this. I will share as a baseline with my team.[1]: I can&#39;t find which one. Maybe its title was something different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks! Well done.As noted below, most of this is “common sense,” but there’s a saying:“Common sense. So rare, it’s a God damn superpower.”https://www.joeydevilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/commo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I liked the points you raised, I think they serve as a good checklist for the finer details of designing UI.One critique I had when I was reading through is the use of he/him when referring to a hypothetical user. This is likely region-dependent, but it sounds awkward to me to assign gender to an unknown user.Some authors prefer they/them and some (more rarely) prefer an equal number of masculine and feminine pronouns.Great work, nonetheless."</p>

Which is utterly perverse, as on one hand the UK govt is despairing about the extent to which the UK is dependent on Big Tech social media and the control they exert on society... whilst simultaneously pushing through legislation which effectively ensures that GAFAM are the only people who can operate!The Matrix approach to addressing abuse is https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix... (and we&#39;re in the middle of building out the first implementation of the decentralised reputation proposal right now) - but it is not pleasant to think that if a judge considered that approach inadequate, the directors of UK entities providing Matrix hosting (e.g. Element, running matrix.org on behalf of The Matrix.org Foundation) would be eligible for jail time \o/Needless to say, we&#39;re doing our best to explain to the UK Govt that their Bill is throwing out the baby along with bathwater..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Whilst we sympathise with the government’s desire to show action in this space and to do something about children’s safety (everyone’s safety really), we cannot possibly agree with the methods.Respectfully, stop sympathising with authoritarians who want to take away your freedom. They are not good people. Good people aren&#39;t nosey. Good people don&#39;t deprive others of liberty. Neither do they class a whole group (Internet users and entrepreneurs) as responsible for the actions of a minority. Guilt by association and collective punishment are antithetical to any lover of freedom and life.Their reasons of &#39;child safety&#39; and &#39;online harms&#39; (whatever on earth that means) are simply pretexts. They don&#39;t give a shit about children&#39;s safety. This bill will do nothing, nothing to improve the safety of children. The perpetrators will simply go after children in other ways. They won&#39;t change.If you, Mr. MP, care about children then ask why are they drawn to bad online content? What&#39;s going wrong with families and upbringing? Start with questions that might actually address the problem rather than implicate everyone who uses the Internet!The trajectory is to increase their power and control over your life. Again, they are NOT good people. They know EXACTLY what they are doing. They love dominating you. It&#39;s understandable why some imagine the government as simply well-meaning but misguided, for it makes our helpless subjection easier to accept. But we won&#39;t stop getting the boot from the state until we start calling their actions out as morally reprehensible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to see UK becoming one of the apologists of internet censorship, closing the gap to the levels of authoritarian countries.Once you have censorship facility in place, the area of its application will only grow. The term &#34;illegal information&#34; is also widely used in Russia for the same purpose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a J2ME app that needed to access location on phones without GPS, I was in touch with the operator and got a list of cell ids with lat, lon.With that I created a daemon in Symbian that would query the cell id and open up a socket server to give it to the J2ME app.With that we developed an app to request a taxi service, but none of the taxi companies wanted it. Some of the complaints were:1. GPRS data plans were too expensive for end users
2. No one would put an expensive Sony Ericsson touch phone on a windshield, the windshield would be broken by thieves to steal it.
3. Looking at a screen on the windshield while driving was never going to be approved by authorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, do I have fond memories of developing on feature phones!Started wayyy back in 2007, and was a cofounder of a startup that made popular J2ME games available for free to people by wrapping it in our proprietary ad serving software. We launched more or less the same time that AbMob did, invented more or less the same stack (ad delivery to mobile phones), but we focussed on the product (games) whereas they focussed on the platform (ad delivery). A few years later AdMob was acquired for mega $$$ by Google, whereas we just kind of limped along and died a slow, natural death! Many years later I discovered that my cofounder just let our 4 letter domain expire (www.hovr.com) and I think it&#39;s up for sale now :(Also remember developing games on the BREW platform by Qualcomm, circa 2005. Whereas I was in India which mostly had GSM J2ME phones, BREW was much more popular on North American CDMA handsets. I, along with a friend, developed one of the first real-time multiplayer games called Blingster Battle, which was on top of Verizon&#39;s charts for a brief period of time! Truly groundbreaking stuff at that time..The most amazing bit, though, was when we made some BREW apps around 2013. By then iOS and Android had firmly taken over the smartphone market, and all the cool kids were downloading apps/games on them. However there was a very significant portion of the market - primarily composed of the elderly - who were still hanging on to their old CDMA feature phones and were still interested in buying new apps. We made a couple of quiz types games, that actually generated a couple of thousand dollars in revenue every month till last year, until Qualcomm finally pulled the plug on BREW!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a startup, Javaground [1], where we ported and developed games for J2ME phones.  We had a room full of dressers full of all the different mobile phones of the day.Each phone had different implementation quirks, such as variable audio delay when playing a file, audio/image formats that were faster/slower, odd button events (some used press, some used ondown, some had no ondown, etc).  A lot of our work was learning all of these quirks and implementing them into the automated porting platform.Then the iPhone came out and started to build momentum.I still have my old flip phone, the one with the least quirks, with some of our games on it.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javaground"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The new auto-complete is really impressive.I&#39;ve always been a big fan of using snippets and auto-completing based on open buffers in a project instead of using LSPs.I haven&#39;t used ST in a while but decided to install ST4 to try it out.I opened a Flask application that uses SQLAlchemy. I opened a Python file and typed User. and then it showed me a list of fields and methods on my User model without having the User model open in a buffer.I did the same thing in an Elixir project and after installing the Elixir package it worked for project specific &#34;things&#34; in my app. Like after typing UserView. it showed me only functions available in that view. Likewise it did the same thing with context modules, it picked up all functions inside of a specific module.In both cases as I started typing &#34;User&#34; it showed me options to pick from. In both cases it also listed out the number of definitions for a specific &#34;thing&#34; and lets you quickly jump to a specific one. If you mouse over a function it brings up the list to pick a definition / reference. There&#39;s also key binds to bring up a CTRL+p&#39;ish feeling menu to see and preview the file where something is being used.It&#39;s not as good as a LSP but it&#39;s definitely a few notches above what I&#39;ve seen in other editors and the best part about it is not needing to configure multiple LSPs and it&#39;s lightning fast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel bad using VSCode after years of supporting Sublime (by purchasing a license). However the one case where I do use sublime repeatedly? When I need to open an editor QUICKLY. It boots faster than VSCode, and frankly, it finally broke me of my constant habit of VIMming now that I have it on my mac, win and linux boxes. I am eager to try V4, but I&#39;m so deep in VSCode now, I don&#39;t know if I can find my way out! I can even cross compile C and debug in VSCode!"</p>

Just something about seeing everyone at their best 100% of the time, doing amazing things 100% of the time, never facing adversity 100% of the time.I know it&#39;s not realistic but it still gets to your head.I uninstalled it from my phone I feel better about myself after a few weeks.I&#39;m guessing most of, if not all, social media is the same.

So Facebook&#39;s opinion in the matter is moot. There are practically no inputs to this function that will change its behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The correlational evidence showing that there is a link between social media use and depression is pretty definitive at this point,&#34; said Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University. &#34;The largest and most well-conducted studies that we have all show that teens who spend more time on social media are more likely to be depressed or unhappy.&#34;&gt; Correlation is not causation, and one area of further study is whether greater social media usage leads to poor mental health outcomes or whether those who are depressed and unhappy are drawn to spend more time on social media.These are correlational studies. They aren&#39;t saying that they have evidence that Facebook causes depression. They&#39;re saying that increased social media usage is correlated with depression.Stepping back, it appears that screen time is correlated with depressive symptoms, with or without social media. One such study: Association between screen time and depression among US adults https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574844/ This includes watching TV or simply using a computer for leisure of any sort.I know Facebook is a popular villain, but we shouldn&#39;t be jumping to conclusions that this data means Facebook causes depression or that Facebook is uniquely worse than other forms of screen time in its correlation with depression."</p>

Also very cheap (iirc $15).Software:JetBrains tools. Basically the only software I can imagine spending $250 a year on, and it actually being worth it.Patreon and Github sponsors. Not much (I think $15 a month total). It&#39;s sad how few sponsors a lot of these projects have. I&#39;m not rich, but I can afford donating $5/month here and there. I really think the world would be a better place if more people donate to open source and content creators they like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unlikely to get upvoted here but a used Porsche Panamera with an extended bumper-to-bumper manufacturer warranty.  As Doug Demuro says it&#39;s cheap, really cheap.There&#39;s not a single brand new car costing, say, 75 K EUR or less that I&#39;d have rather than that because the quality simply ain&#39;t there.The ride comfort, soundsystem, sound insulation, interior quality, how it drives superbly (and can yet be used for some spirited drive if you fancy that), etc.Best car I ever had. Next one is going to be another used Panamera, probably the plug-in hybrid. I tried the Porsche Taycan (their 100% EV) and it&#39;s amazing but I&#39;ll wait a bit until you can find used ones at bargain prices.I&#39;m a big fan of Tesla but, to me, the build quality simply ain&#39;t anywhere close: as in... It&#39;s not even remotely comparable. They are worlds apart. And as I don&#39;t rice at the greenlight, I don&#39;t care about the 0-60 perfs.There&#39;s nothing better to cruise at 110 mph on the autobahn or to go pick up the kid at school.It&#39;s high-end luxury with quality materials for less than the price of a new Camry.https://youtu.be/EAezax2ugQUBy very far my favorite purchase of the last two years+."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Airpods Pro.Not traditionally an apple guy so didn&#39;t expect to like them, but the guy talked us into them while we were upgrading my wife&#39;s phone.Wow. These things are just way better than any other earbuds and so much more convenient and comfortable than headphones. The Bluetooth just works even when switching between my Android and MacBook. The noise cancelling is great as well, way better than my Sennheisers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My company is moving away from it. We built a few services but after a few years some of the original people that introduced it left the company and it became very difficult to hire for. New hires were either people wanting to learn (so we had to spend a good bunch of resources into teaching + end up with a system built by noobs to the language) or very expensive developers with a lot of experience in erlang and elixir.We also found many times missing libraries, or found libraries which are incomplete, or unmaintained or just not well documented. Just compare the total amount of libraries in Hex, vs the total amount of libraries in rubygems. Somebody will say &#34;but Elixir libraries are higher quality so we need less, etc,etc&#34; as if there were not good developers in the ruby world and every elixir developer were a rockstar.Tooling is just terrible. The VSCode plugin is crap, kills the CPU unless you disable features. There is no IDE from jetbrains. There is a plugin but last time I tried it, it was even worse than the VSCode plugin.Also, I&#39;ve read some comments where people mention &#34;we don&#39;t need redis&#34;, &#34;we don&#39;t need workers&#34; everything is so much easier. That was our thinking at first. But then you realize on deployments you will lose your cache, or your background jobs, etc. So you have to persist them either in mnesia or in the database. At that point you&#39;re just reinventing your crappy undocumented and untested version of delayed_job.Most of what you get from elixir in terms of redundancy, high availability, etc you can have that anyway from kubernetes, heroku or any PaaS.... you will need more than 1 server anyway, so...Liveview sounds amazing until you try to use it in the real world. The most minimum latency kills the experience.In the end, we are back to Rails and much happier. Specially now we are using all the hotwire stuff. Not fancy, and not fashionable though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m at a relatively early stage VC-backed startup and from day 1 it&#39;s been written in Elixir. It was a fantastic choice, for many reasons, with some being:- Elixir is good for just getting stuff done. I came from a previous startup that used Go and Elm.- The community isn&#39;t as small as people make it out to be, or, it&#39;s quality over quantity. ;)- There&#39;s a lot of good modules out there, and if you need to write your own, it&#39;s easy and there&#39;s well-defined patterns. E.g. I recently improved our internal Zendesk client and it was a breeze.- https://dashbit.co/ for paid support/advice is amazing.- The console for experimentation, debugging, inspection, etc. is fantastic.- The let it crash, and other Elixir/Erlang philosophies, have been very helpful.- There&#39;s a solid amount of batteries-included, but not in an overbearing/restrictive way.- It&#39;s such a pleasant day-to-day dev experience.I didn&#39;t know Elixir before joining this startup. For myself, and workmates who also didn&#39;t have prior experience, it&#39;s been a breeze to get up to speed in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not argument &#34;against&#34; selecting it (it&#39;s a free world, and mileage vary), but a couple of scar-earned advice:- Be careful about libraries. If you know that your system has to interact with X, don&#39;t assume that there is a running, idiomatic, maintained libary for X on `hex.pm`.
Do a bit of due diligence. 
We had experience ranging from `meeh` (oauth2, graphql, http) to `pretty bad` (mqtt, swagger.)But as other say, if you&#39;re doing vanilla Phoenix/Plug/Ecto with exactly the right kind of DB, you&#39;ll should be ok.- Give a little though about how you&#39;ll be deploying and operating. `releases` and `configuration` haved changed in pretty big ways in the past (https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2019/06/24/elixir-v1-9-0-releas...), the ecosystem is constantly in flux (`config.exs` vs `Application.get_env` vs ENV_VAR vs..) . Plus, the erlang virtual machine (BEAM) has knobs that are not always easy to play with. And if you hide it behind, say, docker containers, you&#39;ll have other troubles. Don&#39;t expect an `heroku do-some-magic` experience.- Unless you&#39;re familiar with the Actor Model already, and your application is very simple, expect a learning curve made of:  1. A period where you&#39;re afraid of GenServer and fail to do anything because you don&#39;t want to create a supervision tree
  2. A period where you think you&#39;ve understood GenServers and you create GenServers like crazy
  3. A sobering period where you don&#39;t understand anything about your application
  4. A couple of refactorings where you move the pendulum until you reach something that&#39;s acceptable

- Finally, you&#39;re coming from RoR, so you&#39;re probably fine with not having static types anyway ; may St Isidore help you ;)  There is a thing called `dialyxir`. It might help a bit ; It will disappoint a lot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really good stuff, even for abled people. For example, being able the use the watch one-handed is great if your other hand is occupied, like carrying something.(The reason I still wear a watch at all is so I can see the time without having to dig the phone out of my pocket and turn it on, which is hopeless while driving.)Just like although I can hear, I use closed-captioning when I don&#39;t wish to disturb others, or when watching a show at high speed (I can read faster than I can understand speech)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Everyday sounds can be distracting, discomforting, or overwhelming, and in support of neurodiversity, Apple is introducing new background sounds to help minimize distractions and help users focus, stay calm, or rest. Balanced, bright, or dark noise, as well as ocean, rain, or stream sounds continuously play in the background to mask unwanted environmental or external noise, and the sounds mix into or duck under other audio and system sounds.Wow, I never thought of background sounds as something connected to neurodiversity, but TIL.I definitely never expected Apple to get into the business of white noise apps, but here they are.I wonder what the quality of these sounds will be, how long they&#39;ll loop for? And if all the background noise apps that already exist will continue to operate as they do now, or if they&#39;ll be able to integrate with this in order to take advantage of the new mixing/ducking features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My money doesn&#39;t seem to fit in any of the slots on my computer...Apple just keeps knocking it out of the park and into a completely new sports metaphor assistive technology provision, they really do. Any measure, I&#39;m a massive nerd/geek/hacker and I really have looked into alternatives both in the open source and proprietary basis and nobody at all is assistive technology as well as at all right now.It really is as simple as whenever I have a new iShiny, I pounds on the nearest able-bodied monkey and get them to take total box and connected to Wi-Fi and then it&#39;s all me. From then on I don&#39;t need any more able-bodied assistance whatsoever with setting up the new device, it&#39;s awesome. And whilst it&#39;s been a few months, the last time I looked known of the other major players were able to come anywhere close to this level of frictionless setup for quadriplegics like me.ALSO! ALSO! Let&#39;s not forget that this isn&#39;t some crappy subset of functions that quadriplegics have to settle for whilst everybody else gets the full fat version of the software. Nope, with very few exceptions pretty much anything an able-bodied person can do with their iShiny I&#39;ll be able to do as well. Just a little slower.Apple, and specifically their approach to accessibility is only one of many reasons I&#39;m able to work, see my family and generally engage with society as well as I currently do.Also, I quite like the term cripple, differently abled or on a good day Stuart. WTF cares what label you give me, I am much more interested in whether this laptop enables me to do the shopping independently and see my Nieces without having to check with an able-bodied person first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Several versions ago Jose talked about how Elixir is basically &#34;done&#34;, which is so refreshing these days!But since then, the developer experience has improved by leaps and bounds through all these improvements other than the core language. As a professional Elixir developer for the last 4 years, I&#39;m loving it. A few improvements in the last few versions off the top of my head that have been really nice:* Robust, timezone handling DateTime support in the standard library. I don&#39;t need Timex anymore!* Finally a good approach for configuring applications ar run time (e.g. with ENV vars), that works for dev, test, prod and releases, via config/runtime.exs.* Better compiler warnings verging on a little &#34;light&#34; type checking* Mix.install in this release finally makes Elixir work well for one-off little scripts, since you can just throw a Mix.install([:jason, :mojito]) on top.* LiveView is amazing, and I now keep open a LiveBook notebook for doodling in code, exploring an API, CSV, etc* Not really Elixir, but I&#39;m jazzed about Erlang/OTP 24 JIT support for better performance.Basically, if you took a look at Elixir a few years ago and thought it wasn&#39;t ready, might be worth another peek now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"See also, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27192873 (Ask HN: Are you satisfied with Elixir or do you regret choosing Elixir?) with great insights about the language.Another popular thread that comes to mind is the one about Discord scaling Elixir (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14748028 and https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19238221)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one thing I’ll say about Elixir I’m always impressed how disciplined they are with the issue tracker on GitHub. Currently 17 issues for such a broad piece of work seems nothing less than astonishing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an outside observer, who has no crypto holdings at all, but is very deeply invested in the public stock market with a heavy weight on technology stocks... this doesn&#39;t look like a crash to me at all. It just looks like some steam being let off and old investors cash out and new investors get more comfortable with how much and where to invest.I consider crypto currency as it is to be an elaborate Ponzi scheme (personal view), but even with that cynicism nothing about this dip looks unhealthy to me. (I have views on what ultimately happens, but I will hold back on that)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bitcoin is the ultimate, purely financial object. It has no revenues or profits. The supply is fixed -- unlike, say, gold, where high prices mean people will eventually start digging mines, BTC supply is entirely price-inelastic. The only thing that determines BTC price is demand. And over the past 13 years, we&#39;ve seen reflexivity at work: The price has gone up, so more people want it, so the price goes up further, and on and on.There&#39;s no reason this can&#39;t happen in reverse. As in previous crashes, once the price starts going down, more people want to sell.Really just an interestingly pure experiment in group psychology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We are living in a culture of overwork because work (esp. desk work) has lost all boundaries.I&#39;m in academia and had been idealizing overwork for quite a while (&#34;the noble goal of devoting your life to science!&#34;), but now have to fend off becoming cynical about the culture (increasingly after a parent with a blue collar-company died shortly before their well-earned retirement, stress played a role here).I have met various of these types, obviously not all scientists are like this, but they seem to become more frequent the more one raises up the ladder:* spending years in an excitingly different foreign country.. on a desk, experiencing little of what the country has to offer (think spending 10 years in California but never visiting Yosemite or the Grand Ganyon), sometimes condescending when told about travel experiences in the same country* working up to the point where they appear to be in psychological pain and lost authentic interest* complete tunnel vision about work* abusive behaviour because of stress* talking suicide in project meetings* continuous smart drug usage* lunch with them is usually cynical, edgy and negative* regret that they&#39;ve lost their 20s to academic workAcademically, these are often quite successful people whose ideas and scientific results are admired. I&#39;d like to stay in academia but fear I will be erased from the system if I don&#39;t pay the same price. Is this view too negative? Can someone offer a different perspective here?Could some older users share their (anecdotal) experiences and perspective on this topic? How did continuous heavy overwork pay off for people you have observed (or yourself)? Is this just temporary and can be overcome by smarter decisions about where to allocate energy?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would differentiate between “working” and “sitting in the office”. My grandfather was a passionate carpenter. His workweek was always at least 60 hours. Sourcing wood, visiting clients, organizing everything, etc. He was in good shape and died at 92 years age. Being forced to sit in the office 45 hours a week I don’t think that I reach age above 60 years. This sitting whole day in the noisy environment was destroying my health. Luckily pandemic came and I was able to work from home."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love stories like this. I have one of my own, actually.When I was first getting into IT I started sending out CVs. Mine was terrible. I had been working in call centres for years at this point and all my &#34;experience&#34; was basically self-taught, so not really experience at all. As a result my CV was void of any actual content a hiring manager in IT would want to read, thus it was binned a lot.I applied for a job at a nearby network hardware repair place. They needed someone to look after their Cisco kit and about 30 Debian Linux systems. I was attracted to the mix of responsibilities so I applied, sending in me not-so-good CV. I was eventually asked to come in to have a chat after waiting about a week to hear back from the place.At the end of the interview, Bob (let&#39;s call him), said I was more knowledgeable than the RHCEs that were coming through his door. This was nice to hear, but then he said something that really made me smile...Apparently my CV was worse than I thought. It was so bad, that Bob literally put it in the bin under his desk. About four days later, Bob was reading through a local Linux User Group (LUG) mailing list and he saw a name he recognised: mine. So he opens the email and reads the thread in which I helped another LUG member compile a sound driver for their kernel. The instructions I gave worked.Bob was impressed but he couldn&#39;t quite remember where he had seen the name. At this point the business owner, John (heh...), was standing besides Bob&#39;s desk and noticed my CV in the bin. He pulls it out and reads my name across the top. The penny drops for Bob and I get the call to come in and have a chat.I got the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was 1992 and I was a high school senior.  My teacher got me a job at the local DPW in the electical department.  I was to work in the warehouse under a guy named Al who was an old timer and lost his hand in a forklift accident 30 years prior.  My job was to clean the warehouse, and when I was done Al told me to &#39;go hide somewhere&#39; which I did, at the top of the shelves 20&#39; in the air, which I had also cleaned.  
This got boring and so I wandered into the main office where people were huddled over a computer.  They were doing a mail-merge with quick basic to inform customers that their power would be out, and it wasn&#39;t working.
I looked over their shoulders and it was exactly what I had been doing to send out mailings to companies for free stuff as I had read in Radio-Electonics magazine.
I fix the problem, and the Chief Engineer said &#39;come with me&#39; and takes me to the (air conditioned!) sub-station and into an even colder computer room where they had just setup the SCADA system to control the towns breakers and monitor the power.  
Nobody knew how to program it, so he pointed to a 3&#39; pile of manuals and said this was my new job.  By the end of the summer we saved the town millions by siphoning power from the local college at peak power demand.  I still hung out with Al, and helped him in the mornings.  The linesmen still made fun of me, even more so when I accidentally turned off half the towns power for 15 minutes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a kind of similar story when I started studying in the late 2000s years. There was a company that had a specialized and really expensive measurement device. But the vendor went out of service. They changed part of their system but kept the measurement device only to find out it could not talk to the new system because the file system of the data was proprietary to the measurement device.I got a student job at that company and one of my first tasks (and that of several students before me) was to open measurement results on the device and type them into excel spreadsheets. I did this for an hour or so until I became totally bored so I started to tinker around. The measurement device had it&#39;s own PC that booted Windows (I think it was 95 or 98) and autostarted their software in full screen/some sort of . This was easy to bypass via the task manager and running explorer.exe. I found out that the proprietary file format was simplay an MS Access file with a different extension. I tried to open it, but the file was password protected.   
At this time I had little to none experience with programming or anything else that was &#34;low level&#34; computer stuff, but I occasionally stumbled about writeups about hacks and exploits and skimmed over them. So I was pretty sure that there had to be a hardcoded password somewhere. I started to open every file I could in a text editor with no luck. Then I got a hex editor and opened the binaries and finally, in a dll there was a password. 
The next few days at this job I spent teaching myself enough Python to read the Access files and write the contents into an Excel file.This worked and I used the free time to study/eat/sleep while getting paid for it but then one of my supervisors found out that I wasn&#39;t doing anything but still got results and wondered how I did it. He immediately put me onto another problem they had, thus starting my career as a software engineer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many of the comments on this article are so cold. I can’t believe it. When I read the original article I was imagining all the constructive ways HN readers would interpret it and hold a mirror up to their own behaviour. Some commenters are doing this. But it surprises and depresses me how many people are commenting saying “no, this list isn’t what it says it is, it’s a list showing the author has a negative mindset / is not from the Valley bubble, and that problem can be fixed by just getting over it.”. We can do better than that.As someone who has sat at some interesting class and race intersections during my career in tech, including my time at some very prestigious institutions like the University of Cambridge and FAANG, and has exhibited and noticed many of the listed behaviours and the lack there of, I can say this article had the undeniable ring of truth and made me feel sick to my stomach. Guilty for when I’ve been on the rich side and angry for the times I’ve been on the poor side.The psychology of growing up with financial uncertainty - and a risk of racial exclusion - is hard to shake and can be passed from parent to child. My life has mostly been financially blessed but you can’t buy your way out of the mindset, or snap your fingers / empty the cache / cycle the power the way the average HN commenter seems to think you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Three paychecks is a month and a half of income (rent and two car payments by my fevered calculations, which never stop)&#34;Pay attention to those last three words. This is very important. I&#39;ve been on both sides too, and to me those words are like a slap in the face: stark reality.If you&#39;re poor enough (relative to the costs of your life) you are at a constant exhausting deficit because you CANNOT stop calculating and recalculating the mechanisms of your basic survival. Even if you&#39;re not juggling bills and having to gauge what will blow up worst, you&#39;re projecting worst-case scenarios and trying to plan against adverse situations, which will come up more often for you (example: old car problems)&#34;which never stop&#34;Consider those words seriously. You can improve the quality and performance of a person a great deal by allowing them to function as they &#39;normally&#39; would, rather than in constant emergency mode."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m from a &#34;poorish&#34; family, but from Europe. Some stuff is relatable some is not:- People ordering lunch always felt weird for me, in my mind I think &#34;why should I pay 10€ for a bowl of salad, when I can go to the grocery store below the office and have the same for 1€&#34;, or even better pay 70 cents for the raw vegetables, wash them and chop them in the office and they will last 3 days- Student debt doesn&#39;t apply, the good thing of being &#34;poor&#34; in Italy is that the country pays you to go to university and not the opposite- When I got my first tech job I was like &#34;wow, I got a MacBook just for joining the company, this costs like 1 year of salary of my previous job&#34;- The part of stealing I don&#39;t find relatable, even when my bank account was empty I would never resort to stealing, must be some honour system I grew up with- The gym part is also not relatable, when I was fat and I did go to the gym everyone was very supportive, and every little progress was celebrated by everyone making you want to go more and more.A thing I notice, is that the mentality stays with you no matter your salary, I always try to avoid spending more than necessary, with a comparison with my colleagues my monthly expenses are less than 1/3 compared to them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to me that the draft was censored and mentioned a buyer, while this one only talks about control. For me, it paints the situation worse.Still sad to see FreeNode fall. This will lead to a lot of split communities and dead links.EDIT: Fuchs finds some harsher words[0]:&gt; In the past few weeks, this has changed[2], and the existance of a legal threat
to freenode has become apparent. We cannot know the substance of this legal
threat as it contains some kind of gag order
preventing its broader discussion within staff.
The democratically elected heads of their respective teams, 
development, infrastructure, projects and communities
were removed by force[3] and have been informed that they are not 
entitled to act in their respective capacity.&gt; [...] A contract in which christel, former head of staff, allegedly sold freenode, surfaced.
And while I personally think that this would have neither included any servers
or code or user data, since that did not belong to christel to sell, I am not a lawyer
and apparently some of our volunteers got pressured very hard and their personal life
could have been ruined easily should we have fought against this apparent contract.This makes it look far more hostile than the linked note. Sad to see.[0] https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this leads to a mass exodus from Freenode, it&#39;ll probably significantly reduce overall IRC usage.Communities will fracture, people will set up random splinter networks that will die off in a few months, and lots of open-source projects that already want to be using something Javascripty like Slack or Discord are going to use this as the motivating thing to make the switch.Personally I&#39;m staying put on Freenode because I don&#39;t see a lot of user-facing impact potential here, and IRC was already essentially untrusted/public (yes, even your private messages - you don&#39;t really know who is relaying them and how trustworthy they are)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Giving your project to a stranger on the internet is risky, so we used escrow.com to make the transfer.I sold a website on Flippa once. The buyer put the money on Escrow.com, I transferred everything over, and they went AWOL. What I found out is that there is no straightforward way to obtain the funds when it happens. Apparently there is no way at all except via the court system. Which would mean the only real protection Escrow gives is against the buyer going bankrupt (or using false identity, I suppose).Fortunately, they came back several weeks later with some nonsensical excuse and closed the transaction, but I will never use Escrow.com again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hard to take this seriously with all the straw men and broad generalizations.Reality check: there has never been a hotter seller&#39;s market for software engineering talent.  The fact that you have not landed a job does not mean that supply is not short in general.  Rather than blowing your stack at some recruiter who you heard on a podcast interview, you might want to reflect on yourself and how you might be coming off in job interviews.As far as low pay goes, yeah, welcome to the labor market.  It&#39;s easy to write a blog post about how companies need to pay more, but hard to reconcile the reality that if they don&#39;t have FAANG cash flows, &#34;market rate&#34; for developers may not be viable, regardless of management&#39;s good intentions or lack thereof.And with regard to bad interviews, remember interviewers are individuals, with skillsets all over the map.  Once you get more senior it gets even more frustrating to be judged by someone who has a fraction of your experience.  Trust me when I say there is no value in dwelling on this or getting your undies in a bunch.  Suck it up and figure out how to play the game (read CtCI, practice on interviewing.io, ask for feedback) and land the job, then do the best work you can every day.  Angry screeds will not change anything about the industry and will not help you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This person sounded really experienced, so I looked them up on LinkedIn. 7 months at their first company. 9 months at their current company. That&#39;s it, aside from non-programming jobs before their bootcamp.The whole thing reads like inventing scenarios that didn&#39;t happen or embellishing them.&gt; A bad interview is when you ask them the definition of some specific thing in some specific framework like “Tell me what a closure in javascript is.” then treat them like they’re stupid if they don’t know.Not that believable, but okay.&gt; I once had an interviewer ask me if I was a wizard with GO, C++, Rust, and C over the phone. Then when I said I had some experience with rust, he immediately cursed at me and hung up.Didn&#39;t happen.&gt; Nobody in their right mind is going to move to San Francisco, California to be a “Lead developer” for only 70k with zero equity.Are any companies actually trying to recruit like this? And is it successful beyond just throwing up a hiring post and not getting anything? I put in a limit buy of $3000 for 1 BRK/A on a whim once."</p>

I&#39;ve done a fair bit of interviewing on both sides of the table, and can say with complete honesty I&#39;ve never heard a curse said in anger in any of them. I&#39;ve also never heard of it happening from a co-worker or friend."</p>

Already feeling like some of these are one person&#39;s opinion, biased towards the current status quo in mobile/web. Although there are a lot of good points around padding, font, contrast, etc. Main theme seems to be around consistency.Edit: Okay, well, I got  7580

I think a lot of this was more &#34;find the difference&#34; than it was &#34;tell me what version is better&#34;. Once you are able to find the subtle difference, it&#39;s pretty obvious which one is better, mostly because one of them lacks self-consistency. I think a lot of the tracking, color, and tint differences were pretty opinionated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a big fan of 1Password. I&#39;ve been paying for it for years. A few years ago I got my partner setup in a few minutes and now they have strong passwords everywhere.  Its got great features for sharing vaults with other people so I&#39;ve got password managers setup for the kids too. My partner and I both have personal vaults, we have a shared vault for financial stuff, and a shared vault for our media accounts (that we share with the kids too)I get that people bristle about SaaS subscriptions in their personal life but the $60/year it costs is well worth it. The research shows that strong passwords and limiting re-use is extremely effective at preventing account compromises and 1Password makes this dead simple.The thing that finally made it an incredible app was when Apple finally allowed 3rd party password management in iOS.Yes there might be better password managers out there and they might have better security. However show me an alternative with a UX that is simple enough for my 6 year old to use, that works on iOS, Android, MacOS, and now Linux."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA: Note that AgileBits intentionally hides the standalone license option and pushes subscription as the only visible scheme to get the application. This is a long standing dark pattern, and though the support staff will admit on their forums or here that the standalone license does exist, you wouldn&#39;t be able to find it without some special incantations on the forums. They will keep reiterating that it&#39;s for your own good so that you don&#39;t get confused.The application UX may be great. The sync may be great. The security of the closed source application may be great (because of audits). But this single dark pattern and the condescending attitude of their team members whenever the topic of standalone license comes up are enough to avoid this company. If you can get to the standalone license purchase option within three or four clicks from the main site, do let me know.I switched out of 1Password to Bitwarden long ago. I will admit that Bitwarden is not fantastic (I find it somewhat slow and also lacking some features). But it doesn&#39;t use dark patterns like AgileBits does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting:&gt; 1Password for Linux also debuts with several features that are coming soon to 1Password for Mac, Windows, iOS, and AndroidThat should be encouraging for Linux users. It suggests that the Linux version is not just a port that will forever at best follow the other platforms. It can get pretty annoying when you have something that is available on multiple platforms, and your platform tends to always lag the others."</p>

If it were easy or simple to issue a money with distributed signing, it&#39;d have been done before Bitcoin&#39;s PoW&lt;-&gt;Difficulty Adjustment&lt;-&gt;Fixed Money Issuance novel art was published.Ethereum has been &#34;about to release PoS&#34; for almost 6 years now and all of the initial critiques (By issuing X units of value, you incentivize ~&lt;X units of energy to be expended)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proof of Stake is already how our current financial system works. The people with the most money make the decisions. Proof-of-Work is provably resistant to this, as evidenced by the 2017 blocksize debate where almost every large miner and bitcoin company wanted to change the protocol and it was fought off through grassroots efforts. A PoS currency will be controlled by a cabal of US financial institutions, and indirectly by the US regulatory system. Be careful what you wish for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A good friend of mine at Google is the technical lead of this project (he has a Phd Princeton, and was a professor before joining Google).I&#39;ve tried it in person and it was truly amazing.  They used some very fancy tech when I saw the demo, so I&#39;m thrilled it is finally being announced and possibly shared with a larger audience.Explanation of why it is amazing:  It totally fools your perception. No glasses or goggles--but rather an 8k display with special glass that allows your different eyes to see different pixels (a light field).They also optimize the sound, and the rest, so as all the testimonials point out, you actually feel like the person is in front of you.It also works for the &#34;cube&#34; around them, so if they hold up some object, it also feels like that is in front of you.Amazing..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, I wanted to share my amazing experience with a similar but lo-fi tech.My mom and dad for the past 2-3 years have mostly lived in two separate countries (due to work reasons) and I could tell they miss each other quite a bit.I got both of them an Echo Show 10&#34; device each and set it up for them. I don&#39;t think I can explain how our lives have changed for the better, just based on this simple piece of tech.The Echo Show is now pretty much constantly on video call for 14-16 hours a day in the living room of both houses and it has become an extension of the one another; a window into the other house. The audio and mics are good enough that at times you genuinely forget the other person is not in the same room. This has truly helped them, especially during Covid times.It&#39;s actually good enough that my parents have their morning tea together practically almost the same way they used to when they were physically together. They&#39;ve told me multiple times &#34;I don&#39;t know how we could&#39;ve lived without this Alexa thing&#34;.If Google can eventually get the prices down to reasonable levels, I really think people would be shocked at how fast this thing becomes part of our daily lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool as hell, but I have to say I feel like we&#39;re solving top-level problems when most consumers don&#39;t even seem to be getting solutions to the most basic pain-points.For me, the problem with video-calling isn&#39;t the image-quality.  It&#39;s all the much more mundane technological problems - high latency, lag-spikes caused by bad ISPs, failed noise-cancellation for people who don&#39;t use headsets for audio, bad wifi routers cutting out, etc.First thing I did when I realized we were going to be WFH long-term was buy myself a $100 gaming headset.  Next thing I did was get all my home computer stations wired with Cat 6.That stuff is far more fundamental and far less interesting than 3D telepresence, but it&#39;s the real unsexy problem that so many people are suffering through this pandemic.Even simple things like latency make simple, natural reactions agonizing.  Talkcover and crosstalk is incessent and I&#39;ve developed a filthy habit of just talking over people because otherwise it&#39;s a solid 20 seconds of &#34;you go no you go&#34; caused by awful latency.  I&#39;ve had to defuse angry reactions by co-workers who feel they&#39;re being interrupted by other co-workers and explain to them that the latency makes interruptions feel worse than they are.I&#39;ve tried to push friends to join me on my private Mumble server where the latency is near-nil and the call-quality is excellent, but there&#39;s always one person who doesn&#39;t have a working headset and wants to just use a laptop or tablet mic with no feedback-cancelling that destroys the conversation through echos (plus Mumble&#39;s auth system is needlessly bewildering).Then with video, problems are similar but less impactful - cheap cameras, poor lighting, compression artifacts, poor sync with the audio, etc.  And it&#39;s infuriating because every person has a wonderfully powerful camera in their pocket right now - and there&#39;s software to connect them but it&#39;s just too tricky for most people.Good on Google for taking an interest in the subject, but I feel like they&#39;re decorating the apex of the technological pyramid while most people are pushing stones around at the bottom."</p>

Her synthesizer modules use FR4 PCBs as the front panels as well, a technique that&#39;s pretty popular but executed so well it&#39;s beautiful. [1]  Even her documentation is made with care; when I have more disposable to spend I&#39;m definitely buying a module.[1] - https://twitter.com/micktwomey/status/1383527521744867338/ph..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great point on embedded dependencies - In theory they can be a time saver, but in Rust land, they&#39;re often too.. abstract, and full of missing features and bugs. Easier to open the datasheets, and send a few bytes down the SPI/I2C etc lines. I haven&#39;t been able to use any deps without forking. In Rust, popular abstractions tend to get in the way too, ie if a rust peripheral struct is trying to own a shared bus.Another good point, re HALs. She skipped the official HAL after finding it to be too much trouble. I&#39;ve found that a good peripheral access library generated from SVD files is all you need, and is easier to work with than a HAL that&#39;s not carefully made. Ie an API that provides named register blocks, registers, and fields, and knows how many bits go in each, which you can read from etc. (Is this what the CMSIS lib she mentioned is?)Related to the last point: &#34;I write very small, usually project-specific, abstractions over that&#34; - If you decide a popular or official HAL isn&#39;t helping you, you end up writing your own HAL!&gt; I&#39;ve chosen to avoid using the Node.js ecosystem in favor of just plain JavaScriptAlso a choice I agree with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very inspiring. I&#39;m myself starting a similar journey with my first hardware product (https://getgumball.com) and it&#39;s really reassuring that it is possible to do something like this in &#34;solo&#34; mode. We hear a tone of people doing it in the SaaS work, but not so much in hardware - if anybody here knows other similar examples, I&#39;d love to hear about it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article talks about Core Web Vitals in passing. That&#39;s the major change here. Two posts from May 2020 talk about them more- https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-ess... introduces these metrics, what they mean and how to measure them.- https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating... talks about how the search engine experience will change&gt; The change for non-AMP content to become eligible to appear in the mobile Top Stories feature in Search will also roll out in May 2021. Any page that meets the Google News content policies will be eligible and we will prioritize pages with great page experience, whether implemented using AMP or any other web technology, as we rank the results.&gt; In addition to the timing updates described above, we plan to test a visual indicator that highlights pages in search results that have great page experience.Seems like a positive change. It will mean extra work as developers improve the performance of their sites. But having clear metrics to improve will make that work tractable. Also, advocating for that work to senior management will be easier when it&#39;s so clearly tied to SEO.The upshot is that ordinary users will experience a more performant web. Not overnight but over a few years, like the shift to HTTPS and supporting mobile web versions. Both of those changes were driven in part by the desire for better ranking on Google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes! I can&#39;t wait till its gone altogether. The whole AMP experience from an end user, really sucked.

Fifty percent of the time I would either need to click the original link, or give up on the content."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This won&#39;t really do anything for availability or reducing scalper pricing. Miners are a sizeable proportion of sales but far from the majority. Gamers will be able to buy more of these GPUs but less of the non-LHR or AMD GPU&#39;s. GPU prices won&#39;t actually change.The real reason Nvidia is doing this is that when mining profitability inevitably drops, either because of a crypto price crash or Ethereum moving to Proof of Stake, the miners will flood the used market and ruin Nvidia&#39;s profits for a few quarters. Nvidia is trying to get miners to buy mining-only cards, because those can&#39;t be sold to gamers down the line. They&#39;d rather mining cards become e-waste in a few years than get resold.People think Nvidia is doing this to try to help them get better prices now, but really Nvidia is trying to extract more money from gamers in the long term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does this behavior anger anyone else on a deep level? I get that its hard to buy GPUs right now, but this seems like such an attack on general purpose computing.Hardware manufactures already segment features between consumer and busness grade parts that the silicon itself is capable of, such as virtualization, but restricting what algorithms one can run is a whole new level.I am pretty sure my next GPU is going to be AMD due to this behavior by Nvidia."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When OpenAI trained their Dota model to beat people 1v1 mid SF, they had a contest at The International (the big yearly dota tournament, RIP) like &#34;can you beat OpenAI&#39;s new bot?&#34; and had a big bucket of prizes for anyone that could.By the end of the night, the bucket was empty. People learned to cheese the bot by running &#34;out of bounds&#34;, so to speak -- normally in a 1v1, you&#39;re supposed to stay close to your opponent, since they&#39;ll be getting stronger if you leave. But the bot didn&#39;t know how to deal with it when you snuck behind it (normally an insane maneuver, almost guaranteed to cost you the game in normal play) and prevented his army (called &#34;creeps&#34;) from running to the middle lane. (All you have to do is go wave your hand at them, and they mindlessly chase you.)People did that over and over, and your own army would eventually overwhelm the bot and win. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An astonishing insert:&gt;A good example of human exploitation of the engine&#39;s failings is GM Hikaru Nakamura&#39;s defeat of Rybka in the following three-minute blitz game from the Internet Chess Club. Nakamura cleverly locks the position so that progress is impossible for Rybka, then he offers two exchange sacrifices to the engine. With the position locked, the engine&#39;s rooks have no value, but the engine thinks it has a winning material advantage. With a draw by the 50-move rule approaching, the engine sacrifices a pawn to avoid a draw, but this proves a huge mistake as Nakamura is then able to win the game, an incredible achievement!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When watching the WC games, I&#39;ve seen it happen that a move wasn&#39;t considered as a top move by the engine, but once played the engine realizes it&#39;s actually crushing. Something about the heuristics used to prune the vast search space can make it miss sacrifices or seemingly sub-optimal moves that temporarily weakens the perceived position but has a huge payoff in the end. But humans find them. Of course, given enough time and depth the engine will eventually circle back and try the move. But it has no intuition.Also, an engine without an endgame tablebase can be pretty stupid. There are certain rules one can deduct when there are few pieces left, but a min/max engine will search forever, not knowing the patterns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked with a number of brilliant people at Bell Labs through the 1980s/1990s. The most comfortably competent among them, the most productive among them, were also the least abrasive. They were also the most self deprecating.Not just one or two, but the majority of them. To the point that the aggressive geniuses stood out. And I worked for/with two abrasive ones as well, so I know the difference.The same was true for the two startups I worked at after that, and Qualcomm, and now the third startup where I work.The really productive geniuses in each situation were easy to work with, I think largely, because of their confidence in their own grasp of the subject at hand. They had nothing to prove, they knew that, and it showed. The difficult people were never stupid, far from it, but they felt like they needed to defend everything they did, every decision they made, and that made working with them less productive.With the gentle geniuses, if you thought you came up with something that was an improvement on what was being done, they would look at it honestly, and if it was not better, they would calmly explain why, and if it was better, they would acknowledge it right out and discuss how to merge that into the current work.The &#39;less gentle&#39; ones would take pride in pointing out the flaws in your idea if you were wrong, and if you were right, would fight you over whether it had any real value at all, then would stiff arm you as far as getting it accepted as a change."</p>

Sure. But the folks who truly stand out in my mind are a level higher. They&#39;re the ones at the top of their game, who know how to demand &amp; command excellence, without being jerks about it.I&#39;m reminded of this episode of &#34;The Chef Show&#34; where Jon Favreau compliments Roy Choi behind his back. He tells Bill Burr that he had followed Roy around for a full day, going to all his restaurants and food trucks, and not once did Roy raise his voice to his staff. It&#39;s pretty cool to see how much admiration one artist/leader has for the other, not because of their technical skills but because they choose to be kind.I don&#39;t think we need to settle for being &#34;fierce nerds&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since pg&#39;s essay is of a psychoanalytic nature, I&#39;ll reply in a psychoanalytic frame, for the sake of conversation, not criticism. [Protip: never psychoanalyze anyone! This likely applies even to psychoanalysts.]During the last year or two pg has written more than a few essays and tweets which appear to be of a defensive nature. People like him contribute more than other people, it&#39;s alright to to be fierce, can&#39;t speak the &#34;truth,&#34; etc.Whenever there is dichotomous thinking, cognition has moved away from clarity. If it were me, I&#39;d be asking myself, What is being defended? (This kind of question can be a multi-decade inquiry.)Although most of us are easily baited into self-justification or self-promotion, I think going down that path it is ultimately a distraction from doing real work and knowing who you are."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This provides more technical details: &lt;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/05/introducing-firefox-new-si...&gt;, which should be more interesting to HN than a marketing announcement.In particular, it seems that &#34;site&#34; isn&#39;t precisely defined. It seems to be based on domains, but backed by a human-curated list of &#34;sites&#34;: &lt;https://github.com/publicsuffix/list&gt;.So it&#39;s different than Chrome&#39;s &#34;every webpage gets a separate process&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really interesting. Prior to this, Firefox&#39;s isolation model was much weaker than Chrome&#39;s due to only having a pool of 8 content processes. If I&#39;m reading the technical blog correctly [1], this will move to a process-per-site model without also doing process-per-tab as Chrome does, i.e. if you have several tabs open on the same site, they&#39;d be in the same process. This seems much less resource intensive than Chrome&#39;s model while still delivering similar security properties.[1] https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/05/introducing-firefox-new-si..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When Chrome was new and shiny, I used it for a time. Then, the first time I found myself needing to kill Chrome because it was completely locked up, I found myself staring at a wall of chrome processes in the task list, not knowing which one I needed to kill. At the time, I thought the idea of a separate process for each tab was silly. Though, with Firefox moving towards this model, I guess the engineers at Google were prescient in the correctness of that tradeoff.I do use a lot of tabs, so I fear I&#39;m going to find myself facing the same problem I faced with Chrome: a site misbehaves and locks things up, crap, which process do I kill? A way of tracking which tab maps to which process would be nice, so the next time I trip over a badly-coded page, I don&#39;t have to kill everything just to get my browser to respond again. Lazyweb question to y&#39;all: is there a feature in Chrome or Firefox that can do this (mapping tab/page -&gt; process), or have I just stumbled upon a side-project idea?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not really related to the article at hand, but I&#39;ve been on a bit of a Google Maps binge the past couple weeks. I learned a few interesting facts, blurry Israel being one of them.Another strange thing I found that might not be super well known (I didn&#39;t know about it) is that all GPS data in China is offset by a nonlinear psuedo-random amount. If you turn on the satellite view in Google Maps and look at various cities in China, you&#39;ll see that the road and business overlay is off by anywhere from 50m to 500m. And the strangest thing is that it&#39;s not a consistent offset from place to place.Turns out this is very intentional, and China uses a different geographic coordinate system than the rest of the world. WGS-84 is the most common coordinate system, but China uses GCJ-02, sometimes called Mars Coordinates. Part of GCJ-02 is an algorithm that obfuscates the results. So applying any GCJ-02 coordinate to a globe using WGS-84 coordinates gets distorted like a funhouse mirror.It&#39;s easy to find open source libraries to convert WGS-84 to GCJ-02 and vice versa. But Google Maps doesn&#39;t do it, for political reasons I suppose? I&#39;ve read that if you open Google Maps within China the mapping data is correct, but have no way to test that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangentially related but where does this come from and why is it so widely repeated (as in this article):&gt; ...Gaza, one of the most densely populated places in the worldI&#39;ve seen this claim (both in the &#34;one of the most...&#34; and &#34;the #1 most...&#34; forms) many times and I don&#39;t know where it comes from. What am I missing?Here[0] wikipedia says Gaza Strip has ~5,046/sqkm. I thought maybe Gaza City was meant, it&#39;s density is 13,000/sqkm[1]. Neither of these come close to ranking on wikipedias list of cities by population density[2], and I haven&#39;t been able to find any &#34;most populated places&#34; lists that list anything below 15,000 people per square kilometer, which Gaza city is well below.Is the BBC just plain wrong here or am I missing something? I hope it&#39;s me because if it&#39;s the former, that says something really bad about their fact checking and would suggest that BBC is not a reliable/trustworthy source, at least on this topic.    0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This link title is extremely misleading to the point of being disingenuous and provocative. The title of the linked article is “Israel-Gaza: Why is the region blurry on Google Maps?”... because the entire Israel / Gaza / West Bank region is blurred in the exact same way. There is no preferential blurring of Palestinian areas. The clear answer is to prevent actors on both sides from using Google’s satellite imagery to plan attacks against one another. But please continue the breathless hot takes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the article:&gt; J Balvin said: [...] With Lossless, everything in the music is going to sound bigger and stronger but more importantly, it will be better quality. [...]There have been tests showing we cannot hear the difference between minimally lossy audio (e.g. mp3 320kbps) and lossless. But Balvin can. And it sounds &#34;bigger and stronger&#34;.The extra quality of lossless is nice when mixing/remixing the sound, as the inaudible loss of quality with minimally lossy audio (e.g. mp3 320kbps) is audible when the sound is sped up or slowed down.But, and this the article does not mention, is not what Apple Music wants you to do. The formats will be proprietary with DRM.I prefer FLAC/OggVorbis/etc when it comes to music. But then I like to be able to mix/remix."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple can add feature after feature, but if Music continues to split albums without warning, it&#39;s close to useless. I can&#39;t curate a music library when I can&#39;t rely on my music not being jumbled around. Dropping music for licensing issues is one thing, but messing with metadata is beyond frustrating.For arbitrary reasons, Apple Music will: remove songs from albums and re-add them to your library as the &#34;single&#34; or &#34;deluxe&#34; versions; split albums and intersperse tracks between both; and duplicate songs in albums.The albums usually still exist in Apple Music—I just have to go out of my way to remove the mangled music and re-add the album. Problem is, there is no warning or notification it happened.Examples:[1] https://pasteboard.co/K2kdUN3.png
This album is totally messed up. Multiple track 3 with different titles, one unavailable, missing tracks that were re-added to my library as singles.[2] https://pasteboard.co/K2keFBV.png
One song pulled out into a greatest hits compilation and duplicated[3] https://pasteboard.co/K2kfc0b.png
All tracks, except 1, removed. The album still exists in Apple Music.[4] https://pasteboard.co/K2kfBTR.png
Originally added the original version of Camp by Childish Gambino to my library—here it&#39;s split between deluxe and basic, with tracks arbitrarily mixed between both.[...and many more]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is included/no additional cost which is fantastic.I do wonder if in the longer term if Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio with &#34;dynamic head tracking&#34; isn&#39;t the next 3D TVs/3D Content i.e. a gimmick.Taking traditional multi-source audio (Dolby/Atmos/etc) and jamming it into stereo is old tech, it doesn&#39;t work particularly well but is cheap to make/consume, thus mostly harmless. The new Spatial Audio is using gyroscopes to measure head movements in order to adjust the audio accordingly, and new audio formats to make it work.This may sound interesting if you haven&#39;t tried it, but it results in: Either you keep your head stationary and get the non-Spatial Audio sound (i.e. what they optimized for 90%+ of their audience) or whipping your head around to &#34;enjoy&#34; the effect (which is largely a movement accurate degradation).It feels like cart-before-the-horse tech wherein they figured out they can do this thing, and now want to work backwards into what it may be useful for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the 90s I used to make money off shareware, and every time I release a new version hackers would release &#34;cracks&#34; for the license key. Eventually I figured out that these cracks are coming from Russia.In the next version of my program, I added a check for system language, and if I detect Russian then I bypass the license key checks, and the program is free to use.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of one weird trick I use to avoid getting foreign language websites served to me while traveling. I remove en-US in my OS and broswers, and replace it with en-CA, as well as the other languages I speak. A lot of websites and software will see en-US and assume it&#39;s &#34;just a default&#34; and then try to serve content in a language determined by your IP or geographical region. But en-CA appears to be an explicit preference, so websites will serve English content instead of defaulting to geographic language detection."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While establishing  a &#34;cause &amp; effect&#34; here seems very hard, from my personal experience working in software field in Japan, I think the winning concept here is actually the combination of removing middleman and paying good salaries.Japan is very very behind in IT/digitalization compared to most western countries. This doesn&#39;t just mean it&#39;s behind in product portfolio and quality, but that perception of software engineer &amp; managers and still quite behind. The respect that a lot of software engineers enjoys in US/EU is not quite there yet in Japan(and salary often reflect this).The C-suite usually doesn&#39;t have a firm understanding of software/IT world, and instead ends-up hiring a lot of &#34;Scrum-experts/Agile coaches&#34; and hires software engineers from consultancy or recruitment companies for cheap.  There&#39;s ofc companies that doesn&#39;t fall in this category, but for middle-sized companies in Japan (which is the bulk of the economy), this is the true state of things. Middle-men in Japan have therefore been way more encroaching on this, and they have the incentive to not improve the respect/social standing the software engineers have.&#34;Removing managers&#34; in this article does not mean the same thing as it would in US/EU, conditions are different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Tange, 46, says his business model is an attempt to remove inefficiencies in Japan’s software industry, where layers of subcontractors take cuts on orders before passing the work to another company below.This reminds me of a role I once had back in the late nighties.I was hired on contract by a multi-national consultancy firm to help out on one of their projects. The need someone to come in with good C programming skills.When I started I was amazed to find a 70 developers and testers workforce working on the project, most of whom were straight out of university.A nice earner for the consultancy firm; they were charging their development team out at $150.00 per hour, yet only paying graduate salaries.It must have been $100+ profit per hour per developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with some of the other comments here, that while this is a very impressive hack (and this is Hacker News!) the real world value seems dubious.It looks like a very clever way of packaging an x86 fat binary for multiple platforms, without actually duplicating the code. To support ARM I assume it’ll need to be an actual fat binary, with both x86 and ARM code. At that point, unless I actually test the code myself on both architectures, how can I be confident it’s going to work properly?If you’re using very simple C constructs and not doing anything fancy, it should work, but it’s not clear to me that this approach is preferable to e.g. a Python script. If you’re doing fancy stuff, it’s a bit more chancy as C isn’t memory-safe and has tons of undefined behavior and platform-specified weirdness.Java is “run anywhere” because they’ve specified the JVM in massive detail and tried to ensure it actually works the same on all platforms. I don’t see how you can have that same confidence if you’re running machine code everywhere.I guess I just don’t see the use case where this is compelling. If I write a handy Unix utility in C, I’ll just keep the source code around, and compile it as needed.It might be handy if you need to move such a utility quickly from Unix to Windows, if you don’t have any dev tools set up. But I can’t think of a situation when I’ve needed that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a bit worried about this:&gt; Please note that your APE binary will assimilate itself as a conventional resident of your platform after the first run, so it can be fast and efficient for subsequent executions.I understand there may be no real way out, but this defeats part of the promise/purpose of PAE: assume I use a pae binary, know it&#39;s pae, and implicitly share it or copy it to a different machine. But once I have copied it from ~/bin/ it&#39;s not pae any more, it&#39;s optimized for my OS/arch!Assuming the first-run optimization step is necessary, would it make sense to provide `--deoptimize` or `--paeize` flag to the same binary, so it&#39;s easy to return to the original, without recompiling it from source? Does it lose information when it optimizes? Can that information be tucked away (with an optional flag or env variable) for this step?What happens if the binary is read-only?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super exciting to see Cosmopolitan progress further! For those wondering what it is, from the website[0]:&gt; Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to Java, except it doesn&#39;t require interpreters or virtual machines be installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn&#39;t invent a new language and you won&#39;t need to configure a CI system to build separate binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much broader audience.[0] https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, they don&#39;t just &#34;feel&#34; faster. They also complete lots of real-world tasks in shorter times, often significantly shorter than the last Intel Macbook Pro."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like the consensus here is that the M1 feels faster, and is actually faster, for a lot of tasks. So, for a lot of engineers, the M1 is the better choice over Intels. (Faster compile times are a good thing for devs, among other things)In that regard, the moment feels similar to the mid 2000s, when you suddenly saw a huge uptick in Macbooks at technical conferences: software developers seemed to gravitate in droves to the Mac platform (over windows or linux). Over the last 5+ years, that&#39;s cooled a bit. But I wonder if the M1 will solidify or grow Apple&#39;s (perceived) dominance among developers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What i find weird is the extreme and very unscientific agression among certain virologist:
&#34;If you think SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in a lab, please unfollow me.  &#34;
https://twitter.com/macroliter/status/1390720308265508871Then you have other academics in the comments saying nothing is certain yet, and other prominents labs like Gupta Labs at Cambridge and Bloom Lab from Seattle saying there could be multiple explanations.I know the issue is politicised and that&#39;s wrong as Ecohealth alliance from the US sponsored this research so there is no &#34;single country at fault&#34; - no need to avoid topics.It&#39;s not &#34;chinas fault&#34; it&#39;s more like, what on earth was the US based Ecohealth alliance doing with this research, why so many previous lab leaks with little attention, what is the history if the Wuhan lab, whats the actual facts about Gain of Function research etc. All topics that the press is not looking into for some reason.On Ecohealth alliance:“ It later turned out that the Lancet letter had been organized and drafted by Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance of New York. Daszak’s organization funded coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If the SARS2 virus had indeed escaped from research he funded, Daszak would be potentially culpable. This acute conflict of interest was not declared to the Lancet’s readers. To the contrary, the letter concluded, “We declare no competing interests.””https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27071432"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not surprising at all considering Wuhan Lab scientists admitted on video they were bitten by bats and they had lax to no safety standards. https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4102619&gt; A video released two years before the start of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic shows Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) scientists being cavalier toward protective equipment and being bitten by bats that carry deadly viruses such as SARS, demonstrating a lax safety culture in the lab.&gt; On Dec. 29, 2017, Chinese state-run TV released a video designed to showcase Shi Zhengli, (石正麗), also known as &#34;Bat Woman,&#34; and her team of scientists at the WIV in their quest to find the origin of SARS. Despite the fact that the scientists work in a biosafety level 4 lab, they show a shocking disregard for safety when handling potentially infectious bats both in the wild and in the lab.&gt; From 4:45 to 4:56, a scientist can be seen holding a bat with his bare hands. Team members from 7:44 to 7:50 can be seen collecting potentially highly infectious bat feces while wearing short sleeves and shorts and with no noticeable personal protective equipment (PPE) other than gloves.&gt; Virus researcher Cui Jie (崔杰) relates his experiences of being bitten from 8:47 to 8:50. He said that the bat&#39;s fangs went right through his glove, which was likely nitrile. He described the feeling as &#34;like being jabbed with a needle.&#34; The video then cuts to a person&#39;s limb showing swelling after a bat bite.That provides a plausible origin scenario of the pandemic: In October 2019, a researcher at the Wuhan Lab was bitten by a bat, got infected (asymptomatically), went home and unknowingly infected other people in the community, and the virus spread from there.Sadly, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever know what happened. Those who were directly involved with the early stage of the outbreak will never speak up, because Beijing issued a complete gag order on what happened. Anyone that speaks about the early stages of the pandemic be charged with espionage, and if found guilty, they can receive the death penalty. https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/11/9833532bb925-chin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The trouble here is that a lot of institutions and public persons have more or less staked their credibility on dismissing the lab origin hypothesis. They had their reasons - if anything, over the last years their standing and the value of expert opinion was under constant pressure (notice I&#39;m talking about a reason, not a justification).But this makes any admission of an error and, by extension, any useful reflection on it very, very improbable. I think if the lab origin is true and at some point becomes common knowledge, it will be treated like the Iraq war. The people responsible for botching the response and the message will fail up and treat the pandemic as if it were a tsunami, rather then human error."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually like using systemd. I took the time to learn how to use it, and as a desktop Linux user, it&#39;s honestly quite nice.But the one thing that still really pisses me off about systemd-the-project was the fact that they ate udev-the-project. In my view, that decision was unnecessary and was done for purely anti-competitive reasons.If you&#39;re not familiar, udev is basically the user-facing device manager for Linux. It&#39;s what allows you to easily configure rules and permissions for all the USB devices that you plug into your computer. These devices still need kernel drivers, but udev is how you tell your system &#34;Please let user ohazi use this device, and also give it a convenient name like /dev/someDevice0&#34;By devouring the udev project, the systemd maintainers have guaranteed that dealing with USB devices on non-systemd systems was going to be a giant pain.Then came the forks -- Gentoo maintains eudev, which is a systemd-free fork of udev. But really, this shouldn&#39;t be a fork. Udev should be independent and available on all systems. If systemd wants to do something special with devices, they should use udev APIs like everybody else. In my view, this is what finally allowed systemd to win the init war, despite all the protest. Ideological arguments about how best to start daemons is one thing, but you simply can&#39;t use a modern system without a sane approach to USB.Edit: It seems that some of my concerns were overblown, e.g. you apparently can run udev without systemd as pid 1. Udev has a build-time dependency on systemd, but not a run-time dependency. The eudev fork removes that build-time dependency, and (maybe?) also papers over some other inconsistencies. I&#39;m pleased that this is the case. I&#39;m annoyed that the discourse around systemd/udev has been muddy enough to lead me to incorrect conclusions (and I&#39;m aware that the original version of this comment likely added fuel to this particular fire). Oh well... live and learn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a system where systemd decides, about half the times I boot it, to immediately unmount all of the filesystems listed in fstab literally right after having finished mounted them as part of the regular boot process. All of this with other daemons starting in parallel.It will fail to unmount most of the filesystems, since they are of course busy, but often it will succeed in unmounting /var, /tmp, /home and others. Then it will continue starting on further services as if nothing happened and even proceed to gdm. But of course without /home I can&#39;t even login.No idea how to even start debugging it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t agree with her sentiment that alpine should adopt something similar. The whole reason I use alpine is because it doesn&#39;t use systemd.I like alpine because it uses a simpler, lighter approach. It&#39;s not for everyone, and I&#39;m pretty sure alpine maintainers don&#39;t intend it to be for everyone. It serves its niche really well as it is. For those who like systemd there&#39;s many distro choices already.Edit: As detaro mentioned in another comment ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27176391 ) they are actually working on something, but they aim to solve the various issues around alpine that don&#39;t fit well with alpine&#39;s philosophy. It sounds like a good story and I&#39;m open to this idea. The main reasons I don&#39;t like systemd are its complexity and its dbus reliance, basically bringing too many desktop paradigms into all Linux systems, even servers and containers.So about my above point: I&#39;m open to it adopting a service manager but not too similar to systemd :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a Bitcoin miner (https://toom.im), while I appreciate the work put into it, this particular metric of &#34;transactions per kW&#34; might not work the way you expect.The main point that you should understand is that a PoW blockchain&#39;s energy usage is not proportional to its transactions.I&#39;ll say that a different way: the transactions themselves do not use any energy in mining.I&#39;ll say this in a third way: it takes exactly the same amount of energy to mine an empty block as it does a 1GB block of transactions, as it does a 1,000,000,000 PB block.In reality, transactions are all hashed together in a mining pool into a single numeric hash before miners ever see them.  It doesn&#39;t matter how many transactions are included in the hash.  The hashpower just has to find a magic number matching that hash.On the other hand, the #1 factor that increases a blockchain&#39;s energy usage is its price per coin.  The price of a coin is how much that coin is worth to be mined, which is the incentive for miners to dump energy into mining it.  In steady state, miners will dump energy into mining a coin until the cost of energy = the value of the coins coming out.This is why you can see Bitcoin SV at the top of the list -- it&#39;s worth the least of the Bitcoins.And it&#39;s also misleading to compute the second factor -- transactions per second -- by counting the actual transactions on the blockchain, rather than looking at the transaction capacity.  Because blockchains only cost something per transaction once they reach capacity.  This is misleading with Bitcoin SV, for instance, because that coin artificially creates bogus transactions on its blockchain in order to make it look popular and demonstrate the vision of large blockchains.  Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, can handle a thousands of transactions per second (on testnet) but doesn&#39;t clog its live blockchain with them.So, in sum, if you send a transaction on Bitcoin Cash, it will cost 0 kW of electricity, even though it says 31.3 Txs/MWh (which equates to 31.9kW/Tx) in this chart.  This is because transactions do not cost anything in electricity.  Electricity only goes to preventing double-spends.  A better metric would be &#34;energy use per double-spend that was prevented.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t this basically 1 / popularity? I&#39;m presuming other coins have the Bitcoin feature of getting harder as more powerful miners appear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting but I’m not sure of the point. PoW by design is not energy efficient. The incentive is just not in the correct place. Interesting but if the goal is to show more energy efficient coins we need to be looking at different tech such as PoS. Although this might have just been a fun project someone put together in which case nice job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is something any US citizen should be concerned about, if not outraged. There is no 4th amendment if a cop can just have a dog with him, or say &#34;I smelled weed&#34;, etc. The cops even joke about it, referring to the dogs as “probable cause on four legs”. The root problem is credulous or complicit judges who let this evidence be introduced. We need them to throw out these cases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had an experience with the system. Literally every person we encountered as a part of that system make mistakes, were incompetent, or committed misconduct. I&#39;m talking about 3 magistrates (who aren&#39;t even required to be lawyers!), court clerks, a trooper, the SGT that approved the citation, the ADA, the second ADA, the DA clerk, a judge, court reporter, president judge, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting others.It&#39;s an absolute shit show that only cares about money. I was even told by a civil rights lawyer that we had a case, but that the judges don&#39;t care unless we sustained substantial monetary loss (more than the $2k plus of handling the case pro se)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Professionally, I do embedded and robotics, but once a year I find an excuse to create a simple web application (to stay updated). Every time, I get impressed by power and simplicity of the web technologies in general. In JavaScript those are things mentioned in the article + WebComponents. For CSS those are flexboxes, grids, and animations. In my opinion, React made a revolution with hooks and contexts. I love the direction in which the web world has been going!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"JavaScript is a great browser scripting language because it&#39;s the only browser scripting language.  That&#39;s a whole realm of good times, and people can and should go nuts with it there.The problem started a decade or so ago with Node.  Too many people only learn JavaScript, become psychologically dependent on it, and they all collectively took it too far outside of a browser.ECMAScript is a general purpose standard, but it was invented retroactively.  Node is not ECMAScript in a server-side ECMAScript engine, it&#39;s JavaScript in a browser JavaScript engine.  That&#39;s just too much of a force fit, and has wasted too much potential for me to say anything positive about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At this one industrial customer I visit every week for a full day, my Verizon cell phone date/time time will suddenly change back by 19 years, six months, and some days (I don&#39;t have the exact value).  This has been going on for almost a year. My pet theory was that law enforcement turned on a stingray nearby back in 2020, it came up with a default date of 1/1/2001, and has been running ever since.  Steel building with warehouse plus office space. No one in the building is running one of those cell phone boosters that plug into customer internet and act as a mini tower. My newish pixel 4 and my previous Moto phone both demonstrate the problem.  I don&#39;t have the fortitude to call Verizon and work through support to get to someone who would understand the problem.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Any other theories on what it is?  (My workaround is to turn off updating date and time from the network)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, this same mechanism can be used as a fallback for GPS to determine device location.I have worked on an IoT device with builtin SIM in the personal alarm space. Often when a device is indoors no GPS fix can be found, but the GSM module can report all celltower ids in range with signal strengths. These can be used to triangulate the device location. Google has an API for this where you can pass celtower ids and signal strengths.edit: and of course similar triangulation fallbacks/methods can be applied to WiFi AP&#39;s or Bluetooth Beacons, if you have a database with APs or beacons and their location. This database can be externally sourced but also built automatically by sending celltower ids/aps/beacons along with GPS fixes. I assume this is one of the many things Google is doing with their fleet of Streetview cars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First, this is an interesting take, and I think there is some kernels to consider in it. However, the author is painting very broadly with a large brush and smudging a lot. I have been happily using PyCharm/IntelliJ since what feels like the dawn of time. It is a perfectly complex and rewarding Fancy Tool. People still use IDEs for C/C++ this whole time, etc. I think the author is taking their personal journey and experience and extrapolating a bit too much about trends in the industry. I found myself nodding along at times and then saying &#34;What?&#34; the next sentence.My thoughts:* JIRA, still heavily used in many, many places. Not even close to being replaced in them.* Evernote vs. Markdown: I have been using org mode and or plain text notes for over 20 years. Markdown was a welcome addition to the arsenal, but I tried the Evernote/Microsoft Notes back in the day... just went back to plaintext for notes+todo, it has worked forever and is good enough. Org mode is a very nice and &#34;Fancy&#34; tool on its own. But also easy to get started with.Just some examples. I don&#39;t mean to be overly critical, it is an interesting and fun article about the tools we use as technologists, but it could do with a lot better grounding all around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Nikkei has a detailed article [0] on the steps that China is taking to compete with TSMC and other western chip factories. I think a lot of commenters would be meaningful if they took time to read the other side of the problem and not just run into nationalist and inflammatory war.[0] https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/US-China-tec..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Geopolitically this makes a lot of sense. Will be interesting to see how China reacts as it moves forward.If Intel is serious this time about letting third parties into their fabs then it could be quite the reversal of fortune. However, as I&#39;ve said in the past Intel is most likely to do this with &#34;alternate&#34; process streams, in order to not expose their full capabilities to competitors.High hopes but low expectations. Real estate in AZ could be a good investment though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So they had talks with the EU and disagreed so the news is they are not building a factory in Europe.   I do wonder if the talks had gone amicably, would the story say EU then.I do appreciate for many the terms EU and Europe are interpolatable but in reality they are not.Do also keep in mind that such actions/statements by companies can often be a case of political bargaining and TSMC in effect telling the EU - look we don&#39;t want to be messed about, if your serious then now is the time to decide and if not, we will not delay things any further in your endless talking.Another article upon this matter: https://www.itpro.co.uk/hardware/components/359547/tsmc-eu-c..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the big number 1 that trumps all others when building a person website is: focus on writing content.This is by far the hardest part. All the other stuff: it&#39;s just tangential. Wordpress, Blogger, Jekyll, Hugo, Medium, hand-written HTML files: IMHO it doesn&#39;t really matter if you don&#39;t have any content. Just use whatever is easiest to get started with and gets out of your way when writing. For me, personally, it would be writing Markdown in Vim and converting that. For other people, it&#39;s something else.Later, when you actually have some content going you can start focusing on tooling, layout, and so forth. Converting things to another platform usually isn&#39;t too hard. But chances are, you will never actually get any content going. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people create personal websites, write one or two things on it, and then basically don&#39;t do anything with it.I&#39;ve built some websites for various friends/non-profits over the years, and about 90% of the time they never actually wrote any content. These days I ask people to write content first, and then I&#39;ll build the website for them. Most of the time I never hear about it again. That&#39;s okay, it&#39;s really hard to write content and a lot of people (myself included, before I had more experience with this sort of thing) tend to be way too optimistic about it and underestimate just how hard this can be.And people will read your website regardless if your content is good. Is Paul Graham&#39;s website the peak of web design? Not really. People still read it. Dan Luu&#39;s website? Pretty much the most basic HTML file you can get. Still widely read.That being said, if your goal is also to learn more if you&#39;re young or inexperienced: then sure, muck around with these tools all you want. I learned a lot from building my personal website over the years in all sorts of tools (geocities, hand-written HTML, shell scripts, PHP, Python, PHP again but this time with MongoDB, back to shell script, and finally settled Jekyll) and for much of this time I didn&#39;t have a lot of content. That was okay, because I learned a lot from the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a good example of how each person’s experience guides their sense of simplicity.This person felt like Wordpress was too complicated, despite it being a system you can use to set up a site with literally no coding at all (using Wordpress.com or one of the many hosting providers with one-click installs). You can live-swap themes to see which one you like, again with just some clicking.Meanwhile he is hand-editing .htaccess files to get the URL structure he wants and switching from JPG to WebP (a change with no real-world SEO value) to try to help SEO.This is not to condemn or criticize! It’s just that when people have experience with having their hands directly on software development, they may be more likely to prefer a web stack that mimics that feel. “Easier” for a coder is going to be different from “easier” for an artist with no coding experience. Look how many artists use Squarespace or Wix for example, which did not even make the list for this effort apparently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re building a personal website from scratch in 2021 (especially a blog), I strongly recommend Hugo (https://gohugo.io) over Jekyll. I had used Jekyll for a decade and very often hit random quirks that have been completely eliminated with modern Hugo. However, there&#39;s a bit of a migration process if you are moving from Jekyll to Hugo despite both being Markdown-based blogs.If you want a more advanced framework for a personal website, I recommend Wowchemy (https://wowchemy.com/) on top of Hugo, which gives the tools needed out-of-the-box like lazy loading/SEO/object-oriented collections, albeit with a massive learning curve."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember this article from a year ago. It&#39;s a beautiful piece of prose that really stuck with me, thanks for sharing this again.The first year of my PhD program is ending, and I feel like I&#39;ve been adrift the whole time: floating by without much direction, not doing much more than the bare minimum. I&#39;ve been needing to reevaluate my priorities and find what I should really be doing. I&#39;ve already decided I won&#39;t end up in academia, I couldn&#39;t win the endless pile of tasks. Not sure what I need to learn from this article but learning to make the most of the rest of your life is high on my list :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this piece is really about identity, and what happens when you establish and associate so deeply with an identity that when something challenges it (e.g. the passing of a job opportunity) it turns your world upside down. The author claims to have found peace in motherhood and that the job she was seeking wasn’t even that great, and perhaps the interviewers single minded, and maybe the entire process a little absurd.What I find interesting about this is that looking through the lens of ones ego, this seems like the logical way you would cope with losing a job - just convincing yourself it wasn’t ever really what you wanted"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People keep saying this is beautify written and stuff, but I feel like I just read a research paper in a topic I don&#39;t know about. Am I just dumb, what am I missing here? I feel genuinely confused about what I just read."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Eh, I can’t be bothered to care. Cellebrite hoards 0-days so they can use them to hack phones. They know about exploitable vulnerabilities but aren’t saying anything about them because they profit from insecurity. Thing is, just because Cellebrite knows about a thing doesn’t mean, say, China’s CCP or the Russian mafia or anyone else doesn’t also know about that thing. You and I are less safe just because Cellebrite wants to profit off of those vulnerabilities.I just can’t work up the ability to sympathize with Cellebrite. The law may have something to say about Moxie’s writing, but in my opinion he has the clear ethical upper ground in this argument."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I disagree with this. Signal isn&#39;t hacking Cellebrite by creating a malformed file that causes Cellebrite&#39;s software to implode.I would be interested in seeing this go in front of a court because Signal isn&#39;t directly targeting any specific person, and the files are fine until they are processed through a specific broken pipeline.If I put a fake USB port on my phone that was a USB zapper to kill the device it&#39;s connected to, it would not be illegal and it would be on the people seizing my phone to take responsibility for it. You cannot repackage vulnerabilities for police and then turn around and play coy because you&#39;re not able to keep your software up to date.In the defense attorney section, the argument shouldn&#39;t be about the PoC but the fact that the PoC shows that Cellebrite&#39;s software is outdated and could be compromised. You can specifically ask for the backup that was extracted from the mobile device to be analyzed by third party software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wouldn&#39;t find a website where professional lawyers opine on startups and programming especially compelling.I don&#39;t find HN threads where tech folk opine on what their opinion of how the law should be interpreted to be especially compelling either.This is especially true here where I note that the author of the post folks are commenting on has an incredibly notable credentials and frankly it&#39;s somewhat ridiculous for lay-folk to be arguing with someone with such bone fides:Riana [Pfefferkorn] was the Associate Director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Prior to joining Stanford, Riana was an associate in the Internet Strategy &amp; Litigation group at the law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, where she worked on litigation and counseling matters involving online privacy, Internet intermediary liability, consumer protection, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets and was actively involved in the firm&#39;s pro bono program. Before that, Riana clerked for the Honorable Bruce J. McGiverin of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. She also interned during law school for the Honorable Stephen Reinhardt of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Riana earned her law degree from the University of Washington School of Law and her undergraduate degree from Whitman College.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was a mistake to attack the business side of the oil company, because it created what could be sold as reasonable doubt to shut down the pipeline.As a result, the ransom had the optics of an attack on infrastructure. As evidenced by the coverage of Americans desperately filling up containers.This created the impetus for the US to treat this as an incident far and above the ambient ransomware activities leading up to this.It also gave the US an opportunity to show how effective it could be when it had the political cover to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The REvil representative said its program was introducing new restrictions on the kinds of organizations that affiliates could hold for ransom, and that henceforth it would be forbidden to attack those in the “social sector” (defined as healthcare and educational institutions) and organizations in the “gov-sector” (state) of any country. Affiliates also will be required to get approval before infecting victims.Statements like this seem to point to ransomware activities being far more coordinated and &#34;business-like&#34; than they often get credit for.I do wonder if ransomware is (in a strange way) a(n illegal) free-market response to what is perceived to be an under-valuation of tech skills - aggrieved people who can carry out attacks and gain access to deploy ransomware are likely to be able to earn more through this route, even factoring in their &#34;risk of being caught&#34;.If a market correction occurs (ransomware becomes a real fear, organisations rapidly start to value security skills more and pay &#34;megabucks&#34; for the skills and hire them at-scale), the risk/reward of being caught starts to mean access brokers reduce in number, and the compensation reaches a free market equilibrium (accounting for the &#34;getting caught&#34; risk of criminal activity).A lot of the time I still see people trying to hire entry-level people into live/ operational security roles, without the experience they&#39;d need. I wonder if this is partly due to a desire to cut costs, rather than accept the need to pay rock-star compensation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “There’s too much publicity,” the XSS administrator explained. “Ransomware has gathered a critical mass of nonsense, bullshit, hype, and fuss around it. The word ‘ransomware’ has been put on a par with a number of unpleasant phenomena, such as geopolitical tensions, extortion, and government-backed hacks. This word has become dangerous and toxic.”I am... flabbergasted.  What?  Ransomware has always been a brand of extortion; it&#39;s right there in the name.  Extortion has become dangerous and toxic?  You have got to be kidding me.  I wonder what&#39;s next for these folks.  A life of simple, honest, pleasant and non-toxic crime?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations!I always have great respect for Scala because itself and the community tried to adopt and push the novel idea in the industry. Take a look at the changes, they&#39;re no joke to design and implement. At the same time, they&#39;re also trying to make the language consistent and simple. (Yes, I mean simple, not easy or single-paradigmed)They are taking the hard way, and not only there are not enough people to appreciate the effort, but also attract some hatred from time to time. I hope Scala 3 would bring us and itself a bright future, and inspire more languages to move forward.(For example, there are a lot of type features added to TypeScript in most releases because it needs to do the typing on existing dynamically typed languages, it may also be a hint that dependent type actually makes sense in mainstream languages)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so psyched about this. I&#39;ve followed the development of Scala 3 for pretty much the whole voyage, and I think they&#39;ve done an incredible job bringing the community along through some pretty radical changes to the language. It has definitely not been an easy process herding a community with very big, informed, divergent opinions on the language.In the end, I think they did an awesome job. Many, many sacred cows of old Scala were confronted. I think the result is a much more approachable language, where simple things are easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing!!! Great to see Scala improving at such a fast pace!I&#39;m especially excited about union/intersection types. I think we could all witness how well they work out in typescript and I believe that every language with the concept of subtyping should have this feature. It is one of the things that make working in a statically typed language feel much more dynamic/lightweight without giving up on safety guarantees."</p>

They are siloed and unless you are deliberately searching in a specific workspace, you&#39;ll never run into the information in a search engine.In comparison, Zulip:- provides HTML export functionality https://github.com/zulip/zulip-archive#zulip-html-archive (example https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive )- URLs are nice and encode meaning (e.g. https://memex.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/279601-hpi/topic/...)
  ... compare with Slack/Discord meaningless character sequences- I&#39;m excited about https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/4817 , which would allow viewing workspaces in &#39;guest&#39; mode, without registering at all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was skeptical about Zulip when I first tried it. What is it supposed to be? A chat? A forum? Why is the UI so ugly?But after using it a while I now really dislike Slack et al, both in professional teams and for open source communities.Zulip can give you the best of both worlds. It&#39;s a regular chat. But the threading model also encourages long-form, more forum or email like discussions.Threads are easily discoverable and it&#39;s trivial to catch up on all the relevant discussions that you missed, while skipping everything that doesn&#39;t concern you.You can still have some regular chat channels for typical ephemeral discussion that no-one is expected to read. It&#39;s really a great tool.The only downside is the very subpar UX when compared to Discord or even Slack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;threaded&#34; part is key here. Slack threads are useless compared to Zulip. In Zulip you can create threads on the fly from existing messages, so if discussion starts diverging you can turn it into a new thread. It&#39;s just a fundamentally superior model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fell prey to this. Might have been the exact same website, too. Had had a drink with dinner, thought heck why not file for my EIN for an independent consulting LLC I was creating? Was using a fresh OS install where I hadn&#39;t yet installed Firefox with an adblocker. Usual defenses were weakened. Boom, $250 down the drain before I really thought it all through. Fortunately I was able to get it refunded by initiating a chargeback and telling their website support that I believed they were misrepresenting themselves as the IRS. It really was a &#34;welcome to the real world&#34; moment, though - my very first act as a new business in the US was to get scammed. This theme has continued. 90% of the business mail I get are scams masquerading as official government mail to get business licenses or whatever. These websites are run by scumbags who should all be arrested. And Google, of course, should pay actual penalties because it&#39;s been all upside for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a hard time trying to understand why governments don’t address these scams more proactively.There is a related issue when you register a new company here in Germany: As soon as the new entity is added to the company house (called “Handelsregister”), you will start to receive fake invoices from scam companies.These invoice look very similar to official ones and some even use the official seal of the state (see https://www.firma.de/en/company-formation/beware-of-fake-han... for examples).If you don’t pay close attention you can easily mistake these invoice for official ones.This scam is quite well-known and has been going on for years. To further add to the insult - the companies that send these fake invoices are usually German entities as well, not some obscure shell companies in remote islands and yet besides warnings from the government it seems that little is happening.I find it infuriating and don’t understand why it is even allowed to send another party that you never had any relation with an invoice for a service that you actually haven’t performed yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I teach everyone in my family to never trust the first few sponsored results now matter how convincing they may be. As far as I’m concerned Google know exactly what they’re doing and are actively complicit in perpetuating online scams against one family and friends. Are we seriously supposed to believe a company of their size, with their talent pool, and their money, can’t filter out such blatantly obvious crap? Sure."</p>

I&#39;ll probably be more inconvenienced by the mitigations that will surely result that make it that much more painful to actually launch a URL scheme, sadly.I&#39;ve actually never checked the &#34;Always open Slack for slack:// links&#34; or similar checkboxes, precisely out of predicting shenanigans like this would happen eventually :)I wouldn&#39;t be too offended if browsers changed the way they handle schemes: always open a &#34;how would you like to handle  this link&#34; dialog for any protocol (even if unhandled - like how Windows shows the &#34;how would you like to open this file&#34; dialog), to disguise whether the protocol is handled or not.  Not sure I have the answer for user convenience though if someone is used to things automatically opening. That&#39;s the &#34;inconvenience&#34; aspect of any potential mitigation, we probably have to get rid of that &#34;remember this choice&#34; checkbox (well, my point is that &#34;have to&#34; is debatable here)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did it on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari and got the same code on all three.

When I did it in Chrome it popped up a small square window where I could see it doing it&#39;s thing.Firefox was the only one where it was silent.But still, that&#39;s an interesting hack.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Syncthing. I have abysmally slow home internet, so any cloud storage service simply takes too long to sync, and trying to do the first sync of 150 GB takes many weeks. Besides, none of these services (dropbox, onedrive) support ignore files, so they&#39;re constantly syncing node_modules folders, etc.Instead, I have Syncthing set to sync a half-dozen folders (Pictures, desktop, documents, audiobooks, etc.) between my phone, laptop, and desktop over the local network. In total, I sync more than 150 GB of files and it works almost instantly and seamlessly. I use the SyncTrayzor GUI for Windows and the Syncthing app for Android. The Android app occasionally needs to be restarted manually, but that&#39;s the only problem I&#39;ve had with it.Importantly, I keep local copies of everything on all of my devices, including my phone (256 GB storage plus a microSD card slot which I have yet to need). Lack of support for Syncthing on iPhones is one major reason I stick with Android, even though there&#39;s a lot to like about the platform. Once it gets too big I&#39;ll move a bunch of old stuff to backup/archive drives, but I don&#39;t expect that to happen for a while.Now, I use Google Photos to selectively share photos with others, and that&#39;s it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The recently release 1.16.1 supports the first beta of untrusted nodes, aka nodes that will sync data but don&#39;t know what it is, as it is encrypted with a passphrase you set.so drop off an old machine at your parents / buddies / exs house, give it internet connection and cron some updates + reboots + power on after an outage and boom, if your house and all your devices burn down, you can get your files via decrypting with that password you saved to your email / password manager.I love Syncthing and it&#39;s replaced Dropbox and Microsoft 365 for me. ok i keep the latter for online dictation when I&#39;m not near a pc with dragon installed on it, but still, I don&#39;t need to trust MS with my data in their cloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unsurprising, but still disappointing. Actually I&#39;m glad someone is trying to hold them accountable. It seems silly tho that we need to pass a law to uphold what&#39;s already written into the constitution. It highlights that the constitution only has teeth in some legal contexts, primarily where a court case is being heard on a citizen being prosecuted. Conditionality seems to not have any bearing on preventing agencies from violating the constitution or stopping them when they&#39;re found out, nor punishing those responsible for the violation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I still can&#39;t fathom, all these years after Bush II and then Snowden, is just how little human beings really care about mass surveillance. Yeah, the Snowden leaks made a splash, but the media cycle turned over a couple weeks later and everyone moved onto other things.It&#39;s like, if you&#39;re of a certain age, you had to read 1984 or whatever in school. You&#39;d think &#34;well, no one would stand for that sort of thing in real life!&#34; Okay, so we don&#39;t live in that society, exactly, but time after time, we&#39;re shown the breadth of government surveillance and the reaction from the broader public isn&#39;t to call for anyone&#39;s head on a pike -- it&#39;s not even to vote anyone out!Outside of little communities like this one, people don&#39;t give much of a fuck. I guess that was Orwell&#39;s real point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like how this article buries the important parts of this story. There is good reason to think that this surveillance by public info is legal currently, there was a court ruling stating that&#39;s the case.A law is necessary to codify that this practice is a violation Fourth Amendment, and Wyden is currently one of a handful of senators trying to get it passed.The story eventually mentions this, but the beginning focus on confidentiality makes it seem like they&#39;re hiding evidence of their crime."</p>

Congress would make this illegal if congress men/women didn&#39;t sell out American Citizens.88% of the cost of the US Fed gov is paid for by taxes by workers (income taxes).  Less than 12% comes from all corp/business taxes combined with capital gains (taxing the rich 1%).  Business shifting tax burden to workers is a massive scale problem.  $3.5 Trillion = US Tax Revenues (2019) and 88% came from workers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Quick summary: the biggest electricity provider in the country (ENEL) made an app (Juicepass) to find and manage their charging stations across the country. The Android Auto functionality of the app has been rejected by Google for non disclosed &#34;security concerns while driving&#34;. The antitrust ruled out it was because Google wanted to sabotage competitor apps to the charging stations finder built-in in the Google Maps app. On top of the fine Google will need to provide the SDK to integrate their app with Android Auto."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way antitrust is working in recent years is kind of ridiculous. Google in Europe is becoming a rich case study in antitrust meh.You find that adwords engages in a blatant &#34;monopolistic abuse&#34; in some specific sense. In the Adwords EU case for example, Google was both monopsonising (google search) and monopolising search advertising. But, the actual violations are specific, like exclusivity requirements and other technical infractions buried in their take-it-or-leave-it contracts with &#34;partners.^&#34;Google get a fine. They deny culpability. They pay a fine and move on. Whether it&#39;s 100m or 2bn doesn&#39;t really matter. Google are demonstrably willing to pay far more (eg acquisition, browser kickbacks, etc.) to maintain a monopolistic position. Besides minor tweaks, there&#39;s no reason for them to change.What&#39;s the point? Antitrust can&#39;t be useful as a violation-fine paradigm. These cases/fines don&#39;t affect the monopoly or free the market in any useful sense.IMO, we need some way to declare a company &#34;Big&#34; and apply special rules to them. If those rules are onerous, that might create some organic pressure to split and/or help smaller incumbents  compete.There is no point to antitrust if its totally reactive, handing out fines for moving violations. The point of antitrust is trust-busting, to affect market structure. The point if to have a competitive market.All the 1990s stuff is playing out. Just like the MSFT case, we see that operating systems, browsers (now app stores) are monopoly prone and that it&#39;s a big deal. On the other side, the 90s &#34;portal&#34; concept is fully realized now. In the digital economy, controlling the windows of consumption is everything. None of the costs, all of the profit... literally all in a lot of cases.^Newspapers didn&#39;t have the advantage search partners had in their monopoly claim, because Google doesn&#39;t have agreements with them. No contract, no abusive clauses. The take it or leave it offer is &#34;give us your content for free, or go away.&#34; Formally, Google isn&#39;t even doing business with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good thing. My business unfortunately rely on the Playstore. Every update we submit I have nightmares about a rejected update or somekind of violation. I am active since the start of the store. On average once every 2 years we have a very serious issue with an app being suspended for a a reason we do not understand. I am lucky to have some ties to people inside Google, otherwise I would probably have lost (no joke) millions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big fan of notion. Not a fan of the data lock-in or haphazard security. For tools like this, SaaS will almost always beat open source just by virtue of elbow grease and a product direction. So I’m willing to forego the open source alternatives. But I really wish Notion gave me more options for how to host my data. AFAICT they offer no “dedicated storage” or “on premise” plan, even if you want to pay for it.In fact I heard a rumor that the entirety of Notion runs on a single unsharded database. If true, combined with the fact that this API took so long to ship, I have to assume that there is a crippling amount of tech debt in their stack. Hopefully it’s growing pains and they’re sorting it out, but it doesn’t make me feel confident about the security of my (most sensitive) data.It’s maybe also a cautionary tale about what happens when you dismiss too many early decisions as “premature optimization.” You ship fast in the beginning but a few years later you’re buried in all the debt you generated.Granted, it’s a good problem to have. If the choice is between a profitable, popular company buried in tech debt, or the perfect stack with no customers, I’ll take the debt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I initially signed up for Notion, I did so thinking the API was already usable. It was used as a selling point for their premium service even though it wasn&#39;t implemented. This was a year and a half ago or so.I felt pretty burned by it and killed my subscription. Hopefully this turns out well for the people who&#39;ve been waiting for it, but that experience left a terrible taste in my mouth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve recently started using Notion and I&#39;m surprised at few things that I find incredibly annoying with it so far. Since it seems there are some Notion staff here I&#39;ll take this as a change to give some feedback to hopefully improve the product.* No read-only mode. I like to have documents default to a read-only mode so I don&#39;t accidentally typo random characters, or delete something when try copying. etc.* No floating table of contents. There is a ToC block but it&#39;s at a fixed position, where it&#39;s not terribly usable especially for long documents having a giant ToC at the top isn&#39;t great. I&#39;ve tried using columns but it just squishes the rest of the document way too much* Floating heads. When you have multiple collaborators the avatars zooming up and down the left side of the document is incredibly distracting. I&#39;d love a way to disable this completely. I don&#39;t care where in a document other people are reading.* Database/Table horizontal scrollbar. Almost every database in our documents end up with this giant scrollbar that spans edge to edge, looking like a horizontal rule, breaking up the visual flow of the page significantly. I keep thinking it&#39;s some kind of page break.These are just some of my initial impressions. I do think it&#39;s a very visually nice product and has a lot of neat features but I&#39;m pretty surprised by some basic QoL stuff missing and hope to see it further refined."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My hot-take having watched the culling from an invested position follows. Disclaimer: i hold both BTC and ETH.While the market in general is down, the major losses in this crash were Bitcoin, Doge and Shiba. Bitcoin is an obvious result given the news. Doge and Shiba have had pretty spectacular gains over the last ~30d and seeing them lose considerable value is unsurprising if you follow crypto markets much. Seemingly new money has been racing in lately (see big rises in Eth Classic and Bitcoin Cash as well), i find these dips also unsurprising given past behavior.As a somewhat meta analysis, i feel BTC could have an interesting summer. BTC plateaued at $1.1T in market cap. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been on a steady rise from 250-500B+. Talk of &#34;the flippening&#34; has returned in a way i didn&#39;t anticipate, certainly not this early on.While this news impacted the whole market (the market still follows big BTC swings to some extent), i have found my personal sentiment shifting to be increasingly bearish on BTC and bullish on ETH."</p>

The design became the first of its kind to become certified with the FAA, achieving certification in October 1998, and as of 2014 was the only aircraft ballistic parachute used as standard equipment by an aviation company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, that&#39;s incredible.  Goes to show that people do walk away from plane crashes with some regularity.  My father was a pilot[0].He sold his plane about 15 years ago (to a group of owners, one of which was a priest, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a joke in there).  A few of winters later, he was called out to Romeo Airport; the pilot flying the plane that was formerly his had crashed the aircraft a few miles short of the runway in bad weather[1].  He was traveling with his daughter, a friend and, I think, his wife.  He died, but his daughter was able to get free and make her way to a nearby farm to call for help.  Looking at the plane, the fact that anyone survived at all let alone walked to a nearby house with minor injuries is pretty miraculous.It&#39;s hard to impress upon folks who have never been in a small plane like that just how ... yeah ... how much it feels like you&#39;re hanging onto a kite.  I have no idea the kinds of structural technologies are involved in the aircraft but I know his plane was made in the 70s and was light enough that he only had a pole which attached to the front landing gear to pull it out of the hangar.  The weight is so critical that the 7-seat plane can realistically only seat 4-5 adults.  I remember being shocked that they had to weigh the paint they applied when he had the plane re-painted.[0] I&#39;ll spare the details as I have left many comments in the past about his experiences.[1] https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/43894 - &#34;Pilot Error&#34;; I recall my Dad saying &#34;all plane crashes are pilot error&#34;[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-32_Cherokee_Six"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So multiple people have noted that the environmental concerns were exactly the same and very well known when Tesla originally started taking bitcoin as payment.So what changed? Well I think the biggest notable difference between then and now is then bitcoin seemed to be going only up. Now it seems to be going down. When bitcoin continues to  steadily go down, it is a significant concern because Tesla will have to take losses on the cars it sells and will have reduced gross margins, which will result in their stock price tanking.Musk smartly decided he did not want to risk his half a trillion dollar company on random bitcoin fluctuations. It is probably the right decision (although certainly covered up with false reasoning) but he should have never reached this stage. Tesla should have never taken bitcoin without provisions for automatically converting it into one of the currencies it pays its costs in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If TSLA has already dumped their Bitcoin, Elon just pulled off a highly lucrative pump and dump scheme.1. Buy $1.5 billion in BTC2. Announce TSLA will accept BTC, with the knowledge that very few people will actually do that, and public support from a major company will drive up the price of BTC.3. Sell off your BTC at the higher price. A portion was sold in Q1 for a hefty profit already.4. Rinse and repeat with DOGE?The environmental impact was well known before they bought it, so it&#39;s a little odd that they&#39;d reverse course because of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fact this was paid off, and paid off so rapidly means that targeting major infrastructure for massive payoffs is going to become more and more prominent. The next time though, it&#39;ll be $50M. I work with people in the oil fields and I know the numbers they are playing with and the fact that a single well being down can easily be $100,000 lost per hour. So obviously they want these systems back up fast.$5M for shutting down that major of a pipeline seems like too little, unless, of course, they weren&#39;t expecting the company to even pay. Now that these actors know that the oil (and quite likely other utilities) are more than willing to pay big bucks to get back online, they will be targeted far more.There are so many reasons this is very very bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have much to add here, but I&#39;ve been going to Def Con and the other Las Vegas security conferences for a few years. Every year there is a section for infrastructure security (factories, refineries, etc). Its always the smallest section and the least populated. But its simultaneously the &#34;most important&#34; in terms of how much damage can be done from a single attack. Every year I went and was always terrified by all the stuff I saw because all the people hosting booths were like &#34;yeah its dead simple to get in and break things.&#34; I feel like so many people could see this coming and there are just no consequences for the companies to incentivize them to do better."</p>

Any IT department that is telling users to use IE11 for security reasons is questionable imho."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking as one of the original three authors of Google Docs (Writely), but zero involvement in this project (I left Google in 2010): I&#39;m seeing a lot of comments asking how JavaScript-on-Canvas could possibly outperform the highly optimized native code built into the browser engines. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve really been involved in browser coding, but having written both Writely and, farther back, several native-app word processing engines, here are some thoughts.Word processors have extremely specific requirements for layout, rendering, and incremental updates. I&#39;ll name just two examples. First, to highlight a text selection in mixed left-to-right / right-to-left text, it&#39;s necessary to obtain extremely specific information regarding text layout; information that the DOM may not be set up to provide. Second, to smoothly update as the user is typing text, it&#39;s often desirable to &#34;cheat&#34; the reflow process and focus on updating just the line of text containing the insertion point. (Obviously browser engines support text selections, but they probably don&#39;t expose the underlying primitives the way a word processor would need. Similarly, they support incremental layout + rendering, but probably not specifically optimized in the precise way a word processor would need.)Modern browser engines are amazing feats of engineering, but the feature set they provide, while enormous, is unlikely to exactly match the exacting requirements of a WYSIWYG word processor. As soon as your requirements differ even slightly from the feature set provided, you start tipping over into complex workarounds which impact performance and are hell on developer productivity and application stability / compatibility.This is loosely analogous to CISC vs. RISC: browsers are amazing &#34;CISCy&#34; engines but if your use case doesn&#39;t precisely fit the expectations of the instruction set designer then you&#39;re better off with something lower-level, like Canvas and WASM. (I don&#39;t know whether Docs uses WASM but it would seem like a good fit for this Canvas project.)Frameworks in general suffer from this problem. If you&#39;ve ever had to fight with an app framework, or orchestration framework, or whatever sort of framework to accomplish something 5% outside of what the framework is set up to support, then you understand the concept.Also, as noted in many comments here, browser engines have to solve a much more general problem than Docs, and thus have extra overhead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2009, I joined Mozilla and started working on the Bespin[1] project, which Ben Galbraith &amp; Dion Almaer had brought to Moz. Bespin was built with a canvas-based renderer. Bespin was way faster than other browser-based code editors at the time.Then the Ajax.org/Cloud9 folks came along with their Ace editor[2], which was DOM-based and still very fast. We ended up merging the projects. edit to add: and switching to DOM renderingRik Arends[3] was one of the Ajax.org folks and he&#39;s been working on a WebGL-based code environment called Makepad[4], which is entirely built in Rust and has its own UI toolkit. He&#39;s complained a lot about how difficult it is to make a performant JS-based editing environment.My point in all of this is just that there are absolutely tradeoffs in performance, accessibility, ease-of-development, internationalization, and likely other aspects. If raw performance is what you&#39;re going for, it&#39;s hard to beat just drawing on a canvas or using WebGL. Google Docs needs to worry about all of that other stuff, too, so I&#39;ll be interested to see how this shapes up.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Skywriter[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(editor)[3]: https://twitter.com/rikarends[4]: https://makepad.dev"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote the terminal canvas renderers in VS Code that has been called out a few times here. Initially I implemented a canvas renderer using just a 2d context to draw many textures which sped things up &#34;5 to 45 times&#34;[1] over the older DOM renderer.Since then I moved onto a WebGL renderer[2] which was mostly a personal project, it&#39;s basically the first canvas renderer but better in every way since it works by organizing a typed array (very fast) and sending it to the GPU in one go, as opposed to piece meal and having the browser do its best to optimize/reduce calls. This was measured to improve performance by up to 900% in some cases over the canvas renderer, but actually much more than that if for example the browser has GPU rendering disabled and tried to user the canvas renderer on the CPU.My opinion here is that canvas is a great technology, capable of speeding things up significantly and getting close to native app performance. It comes with very real trade offs though:- Cost of implementation and maintenance is much higher with canvas. This is particularly the case with WebGL, there have been very few contributions to xterm.js (the terminal frontend component) in the WebGL renderer because of the knowledge required.
- Accessibility needs to be implemented from scratch using a parallel DOM structure that only gets exposed to the screen reader. Supporting screen readers will probably also negate the benefits of using canvas to begin with since you need to maintain the DOM structure anyway (the Accessibility Object Model DOM API should help here).
- Plugins/extensibility for webapps are still very possible but requires extra thinking and explicit APIs. For xterm.js we&#39;re hoping to allow decorating cells in the terminal by giving embedders DOM elements that are managed/positioned by the library[3].More recently I built an extension for VS Code called Luna Paint[4] which is an image editor built on WebGL, taking the lessons I learned from working on the terminal canvas renderer to make a surprisingly capable image editor embedded in a VS Code webview.[1]: https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/03/terminal-rend...[2]: https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_55#_webgl-renderer-...[3]: https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/1852[4]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.l..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very nice code quality.C gets a hard time and this code base highlights some of the modern features C is missing by its use of perfectly clear workarounds. E.g. The prefix “namespacing” done here works just fine, easy to understand. The go-style visibility approach is growing on me lately and it works well here.C does deserve some of the criticism right enough, e.g. the same macros re-defined in a few places - it’d be nice if c had a better way than its version of macros although its not actually a problem here because the macros aren’t really big enough to have subtle sharp edges.Ahh a beautifully written project, just shows that maybe C is entirely workable in the right hands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The number of comments here that are negative is just staggering to me.These images are within a hair&#39;s breadth of being indistinguishable from reality. It&#39;s an enormous leap. An enormous leap from the previous techniques and an enormous leap towards photorealistic realtime graphics.You don&#39;t want your games to look realistic? Go play pacman or outrun.You want to use path tracing instead? You have no idea how much cheaper this technique is. And on top of that the neural network is also fixing up the unrealistic texture work on all kinds of things in the scene.The first games to use this are going to be from small game studios with less investment in the status quo and they are going to blow the competition out of the water."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am especially impressed by how much more realistic the lighting ends up looking despite the network probably having less information to work with than the engine! Though it ends up turning the lighting very flat. I guess that is an effect of the source images they were using.As others have said, using this directly in the engine (tuned to work with the intended art style etc) could probably produce almost miraculous results, if it can be made to work at a reasonable frame rate.That would also allow the developers to use high-quality rendered images instead of these green-tinted, low-contrast &#34;automotive grade&#34; camera images as source of truth (there are good reasons these images look like that ... but they don&#39;t look pleasant)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Impressive, but I think that photorealism is not necessarily what you would want to strive for in games, as it is not true realism. It emulates the deficiencies of the camera that we perceive it as realistic, because we are trained on thousands of photo images and video footage. I prefer visionrealism instead of photorealism in my games and don&#39;t really find that lens effects like flares, chromatic aberration, and depth of field enhances the experience of realism. It feels like I&#39;m looking through a camera rather than being there myself. For me it breaks immersion instead of enhancing it."</p>

This ESP32 AirTag emulator could send out battery level and bilge pump data any time someone sailed by, without the need for a dedicated modem. Might have to try this out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As there&#39;s a limit of 16 AirTags per Apple ID, and each AirTag&#39;s keys rotate every 15 minutes, presumably Apple can detect if anyone is abusing the system by sending more than 16 different &#34;messages&#34; per 15 minutes. They can&#39;t detect this when the fake airtags are sending, but can detect it from stored message timestamps when you query.  If they start to see this being abused a lot, they can then block Apple IDs.  To avoid Apple being able to see this, you probably need to either use multiple Apple IDs, or send less than 16 bits per 15 minutes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember when I first learned to touch-type as a child, and for many years after, I would sometimes &#39;type&#39; things out on my legs, tabletops, notebooks. At first it was to practice, but after I had mastered typing I kept doing it just because it was still novel to be able to type and feel like I knew how to use technology. Doing that made me realize that typing a character is a very specific and atomic action (compared to writing by hand), as well as an automatic one (once you learn how to touch-type). I wonder if the performance of this solution could be improved by training it to detect the mental impulses that occur when a trained typist imagines typing a character, rather than when the person imagines writing out a character."</p>

That it worked blew my mind. But they talked about how slow and noisy it was to get the cursor from one side to the other... maybe a minute IIRC. What I remember most distinctly was the researcher said it was physically draining to do, that after 5-7 minutes of this activity they would be sweating and exhausted, without moving."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The biggest technical hurdle is the inability to run external processes on iOS and iPadOS.&gt; Apps on iOS and iPadOS must use Apple’s Javascript interpreter, JavaScriptCore.Both of these really suck because they are policy, not technical, decisions. Even setting aside the arguments of whether JIT code is a security concern (it is not unless your security model is one where codesigning exists to prevent the addition of new native code) that you cannot spawn a new process, nor can you ship another JavaScript interpreter, is really unfortunate.Allowing apps to spawn new processes is easy (I mean, just inherit sandboxing rules and resource limits…) and allows for a lot of new usecases, like robust crash reporting, web servers, privilege separation, and more. That Apple allows this on macOS and even uses it for its own apps on iOS just shows how useful this can be and how little it affects the security model of iOS.Likewise, not allowing other JavaScript interpreters is just…annoying. Regardless of your opinions of JavaScriptCore, this is an unfair limitation on an already slanted playing field. Coupled with the fact that the JavaScriptCore interpreter (which the framework uses for anything you run in-process) is literally designed for low resource consumption instead of than performance makes this even more infuriating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a different view of this than most in this topic. I am disappointed, though not surprised, that Panic is abandoning yet another of their iOS apps. They’ve done it several times before and while I am grateful they’ve continued to provide some bug fixes, feature work stopped years ago.In my view, the biggest hurdle does not seem to have been technical, but ideological/business. These old school Mac developers like Panic and Omni have had a very difficult time adapting to (or failing to) the iOS/mobile era. 
I know we all hate subscriptions, but continued app development and management requires continued labor so subscriptions seem like the only business option that makes any sense to me. Panic and Omni want paid upgrades but Apple has never, ever even hinted at providing that as an option. The option is subscriptions. Even on desktop Sketch, Adobe, and Microsoft are going with subscriptions. (We’ll see how Affinity does. They charge a lot more for their apps and seem to be in a growth phase so I imagine their sales at the moment are fast enough to make up for the fact that each sale is only a one time source of revenue).Honestly, Panic and Omni and other old school Mac developers really, really need to adapt to the modern era. They’ve had years and it feels like the runway is about to end (see Omni’s recent layoffs.) Wishing for paid upgrades and writing “only AppKit apps are real Mac apps” blog posts isn’t going to change anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a real shame that the otherwise very capable iPad cannot sustain an enormous subcategory of professional grade software, solely because of Apple’s policies.People know this going in of course, but it doesn’t make it any less of a shame, especially now you can spec out an iPad Pro with the exact same specs as the laptop I use for work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tracking units is a thing that I rarely have a use for (as a non-engineer), but when I do, I’m totally mystified by how bad almost every language is at it. F# is the only actual programming language I found that even tries. It does a pretty decent job, but even it has some disappointing holes (e.g. not being able to understand g and kg as scaled versions of the same dimension).I guess the overlap between physicists/engineers and type system/PLT people isn’t large enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I see this sort of thing I always want to know something that is seldom made clear: what is actually implemented so far?.The video begins &#34;This is Atlas, a concept for a new engineering IDE&#34;. (To me, that strongly suggests that rather little is actually implemented yet, and that what we&#39;re about to see is a lot of canned demos, because otherwise it would be a new engineering IDE, not just a &#34;concept&#34; for one.) But then most of what follows, and pretty much everything on the webpage, says that Atlas does this or that, not &#34;will do&#34;.And the trouble with &#34;concepts&#34; is that unlike actual implementations they aren&#39;t much of a guide to what you&#39;re ever actually going to get. It&#39;s easy to think &#34;X would be cool&#34; and say &#34;Atlas does X&#34;, but some Xs are much more realistically implementable than others, and how interesting Atlas actually is depends on which of those Xs are ever actually going to be implemented.But reading the page and watching the video I have literally no idea where the project is on a scale from &#34;we wrote down some things it would be cool to do and rigged up a demo that pretends to do them&#34; to &#34;everything here is already implemented, though there are a few gaps and bugs here and there&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Write equations; not codeThis is a little odd to me - I generally prefer to write my math in code if its going to be executed. I find my preferences to be pen and paper (or whiteboard)&gt; latex, so perhaps I am not the target demographic here."</p>
