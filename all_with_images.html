								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NFTs make perfect sense for representing a claim on things that can be used, like event tickets or in-game virtual goods. But as certificates layered on top of collectibles... I&#39;m not so sure.With something like CryptoKitties, you can do something with the tokens (play a virtual pet game). But with something like CryptoPunks you&#39;re essentially paying for digital beanie babies, which are worse than real ones since anyone can display and enjoy the image you paid for.You can brag about owning such-and-such an image, but only as long as enough other people desire images from that particular set. When a set&#39;s popularity wanes, so does your token&#39;s value, and your ability to show it off.I&#39;m always happy to see artists being paid for their work, and if they can make some money during this craze - more power to them. Beyond a few creators being rewarded, it seems like this is going to be 90% bubble (with plenty of hucksters), and 10% real use cases that stand the test of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty bad take on NFTs.There are numerous configurations, networks, and commercial structures that can be created for NFT offerings that can mitigate &#34;problems&#34; described in the OP and accommodate for different tradeoffs.A simple retort would point to the many alternative NFT networks that don&#39;t use POW-based consensus algorithms or the NFT offerings that enable value add offerings very differently than purchasing art or baseball cards.Evaluating the capabilities of NFTs against the value offerings of something like rare art is an apples to oranges comparison. Of course the market for digital assets offered via NFT is immature and speculative; this is a new market, based on an alternative technology paradigm, that has a long way to go before it settles into a more usable and valuable structure.Ultimately, the idea of using key-pairs pegged to widely accessible peer-to-peer public networks as a mechanism for tracking ownership of digital (or near digital or at times even physical) assets is incredibly novel. It turns the conventional model of third-party hosted digital assets on its head and enables really interesting mechanisms of distribution, ownership, access, and value consumption and creation that does not compare well with traditional mechanisms. And in saying it doesn&#39;t compare well I mean to acknowledge its limitations and its potential at the same time. However, the critique in the OP is pretty bland and doesn&#39;t seem to acknowledge the full scope of the situation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NFT&#39;s are Bullshit: https://samim.io/p/2021-03-05-non-fungible-tokens-nft-are-bu...In Summary:
1. The NFT doubles down on the worst of copyright, the property metaphor, &amp; tries to impose old ideas of scarcity &amp; exclusion on the digital realm, where both are obsolete.2.NFTs are an absolute ecological disaster"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having distinct types for P0 and P1 is deliberate and is what is called &#34;type state programming&#34; in the embedded rust book [0]. The advantage is that you can prevent misconfiguration at compile time  (ensuring that a given pin cannot be used in multiple places). In the Zig example, it seems to me (and I have zero knowledge of Zig, so sorry if this is inaccurate) that you can potentially introduce bugs where the same pin is used twice.For a generic led driver, it should not use these types, but instead the trait types from the embedded_hal crate, such as &#34;OutputPin&#34; that is implemented by the different chip-specific HALs. There is an example of a generic led driver that uses these traits at [1].In general I recommend everyone who wants to try out Rust on embedded to read the embedded rust book, because it clarifies a lot of the reasons and advantages of its approach.[0] https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/static-guarantees/typest...[1] https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-device/blob/main/rt/src..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s another example of the coolness of Zig&#39;s comptime code execution:https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/0808d98e10c5fea27cebf9...That&#39;s a generic container class (similar to vector in C++ or List in C#). But! With a twist!It stores structs in &#34;column major&#34; order in memory (e.g., if a struct had two fields A and B, then in-memory layout would be A...AB...B), and you can idiomatically and efficiently get a a slice of the values of each column.I.e., it&#39;s a datastructure that automatically applies the struct-of-arrays optimization:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA#Structure_of_Arr...And the code to do it is straightforward, normal Zig.Pretty awesome stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zig&#39;s design is so radical, that it completely rethinks how low-level programming can and should be done, rather than improve on one of the existing low-level programming philosophies (C or C++&#39;s). That the result is such a simple and easy-to-learn language that, despite being so radical, doesn&#39;t feel foreign is truly an accomplishment.&gt; In particular, that much of the complexity I’d unconsciously attributed to the domain — “this is what systems programming is like” — was in fact a consequence of deliberate Rust design decisions.I also thought that, and, to be fair to Rust, it is following the tradition of C++ and Ada, two low-level languages that would also easily make the top five most complex languages in history alongside Rust. Until Zig showed up, I, and I think many others, didn&#39;t believe that an expressive low-level language could be made so simple, certainly not one that values safety."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got the privilege of having lunch with Mr. McDonald when I was an IEEE officer during college. He gave a lecture at my university on ethics, and the IEEE council got to take him for lunch afterwards.He was not shy at all about saying whatever was on his mind. It was pretty awesome to hear him dunk on his VP, right in the middle of lying to the Rogers commission&#39;s face. He was also really open about the fact that nobody at Morton Thiokol trusted him for the better part of a decade after he did that. He said something to the effect of, &#34;It definitely made my career harder, but on the bright side, I never had any major crises of conscience for lying about it.He also didn&#39;t give a single fuck about getting a lunch beer at a student gathering. I wish I&#39;d joined him in drinking beer at noon on a Tuesday on IEEE dime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found the history of the related company Morton-Thiokol quite useful as part of understanding as well. [1]https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-mag..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The film “Challenger: The Final Flight” on Netflix includes interviews with the most important participants in the launch decision, including McDonald. (It also has interviews with many of the astronauts’ families and does a great job at putting their experience front and centre.)The guy whose job it was to send the fax because he happened to be the one who knew how to operate the fax machine is to this day utterly devastated; weeping.The MTI VP who signed off (although the decision was made above his head) admits that he agreed with it at the time, but acknowledges it was a mistake. He’s being interviewed in a large room full of very expensive furniture.The NASA manager who bullied them into agreeing to launch because they couldn’t prove that it was unsafe basically says that if he had his time over he would kill all of the astronauts again. Truly terrifying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Switzerland has an awesome electoral system [1].  Instead of being ruled by a president or a prime minister who can be polarising, divisive, or selective, Switzerland has an Executive Council.The 7 member Executive Council is composed of the top 7 candidates from each election.  The chairperson of the executive council rotates each year, so that the top 4 vote winners each get a turn at being chairperson.This means that different social and political priorities get implemented in turn.  It also means the way the government works is more cooperative, because each council member, including the chairperson, knows there will be a new chairperson next year.So, if a pro-business candidate places 1st, and an environment candidate 2nd, and a social welfare candidate 3rd, and a libertarian candidate 4th, it is in all their interests to cooperate and create legislation that serves all of their interests as much as possible.  Instead of disregarding the environment, the pro-business council member is encouraged to develop green business initiatives that will be supported for the full 4 year term under the different chairs.The system creates a leadership team that looks for win-win, rather than a sole victor who can abuse majority rule.[1]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council_(Switzerland)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quite a few people who voted against this did so purely because they didn’t want private companies controlling the system.If the proposal had been for the government to issue and control the identities, it may well have passed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; From a distance, procrastination looks like a time management problem. There is growing evidence that it is rather an emotional management problem — a flight response.It&#39;s eye opening how a lot of life struggles turn out to be an emotional management problem at their core: procrastination, addiction, stress.I wish I had that perspective earlier in my life. It completely changes the solution space from trying random productivity tools to focusing on one&#39;s emotions and possibly getting into therapy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is all true but but I&#39;ve been recently been diagnosed with adult adhd in my mid-30ies and on a low dose of slow release Methylphenidate and it&#39;s all the difference between getting things done and procrastinating like hell. If you exhausted all the articles and nothing worked and you have big problems for years (like this: https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html) give it a try. In the last weeks I managed to really learn in a structured way for the first time. Of course it&#39;s no magic solution to all your problems but it&#39;s a stark difference for me. I just want to leave that here as I&#39;ve read these articles every other week and nothing sticked. Neither did counseling or talk theraphy - it helped but didn&#39;t solve the procrastination / time issues"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the interesting things you can do with ffmpeg, if you have a LOT of scratch disk space, and you&#39;re trying to compare subjective encoder quality (not VMAF, but human eyeballs) on a certain video file:1) take your raw uncompressed y4m file and write it out to a directory of PNG files, one png file per frame. this is your static image reference baseline for subjective eyeballs.2) take your raw uncompressed y4m file and encode it to x265 or whatever codec you&#39;re testing, at various different bitrates and encoder settings3) take your various encoded x265 files and also write those out to PNG files in separate directories3) pick exactly the same frame number filename from your &#39;master&#39; PNGs and your encoder-output PNGs, copy them and put them in the same directory so you can quickly flip back and forth between them in a image slideshow application.If you want to do this with 2160p24,p25 or p30 videos at several minute lengths, be prepared to have 150-160GB of scratch disk per y4m and per PNG-dump-directory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this book does what it claims to do, it should probably cost more (pls raise the price after I buy it). I strongly believe that inside ffmpeg may be the secret to the cosmos, the universe and life itself"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a fun read, especially as someone who grew up with those 80s and 90s movies.That said, and as the author touches on, the action/super hero of today is a PG-13 one. Studios need to reach the widest audience possible to make the most money, so it&#39;s a safer bet.Sure, back in the day studios had the same imperative, but the licensed toy game was still young, so they didn&#39;t realise that maybe if they made Die Hard PG instead of R they could sell some John McClane action figures to younger viewiers.Nowadays, that&#39;s basically the starting point; what we can we sell outside of the movie? how can we milk the franchise for as much as possible?And that&#39;s where a lot of the sex appeal is lost. Marvel movies can&#39;t be as raunchy as a result.Another topic that the author touched on was the way the ideal aesthetic has changed in not just our bodies but where we live or what we do in our spare time.I agree that more and more we are optimising for artifice; fitness classes, extra curricular activities, holidays, concerts and events we attend, just to keep up an appearance online or in person. And in those activities we often don&#39;t get the true value out of them because we&#39;re doing them for the wrong reason.Anyway, it&#39;s a complex and interesting topic and I&#39;d love to read more about this perhaps from even further back (50s or 60s) if anyone has something similar to this post?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this a side effect of normalizing porn, that sexuality is more effectively partitioned?I once had a debate in an online forum about legalizing prostitution, and most participants were supportive of it. Then I asked the same group, what about legalizing partial prostitution, like a receptionist that also has sex with the boss as part of the job description. The participants all immediately switched to revulsion at the idea and none would support it.So why is 100% sex work less exploitative than 50% sex work? I don&#39;t think it is. But for some reason our culture finds specialist sex workers more tolerable. The same pressure seems to be bifurcating entertainment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; [Julia] was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her.&gt; Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.1984, George Orwell, 1949"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Been following the creators for awhile and very much happy to see them democratizing their difficult skillset.Most designers -- think anyone using figma -- are effectively locked out of modern interactive and animated visuals due to not knowing hardcore shaders + effective js coding. To get a feel for how hard that is, look at the public timeline of Shirley Wu, another wonderful award-winning designer and experienced js coder, to pick this kind of stuff up. Nodes makes it a lot more accessible, similar to Max/msp for musicians. Once you look beyond the over-claiming, which is clearly nails-on-chalkboard for most engineers and scientists as you are seeing in the comments -- this is a wonderful and enabling project.Extra impressive is they do not seem to try to &#39;dumb it down&#39;. They are a consultancy and (seem to) try to use it for their own bespoke advanced installations. I don&#39;t know how well this will translate to others, but the success of Max msp and super collider make me optimistic that it can grow to those levels. Cycling 74 supports 20+ employees and empowers many musicians, and as Nodes can be used for commercial art (web+tv ads, music videos, landing pages, ...), I can see them being even bigger."</p>

By Googling, I found the GitHub repo [0], but it’s empty of code and looks to be used for issue tracking only.I can’t see something that’s trying to be an ecosystem being very successful without being open (see: every closed-source language/runtime ever).I couldn’t even find any example code. I tried clicking the examples on the home page. I even tried clicking “Playground” and it wasn’t a link.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s an avalanche of people commenting on this who didn&#39;t bother to check the article before raising their methodological objections, so let&#39;s get these out of the way here.- Yes, they controlled for objects appearing in the pictures that might indicate political affiliation. The images are tightly cropped around the face. See Methods.- Yes, this is significantly better than both a coin flip and a human classifier. They gave the same test to humans, who did much worse than the model. See Abstract, Introduction, and Results.- Yes, this is doing more than just detecting a person&#39;s race, age, and/or gender. The classifier is still accurate when they compare people with the same race, age, and gender. See Results.If you want to discuss actual limitations in the study, here are some the author points out:- &#34;A more detailed picture could be obtained by exploring the links between political orientation and facial features extracted from images taken in a standardized setting while controlling for facial hair, grooming, facial expression, and head orientation.&#34;- &#34;Another factor affecting classification accuracy is the quality of the political orientation estimates. While the dichotomous representation used here (i.e., conservative vs. liberal) is widely used in the literature, it offers only a crude estimate of the complex interpersonal differences in ideology. Moreover, self-reported political labels suffer from the reference group effect: respondents’ tendency to assess their traits in the context of the salient comparison group.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t a study that shows that people&#39;s faces indicate their political leanings.It&#39;s a study which shows that pictures that people select to represent themselves publicly have features that indicate political leaning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the key line is how much better this system is than humans attempting the same task:&gt; Political orientation was correctly classified in 72% of liberal–conservative face pairs, remarkably better than chance (50%), human accuracy (55%), or one afforded by a 100-item personality questionnaire (66%).This isn&#39;t a matter of &#34;recognize that old white people are conservative&#34;, because people will do that already, and they know all those biases. And the system doesn&#39;t lose much accuracy when comparing otherwise similar people.This system is picking up on things we don&#39;t notice. Maybe it&#39;s the photos themselves (they are self-selected), maybe it&#39;s micro expressions in the face, maybe it&#39;s something else entirely.But damn it&#39;s neat and maybe frightening. Imagine if your next hiring manager had a quiet little camera in the corner and chose you based on your predicted approval of unions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Just 100 cars will be made available with the technology in Japan, and they will cost the equivalent of $101,900. None of these Legends will make their way to the U.S.&#34;I&#39;m assuming if it won&#39;t come to the US it won&#39;t come to the UK, Canada or Australia either.Is 100 units really a &#34;production car&#34;? I don&#39;t agree.Also:&#34;It does all this with zero input from the driver, who Honda says can &#34;watch television/DVD on the navigation screen or operate the navigation system to search for a destination address.&#34;and yet:&#34;Please do not overestimate the capabilities of each Honda Sensing Elite function and drive safely while paying constant attention to your surroundings. Please remain in condition where you can respond to the handover request issued by the system, and immediately resume driving upon the handover request.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is notable is level 3. Not the features, but the legal aspect of claiming drivers can now be distracted with your mode.Tesla &#34;auto&#34;pilot does more, while pretending to enforce an always alert driver. This has resulted in a couple wrongful deaths no one at Tesla has been prosecuted for.Honda meanwhile is taking advantage of the Japanese governments legal changes which make level 3 legally tenable. Drivers need not watch the road, but they must respond when the car asks them to. This means Honda is promising your Honda will not silently drive you into a wall as the Tesla autopilot is known to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s not mentioned in all the othe english based articles is that Honda&#39;s system only works on highways at speeds below 50km/h. It&#39;s a system specifically designed for dealing with traffic jams on highways, and is not comparable to, say, Tesla&#39;s autopilot.https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Honda-launches-...&gt; It can free drivers from driving in congested traffic on an expressway when travelling slower than 50 kilometers per hour.&gt; The system automatically accelerates, brakes and steers while monitoring the vehicle&#39;s surroundings, using data from high-definition mapping and external sensors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, clearly Google has too much power over the internet, it&#39;s arbitrary and opaque, etc.  I agree.  However, I think it is worth pointing out that:1) malware is often very aggressive and fast-spreading, and once it&#39;s on a user&#39;s computer it&#39;s hard to get off, therefore...2) the system to detect it and stop access to the site has to be automated, not a human-in-the-loop system that might take hours or days to shut off access to a site which is infecting many users per minute, and...3) the more clarity there is on how exactly that automated system works, the more certain we can be that malware will be able to evade it; it&#39;s much like how spam detection or search page rankings are opaque, because the incentives to game the system are very greatI&#39;m not saying Google&#39;s system is perfect, but I am saying it&#39;s a very hard problem to solve in a way that doesn&#39;t give us an even worse time stopping malware spread than we already have.  So while it is hard to feel sorry for a company as wealthy and powerful as Google, I think the issue is not as clear-cut as some comments on this thread seem to suggest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Now we run automated tests to monitor server uptime and check server for problems every 30 seconds. Unfortunately automated test scripts were happily getting HTTP/200 replies while people using the Chrome browser were being told this is a scam business trying to steal their bank account information.I was surprised this wasn&#39;t part of the lessons learned. But it seems the monitoring basically failed but that wasn&#39;t a lesson.I feel like majority of uptime monitors are falling for this same trap. One of the reasons why for my monitoring service I choose to do full page load monitoring via Chrome instead of just a http request via Curl or whatever. Main reason, people care if the webpage loads or not. People care how long it takes for their webpage to load. Having a website respond in 200ms is great but if it takes 8000ms for all the JS to load and process your website is still slow. I get why sites are just doing curl requests because it&#39;s way cheaper but really you&#39;re monitoring one part of the stack while really caring about all of it. If your website starts producing javascript errors you want to know, etc.[1] https://www.ootliers.com (The landing page and everything are terrible and I&#39;m working on improving that)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They can remove your YouTube account, app, entire Google account or even your website at any time and you can only make guesses why did that happen, because they always make the rules really vague and it&#39;s never clear what is or is not allowed. And even when they do admit the mistake and get you back up, they still won&#39;t explain anything and nothing is ever fixed. Thank you Google, very cool."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"0data appears to be a curated collection of five best-in-class libraries/frameworks that enable building SPA apps with user controlled data, rather than Big Tech controlled platforms and services.1. Autonomous Data2. remoteStorage3. Solid Project4. Unhosted5. Fission[1] https://noeldemartin.github.io/autonomous-data/introduction....[2] https://remotestorage.io/[3] https://solidproject.org/[4] https://unhosted.org/[5] https://fission.codes/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone dabbling with such an app right now, there are several hurdles if you want to exclusively use self sovereign identity.1. Local data gets lost, so you need to sync for backup. But when your device gets lost or when you need to access it from elsewhere, how would you login to the said backup service? The most intuitive option is still a username and a password.2. It&#39;s hard to transfer data from one device to another. And to asynchronously share data with friends and family. Solutions like ipfs exist, but in practice they rely on many centralized services (eg: for pinning). And besides, securely sharing private data is not an option on any of them.3. Lay people being able to safely handle cryptographic keys is an unrealistic assumption.So IMHO, perfect 0-data is not going to happen. It used to work earlier (pre-internet) because we had only one device, didn&#39;t  have a lot of media, and could carry floppy disks for the rare occasion.What I think would make a difference is: browser apps being able to do TCP/UDP (with safe-guards) and sandboxed local disk-access. This allows web apps to do things like SSH, and login to the vast storage infrastructure that already exists - such as GitHub. Data remains fully under your control and becomes portable. Git IMHO is a better path to where Solid wants to go.  Especially once SHA256 commit hashes land - to become your personal, consensus-less blockchain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the vast majority of users, isn&#39;t having solid export options enough, or even better than this? Your average non-techie isn&#39;t going to want to configure each app to get syncing with NextCloud or Dropbox working just right, they just want to perform a task with the app and move on with their lives, regardless of where the data lives. And with an export option, if the app dies, you&#39;ve still got your blog posts or pictures or drawings or whatever it is you were using the app for.I think being in this bubble of working in and thinking about tech 24/7 can often make us miss the point - these apps are just meant to be tools to do a task."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone from the dolt team is reading this, I&#39;d like to make an enquiry:At bugout.dev, we have an ongoing crawl of public GitHub. We just created a dataset of code snippets crawled from popular GitHub repositories, listed by language, license, github repo, and commit hash and are looking to release it publicly and keep it up-to-date with our GitHub crawl.The dataset for a single crawl comes in at about 60GB. We uploaded the data to Kaggle because we thought it would be a good place for people to work with the data. Unfortunately, the Kaggle notebook experience is not tailored to such large datasets. Our dataset is in a SQLite database. It takes a long time for the dataset to load into Kaggle notebooks, and I don&#39;t think they are provisioned with SSDs as queries take a long time. Our best workaround to this is to partition into 3 datasets on Kaggle - train, eval, and development, but it will be a pain to manage this for every update, especially as we enrich the dataset with results of static analysis, etc.I&#39;d like to explore hosting the public dataset on Dolthub.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wordpress would have benefited from this.What a lot of webmasters want is, test the site locally, then merge it back. A lot of people turned to Jekyll or Hugo for the very reason that it can be checked into git, and git is reliable. A static website can’t get hacked, whereas anyone who has been burnt with Wordpress security fail knows they’d prefer a static site.And even more: People would like to pass the new website from the designer to the customer to managers — Wordpress might have not needed to develop their approval workflows (permission schemes, draft/preview/publish) if they had had a forkable database."</p>

While I game a lot and have been for over 20 years I never played anything on my phone (PC gaming only) so I was pretty shocked at the state of the industry. They have meetings about making the game more addictive, taking away any chance to get ahead in the game by skill or grind so you must spend, targeting vulnerable groups, making it hard to see how much you actually spent in the game.To have these people paint themselves as oppressed and offended... is exactly what I&#39;ve come to expect after every online social justice controversy I&#39;ve witnessed so far.And I know exactly how they would respond to me: What do you mean by &#34;these people&#34; you *ist!"</p>

I have very different viewpoints than even myself a few years ago. I imagine a completely different person in a different city or country would disagree with at least some of them. And you know what? I am okay with that.I don&#39;t like this fake-wokism SV monoculture creeping into everything. I wouldn&#39;t mind them sharing their opinions on things if they didn&#39;t have teeth.

We end up with a system that punishes people following the rules and doesn’t do anything about the many people breaking the rules.  It also creates the sense of unfairness and general lawlessness — that laws are recommendations that can mostly be ignored."</p>

They were already banned in that town, but it was never enforced.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rackauckas has done a lot of work to create the whole scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem (with collaborators).Symbolics.jl is the new step to a universal CAS tool in Julia to bridge the gap between symbolic manipulation and numerical computationIt is especially useful as a foundation for equation-based simulation package ModelingToolkit.jl. In the foreseeable future, I expect ModelingToolkit.jl can be comparable with the Modelica ecosystem to provide fast, accurate modeling and simulation capability and easy integration with machine learning methods for Julia ecosystem, which is crucial for engineering application and scientific research."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very cool. Computer Algebra Systems are like a super power. I’ve been able to use the TI-89’s arbitrary precision to do pretty sophisticated cryptography work. Symbolics.jl has the ability to modify some of the rules of the algebra, which should allow even easier implementation of number theory related cryptographic concepts (as well as compression and error correcting codes... or quaternions or bra-ket quantum mechanics) without needing specific libraries. I love this as I’m trying to teach myself the fundamental concepts in mathematical terms and not just something in a specialized black box library. (And without paying the insanely high price of Mathematica if I ever want to use it professionally.)I’ve looked briefly into Julia in the past, but if stuff like this becomes pretty standard (in the way numpy is for Python), I think I could become pretty comfortable in Julia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"CASes are one of the most difficult things to write and they’re never complete. There are always bugs, performance concerns, anemic mathematical domains, etc. Every major free or commercial CAS that’s still in use is under active development to battle these inadequacies. Dozens of CASes have come and gone in the past 30 years, the majority of which have bitrotted or stopped being maintained. And not a single CAS has reigned supreme as the CAS that beats all CASes.It’s very exciting to see more work in CASes being done, but I worry that “starting a CAS from scratch” isn’t the right approach. The Axiom [0, 1] project rightly identified that building a general-purpose CAS for working practitioners of computational mathematics is an effort requiring nearly generational timespans [2], and that you must have the right language to describe mathematical objects and their relationships. They had a literate programming policy, where all math code must be accompanied by publication-quality documentation, precisely because it’s so hard to build and maintain these systems. Some of the greatest computational discoveries and expositions came out of the development of Axiom, like the richest and most complete implementation of the renowned Risch algorithm for doing symbolic integrals.Axiom fell into disuse for a variety of reasons, but from my perspective, found new life in a fork called FriCAS [3, 4], which is actively developed and allows a more “software engineer friendly” approach to the development of the system. The code they have is enormously complex and has mountains of knowledge from foremost experts in computer algebra.I really wish new computer algebra initiatives attempted in earnest to make use of and extend Axiom/FriCAS so that we could continue to build up our knowledge of this exceedingly delicate and tricky subject without constantly starting from zero. Axiom has a manual that is over 1,000 pages of dense mathematics and that’s really hard to rebuild correctly.(The only project I know who honestly tried to build upon and subsequently extend CAS functionality is Sage [5], which builds upon a plethora of existing open source general-purpose and specialized computational math systems.)[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_(computer_algebra_syst...[1] http://www.axiom-developer.org/[2] Quote from Axiom manual (http://fricas.sourceforge.net/doc/book.pdf):&gt; With that in mind I’ve introduced the theme of the “30 year horizon”. We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains? How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians? The “30 year horizon” is much nearer than it appears.[3] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriCAS[4] http://fricas.sourceforge.net/[5] https://www.sagemath.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, WebGPU support is really cool. Graphics is usually an afterthought in programming language runtimes, which is crazy when you consider that most devices these days have a GPU which is physically larger and has far more raw compute power than the CPU.I understand why. The extremely proprietary and platform specific nature of graphics APIs and hardware makes it hard. WebGPU is a good choice for portability."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was curious about how `Deno.permissions` prevents things like &#34;requesting the permissions, then clearing the screen and asking to press &#39;g&#39;&#34;. Apparently, `Deno.permissions.request()` just stops program execution waiting for user response, so it&#39;s impossible to do anything after this call.
It also seems to reset text color, so it&#39;s impossible to make text invisible.
iTerm custom escape sequences allows program to change color profile on the fly. Setting bg and fg to the same value hides Deno messages and allows someone to conceal which permissions are being granted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I LOVE Proton. About 85% of my Windows games just... work. And probably 75% of the 15% that fail initially only require a little tweaking to make work.My only complaints are that steam uses arbitrary numbers instead of human readable labels for emulated AppData folders. It can be time consuming to locate a save game file. Also Streaming cross platform isn&#39;t a pleasant experience yet but it&#39;s getting better and I really appreciate the feature. My final gripe is that when adding media to a Steam chat on Linux the file open dialog does not cache the last folder you visited and doesn&#39;t support multiple files. This compounds the first problem I listed making it EXTREMELY time consuming to share multiple game files with friends quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proton is the reason I moved from a Windows + MacOS machine to GNU/Linux full time. I understand the concern that some hardcore enthusiasts might have about it making devs lazy when it comes to developing native ports but to be honest I don&#39;t care. I am just glad to have a simple method of gaming on GNU/Linux. Proton plus Lutris and the slew other tools that have come out in recent years has made the transition to GNU/Linux very easy and has opened the door for many who were curious but scared of the learning curb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proton is neat for sure, but unfortunately modern anti-cheat solutions expect Windows and will not allow Linux clients to connect. There&#39;s also a few games that I expected to work but simply won&#39;t launch for me, like Elder Scrolls Online.I&#39;m a fan of the Linux desktop, but for me the easiest solution is to have a dedicated Linux PC (right now an XPS 13 Developer) and a Windows machine for playing video games. I don&#39;t have the patience to troubleshoot getting games to run or perform well anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have deep aversion to &#34;Open source projects should run office hours&#34; title.Maybe &#34;Office hours may be a good idea for open source projects&#34;? This would not suggest obligation.In general, fact that someone created or maintains or supports open source projects should not be considered to create any obligations beyond lack of malice and abuse.I am not obligated to support any bugs, create any features and it is perfectly fine to delete all my repos at any time (unless I declared otherwise).I am also not obligated to support anything, help with anything, there is no guarantee of uptime, office hours, resolving issues or anything else.If you want obligations, guarantees or anything like that - feel free to hire a given developer.Many such things are good ideas and some people may decide to promise them (if you describe something as secure then you declared to handle security issues timely). But I reject idea of being obligated to do any of above."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of the comments are concluding from the title that open source maintainers should be working on the projects during office hours.That is not what the article is suggesting.From the article -&gt;&gt;  anyone can book a 25 minute conversation with me on a Friday to talk about the project. I’m interested in talking to people who are using Datasette, or who are considering using it, or who just want to have a chat.&gt;&gt;A challenge of open source is that it’s easy to be starved of feedback. People might file bug reports if something breaks, but other than that it can feel like publishing software into a void.&gt;&gt; Hearing directly from people who are using your stuff is incredibly motivational. It’s also an amazing source of ideas and feedback on where the project should go next.I think that&#39;s really a fantastic suggestion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had massive success with this in ML. My twitter DMs have become almost-daily office hour sessions with people trying to solve hard ML problems. The last fellow was so happy he venmo&#39;d me $250 after I merely asked for &#34;pay whatever you thought that was worth.&#34;Apparently putting &#34;DMs open&#34; in your twitter bio is an excellent way to meet new people. Also, tweet (often!) about what you&#39;re working on. Post lots of questions, notes to self, and screenshots or videos.To get followers, you&#39;ll need to go inject yourself into conversations. That seems to be the most reliable way to get noticed.We also run an ML discord server and do informal office hours for people working on various ML products. It may sound cheesy, but I try to emulate what pg would do in a YC office hours session. It seems to keep them pretty focused.So, yes! Glad to see office hours are becoming mainstream. Try it out; you&#39;ll probably be surprised."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve got some information on the timeline (and a name) on one of the major exploits here:https://proxylogon.com/Some of the detail on where this is a mess -The relevant security update is only offered for the latest (-1) Cumulative Update for Exchange. So you can open Windows Update and it will say &#34;fully updated and secured&#34;, but you&#39;re not. Complicating matters, Cumulative Updates for Exchange 2019 have to be done from the licensing portal, with a valid logon.So maybe you have a perfectly capable 24x7 tech team, but the guy who manages license acquisition is on leave today. This is how you may basically find yourself resorting to piracy to get this patched."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are seriously looking at strategies for clean room rebuild of our IT infrastructure, potentially on a recurring basis via automation.Obviously, you cant mitigate 0-day exploits in any situation where reasonable/expected network access is possible. But our concern, despite not being directly impacted by this, is that we may have accumulated malware over the past decade+ that has never been discovered. How many exploits exist in the wild which have never been documented or even noticed? Do we think it&#39;s at least one?The thinking we are getting into is - If we nuke-from-orbit and then reseed from trusted backups on a recurring basis, any malware that gets installed via some side-channel would not be able to persist for as long as it traditionally would. Keeping backups pure via deterministic cryptographic schemes is far easier to work with than running 100+ security suites across your IT stack in hopes you find something naughty. It is incredibly hard for malware to hide in a well-normalized SQL database without SP or other programmatic features.What if we built a new IT stack that was designed to be obliterated and reconstructed every 24 hours with latest patch builds each time? Surely many businesses could tolerate 1-2 hours of downtime overnight. It certainly works for the stock market. There really isn&#39;t a reason you need to give an attacker a well-managed private island to hide on for 10+ years at a time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bigger picture, what&#39;s the endgame here?  It seems a lot of institutions handling sensitive work are considering air-gapping some or all of their networks at this point.  Maybe that&#39;s even what has to happen.Is there a means of fending off these attacks on the political front?  If this same level of espionage was happening in person, there would be a kinetic response but it seems everyone is happy to just turn the other cheek.These attacks have a very real impact.  Copying others homework is a tried and true way to get a technological edge and in practical terms, it means a lot of research and development money is effectively wasted as it doesn&#39;t generate any returns.Mind, I don&#39;t think there should be a violent response, but it&#39;s odd that even the threat of sanctions isn&#39;t made whenever this happens."</p>

So, if someone writes an app like Google Docs, they can&#39;t just store the data opaquely on their own cloud servers. They legally have to integrate with a separate storage provider. And that storage provider has an obligation to make my data accessible and manageable by me.This wouldn&#39;t be a panacea, but it at least makes it theoretically possible to write a replacement client for Google Docs that could be a drop-in replacement."</p>

They were already gifted many billions of dollars in the past for this same basic purpose but they pocketed the money.  They can just use the free money they&#39;ve already been given.  Instead, the funding should go to existing munipical fiber ISPs to expand their coverage.  Give money to people with a proven track record of doing what you want, not people with a proven track record of keeping the money for themselves.I&#39;m on municipal fiber and it&#39;s amazing."</p>

There is no technological reason for these caps. For wireless, they could be defended by arguing that companies only get to use so much spectrum because of FCC laws.

[...] the FCC defines [...] Alternatively, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines&#34; why is this the federal government&#39;s job again? the internet is clearly not an enumerated power. is this the interstate commerce clause that keeps on giving in action again? i think decentralizing federal power would help alleviate a lot of the existential dread vis a vi corruption that many americans are feeling.all in all, this reeks of regulatory capture to me. if we&#39;re gonna have a serious discussion about internet infrastructure, i think the starting point is how we classify ISPs and where in the city-state-federal hierarchy the responsibility lies. changing a 25 to a 100 is a cool bullet on a resume, but i dont think this is the low handing fruit here.[0]https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just don&#39;t get it why developers like Scrum.
The whole thing was designed to give non-technical people more power over the ones who spent a lifetime honing their craftmanship. Standing around a table in the morning like assholes is not my idea of fun. Same for the &#34;product owner&#34; concept. If I develop something, I am the owner. I generally hate being micromanaged and being assigned microtasks that gives &#34;them&#34; total control over my workday while I have no idea what &#34;they&#34; are doing the whole day. 
Scrum was the reason why I left my last company and I&#39;m much happier now in my new company, where we do not have any process at all, just a common goal. Instead of standups, the team gathers for a coffee in the morning. If I want to spend 3 days learning a new framework that might do the product good, nobody cares. The only thing that counts is the endresult. That means we are beating the product into submission until its good, even if it means rewriting the thing three times and missing deadlines.
So no more Scrum for me. Never."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think you need to separate Agile from Scrum to be honest.Agile is at is core just some suggestions for teams to work well together. There are no stand ups or sprints or whatever.Scrum was created by one of the creators of the agile manifesto as a way to see consulting/training around the &#39;Agile&#39; idea (timeframes may differ a bit, but they were linked). There is an interview/article by one of the creators of the agile manifesto (Kent Beck maybe?, will try to dig it up and edit the answer if I find -&gt; was Robert C. Martin, see below) where he explains a bit the story and compares it to Agile (and basically says scrum has nothing to do with the original agile manifesto)On a personal level, I hate scrum. The stand ups, the sprints, the retros or grooming or whatever they have nowadays. It is literally one of the first questions I ask in an interview about their processes and excuse myself from the process if I see if they follow it. It may work for others, but for me personally, I hate it with a fervour.Though I agree with the Agile manifesto though, unfortunately it isn&#39;t very &#39;manager&#39; friendly so you usually get scrum instead.Edit: link to a reference to the article, can&#39;t find the original but found this: https://www.aaron-gray.com/a-criticism-of-scrum/#scrum-strai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never felt like a stand-up with your manager-type-person present is ever net helpful. Stand-ups just implicitly become &#34;what did you do yesterday that justified 10% of your biweekly paycheck&#34; at some level, and people end up talking to the manager rather than to each other.I&#39;m sure some super special orgs out there can counteract this with their incredible non-toxic culture and such. Most cannot. Ones that explicitly think they can almost certainly actually cannot.If it&#39;s solely the IC&#39;s, I think that&#39;s where it can be good. People feel a lot more free to not say anything if they don&#39;t have any blockers and don&#39;t need to put anything to the team. It&#39;s much easier to get in-and-out and have a high-bandwidth discussion.I&#39;ve felt the most comfortable where we sat down once a week for an hour, went over the last week, and thought about the next. And we had an open-door policy (not literally/physically of course) if you ever needed to discuss blockers or put things to the team. &#34;Standups&#34; happened naturally, about once or twice as week, where people would accrete into a standup in the middle of our pod discussing something that was so interesting/relevant that it naturally drew us out of our offices.Maybe that was just the only time where we finally had the team and the process mesh on a natural level, and it doesn&#39;t prescribe this as &#34;the way to do it&#34; for anyone else. But damn did it work for us, for at least two years, before the org changed enough that our team didn&#39;t really exist as the same team anymore.One thing I have never enjoyed was the &#34;the big boss wants this project done ASAP, have standups every day to make sure it gets done as fast as possible&#34;. That and everything related to it was awful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who&#39;s just written about the &#34;small web&#34; [1], this warms my heart. The lite version is probably a little too bare-bones for most people&#39;s tastes, but it sure is tiny -- great for people on very slow or flakey connections. Some numbers:HTML homepage transfers 34KB (94KB uncompressed) over 6 requests. HTML search results page transfers 133KB (248KB uncompressed) over 31 requests.Lite homepage transfers 13KB (11KB uncompressed, ha) over 4 requests. Lite search results page transfers 21KB (43KB uncompressed) over 5 requests.In all cases, all requests are to *.duckduckgo.com, which was very good to see from a privacy perspective. Nice work, DDG![1] https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Up until not long ago, Google search result pages worked well without JS, and if you sent a suitably old UA header, you&#39;d get the &#34;original&#34; version without mangled URLs or any of the other bloat. Then in 2019 or so, in what I consider to be an extremely hostile move, they started redirecting (using meta tags) to a horrible dumbed-down mobile-ish version and using styles-removed-by-JS to &#34;hide&#34; the actual content of the &#34;full&#34; version (which has the &#34;modern&#34; mangled URLs) if you managed to reach it anyway, so all you&#39;d see was a blank page. It&#39;s almost like they were deliberately trying to make something that only worked in the latest version of Chrome or whatever few other &#34;modern&#34; browsers exist today, and decided to force non-JS users to a worse experience than they had had for the past decade or more. Nothing a filtering proxy can&#39;t fix (and I brought back true URLs at the same time), but I was absolutely incensed when that happened.I don&#39;t think a search engine should ever require JS to be usable. The existence of search engines[1] predates the existence of JS, and of course the HTML mechanism of form submission and displaying a list of links predates both of those.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JumpStation"</p>

At first glance, this seems like probably the best Electron alternative I&#39;ve seen posted on HN.Apart from the consistent GUI layer, I think an underrated reason that many teams stick with Electron is the mature tooling for cross-platform builds and upgrades. It&#39;s pretty painful to DIY.It looks like NodeGUI doesn&#39;t currently support cross-compilation--is that something that&#39;s on the roadmap? How about upgrade/auto-upgrade tooling?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some problems that Fukushima had: 1950s vintage design, active cooling system, backup power at sea level in a seismically active area.  This kind of failure was not just predictable, it was predicted.People travel to Japan from around the world to learn how to build earthquake resistant structures.  Their nuclear engineers are top-notch.  It was the bureaucracy that failed, not the talent.In short, the problems were human not technical.  People get complacent and greedy.  They use every procedural tool they have to delay upgrades, maintenance, and improvement.  I think that is at the core of most nuclear skepticism.  Does anyone honestly think the United States has institutions sound enough to safely manage nuclear power over multiple decades?  Or will they neglect basic maintenance and upgrades?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The key thing to remember is that power sources like coal and other fossil fuels have a very real health cost. A large number of people die every year. However a nuclear accident is much more &#34;exciting&#34; news and sticks in people&#39;s mind. People dying of cancer, asthma and other conditions are not as direct or as dramatic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real trouble with the light water reactor is not the nuclear part but the steam turbine it is attached to.Unfortunately people have a way of driving while looking in the rear view mirror and much of the discussion around nuclear energy revolves around issues of the 1970s.In the 1970s coal burning power plants were the cost king of power plants.  There was some concern about making them cleaner,  but by the 1980s gas turbine power plants with 10 times the power density (e.g. 1/10 the capital cost)  were becoming widespread and people quit building coal plants.(A big literature got left behind about how to drive a gas turbine from coal,  on paper it would be lower capital cost than a conventional coal plant,  but the technology never got developed at full scale.)Even if the heat was free it would be hard for a steam turbine based power plant to compete with gas turbines.Now it should be possible to build a nuclear power plant based on the brayton cycle using helium or carbon dioxide or some similar gas as a working fluid.  You then need to use helium or sodium or lead as a coolant because the pressure would be too high with water.Fast reactors are the best developed option,  followed by the prismatic HTGR,  then the thorium reactors.  Pebble-bed HTGR looked pretty good until an expose came out that a German pebble bed reactor had a difficult time...  Turns out pebbles that slide past each other just fine in air will get stuck on each other and crack in helium.When Bill Gates and others go around saying we have to get over the safety issue they are continuing the stigma.  Nuclear power is not going to get out of it&#39;s funk unless it has a cost story that looks good when everything goes right -- which is not the case with the LWR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d add to this list:Chunk extensions. Most people know HTTP/1.1 can return a &#34;chunked&#34; response body: it breaks the body up into chunks, so that we can send a response whose length we don&#39;t know in advance, but also it allows us to keep the connection open after we&#39;re done. What most people don&#39;t know is that chunks can carry key-value metadata. The spec technically requires an implementation to at least parse them, though I think it is permitted to ignore them. I&#39;ve never seen anything ever use this, and I hope that never changes. They&#39;re gone in HTTP/2. (So, also, if you thought HTTP/2 was backwards compatible: not technically!)The &#34;Authorization&#34; header: like &#34;Referer&#34;, this header is misspelled. (It should be spelled, &#34;Authentication&#34;.) Same applies to &#34;401 Unauthorized&#34;, which really ought to be &#34;401 Unauthenticated&#34;. (&#34;Unauthorized&#34; is &#34;403 Forbidden&#34;, or sometimes &#34;404 Not Found&#34;.)Also, header values. They&#39;re basically require implementing a custom string type to handle correctly; they&#39;re a baroque mix of characters &amp; &#34;opaque octets&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been searching for a while for a good way to know whether a client has disconnected in the middle of a long-running HTTP request. (We do heavyweight SQL queries of indeterminate length in response to those requests, and we&#39;d like to be able to cancel them, rather than wasting DB-server CPU cycles calculating reports nobody&#39;s going to consume.)You can&#39;t actually know whether the outgoing side of a TCP socket is closed, unless you write something to it. But it&#39;s hard to come up with something to write to an HTTP/1.1-over-TCP socket before you respond with anything, that would be a valid NOP according to all the protocol layers in play. (TCP keepalives would be perfect for this... if routers didn&#39;t silently drop them.)But I guess sending an HTTP 102 every second or two could be used for exactly this: prodding the socket with something that middleboxes will be sure to pass back to the client.If so, that&#39;s awesome! ...and also something I wish could be handled for me automatically by web frameworks, because getting that working sounds kind of ridiculous :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another thing to note about custom headers is that when used in an XHR (eg: X-Requested-With), they will force a preflight request (with the OPTIONS method). If your webserver isn&#39;t configured to handle OPTIONS and return the correct CORS headers, that will effectively break clients.Best to just never use custom headers.I&#39;ve written more about this here: https://developer.akamai.com/blog/2015/08/17/solving-options..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To respond to some of the comments.It is not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with these functions. You can technically use all of them and I have been using all of them, safely, for decades.The issue is they are huge traps to the point that in a larger piece of software one can say &#34;well, it&#39;s just not worth it&#34;.You can go much, much, much further than that.In couple embedded projects I worked some of the rules were:* dynamic allocation after application has started is banned -- any heap buffers and data structures must be allocated at the start of the application and after that any allocation is a compile time error,* any constructs that would prevent statically calculating stack usage were banned (for example any form of recursion except when exact recursion depth is ensured statically),* any locks were banned,* absolutely every data structure must have size ensured, in a simple way, beyond any reasonable doubt,etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be nice if the error messages generated would suggest replacement functions that they deem appropriate.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s an anecdote about what happens when you design a product in the opposite way.I own https://www.executeprogram.com, which has interactive in-browser courses on various software development technologies. Currently they all cover languages, more or less: TypeScript, SQL, various JS topics, regexes. (Disclosure: it costs money after you finish your 16th lesson.)Almost all (maybe literally all) of our competitors are amenable to binging. It&#39;s true of books, video learning platforms, and most/all other interactive learning platforms.Execute Program is very intentionally non-bingeable. When you start a course, you get 5 lessons on the first day, then it stops you and tells you to come back tomorrow. On the next day, you get some brief reviews of yesterday&#39;s lessons, then a few new lessons, then it stops you again until the next day. That cadence repeats until you finish the course. You can&#39;t binge/cram even if you want to.(A bit more technical detail: it&#39;s a spaced repetition system with exponential review intervals, similar to those used for language learning in e.g. WaniKani and Anki. But it also has a lot of fine-grained knowledge of its own course structure, so it can use reviews to intelligently unlock different lessons depending on how the user performed on their reviews.)Occasionally, we get support email from new users who don&#39;t like this. They want to cram a whole course in a day. But cramming is a very time-inefficient way to learn, so this is self-defeating! Since launch, we&#39;ve had good success adjusting the app&#39;s behavior and internal explanations to reduce these complaints.However, we still get emails from long-term users who appreciate the time limitations. Generally these fall into two categories:1. Users like that an enforced break before the reviews provides tangible evidence that &#34;yes, I genuinely understood yesterday&#39;s lessons&#34;. If we allowed cramming, that reassurance wouldn&#39;t exist; it&#39;s too easy to succeed at a review when you just finished the lesson 30 seconds ago.2. Users like that the usage limits remove a source of anxiety and worry. You do your reviews and lessons, you finish, and then you wait until tomorrow. There&#39;s no temptation to think &#34;I really should&#39;ve done 10 lessons today instead of 5; I&#39;m so lazy&#34;.It&#39;s still possible for a very dedicated user to do all of our courses in parallel within their first monthly billing cycle. (Median course start-to-finish time is 8-18 days depending on the course.) So this scheme doesn&#39;t make users pay us more than they would otherwise. And they&#39;re spending the same amount of wall-clock time that they&#39;d spend if they crammed all of the lessons in one day. That makes it pure win: they memorize the topics more deeply, they worry less, and they get those benefits for no extra time expenditure. The only exception I can think of would be people who think &#34;I must get exposure to all TypeScript syntax and semantics before tomorrow morning, even if that significantly reduces my ability to remember what I learned.&#34;Obviously I&#39;m very biased here, and the goals that we&#39;re optimizing for don&#39;t even exist in most other product spaces. But I thought it would be nice to have a counterexample to &#34;engagement at all costs&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like the current trend of social media apps burying users under push notifications, calls to action, and other engagement hooks.However, there&#39;s a second, parallel problem adding fuel to the fire: The more we talk about overindulgence in social media (or Netflix, or video games, or fast food) as an act perpetrated by evil corporations on us helpless individuals, the less sense of individual agency we give ourselves. I&#39;m not suggesting that we let social media companies off the hook, but battling this problem is going to require more than simply shaming them in Medium posts. We have to start reminding people that they are in control of their decisions, and that they can take steps to reduce their social media usage to healthy levels.I know the common refrain is &#34;Delete Facebook!&#34; but that&#39;s the equivalent of abstinence-only education. We need to start talking about how to configure Screen Time on iOS, or how to use Facebook&#39;s built-in tools to hide content you don&#39;t want to see. We also need to encourage people to take control of their feeds, muting users and topics who draw them into unproductive discussions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A tangential point about the horrifying power of euphemism: I&#39;ve done some consulting work with some large biopharmaceutical companies in the past and found myself consistently shocked at how effective euphemism was at making people comfortable talking about, and doing, very questionable things. E.g. &#34;Maximizing treatment&#34; = &#34;extend how long a patient requires our medication&#34;. This was at a senior level and these were, on the face of it, warm, caring people having a very comfortable and open conversation. I had always assumed decisions that directly disadvantaged the consumer would look different, with some sense of secrecy or at least awareness. Nope, one level of language abstraction is apparently all it takes.There are countless other examples out there. I just finished &#34;Cruel Britannia&#34; regarding the torture practices of the British over the last century. They were particularly adept at it. Euphemism is such a powerful tool for doublethink and systemic abuses of power."</p>

Or maybe it does - the website is terrible to navigate, slow and I got 404s off their main internet landing page.Anyhow at the risk of this turning into a multi page rant about comcast I&#39;ll cut back to upload speed. I see it as upload is for creation and download is for consumption. What do the cable companies want people to be doing?If you look at the popularity of twitch/youtube/(things I&#39;m too old and unhip to know about) it is a direct threat to cable/traditional content creation. I&#39;d wager the current state of affairs holds a lot of people back from getting into content creation, especially poorer/larger families who have to share a limited connection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My local broadband provider admitted to me that they could offer symmetric 1 gig service, but are choosing not to.  The current max a residential customer can purchase is 1 gig down, 25Mbs up.  The monthly non-discount rate is $180, with $110/month possible with certain promotions.  It is an extra 10$/month to go from 20Mbs up to 25Mbs.  Starlink is doing well here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in South Africa. Myself and all my friends are sitting on around 100 Mbps up/down uncapped unshaped, no fair use policy each at around $100 USD monthly. A few of my friends are on Gigabit down, 200 up.How is America behind on this? Everything is hosted there and cached there. Is it big business lobbying politicians to prevent them from having to compete? In South Africa we have dozens on ISPs and as an economy we&#39;re probably not far off from one US state. The competition has been great for consumers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my pet meta-theories about Hacker News is that the frustration expressed over several apparently different stories really has a single source: Hacker News likes the internet of 10-20 years ago a lot more than the average person.One place this shows up is a frequently-expressed sentiment that the internet is a less magical, less weird, and more corporate place than it was 10-20 years ago. Part of this may be because SEO has diluted the voices of individual creators. But part of it is also because way more average, everyday, tech-unsavvy people are on the internet now.Another example is the periodic highlighting of somewhat garish HTML-based websites. I like these too! My own personal website falls in this category! But as far as I know, the generic internet user likes the generic slick-graphics-and-whitespace style, and so go the websites that want to attract them.More relevant to the topic at hand, many comments in this thread argue that targeted ads are unnecessary for a functional internet, since the internet of 20 years ago seemed to work just fine without targeted ads. But, again, it&#39;s less clear to me that general internet users -- that is, mostly people who never experienced the internet of 20 years ago -- have the same preference.It&#39;s funny, because I&#39;m to a large extent on HN&#39;s side on this one. But my enthusiasm is tempered by my sneaking suspicion that the other side is a lot bigger, and my side is actually powered by more elitism and nostalgia than I thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This captures my feelings on the issue:&gt; That framing is based on a false premise that we have to choose between “old tracking” and “new tracking.” It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads.I don&#39;t want to be tracked. I never have wanted to be tracked. I shouldn&#39;t have to aggressively opt-out of tracking; it should be a service one must opt-in to receive. And it&#39;s not something we can trust industry to correct properly. This is precisely the role that privacy-protecting legislation should be undertaking.Stop spying on us, please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly why we&#39;re building EthicalAds. It&#39;s an ad network that only targets based on the content of sites, doesn&#39;t allow any third-party media, and is currently only focused on a developer audience: https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/We had the same choice on Read the Docs, but didn&#39;t really have any other way to make money but advertising.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As dis-heartening as this story is, compared to a couple of years ago, it is encouraging to see lots of comments from people beginning to wake up to what is going on with this craziness and not being modded here.Free speech is about protecting the right of the un-popular and views that some may find utterly repugnant. Why? because, as we are seeing with all of the woke craziness, when you don&#39;t stand up for everyones ability (including views you do not like) to freely speak, the censorship will end up being turned against you.The key things with all of this, is that if enough people were to collectively have the courage to push back against this craziness it would stop...people recognizing that there is a problem is a good first step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know any culture that banned books independent of their content that people didn&#39;t regret in the future.A few months ago I was reading about schools banning the book &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; because it contains basically the &#34;n&#34; word. I&#39;m not american, and and havent read that book. I watched the movie, through, and it seemed to me to be a very anti racism message.I think instead of banning, schools should work provide  context to kids and teens that read this books, of how society was when they where written, so people don&#39;t forget the past, but are able to make better decisions to the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t be certain, but I suspect the real problem was that the original contract was signed without requiring the technical data rights and/or delivery of the technical data. This is a common mistake made by the DoD, and can lead to extraordinarily high costs later.Just look at the notice: &#34;The deliverables will include all technical data related to the heat exchanger disassembly, all technical data related to the cores, all technical data related to the stack up, vacuum brazing, and installation of the cores on existing units. The deliverables will also include all technical data related to the tooling needed...&#34; It&#39;s clear they don&#39;t have the technical data.Here&#39;s how this can happen: the government asks for proposals, and the prospective contractors say &#34;we&#39;ll create it for you for cheaper if you don&#39;t require the technical data &amp; its related rights&#34;. The government program manager (PM) is under a lot of pressure to &#34;get it cheaper&#34;, and this is cheaper in the short term, so the government PM agrees. The PM will be around for a few years, then leave. Later on, the contractor is the only one who can make the parts (because they&#39;re the only ones with the technical data &amp; the technical data rights to do it). The government procurement system is all about competition, but now there is no possibility for real competition. Thus, the parts will cost 10x or more, and the government PM who approved this is long gone (probably with a promotion), and the contractor is happy with incredibly large profit margins.I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what happened in this case. But it&#39;s very very possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reverse engineering seems like a good skillset for the DoD to nurture, anyway. Yes, the US is going to be at the cutting edge of weapons design at least through the medium term, but the leadership isn&#39;t arrogant enough to think that all engineering innovations will come domestically. If the US acquired a next-generation Chinese fighter, wouldn&#39;t it be handy if someone had the expertise to tell you exactly how its parts were made and machine replicas if needed?So, the tinfoil hat interpretation of this story would be, of course the Pentagon has the original blueprints in quintuplicate, but it&#39;s identified reverse engineering as a key strategic advantage China has over the US (pretty reasonable so far, right?) and has announced this as a way to shuffle some money into building up domestic RE expertise in the defence industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US nuclear weapons program had to do something similar in the 2000&#39;s with a material known as Fogbank. This is used in the W76 warhead as an interstage material, and they needed more of it to keep the weapons in operational state.Unfortunately, they&#39;d forgotten the manufacturing process, decommissioned the plant that made it, and the people that knew how to do it weren&#39;t around any more. They figured it out, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily look easy to do (nor does the material seem easy at all to make in the first place).https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/201814/fogbank/p20 here says more: https://www.lanl.gov/science/weapons_journal/wj_pubs/17nwj2_...Edit: I somehow missed this other thread in this story, despite a search: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26334367"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Your whole blog resonates deeply with me. All this corporate grifting and women&#39;s empowerment months will do jack shit until we figure out how to make workplaces and lives more equitable for mothers and allowing for gaps, breaks and destigmatizing time off for parents of both genders.Instead, we talk about how sexism is the biggest problem. Sure, sexism might be annoying, but in the west, it is hardly something that creates a genuine barrier for women.Startups have it worst, and everday I count the number of years I have to work in the high stress places I want or do a startup if I want to have two kids before 35. No one talks about planning around fertility. When I mention it to someone that I want to take time off for a couple years to have children in silicon valley, they look at me as if I&#39;m an alien. As if wanting to be pregnant and not working at the same time as being sleep deprived and wanting to spend time with my own baby when they are at their youngest is some strange outlandish fantasy.All careers are built this way. PhD to tenure, startups, generally high stress professions. I wish the world wasn&#39;t so male centric, that feminists actually cared about finding structural solutions instead of forcing women to become copies of men to achieve gender parity. But they care more about power than actual equality where we acknowledge that women have different needs and desires, that those needs and desires are equally valuable and not inferior to desires men have, that the two genders have different strengths and capabilities and it is equally important to reward both. And maybe not wanting to outsource your baby to a nanny during their most vulnerable years is not a heretical thought.I wish we had more focus in allowing people to transition back from taking a few years off to raise young kids, and it wasn&#39;t automatically assumed that you would be a worse founder or professor or software engineer just because you have 2-4 years you didn&#39;t commercially work. Hell, I want to take that time to contribute to open source, something I don&#39;t get to do much usually and I&#39;m looking forward to it because I am willing to face the  consequences. But I wish more women could be less scared of their career prospects for choosing to have children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree completely with the premise that most people don&#39;t appreciate just how fleeting fertility can be, but I think rather than freezing eggs, the solution is for people to normalize having children at a younger age and designing work and home life around children existing and even being present in certain work contexts.Obviously freezing your eggs is something that you can do as individual without society&#39;s input, and my preferred solution is a cultural overhaul...But economic productivity is only useful insofar as it leads to better lives for people, economic activity that increases well-being by one unit is pointless if it requires us to spend more than one unit of well-being (by say, freezing our eggs and not becoming grandparents until we&#39;re 80) to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not so sure freezing eggs is sound advice.Lord Winston, who is professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, warned that it was &#34;a very unsuccessful technology&#34; and said: &#34;The number of eggs that actually result in a pregnancy after freezing is about 1%.&#34; He later clarified he was referring to live births.https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51463488#:~:text=Lord%20Wins....“It’s not like I would discourage egg freezing. Women should be doing it because it’s the best option they have, but it is not an insurance policy,” says Christos Coutifaris, past president of the ASRM and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania. “Insurance policies usually guarantee a payoff. In this case, there is no guarantee.”

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;The service will, eventually, be available as a paid option...&#34;How my viewpoint has shifted over the years. 10-20 years ago this would have instantly turned me off, but now this is the most exciting line in the entire thing to me. As long as we all expect free, we can&#39;t expect privacy.@Brave team, who I rather expect will be reading this, I can&#39;t believe that Cliqz doing tracking on me to improve its results for free will be in my interests if it&#39;s free. But if I&#39;m a paying customer, you might be able to convince me that you&#39;re doing some semi-invasive tracking but not actually selling it to anyone, because it wouldn&#39;t be worth losing me as a customer.I&#39;m actually excited about the idea of a search engine that I pay for. Been waiting for DDG to do it but last I knew there&#39;s still no option there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my understanding what Cliqz did, at least in the beginning, was to buy clickstream data and then build an index on top of that. So in a sense they just scraped Googles&#39; search index, as almost all users rely on Google for finding stuff on the web. The clickstream data gives you both the search query and the website(s) users visit after searching, so it&#39;s pretty easy to build a search index from that, at least for popular searches (it might be more difficult for the long tail of search queries).A lot of the clickstream data you can buy comes from browser extensions btw, and often gets collected without users knowing about it (looking at you, &#34;Web of Trust&#34;). I think their reliance on such data was the reason Cliqz acquired Ghostery, which also collects a copious amount of &#34;anonymous&#34; data from its users. On one hand it&#39;s a neat idea since you&#39;re basically standing on Googles&#39; shoulders, on the other hand it&#39;s at least questionable for a &#34;privacy-first&#34; company as the generation of the search index is based on personal data mined from (often unwitting) users.That said I don&#39;t know how their system evolved, so maybe today they have another way to build their index."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brave has a long way to go to build real trust. Too many reckless stuff: hijacking links, suspicious url-rewriting, crypto-token stunts, forgetting to communicate with users about serious privacy leaks with their faulty TOR window... also it looks like they care about privacy only in their PR brochures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Killing TurboTax&#34; is essentially a meme until we meaningfully simplify the tax code.There is no software development team on earth who could catch up with the full capabilities of TurboTax without some sort of fundamental shift in the business. I really hate to say this as someone who makes a living out of it, but dealing with the current amount of complexity in the tax code with a piece of software that a non-expert could use is virtually impossible.For the happy path (i.e. single individual, no dependents, no investments, no retirement, rents home), you could certainly build an application that handles these scenarios. The moment you factor in individuals who are bringing stock sales, multiple investment properties, ownerships/K1s and other complex scenarios to bear, its a different hellscape altogether.Also don&#39;t forget that most states have their own independent tax codes as well, which further complicate matters. There&#39;s difficulty multipliers all over this problem domain, and you can be certain that the lobbyists employed by Intuit, et. al. are encouraging this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sunde understands the value of propaganda, so it&#39;s fairly obvious he expected this outcome. He wanted to highlight the undemocratic and corrupt nature of one of the most critical parts of our global infrastructure, and he did it.Ironically, this was a better proof of transparency than what most &#34;problematic&#34; people would subject themselves to. If any vanilla oligarch wanted to be in those circles, he would just pay some squeaky-clean individual to be his stooge, and then make it known, after registration, who the real power is. Sunde could have configured himself as a freelance consultant to his friends, and he would not have appeared on any radar. This would have made his business work, but it would not have advanced the perennial conversation about ICANN&#39;s original sins, which have become more and more untolerable with the years.ICANN were pretty stupid to just veto his admission. That&#39;s not how you deal with institutional critics. They could have simply brought him in, then informally and formally vetoed anything he wanted to do. They have experience with people who tried to blow up things &#34;from inside&#34; in the past, so clearly they&#39;ve developed countermeasures ready for that scenario. Or they could have given him something, enough to behold him, so he&#39;d have an incentive to stay in the tent and piss outside rather than the other way around.This attitude proved Sunde is fundamentally right on the subject matter, like him or not as a person."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" &gt; They basically admitted that they don’t like me. They’ve banned me for nothing else than my political views. This is typical discrimination. Considering I have no one to appeal to except them, it’s concerning, since they control the actual fucking center of the internet.Next-level deplatforming. From a non-profit. That essential controls the internet. Yay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Over the phone, ICANN explained that the matter was discussed internally. This unnamed group of people concluded that the organization is ‘not comfortable’ doing business with him.It&#39;s the height of arrogance that they didn&#39;t even feel the need to come up with any better excuse, just this. And of course:&gt; ICANN will also keep the registration fee"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;re all complaining about how js is a bad language, tooling is a mess, and how the web is fundamentally built for documents and makes it hard to create app-like experiences. Now, Google comes and creates a whole new UI toolkit from scratch, couples it with a very beautiful SDK and component framework and offers a far better programming language than js could ever be but we&#39;re still nagging. I was also pretty disappointed with the demo at flutterfolio.com that is supposed to show how great Flutter 2.0 for the web is. It&#39;s not that good but it&#39;s gonna get there eventually, given the hype around wasm and &lt;canvas&gt; technologies. Not to mention that Flutter is already better and easier to use than the existing native tools for both Android and iOS. I believe Flutter is an extremely ambitious project and I appreciate that Google is really trying to give an answer to the problem of cross-platform UI development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Google Pay switched to Flutter a few months ago for their flagship mobile app, and they already achieved major gains in productivity and quality. By unifying the codebase, the team removed feature disparity between platforms and eliminated over half a million lines of code.from pay.google.com&gt; Starting April 5, you won&#39;t be able to use pay.google.com to send and receive money from other people. To send and receive money, use the new Google Pay app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently 5 months into developing a mobile app for a startup with flutter and my experience so far is very underwhelming.Flutter as a framework is not the worst but far from best, it&#39;s very OO while trying to use reacts vdom model which just wants to be functional.The biggest limitation of the platform is Dart - it&#39;s a horrible language that should have died once TS and ES6 became mature enough. And I&#39;ve used dart back when it was supposed to be a JS killer shipped with browsers, used dartium to build a MVP for an app using Angular Dart durgin the betas.Back then Dart was miles ahead in terms of tooling and JS the language didn&#39;t even have async/await - so I was singing it&#39;s praises. But the language stagnated and it&#39;s fundamentals with a nominal type system and a closed object model make the language so inflexible and full of boilerplate it&#39;s incredible. It&#39;s very much like Java (the language, without the powerful ecosystem) and people prefer Kotlin for frontend for a reason. C# is similar but they figured out that they need to build a lot of things in to the language to reduce the boilerplate so they are adding stuff like Records and pattern matching.If you look at state management patterns in flutter there&#39;s probably 5-10 competing approaches all lacking in their own way and all severely hampered by how unexpressive dart is. Or how you deal with serialisation/immutability/etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blog author here!  Thanks to HN for warning me about sscanf at exactly the right time – within a day of me trying to load some ASCII STLs and noticing it was slow...Linked deep in the Twitter replies [1], there&#39;s an open glibc issue about this, dating back to 2014:https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17577C doesn&#39;t have any requirements on the complexity of sscanf, so it might not be a bug per se, but it&#39;s certainly... a pitfall.[1] https://twitter.com/impraxical/status/1367194430835425283"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the really embarrassing part for Rockstar is that they didn&#39;t bother to investigate what took 5+ minutes to load in their star product, a simple profiling would&#39;ve made the issue obvious. So either they knew and they didn&#39;t care, or they didn&#39;t know and they didn&#39;t care.That being said both for GTA and for TFA the issue is a very similar sscanf call:     sscanf(data, &#34;%f&#34;, &amp;f);

I already posted a similar comment in the GTA story but I really want to emphasize it: scanf is almost never the right tool for the job, and it&#39;s definitely not the right tool in this situation. Just use strtof. That&#39;s literally what it&#39;s for. String to float. There. Done.Scanf is crappy and if it were up to me would&#39;ve been deprecated a while ago. I can sort of see using it for a quick one-off &#34;script&#34;, for instance to parse user input, but seeing it in the middle of a program will always raise a huge red flag for me.Use strtok_r if you need to split a string, then parse every entry individually. It&#39;s more robust, more flexible (you can parse custom types and formats that way) and allows for much better error handling and diagnostics. And of course it&#39;s also usually vastly faster.Scanf is an antipattern in my opinion. I literally never use it and I&#39;m better off for it. The last time I interviewed for a C coder position I managed to answer the full C test quizz except for the one question regarding scanf. That&#39;s how much I don&#39;t use it.I think it&#39;s even worse for developers who come from higher level languages and (reasonably) expect to be able to deserialize data easily. You simply can&#39;t do that in C, the type system and general philosophy of the language won&#39;t let you, but scanf may convey the illusion that it&#39;s sort of possible. Don&#39;t believe its lies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a small story, decades ago, about a company/univeristy which was left holding the bag when the government cancelled their contract. They were constructing a lens system to go into a satellite which could purportedly read the issue date on a dime lying on the sidewalk. It was something like $15M. The implication was that the government had found something even better, and gone with that instead. If Google is publicly giving up on a particular, unpopular technology to buy some PR, I strongly suspect that they&#39;ve already figured out something which will work &#34;better&#34; behind the scenes.There&#39;s a lot of confusion over what this story is actually saying, and, given the obscurity with which Google deals with it&#39;s tech, I don&#39;t think this is going to get cleared up, leaving room for a lot of speculation. But one thing is absolutely certain: There&#39;s no possible way that Google is going to make a change to their biggest money maker that would make them LESS money. Maybe that just means that they consider their duopoly enough of a barrier that advertisers will be forced to accept less-targeted marketing, but I doubt it..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the phrase “tracking individual people” is how Google is going to keep tracking you as well as they did before.With the announcement of federated learning of cohorts [0], it allows Google to use their massive amount of information they have on you already, as well as their dominance in AI to cut out the easy way of tracking people, and make it harder for anyone else to personalize ads.Don’t get me wrong it’s a good thing that we are removing third-party cookies, but the idea that Google is confident they can track you without them makes me worried for the future of advertising. This move is undoubtedly going to cement google as the best ad tracking company for some time into the future.[0]: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/24/google-extremely-confident-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope this gives rise to another, smaller viable party outside of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Perhaps I&#39;m jaded, perhaps hopelessly biased - but I can only see this as a net negative.Okta&#39;s open source packages receive a pitiful amount of attention (for example: https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%...) with forks almost becoming a requirement. Auth0 by contrast has been &#34;on the ball&#34; for a long time with their offerings. Okta&#39;s interfaces have been disjointed and inconsistent, confusing to users on a scale only surpassed by Jira, while Auth0&#39;s have always been pleasant to use from a user and developer perspective.From a personnel perspective, the two companies couldn&#39;t be more different, with Auth0 embracing a remote-first-class culture with creative interview processes, and Okta (pre-covid) being very much the opposite. I interviewed with both, and the process at Auth0 had me walk away with respect, while contrasted with Okta that left me reminded that tech hiring is broken.I&#39;ll hold my breath for a short time that Auth0 is allowed to operate independently. Sadly I feel it&#39;ll be inevitable that they&#39;re eventually swallowed up by the mothership."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate this. We moved from Okta a few years ago after we were basically received almost no actual real support for a bunch of issues, even though we were paying a premium cost. Nobody cares about issues on their Github, the kicker was a when we received a support response as suddenly something was no longer working after an update, we got help in the form of &#34;We have no plans to address this anytime soon.&#34; when asking for an ETA.We ended up switching to Auth0, after we had a few calls with them. We shaved a decent amount off our costs with Auth0&#39;s Enterprise plan, and their webtask based rules worked. While the migration sucked for a bit, in the end we were much happier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really not a fan of this.Okta as a business are a pain to deal with, and unless you meet their minimum spend requirements (which are not told to you up-front) you&#39;re screwed.I&#39;ve rolled out a ton of commercial products where we started with 1-2 users or a few units of compute, and on the basic little/no support options.When those products succeed, and we can demonstrate that not only does it meet our needs on paper, but it actually works, and whatever flaws that exist are not big enough to stop us wanting to use it more.AWS, Atlassian&#39;s Jira and Confluence, Sendgrid, Mailchip, Duo, and a bunch of others all started being used in orgs where this kind of thing is super low friction and easy to spin up, we plug in a credit card to get us off the ground.Okta? Well they&#39;ll tell you the pricing up-front, that&#39;s great - what they don&#39;t tell you is that after the trial period, you can&#39;t just give them a credit card, no you need to go through the sales process. It&#39;s not until you&#39;re talking to their salesperson that you find out you can&#39;t just start with a few licenses, no, you need to meet their minimum spend figure per month.Well, that idea was dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been trying out the latest master builds of pipewire recently and have been pretty impressed with it:* My bluetooth headset can now use the HFP profile with the mSBC codec (16 kHz sample rate) instead of the terrible CVSD codec (8 kHz sample rate) with the basic HSP profile.* Higher quality A2DP stereo codecs, like LDAC, also work.* AVDTP 1.3 delay reporting works (!!) to delay the video for perfect A/V sync.* DMA-BUF based screen recording works with OBS + obs-xdg-portal + pipewire (for 60fps game capture).For my use cases, the only things still missing are automatic switching between A2DP and HFP bluetooth profiles and support for AVRCP absolute volume (so that the OS changes the headset&#39;s hardware volume instead of having a separate software volume)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; including the raw Linux ALSA sound API, which typically allows only one application to access the sound card.If the raw in that sentence is not meant as a special qualifier and this is meant as a statement about ALSA in general, this is wrong. I recently read up on this to confirm my memory was right when reading a similar statement. In fact, ALSA had just a very short period where typically only one application accessed the sound card. After that, dmix was enabled by default. Supporting multiple applications was actually the big advantage of ALSA compared to OSS, which at the time really did support only one application per soundcard (without hardware mixing, which broke away at that time). I&#39;m not sure why this seems to be remembered so wrongly?&gt; Speaking of transitions, Fedora 8&#39;s own switch to PulseAudio in late 2007 was not a smooth one. Longtime Linux users still remember having the daemon branded as the software that will break your audio.This wasn&#39;t just a Fedora problem. Ubuntu when making the switch also broke Audio on countless of systems. I was active as supporter in a Ubuntu support forum at that time and we got flooded with help requests. My very own system did not work with Pulseaudio when I tried to switch, that was years later. I still use only ALSA because of that experience. At that time Pulseaudio was garbage, it should never have been used then. It only got acceptable later - but still has bugs and issues.That said, PipeWire has a better vibe than Pulseaudio did. It intends to replace a system that never worked flawlessly, seems to focus on compatibility, and the apparent endorsement from the JACK-developers also does not hurt. User reports I have seen so far have been positive, though I&#39;m not deep into support forums anymore. Maybe this can at least replace Pulseaudio, that would be a win. I&#39;m cautiously optimistic about this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just tried it on NixOS, had no idea it was so fleshed out already! Thought it&#39;d be full of bugs but was pleasantly surprised, it just worked. No issues with compatibility, extremely low latency and has JACK and PulseAudio shims, so everything works out of the box, including pro audio stuff like Reaper and Ardour. And thanks to the JACK shim I can patch around the outputs with qjackctl. This is compared to JACK, which I never managed to properly combine with PulseAudio."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We recently tried to build a relatively simple PowerApps application - under the assumption it would save time over pumping out a React boilerplate form.  Never again.We wanted it to be able to integrate with our backend which lives outside the MS ecosystem.  No problem we thought - that&#39;s what custom connectors are for.  Except they don&#39;t work with any of the automated form generation functionality.  So we pretty much have to build the form entirely manually.Low code becomes high code all of a sudden - except it&#39;s worse than just coding and learning a new framework.  You can&#39;t just input your code anywhere you want, or import your dependencies, etc... You have to hunt around in a zillion different (laggy as all hell) interfaces to find the right location where that code can live.  Or maybe it&#39;s not code - but a toggle somewhere... OMG... kill me.Good luck if you are trying to learn the lower level aspects... since all the tutorials, blogs, youtube videos - all assume that your data all lives in Sharepoint or some other MS resource - and that your connector actually works as advertised.If you can code - and your stack doesn&#39;t already entirely consist of the MS ecosystem.  Just roll your own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just read the overview document (docs/overview.md in that repo), and I have to say I&#39;m blown away.Excel is one of the world&#39;s most popular programming environments, because it has such a low barrier to entry, but it&#39;s limited: the input is always a grid of numbers, and the output is always a grid of numbers, which limits how useful it can be to people outside number-crunching professions.Visual Basic (especially the original, pre-.NET incarnation) let you create Real Windows Apps with all the inputs and outputs that entails (images, copy/paste, files, sliders, textboxes, databases) and let you use a fairly simple and forgiving language to wire them together... but the barrier-to-entry was still a lot higher than Excel, even if it was lower than C++, or even Visual Basic.NET.This PowerApps thing seems like an elegant middle-ground between the two - rich inputs and outputs (images, sliders, text-boxes, databases), with a simple, predictable language to wire them together. The inputs and outputs aren&#39;t quite as rich as Visual Basic, but the shift from native apps to web apps has changed people&#39;s expectations since the days of VB6, so that&#39;s probably an advantage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the overview document:&gt; Microsoft Power Fx is the low-code language that will be used across the Microsoft Power Platform.The emphasized part above is all you need to know to understand that Microsoft Power Fx is NOT a low-code general purpose programming language, as is mistakenly stated in the README document. It might be general purpose in the Power Apps context, but it&#39;s a moot point from the larger perspective. Generally, Microsoft Power Platform and, thus, its subset Power Apps, present a much stronger lock-in risk than Azure and some other products and services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also wanted to share my overall positive experience with Clickhouse.UPSIDES* started a 3-node cluster using the official Docker images super quickly* ingested billions of rows super fast* great compression (of course, depends on your data&#39;s characteristics)* features like https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/merget... are amazing to see* ODBC support.  I initially said &#34;Who uses that??&#34;, but we used it to connect PostgreSQL and so we can keep the non-timeseries data in PostgreSQL but still access PostgreSQL tables in Clickhouse (!)* you can go the other way too: read Clickhouse from PostgreSQL (see https://github.com/Percona-Lab/clickhousedb_fdw, although we didn&#39;t try this)* PRs welcome, and quickly reviewed. (We improved the ODBC UUID support)* code quality is pretty high.DOWNSIDES* limited JOIN capabilities, which is expected from a timeseries-oriented database like Clickhouse.  It&#39;s almost impossible to implement JOINs at this kind of scale.  The philosophy is &#34;If it won&#39;t be fast as scale, we don&#39;t support it&#34;* not-quite-standard SQL syntax, but they&#39;ve been improving it* limited DELETE support, which is also expected from this kind of database, but rarely used in the kinds of environments that CH usually runs in (how often do people delete data from ElasticSearch?)It&#39;s really an impressive piece of engineering.  Hats off to the Yandex crew."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s an unfair comparison, notably because:1) Clickhouse is rigid-schema + append-only - you can&#39;t simply dump semi-structured data (csv/json/documents) into it and worry about schema (index definition) + querying later.  The only clickhouse integration I&#39;ve seen up close had a lot of &#34;json&#34; blobs in it as a workaround, which cannot be queried with the same ease as in ES.2) Clickhouse scalability is not as simple/documented as elasticsearch.  You can set up a 200-node ES cluster with a relatively simple helm config or readily-available cloudformation recipe.3) Elastic is more than elasticsearch - kibana and the &#34;on top of elasticsearch&#34; featureset is pretty substantial.4) Every language/platform under the sun (except powerbi... god damnit) has native + mature client drivers for elasticsearch, and you can fall back to bog-standard http calls for querying if you need/want.  ClickHouse supports some very elementary SQL primitives (&#34;ANSI&#34;) and even those have some gotchas and are far from drop-in.In this manner, I think that clickhouse is better compared as a self-hosted alternative to Aurora and other cloud-native scalable SQL databases, and less a replacement for elasticsearch.  If you&#39;re using Elasticsearch for OLAP, you&#39;re probably better to ETL the semi-structured/raw data out of ES that you specifically wan to a more suitable database which is meant for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SQL is a perfect language for analytics.Slightly off topic, but I strongly agree with this statement and wonder why the languages used for a lot of data science work (R, Python) don&#39;t have such a strong focus on SQL.It might just be my brain, but SQL makes so much logical sense as a query language and, with small variances, is used to directly query so many databases.In R, why learn the data.tables (OK, speed) or dplyr paradigms, when SQL can be easily applied directly to dataframes? There are libraries to support this like sqldf[1], tidyquery[2] and duckdf[3] (author). And I&#39;m sure the situation is similar in Python.This is not a post against great libraries like data.table and dplyr, which I do use from time to time. It&#39;s more of a question about why SQL is not more popular as the query language de jour for data science.[1] https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sqldf/index.html[2] https://github.com/ianmcook/tidyquery[3] https://github.com/phillc73/duckdf"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the best news I&#39;ve heard all week.  The more widely vegan &#34;meat&#34; is available, the more likely it is to be adopted by average people and not just dedicated vegans.Reducing the demand for real beef is probably one of the best things we can do in the short term for the environment, due to the amount of land required for cattle farming, and due to the surprising amount of methane emitted by cattle.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoy eating meat and have no plans of going off of it completely. But we eat so much of it as a culture.And when you add up every hot pocket, frozen pizza, slider, hot dog, or chicken nugget, it&#39;s hard to argue that most of meat actually being consumed can&#39;t be easily substituted. For something healthier and cheaper too!And I know people blast tech companies for focusing too much on making things flashy and cool, but the people who are making electric cars and fake meat cool are the ones who are going to save our asses while we were busy scolding people for not trying harder to enjoy brown rice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He&#39;s kind of totally wrong about the phones and thus the speed being THE killer feature. First of all, Symbian phones, which were the market leader smartphones when the iphone was released were pretty fast. So were feature phones (i.e. dumb phones).What iphone was a LOT better at than everyone else was UX. Of which speed is one component, of course. It&#39;s funny how much people never get it although it happened in front of us, it happened to us. At the time I was working at Nokia Research and I remember my girlfriend telling me how his boss got this wonderful phone that you can take photos with and you can view them, etc. The funny thing is that I had such a phone since 2001. I have been working with smartphones for 6 years then, she knew it, she listened to me when I told her or others what I was doing (and then listen to others responding &#34;yeah, but phones are for making phone calls&#34;). She saw me browsing the net on my phones (a 9210 communicator and then a 9500), send emails from the beach, etc.Still it somehow didn&#39;t register. Because it looked like something that she&#39;d never use. And then the iphone that did a lot less made her and basically everyone understand what a smartphone is. (Even though by then symbian smartphones were pretty common, most people didn&#39;t use them as smartphones.)So no, it&#39;s not simply the speed. It&#39;s the UX. And even if we talk about speed, it&#39;s still not the speed, but it&#39;s the perception of the speed, which a lot has been written about: delay (lagging) matters a lot even if speed on average is OK."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I vividly remember using a kiosk to order a sandwich at a gas station 3 years ago... Not because the sandwich was great, not because it had a great logo, or a great name...The INSTANT I hit the button to complete the order, the built in printer almost spat the ticket at me. I ordered a second sandwich just so I could get a video of that happening again.Edit: Just found and uploaded the video :)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This I think is a key reason Netflix is a default ‘channel’ in my mind, whereas Apple TV, amazon prime and Disney plus are all just apps.Netflix is faster in every way. There’s a button on my TV specifically to launch it, the videos start faster, fast forwarding is faster, there’s less buffering in general. Every single touch point is fast. And it’s because they put the effort in where the others didn’t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a recent video presentation by Jonah Edwards, who runs the Core Infrastructure Team at the Internet Archive. He explains the IA’s server, storage, and networking infrastructure, and then takes questions from other people at the Archive.I found it all interesting. But the main takeaway for me is his response to Brewster Kahle’s question, beginning at 13:06, about why the IA does everything in-house rather than having its storage and processing hosted by, for example, AWS. His answer: lower cost, greater control, and greater confidence that their users are not being tracked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see incredible value in IA collection of books, videos and software. OTOH I&#39;m puzzled by lack of organization.Take for example this newer document: https://archive.org/details/manualzilla-id-5695071  The document has horrible name and useless tags, and the content seems to be only section 2 of some SW manual. How would I ever hope to find it if I needed that exact document?Obviously such huge archive cannot be categorized and annotated by small team, so it would make sense to crowdsource the labeling process. Yet, as registered user I can only flag the item, or write a review. Why doesn&#39;t IA let users label content and build their own curated collections of items?"</p>

It&#39;s extremely important to be accurate with this kind of thing. The discussion below is all based on assuming that that title is literally true.The HN guidelines specifically ask you not to rewrite titles unless they are misleading or linkbait: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.I&#39;ve changed the URL from https://www.mitpressjournals.org/action/showPublications, which doesn&#39;t explain anything, to the press release which, although it&#39;s a press release, sort of does. Nevertheless it&#39;s hard to figure out what exactly is being announced here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To MIT Press, thank you. But without an announcement, I fear that this is just a one time, brief thing.Springer did this awhile ago for a weekend, not its entire catalog but many books were free to download. It was wonderful, but brief. From down thread, https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/mit-press-launches-direct-openI think it is important for folks to recognize how hard this must have been and how many heated verbal battles were exchanged inside of MIT over this. Thank You. And thank Aaron, always a champion in spreading the world&#39;s knowledge to the most people possible.  We should empower everyone as much as we can with the bits we have available.Folks should check some fun journals likeComputer Music Journal https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/comjEvolutionary Computation https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/evcoAdd your own below!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems slightly weird to me that university presses and learned society journals aren’t generally open access. I thought the point was to aid the university’s research. Surely it helps the name of the university to have important widely accessible journals with the university’s name on them. Maybe the presses tend to have been spun off as commercial enterprises, or maybe the university really loves the income. Or maybe they are really expensive to run for some reason. I know the press at my university has a pretty large building but I’d figured a lot of it was a warehouse. Maybe it’s full of salespeople negotiating with librarians.I don’t think there’s much hope of the commercial journals owned by Elsevier or Springer opening up, but I do hope that the trend of journals flipping (where the entire editorial board resigns and forms a similarly named open access journal) will increase.Perhaps another problem is that in those fields that are already closest to open access (say because they use the arxiv), there is less incentive for people to jot publish in commercial journals as everyone who matters will have already read the preprint in the arxiv."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More background from the point of view of Frogware:The Sinking City is Being Delisted. Here’s Whyhttps://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her...Without wishing to take sides, here&#39;s what seems to be at the root of the dispute, from Frogware&#39;s POV:On June 27, 2019, The Sinking City was released on Xbox One, PS4, and Epic Games Store. That was a great day for us. And once the game was released, we received a letter from Bigben/Nacon that the milestones that were previously approved are being canceled, meaning that we would not receive any profit from the sales of the game. A retroactive cancellation on not delivering a product on time that is already out in the market is not acceptable. That was when our legal battle began.We filed a lawsuit against Bigben/Nacon on August 2019 and, incidentally, only then we started to receive income reports, though incomplete and undocumented. So it was not possible for us to see if the revenue was correctly calculated or even how many units we sold. At some point we received a statement claiming that one of the console manufacturers hasn’t paid royalties for more than 5 months, while actually the same console manufacturer paid our royalties from other games without any delay in the same period of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working near some game publishers many many years ago, and the case when they would crack the game in order to publish/republish/rewrap installer, localize to some local market or release some critical patch, when the original team was not responsive, not experienced in certain tech issues, had no resources allocated, was drown in bureaucracy, or even was not existing anymore, was not so uncommon.The case when this is breaching original contracts is the well the separate issue. Often times the publisher and developer have different views of the world, - relationships in this industry have always been tense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t heard of this before, so maybe I am missing some context here, but something seems fishy:&gt; Steam is one of the listed platforms of commercialization in the contract between Frogwares and Nacon. But since the release of the game, Nacon’s unlawful actions have forced Frogwares to defend its property and react in front of the French Justice for lack of payments, attempts to steal our IPs, etc which we made a public letter about back in August 2020.Here&#39;s the previous statement from Nacon:https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/750130/view/30584784...I can&#39;t find any of the details about Nacon&#39;s unlawful actions, and it seems Frogware is being intentionally vague. Doing some digging, it seems like this is almost a complete retread of a legal battle they had before:https://twinfinite.net/2019/09/frogwares-games-delisted-alle...It seems like they may have a history of playing a copyright game with publishers - take their money to develop a game, then use legal trickery to take back the property outright.In this case Nacon may have felt they had a &#34;mechanic&#39;s lien&#34; on the code and felt justified stealing it back outright (probably a bad choice in the long run). But regardless, I don&#39;t get the sense that Frogwares is completely being on the up and up about the relationship with their exes.Update: Frogwares has a much more detailed list of grievances here: https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-her... Some seem petty and some seem serious. But it still leaves questions. How much did Nacon already pay Frogwares? Does Frogwares plan on paying it back?&gt; The agreement is, therefore, terminated without further formality. Moreover, on July 17, 2020, Nacon attempted to oppose the termination in court, but the judge rejected the demand, and the contract is now terminated in the eyes of the law.Maybe French law is much weirder than ours, but this phrasing would be highly suspect in the US. You would get a really affirmative ruling that you are still bound by contract or not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there is something kind of fun about purposefully using &#34;outdated&#34; software, and even valuable sometimes, in the same way that it&#39;s useful to use a dead language like Latin nowadays; it&#39;s not changing so there&#39;s sort of a bit of &#34;equality&#34; to it, for want of a better word.For example, I&#39;ve actually thought it might make sense for people to release new software on DOS or the Sega Genesis, simply because they&#39;re  not being updated anymore, and as a result, there&#39;s a ton of great emulators for both that can run on pretty much any modern platform under the sun.  A Linux program I write might not run under FreeBSD or AmigaOS, but I would bet that I could get basically nearly any SNES game running nearly flawlessly on them with an emulator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let me fix that title. Happy to be downvoted into negative territory. I only have 11 points. Go ahead.&#34;Bitcoin Is A Waste of Time (and Resources)&#34;What Bitcoin has done is that it taught people they can come together in a sustained flash mob (like an on-the-fly hedge fund operation) and manipulate the price of speculative assets by creating artificial short-term pump-n-dump type demand. Bitcoin has trained our collective neural network to do this.The huddled masses can take their new superpower and apply it to stock, crypto, commodities on the commodity exchange, and all kinds of speculative assets, especially the virtual kind.It&#39;s taken a gambling-friendly society with feverish lust for winning (think for-profit fantasy sports, online poker, day trading, Vegas et al) and turned us into a giant decentralized casino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so sick of these profound-sounding blog posts that take 1 million words to say precisely jack shit. Yes, the key innovation around Bitcoin was to order events. You can call this &#39;time&#39; if you want. This is literally the most obvious thing you can say about the system. It&#39;s so obvious in fact that it&#39;s in the introduction section to the Bitcoin whitepaper. Here is the entire blog post written much shorter and more precisely by Satoshi:&#39;In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.&#39;Not trying to be elitist but if you find this topic new then you probably also find Bitcoin&#39;s technical workings new. Since it&#39;s now more than a decade old I don&#39;t find this a very topical inclusion for a &#39;news&#39; site."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the article that made things finally click with me. Thinking about the pre-WWI gold standard and the issues that existed there and the improvements that Bitcoin brings around time, consensus, etc.The baseless negative comments with no interaction with the article content confirms for me that Bitcoin is on to something. Sour grapes syndrome is a result of pride, I think."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t read all four articles. I got about half way through the first one and was just wondering &#34;I still have no idea what this is all about.&#34; Fortunately, the Wikipedia article on the author has a brief summary.In particular, I thought this quote from the Wikipedia article really summarizes the differences between older and younger generations: &#34;there is a profound difference between using a racial epithet in the course of a discussion about that racial epithet&#39;s use, and using a racial epithet to diminish or to wound someone.&#34;For &#34;socially conscious&#34; people in my generation (Gen X), I think nearly all of us would find calling someone a racial epithet abhorrent. At the same time, while I understand culture has shifted and I wouldn&#39;t do it now, I still find it quite bizarre that the mere utterance of the epithet, even in a sentence like &#34;You should never call someone a &lt;racial epithet&gt; because that is extremely offensive&#34; is considered itself racist by younger people.I recall hearing about a young popular YouTuber about a year or so ago who was accused of being racist simply for singing along to the lyrics of a popular rap song. Even more strange to me was that his defense (which was true if one looked up his Instagram video) was that he did NOT utter said epithet, in that he was singing along with the lyrics but when it got to that word he just skipped it and didn&#39;t say it.I understand culture changes, but it still bothers me that we&#39;ve gotten to the point where we completely disregard intent and focus instead just on the syntax of what was said. To be clear, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s indeed what occurred in Mr. McNeil&#39;s case, but I certainly have seen it in other examples."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 1. Yes, I did use the word, in this context: A student asked me if I thought her high school’s administration was right to suspend a classmate of hers for using the word in a video she’d made in eighth grade. I said “Did she actually call someone a (offending word)? Or was she singing a rap song or quoting a book title or something?” When the student explained that it was the student, who was white and Jewish, sitting with a black friend and the two were jokingly insulting each other by calling each other offensive names for a black person and a Jew, I said “She was suspended for that? Two years later? No, I don’t think suspension was warranted. Somebody should have talked to her, but any school administrator should know that 12-year-olds say dumb things. It’s part of growing up.”&gt; 2. I was never asked if I believed in white privilege. As someone who lived in South Africa in the 1990’s and has reported in Africa almost every year since, I have a clearer idea than most Americans of white privilege. I was asked if I believed in systemic racism. I answered words to the effect of: “Yeah, of course, but tell me which system we’re talking about. The U.S. military? The L.A.P.D.? The New York Times? They’re all different.”&gt; 3. The question about blackface was part of a discussion of cultural appropriation. The students felt that it was never, ever appropriate for any white person to adopt anything from another culture — not clothes, not music, not anything. I counter-argued that all cultures grow by adopting from others. I gave examples — gunpowder and paper. I said I was a San Franciscan, and we invented blue jeans. Did that mean they — East Coast private school students — couldn’t wear blue jeans? I said we were in Peru, and the tomato came from Peru. Did that mean that Italians had to stop using tomatoes? That they had to stop eating pizza? Then one of the students said: “Does that mean that blackface is OK?” I said “No, not normally — but is it OK for black people to wear blackface?” “The student, sounding outraged, said “Black people don’t wear blackface!” I said “In South Africa, they absolutely do. The so-called colored people in Cape Town have a festival every year called the Coon Carnival where they wear blackface, play Dixieland music and wear striped jackets. It started when a minstrel show came to South Africa in the early 1900’s. Americans who visit South Africa tell them they’re offended they shouldn’t do it, and they answer ‘Buzz off. This is our culture now. Don’t come here from America and tell us what to do.’ So what do you say to them? Is it up to you, a white American, to tell black South Africans what is and isn’t their culture?”I fundamentally don&#39;t understand why the Times didn&#39;t explain this early on. Not necessarily release these statements verbatim, but certainly provide some of this context."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related to Xiaomi, the company is also doing some sketchy things in the smart home space under their brand &#34;Aqara&#34;.  I use HomeKit in my apartment and opted for Aqara branded wireless buttons and temp/humidity sensors because of the attractive hardware and good reviews.  The devices require a wi-fi connected hub, not too strange for things that use Zigbee, so I gave that a go.Well, on cursory examination, the Aqara/Xiaomi hub was talking to a bunch of Chinese servers constantly.  I didn&#39;t dive too deep into what all they were actually for.  When I blocked the device from phoning home with my router, all the connected devices stopped working!  None of the buttons or sensors would work, the RGB light on the hub couldn&#39;t even be changed.  As soon as it lost the ability to ping its servers in China, the thing actually started strobe light flashing blue.  Re-enable the outside network access on it, starts working again.  This was totally antithetical to why I use HomeKit in the first place, so I removed the hub and paired all the Aqara accessories with a generic open source Zigbee hub (ConBee II) and added it to HomeKit with HomeBridge.In the future I plan to give brands more scrutiny before investing time/money in them and granting them unfettered access to my LAN..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This paragraph stood out to me:&gt; The intention here seems to be that aigt is the timestamp when the ID was generated. So if that timestamp deviates from current time by more than 7776000000 milliseconds (90 days) a new ID is going to be generated. However, this implementation is buggy, it will update aigt on every call rather than only when a new ID is generated. So the only scenario where a new ID will be generated is: this method wasn’t called for 90 days, meaning that the browser wasn’t started for 90 days. And that’s rather unlikely, so one has to consider this ID permanent.If we assume that Xiaomi aren&#39;t literally trying to spy for a government and are in fact just poorly calibrated on what&#39;s legitimate to collect for product analytics purposes, this paragraph highlights why that&#39;s still incredibly dangerous despite &#34;good intentions&#34;.I remember the UK government investigation into Huawei concluding that not only was their security posture insufficient for critical infrastructure, but their engineering practices were likely a decade away from being at a point where they could start to claim good security practice.This paragraph seems to suggest a similar problem at Xiaomi. This should have been caught at a security review stage during design, it should have been caught at the code review stage, it should have been caught by automated tests, it should have been caught by QA, it should have been caught once live by data tests, it should have been seen once live by analysts, it should have been fixed at so many different points. The fact it wasn&#39;t suggests that these stages either don&#39;t exist or are insufficient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I truly don&#39;t understand, from a security and privacy perspective, why would anyone outside of China would voluntarily choose to run closed-source software from a company that&#39;s subject to domestic laws and regulations in China. The MSS is no joke.https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=china+mss...This is the same reason that Zoom is banned at my workplace and many other partner companies.You&#39;ve actually got two problems here. One is the commercial advertising/for-profit related data sharing problem described in the article. The second is that Xiaomi, as a company with that collected data resident in China on its servers, is obliged to provide a pipeline for a copy of their database to the MSS upon request."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Throwaway because I don&#39;t want my co-workers to know.I was poor. My father left home when I was a kid in middle school. My mom worked part time cleaning houses and left us when she found a new husband. I dropped out of high-school in the 9th grade and went to work. Low paying jobs. I lived with my aunt on the bad side of town.Fast-forward 35 years. Today, I make about 200K per year. I got a GED, went to trade school, then got into college (full Pell Grant because I was so poor) and came out with a few degrees.Everything I own is fully paid for. House, cars, etc. because I&#39;m always afraid I&#39;m going to be poor again. Of course, I only own modest things. Nothing fancy.If you have never been poor, you may not realize how awesome Small houses and Toyota Corollas are.My fears about being poor again drive my wife and kids crazy. They think I&#39;m nuts and say I need counseling. I probably do.Anyway, people think I&#39;m &#39;privileged&#39; now because I earn a lot of money, but they have no idea that I used to sleep on the floor and eat in soup lines.I made it and you can too. Poverty has no color. It impacts everyone. You can&#39;t tell just by looking at someone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great write-up, and as someone who spent time being poor-ish, it really resonated.What I realized from my own life experience: the US sawed the bottom rungs off the ladder in the 1950s when it suburbanized. There is no affordable housing or transportation in 95% of the North American land area, and virtually every societal problem we deal with either stems from this or is made worse by it. Then the healthcare disaster is the cherry on top.The US is a great place to live and work with tremendous upward mobility —— but only if you can stay above the event horizon which is reliable car ownership and insurance coverage (health, home/renters, auto). If you fall under that, you will need help or a lot of good luck to get back out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His point on housing is so important, and its adjacent to a lot of other poverty-related issues.It&#39;s one of the reasons advocates for the poor often seem to speak a different language to their opposition.If you live in median-and-above-land, you think of all costs existing on a spectrum.  Fancy dinners for $100 on one end. Rice and beans for pennies at the other. This is true for clothes, smartphones, furniture... lots of things. There&#39;s a spectrum with options all along it.It is not true for housing, transport and a lot of other, unavoidable expenses. Housing is the extreme example. Say an average smartphone is $350. $700 buys a luxury phone. $175 gets you an decent phone. Say median rent is $1500. Going above $3k will get you a palace and $750 probably doesn&#39;t get you anything. Quality, below median prices is on an extremely steep curve.Household economics are just completely different below and above a certain threshold... and this has gotten more pronounced over the last generation or two.Ireland has/had a whole literary genre of stories about miserable poverty-stricken childhoods. They paint a very vivid picture. If you compare it to poverty today, besides being less harsh, it&#39;s quite different.  They had housing. It was basic, often insecure, but they did have housing.Food was scarce. That&#39;s no longer the case. Stuff though... they had no stuff. No bed, no mugs, no shoes, no pencils. Getting these things was an epic mission and served as a landmark. That is all changed now. Stuff is extremely abundant. Basics like housing and transport are almost as scarce as they were in the bad old days.The upshot of all this is that we underestimate how poor poor is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seen the GTA post already and the sscanf behavior is very surprising as one would expect it to parse the given string until the given format is satisfied or \0 is hit. Seems like this is not the case. Found this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23924112&gt; sscanf() converts the string you pass in to an _IO_FILE* to make the string look like a &#34;file&#34;. This is so the same internal _IO_vfscanf() can be used for both a string and a FILE*. However, as part of that conversion, done in a _IO_str_init_static_internal() function, it calls __rawmemchr (ptr, &#39;\0&#39;); essentially a strlen() call, on your input string.Looks correct. Call flow:https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/21c3f4b5368686ade28d90d...https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/83908b3a1ea51e3aa7ff422..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this while making a collection of what C implementation does what at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26298300 .There are two basic implementation strategies.  The BSD (FreeBSD and OpenBSD and more than likely NetBSD too), Microsoft, GNU, and MUSL C libraries use one, and suffer from this; whereas the OpenWatcom, P.J. Plauger, Tru64 Unix, and my standard C libraries use another, and do not.The 2002 report in the comp.lang.c Usenet newsgroup (listed in that discussion) is the earliest that I&#39;ve found so far.There have been several assertions that library support for strings in C++ is poor.  However, note that the fix here was to switch from the Standard C library function sscanf() to a C++ library.* https://github.com/fastfloatOne might advocate using other people&#39;s libraries, on the grounds that they will have got such things right.  However, note that this is RapidYAML, and the bug got fixed several years after GTA Online was released.  Other third-party parsing libraries have suffered from being layered on top of sscanf() in other ways.* https://github.com/json-c/json-c/issues/173* https://github.com/kgabis/parson/commit/96150ba1fd7f3398aa6a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have come to the conclusion there are two kinds of audience and two kinds of diagram, abs they almost exactly overlap1. Engineering diagrams, explaining concepts to other engineers who are using the diagram as a jumping off point to deeper explorations2. &#34;Business&#34; diagrams - the sort of thing we want to see in a Medium article or presentation.  The style and correct placement matters far more than engineering.The first is very amenable to markdown style production - often we want to spend no more than a few minutes creating the diagram.  We get (60?) 80% of the way there with 20% effort.But with every markdown approach I have tried the remaining 20% is flat out days of work.  There is almost always a need to place that box there and have this one below and to the right and dammit the layout engine will not agree.What I would ideally like is a combo - markdown to get me most of the way there, and then drop into some vector format that lets me tweak."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really miss AIM.It was the way you knew friends were available to chat. It was much closer to in-person conversation than most media we use nowadays.It&#39;s not uncommon for someone to {iMessage, SMS, FB Message, IG Message, etc.} me while I&#39;m otherwise busy. Then, I need to find a second to let them know of this (unless I either totally drop the ball or consciously decide to not reply). I also need to let them know I&#39;ll be free to chat after work, at lunch time, etc.With AIM, you just logged in and set whether you were available, idle, away, or invisible. Friends knew whether they would disturb you or not.Not only that but it was pretty much the singular form of instant communication that almost everybody used. Now I have people I reply to on multiple platforms such that we&#39;ll even branch off in separate conversations per platform, I only talk to on X, Y, or Z platform, etc.I&#39;m not one to &lt;Old man yells at cloud&gt; typically but this is one aspect of social media that I think we&#39;ve lost over the past decade and it really sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was browsing through a backup of an old computer that ran Pidgin and had chat logging on. One of the last AIM messages I ever received went like this:    Conversation at Mon Jan 15 01:16:36 2007
    (01:16:36) Megan: omg it&#39;s ryan.
    (01:17:41) Megan: and then in time...
    (01:17:53) Megan: the friends faded away
    (01:18:14) Megan: and the instanst IMs that&#39;d open were deleted
    (01:18:28) Megan: and responses never came
    (01:18:39) Megan: and then never even talked anymore
    (01:18:50) Megan: and then hadn&#39;t hung out in forever
    (01:19:02) Megan: ...but it was ok.
    (01:19:09) Megan: because that is life.
    (01:19:28) Megan: and she was thankful for the past they had,
    (01:19:38) Megan: even if there was no present.
    (02:31:57) Megan has signed off.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was such a senseless destruction. People miss AIM, people miss MSN Messenger and just a couple years later it turned out instant messaging platforms were worth billions.It&#39;s still insane to me these corporations shut down perfectly viable platforms that were still used by millions. The short sightedness and pettiness of these directors is something of legend, I hope there&#39;s a chapter about this in new management textbooks, but who knows.Anyone got a good explanation why it made sense to shut down these services?"</p>

This is my post.I’m not strictly allergic to proving that I live in a certain place, so long as the evidence is securely deleted afterward.

For example, “proof of residency 3” includes financial or medical records. Suppose that Large Corporation donates $1,000 to Little League. Per the privacy policy, Little League could share those financial or medical records with them. Nuts to that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Surprising how much press &#34;cancel culture&#34; gets these days as if it&#39;s a new thing or as if it&#39;s a new thing being pushed on society by the left. We&#39;ve always had cancel culture. Some might remember the Dixie Chicks. How about the Rachael Ray ad that Dunkin Donuts pulled merely because it looked like an Arab scarf? Jerry Falwell came to prominence entirely based on his pushing of cancel culture. When I lived in North Carolina, one of the things that was repeated all the time was that a newspaper editor would lose his job for publishing a story with a positive spin on free trade. You can go back further to McCarthyism, Turing being prosecuted for being gay, and on and on.Cancel culture remains a thing. Apparently now that folks aren&#39;t just being cancelled for supporting gay marriage, the free exchange of ideas is suddenly important. The outright hypocrisy of so many on this issue is the biggest story.Edit: Forgot to mention this extreme example of cancel culture:https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/professor-who-wore-hijab-...A professor was cancelled because she wore a hijab. There was no outrage at all from the usual suspects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely wonder what cancel culture is going to look like in the next 5-10 years and beyond. Just about everyone I speak to about the subject agrees that cancel culture is bad but very few people seem willing to confront it. I sense that people hope the rest of society will come to its senses and we all stop being so judgemental.But as much as I loathe cancel culture and it&#39;s chilling effects on the free exchange of ideas, I can&#39;t help but admit that it seems to work. From a detached and objective standpoint, an ideology that utilizes cancel culture is really good at stamping out opposition. You are free to think and believe whatever you want in private and then you self-censor in public out of fear. It takes a certain critical mass of people to affect change and cancel culture excels at keeping individuals from speaking out because the consequences have the potential to ruin your life.So all that being said, I genuinely wonder if cancel culture is here to stay, because the next ideology to come along will also realize how powerful of a tool it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it almost funny how the media/culture/etc. seems determined to build a group of people that will react negatively to so-called &#34;cancel culture.&#34; They seem to think that people will gladly follow the ever-growing list of arbitrary rules indefinitely.If I were a betting man, I&#39;d predict a resurgence in punk attitudes in about 2025 or 2030. At some point, the dam will break and people will stop caring. I already get a sense that the 13-19 generation is a bit tired of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s a UX defect with Messages right now where if you delete some conversations in succession, randomly will a modal popup and ask you if you want to report the contact as spam.Some Apple articles will tell you not to worry if you’ve accidentally reported someone as spam, but it actually does something. It’s not a pedestrian crosswalk button.I found this out the hard way when my wife could no longer send or receive messages nor sign into Messages and we had to contact Apple support. I’ve accidentally reported tons of people as spam because of this stupid Messages experience, and I can only guess that I’ve reported my own wife so many times from clearing all of my Messages conversations that they disabled her Messages account.The support tech had the gall to tell me they’d reactivate her account as a one-time exception, and I practically wanted to kill the guy over the phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now that I work for a big evil corporation, I have some insights on why these inexplicably evil things happen. Fun at parties, I know. Not excusing it, just shedding light for anyone interested in the systems perspective.&gt;It appears as though charges from Apple are specialThis is exactly right. You offer branded cards because interchange fees are expensive. You want people who buy your stuff to pay you by ACH. That&#39;s not practical at the point of sale, but it is practical if you frame it as the monthly payment on your store-brand credit card. Charges at the store on the store-brand card are always special. That&#39;s why the cards are offered.From a merchant&#39;s perspective, anyone who buys something is really taking out a loan. In most cases such a loan will be settled by the customer&#39;s card issuer, less the interchange fee. In the case of a branded card, it will be settled by the customer directly and in full. In either case, if this doesn&#39;t happen on time, the customer&#39;s account with the merchant is now in arrears.Most of the time this happens, the &#34;customer&#34; is farming stolen credit card numbers for resalable goods. You are never going to find these people, let alone rehabilitate them and settle up. So the &#34;hey, you did a lot of chargebacks to us, what the hell?&#34; state is not user friendly. It&#39;s scorched earth. I would be cautious about signing into any other Apple accounts on devices that have been associated with yours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar terrible experience with Apple Card. Still having it actually, as months later they haven&#39;t resolved it.The product was great until it wasn&#39;t. The amount of hours I&#39;ve lost to try and fix this, including talking to numerous people on the phone, is absurd. No one can figure out how to unlock, pay, or even close my account. Linking Apple Id&#39;s to Apple Card accounts is crazy. Shocked when I realized that was going on.Here&#39;s a *long* screenshot of my support history https://breckyunits.com/appleCard.pngSmall pain in the big scheme of things, but sad to see Apple not really innovate behind the fancy UI. I&#39;d vote they nix this thing and leave consumer cards to Stripe and PayPal and others who are more focused on building better financial products for consumers. Don&#39;t pull a GE and get mixed up in finance Apple, you&#39;re better than this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is definitely the most reasonable case I&#39;ve heard made from this argument, and it&#39;s changed my stance on the issue.That said, I feel the cryptography project handled this poorly. I encountered the issue when one day, installing a Python Ansible module the same way I did the day before required a compiler for a different language that I&#39;ve never used before and that is hardly used, if at all, in the rest of my stack. The Ansible project seemed to be taken by surprise, and eventually  I found the root upstream issue, where the initial attitude was &#34;too bad&#34;. Some people making those comments worked for Red Hat / IBM, Ansible is heavily backed by that. What company cares more about Linux on S390 than Red Hat / IBM? I would suggest none. So the fact that they had this attitude and community reaction to me suggests the problem is not one of expecting free work for a corporation on a non-free architecture. It was IMHO a combination of a lack of forethought, communication, and yes, perhaps a change that is overdue and will just be a little painful. The suggestion to maintain an LTS release while people figure out how to proceed is the right move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do think that we&#39;re going to see more of this. This is just a relatively early example. Rust and LLVM bring things to the table that make them inevitable if we as an ecosystem, on the whole, value privacy and security. This is where the rubber of the ethos hits the road. C for all it&#39;s good work and history, is a leaky mess and the source of so many zero-days, especially the bad bad state actor level ones.If we are to move to a more abstracted and safer system, the ideas behind LLVM are just going to be a fact of life in years to come. The solution to this is to either fund greater LLVM integration (or similar that isn&#39;t on the scene yet) or accept the status-quo. I choose the former, but I sincerely hope the future direction leaves as few out in the cold as possible through the effort of smart people. But protecting hobbyists is a stretch goal in my mind compared to improving the security and privacy of the global interconnected world we&#39;re in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t know about crypto. But any open source package, ported to a new environment (one not explicitly tested by the maintainter) is going to have issues. That&#39;s the nature of software.E.g. I just added pnglib to an embedded assembly. Has a display among other things. Wanted to put compressed PNG images into (limited) flash, then decompress into (plentiful) RAM at boot.Of course pnglib didn&#39;t build for my environment. Never mind it has a C library. There are 50+ compile switches in pnglib, and I was setting them in a pattern that wasn&#39;t part of the tested configurations. It didn&#39;t even compile. Once it compiled (after some source changes) it didn&#39;t run. More source changes and it would run until it hit some endianness issues. Fix those, and it would do (just) what I wanted, which was to decompress certain PNG image formats with limited features, once.No problem. That was my goal, achieved. But at no time did I blame the maintainers for not anticipating my use case.I would say this: maintainers, flag compile-time options that aren&#39;t tried both ways in your test environments. To give me some chance of estimating how hard my job is going to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is absolutely unbelievable (and unforgivable) that a cash cow such as GTA V has a problem like this present for over 6 years and it turns out to be something so absolutely simple.I do not agree with the sibling comment saying that this problem only looks simple and that we are missing context.This online gamemode alone made $1 billion in 2017 alone.Tweaking two functions to go from a load time of 6 minutes to less than two minutes is something any developer worth their salt should be able to do in a codebase like this equipped with a good profiler.Instead, someone with no source code managed to do this to an obfuscated executable loaded with anti-cheat measures.The fact that this problem is caused by Rockstar&#39;s excessive microtransaction policy (the 10MB of JSON causing this bottleneck are all available microtransaction items) is the cherry on top.(And yes, I might also still be salty because their parent company unjustly DMCA&#39;d re3 (https://github.com/GTAmodding/re3), the reverse engineered version of GTA III and Vice City. A twenty-year-old game. Which wasn&#39;t even playable without purchasing the original game.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Holy cow, I&#39;m a very casual gamer, I was excited about the game but when it came out I decided I don&#39;t want to wait that long and I&#39;ll wait until they sort it out. 2 years later it still sucked. So I abandoned it. But.. this... ?! This is unbelievable. I&#39;m certain that many people left this game because of the waiting time. Then there are man-years wasted (in a way different than desired).Parsing JSON?! I thought it was some network game logic finding session magic. If this is true that&#39;s the biggest WTF I saw in the last few years and we&#39;ve just finished 2020.Stunning work just having binary at hand. But how could R* not do this? GTAV is so full of great engineering. But if it was a CPU bottleneck then who works there that wouldn&#39;t just be irked to try to nail it?

Even having to wait for your TV&#39;s OS to boot up when you turn it on is a terrible UX.However, when it comes to buying a TV for your conference room where you have a TV running 12hrs/day (when you&#39;re not a small startup with 10ppl), invest in a proper commercial TV like NEC or (my personal favorite brand) iiyama: 1) the&#39;re dumb TVs from the start, 2) you get proper warranties and support, 3) you can get larger TVs without 4K HDR (which your computer may not support anyway), 4) the color grading is more apt for your PowerPoint slides, etc and finally, 5) these panels are actually rated for that kind of use and won&#39;t break after a few weeks. From my experience building conference rooms, that investment is actually worth it"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really pleased the author called out the Apple TV as a device that lets you avoid ads. We tried to go cheap on another of our TVs and get an Amazon Fire Stick and in addition to it being not as smooth (combo of UX and speed) at the Apple TV, it had a good amount of ads all over the place.There’s lots of griping about the cost of an Apple TV 4k, but I’ll pay that extra $100 to avoid ads and not be tracked so extensively."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s the correct decision (although Facebook likely only cares about its bottom line). the YPG is designated as a terrorist organisation by the Turkish state and it&#39;s quite obvious that Turkey will want to exercise sovereignty over its communication channels rather than letting an opposing military force broadcast freely to its citizens.It&#39;s not really the job of a private company to undermine nations in this way for simple reasons of sovereignty, and because even if Facebook were to somehow win in the short term, the five to ten year consequence would probably be that nations like Turkey decouple entirely and take control over communications back a la Russia or China."</p>

ATC didn’t call it so presumably they didn’t see it on radar. It was exactly as described, small, shiny, cylindrical, no wings, and fast. If I could guess it was doing 500kts in the opposite direction. By the time I pulled out my phone to snap a picture it was gone. If it was a cruise missile it was flying over a populated area and not in restricted airspace or a MOA. Not sure what conclusions to draw other than these things are real and probably more common than people assume. It was not an airliner or private jet I’ve seen plenty of them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My observation is that much of industry does not care about any of these technical or security issues.In theory microservices are technical artifacts, but what they tend to be are cultural artifacts.Microservice adoption is often driven by cargo culting, or (better) a considered decision to work around a lack of organisational cohesion.What microservices let you do is ship your org chart directly, and also map back from some functionality to an owning team. You know who to page when there&#39;s a problem and it&#39;s easier to tell who is late delivering and whose code is slow. In cultures with &#34;lax&#34; technical leadership (aka no everyone uses same thing mandate, I&#39;m not judging) it lets teams use their favourite tools, for better or worse.Other org related things are the ability to have independent (per team) release schedules. Separable billing. Ability to get metrics on performance, cost and failures that can be used as indicators of team performance and promotion material. Microservices can also act as &#34;firewalls&#34;, limiting the impact a bad hire or team can have across your codebase.None of this is intended to be negative judgement; microservices can (among other things), help teams feel a sense of agency and ownership that can be hard to maintain as org size scales up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this is a confused take on modularity. I think isolation and security are related concepts, but not what modules are for. Those things have to follow module boundaries, but they&#39;re not the goal of modules. For me, modules are about understanding; in order to use this code you don&#39;t need to read all of it, you just need to understand the interface. Modularity is for humans, not computers.They do often follow Conway&#39;s law, but that&#39;s not a desirable thing. Most modules are outside of that kind of context -- they&#39;re in libraries written by people you don&#39;t communicate with at all!I&#39;m interested in people&#39;s opinion here. I&#39;m also planning an article on the relationship between services and modularity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this to be surprisingly interesting and novel - usually I expect to see really low quality content when it&#39;s a post about microservices, whether for or against the idea. This boils it down to isolation, which I myself have written about in a similar vein[0].&gt; at this point security people simply don&#39;t believe that any of the following (each one the very best technology available at the time) is totally safeTo be fair, we don&#39;t think anything is totally safe :) that&#39;s the point. Actually a lot of those things listed are why Chrome is so secure. I think this is a bit pessimistic about process isolation, which is actually quite powerful, but I get the point - there&#39;s no gap like an air gap.I prefer to think of monoliths and microservices as being completely unrelated ideas - they aren&#39;t on a spectrum of &#34;big to small&#34;, they&#39;re just two totally different ways of approaching software development. I might put &#34;monoliths&#34; closer to SOA, in that they both describe a very basic approach to a problem, whereas Microservices is not &#34;small services&#34; it&#39;s about bounded contexts, patterns, organizations, etc.Anyways, I appreciated this post.[0] https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/architecting-for-performa..."</p>

So, like:1. Search for something (either using / or *).2. Type ”cgn” in Normal mode (i.e. change next search match) and replace what you searched for with whatever3. Hammer on ”.” (i.e. repeat last command) to replace other matches.This replaces, like, 97% of uses of :s and is a much more convenient way to do search/replace, especially if you use * to search for the word under the cursor.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recently Apple added a feature to iOS that allows you only to allow selected photos to be accessible by an app. This allows the user to respond positively to an access request, but allow the app to see only a subset (or zero) actual photos.It would be a very useful feature for Apple to do the same for contacts: the app would think it&#39;s getting access to your contacts, but would only actually receive a subset of them, and be none the wiser. This would be a tremendous boon for privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see what the point is.&#34;Data poisoning&#34; gives companies a bunch of fake contacts... on top of all your real ones?Who cares? So they send some e-mails to addresses that don&#39;t exist or something? So it takes up an extra 1% of disk space in their database?If you could share an empty address book then that would actually preserve the privacy of your contacts. But this doesn&#39;t do that.I don&#39;t get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Clubhouse requires contact list in order to get invites, which are required to sign up right now.I get why they are doing this, and it caused me to share my contacts with them.However, I resented it and it put me immediately in a defensive posture with the product and company.There is no possible way to trust a company with your contact list and Apple should make it how Photos works now--where you can select which data to share.  There are some folks I don&#39;t even want to possibly find in a social app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most important skills is learning to communicate clearly.You need to give up details and be able to express the key concepts clearly on different levels of detail and business/technical understanding.Explaining this is something you will be doing again and again, so it is worth a lot of effort to get there.I recommend iterating until you have an A4 with the skeleton you need explain all this. It will include key stakeholders/users/integrations, key technologies/protocols, key services/components and the high-level system landscape with key internal and external systems.Notice that a good diagram for this mixes a lot of different views and formal notations.The key idea is that you should strive to provide a skeleton on which your audience can place their understanding and fill in the blanks that they are interested in based on you explanation.If you try to put everything there or follow a formal model like UML you will drown out the key concepts in the noise of the details."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is neat.  I decided to diff two pods in a replicated Kubernetes service.  It seemed that it was going to take forever to run, so I just wrote a short Go program to do the same thing (load two JSON files into a map[string]interface{}, cmp.Diff them) while it was going:https://gist.github.com/jrockway/73982949b3d2ce9b443528042c4...My program runs in less than 10 milliseconds (/usr/bin/time reports 0.00 seconds), and graphtage takes 5 minutes and 17 seconds.  I&#39;m 317,000x faster!  (Not including the time to write the program; if you do that, then it&#39;s about even assuming graphtage took 0 seconds to write.)Graphtage prints the entire file in JQ colors, with diffs inside fields colored red and green, which I love:    ...
    &#34;hostIP&#34;: &#34;10.136.13̟9̟2̶1̶.139̟1̶&#34;,
    &#34;podIP&#34;: &#34;10.244.1.18̟6̟7̶&#34;,
    ...

(My terminal can&#39;t display the dots under the numbers and the strikethrough, but it looks great on HN!  I really love it.)My program produces relatively boring line-by-line diffs:    -               &#34;hostIP&#34;:    string(&#34;10.136.121.131&#34;),
    +               &#34;hostIP&#34;:    string(&#34;10.136.139.139&#34;),
                    &#34;phase&#34;:     string(&#34;Running&#34;),
    -               &#34;podIP&#34;:     string(&#34;10.244.1.17&#34;),
    +               &#34;podIP&#34;:     string(&#34;10.244.1.186&#34;),

Honestly, I get what I want out of mine, and wait 317,000x less time, so... I probably won&#39;t be using this on a daily basis.  But I will be stealing those dots and Unicode strikethroughs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s insanely cool to see a non-IM use case built out on top of Matrix appearing (almost) out of the blue - congratulations :)The implementation currently freestyles a bit on the event format for the messages, which is somewhat our fault on the Matrix team for running horrifically late on MSC1767 (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc176...) which proposes how to do rich custom event formats (e.g. blog posts) which are still renderable and visible to more generic Matrix clients (e.g. Element).  As a result, if you join a Hummingbard conversation via another Matrix client currently you can&#39;t see all the messages (or vice versa). However am hoping that Hummingbard might be a trailblazer for actually exercising MSC1767 in the wild and knocking it into shape, which would hugely benefit the whole Matrix ecosystem :)In terms of licenses, it depend on how you want the project to be used.  If you want folks to run it for personal use as a decentralised social network, I&#39;d personally go GPLv3 or AGPLv3.  If you want commercial folks to be able to build on it too, then Apache is probably the best bet.  copyleft + proprietary dual licensing is another option, but means you&#39;d need any contributors to agree to the dual licensing (could be tricky), and could be seen as not being in the spirit of the GPL.  that said, IANAL, YMMV.(At the risk of going somewhat off topic, another exciting Matrix client also appeared today: https://github.com/pixlwave/Watch-The-Matrix - the first native Matrix client for Apple Watch. https://youtu.be/Jh9iewrBdGQ)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What does it look like to actually write a program ontop of Matrix? Eg i have a key value store that i&#39;d like to use Matrix (or IPFS/etc) for the P2P layer. Is it a lot like IRC channels that you connect to, pushing data into them and getting data out from other clients in the same channel?Ie is it a series of messages? Or is it something more advanced; with built in conflict resolution or other P2P-y features?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very cool! If you end up writing about what the developer experience on top of Matrix is like I&#39;d also be curious about that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is missing one of the best features of iso 8601: it‘s string form is naturally sortable. You don‘t need any specific logic for sorting, so e.g. your filesystem will automatically sort files correctly if you prefix them with a iso 8601 date."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangentially related: I hate GNOME&#39;s approach at configuring formats.In their format settings, you have to pick a country and that determines the format of dates, time, numbers, and the unit system.Of all the countries, none of them has the sane choice for all of the fields, namely: ISO 8601 for dates and times with 24h (no AM/PM), metric system (or SI, whatever), and dot as decimal separator.You can have sane dates, but then you have AM/PM in the clock. You can have 24h clock, but then you have a comma as decimal separator, etc.Can we add a country &#34;Saneland&#34; with the sensible options for all fields? cause that&#39;s where I want to be from. Saneland: the imaginary place where we use reasonable standards and things work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the risk of nitpicking, I prefer RFC 3339, which is a profile of ISO 8601. ISO 8601 provides room for things you typically don&#39;t want, e.g. dropping time zone offsets.While I&#39;m typing this I realise that I&#39;ve never actually read the ISO 8601 spec, like probably most people here, because it&#39;s not free.

It is fully off-grid (except WiFi) and we made smart decisions and installed reliable systems.You pay your money and you maintain the house.Unfortunately it’s never like that. It’s all DIY:Come camp with us for 4 weeks without a hot shower while we teach you how to mix AirCrete and sell you a pump. Get 4 friends and spend 4 months slathering cob incorrectly together. Never cut down a tree before? Buy a chainsaw and start stacking 1-ton logs- you’ll be perfectly safe: nobody has blogged yet about having crushed themselves.I realize this is contrary to the spirit.I just want a convention-over-configuration small off-grid house that I can see in models, read specs for, and purchase outright, including the land it’s sitting on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve ridden the RAGBRAI (Register&#39;s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa) three times. Each year, a different route brings you and 15,000 of your closest friends through small towns like Marne and Manilla. The chosen communities always enthusiastically rise to the occasion by providing food, water, beverages, entertainment, fun diversions, historical themes, hospitality, well wishes and much more.Riding out of town after having a stack of pancakes at the firehouse or a piece of pie from the local Rotary Club, you have plenty of time to think about what it takes and how remarkable it is for some of those towns to accommodate everyone.The RAGBRAI is a great way to experience the State of Iowa."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Around 20 years ago, I had the opportunity to listen to a member of Nasdaq top management talk about the stock market. It&#39;s all a _tiny_ bit blurry, being a long time ago, but I remember how he talked about three different perspectives for investing in stock:First, the &#34;company perspective&#34;. An investor would buy stock in a company they believed in. Maybe they had good products, or good management, or something else. The idea was looking at the how well the company would perform.Second, the &#34;stock perspective&#34;. An investor would ignore the underlying company, but look at the stock itself. It didn&#39;t really matter if the company was doing good, but only if the stock itself had good potential. The idea was looking at how well the stock would perform.Finally, the &#34;game perspective&#34;. An investor would not really care about the stock, but only about the behavior of other investors. Day trading would be the example here, profiting mainly on marketplace dynamics, no matter the stock. The idea was looking at how to be a better player than the others.Then he talked about how the game perspective was the only model that really matched the marketplace, and how the stock market had evolved from being place where people would invest in companies, to a place where they would play a game with other peopl."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Gambling occurs when you have a poor understanding of risk, resulting in either (1) negative expected value bets, or (2) poor bet sizing that leads to ruin.&#34; Not so. Top poker players are still gambling, but have an excellent understanding of the risks. Their skill doesn&#39;t turn them into investors. Gambling is taking a high risk bet. Whether the expected pay off is high enough to justify the risk and whether you can afford to lose the bet is a separate issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is only scratching the surface of the question.For interest, there&#39;s a very common negative expected value bet that almost everyone is required to make: insurance.We don&#39;t consider that gambling, in fact we often tell our parents to buy some when they fly on holiday.Why? The answer touches on the lottery.We care about not just the average case, we care about what might happen.Regarding Kelly criterion, there&#39;s a good reason why people don&#39;t used exactly the amount it says. If you look at the risk, ie the chance your probability is wrong, there&#39;s a chance you are overbetting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the hardest thing about being a parent today is the constant shame and confusion about the “right” way to do it. We don’t live in a hunter gatherer society anymore, we just don’t. There’s lots of wisdom in that way of life, and sure we could learn from it — but there’s enough anxiety as it is, parents don’t need more of it.We have three kids and we sleep trained them. (Not a pediatrician, standard disclaimer.) This article calls it an ‘extreme’ practice. For us, ‘extreme’ was the sleep deprivation we experienced with baby number one as we tried every ‘no cry’ method in the book. The baby cried and cried and cried. Once we started sleep training, there was a bit of crying and then - a sleeping baby! Through the night! Total amount of crying went from hours to zero. The kid became happier — they weren’t sleep-deprived anymore. And neither were we. I no longer felt like I was going to drop the ball due to extreme exhaustion.Babies two and three had the benefit of our experience, and they barely cried at all. The third one would lay down eyes-open and fall asleep. “So it actually does happen! — I thought the books must be lying.”By all objective measures our kids are happy, healthy, and well-adjusted. But that doesn’t mean we still don’t get the stink eye from people who think it’s a cruel practice.Just raise your kids with love. Be compassionate, and patient. Find a doctor you trust. Don’t let people add to an already stressful endeavor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of all the &#34;weird&#34; things we do as parents in euro/anglo nations, sleeping arrangements seems nowhere near the top.IMO, the top &#34;offender&#34; is over-scheduling kid&#39;s activities. So many kids in my area have their days booked solid with sports, academic tutoring, music lessons.  Approaching zero free time to enjoy being a kid.Edit - and this isn&#39;t really a western thing, &#34;Tiger Mom&#34; and similar probably pre-dates this behavior in the US."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking as a parent of 5. Parental mental health has a much bigger effect on the child than choice of methodologies. You really need to look after yourself before you can look after them - so if you are suffering from sleep deprivation, doing what you have to do is the right thing to do.Put your own oxygen mask on first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I commend Firefox for trying to do this... but it worries me.3 obvious holes:- Proliferation of dialogs. When you don&#39;t know whether a site will suddenly break or not, standard users will be implicitly trained to say yes to all dialogs.- Domain &#34;homogenizing&#34; (spoofing) services will win. Trackers that offer a widget you can install on your server will win. Facebook et all will still know where they sent you, and will be able to track you server side. If mozilla provide a centralized whitelist, then SSO providers who also provide trackers will win. Essentially, the big players will find a way, the little players (who users weren&#39;t worried about anyway) will still lose.- The web will break. SSO will be broken for a good couple of months on over 50% of websites using it - possibly more. &#34;This only works in Google Chrome&#34; will become more and more popular. Potentially, Firefox doesn&#39;t have the market share to make this work.Those of us who will stick with Firefox regardless are in for a world of pain, and not a lot of gain. I guess it&#39;s necessary to move the web on, but the pessimist in me doesn&#39;t see that happening any time soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what you want is essentially an entirely fresh browser session for every website you visit. Pretty mind-boggling to what lengths we need to go in order to prevent companies from tracking us. That said most tracking companies seem to have devised strategies to construct fingerprints from data like IP addresses, user-agent strings and any other meta-data they can get their hands on, so the next step will probably be to restrict what kind of information can be learned about the browser environment via JS (e.g. getting exact screen resolution).Also, data exfiltration via browser extensions is still not a solved problem, there are very popular extensions (Ghostery for example) that are highly privileged in the browser and often collect a ridiculous amount of data. Really can&#39;t get my head around why browser vendors still allow that while being so strict on all other forms of tracking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This needs to be bypassed to use SSO, to bypass it the SSO providers site will need to ask for Storage Access, in some cases the user will be asked for permission…“After the user has granted access, Firefox will remember the storage permission for 30 days.”So lay users will get used to just clicking through and blindly granting the permission.The end result will be an additional step for trackers, and a bunch of headaches for all the legit services that get broken from this change.I’m all for less tracking but this doesnt seem like a good solution."</p>

The SAME binary. Quite frankly, that sentence doesn&#39;t even make sense to me.Check out https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/index.ht...As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is literal magic. Look at the magic numbers:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love reading Justine&#39;s code. It comes up from time to time here and it just makes me happy. It reminds me of the passage from &#34;Programming Sucks&#34; by Still Drinking [1]  Every programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It’s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.

  This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It’s concise. It doesn’t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.

Her work is always just a little bit trippy in a good way haha.[1] http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unless I am reading this incorrectly, I think this paragraph better summerizes the article versus the headline:&#34;In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape users’ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Google’s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.&#34;It doesn&#39;t seem like the complaint is that Chrome collects data on you in &#34;Incognito&#34; mode, rather that websites (e.g. Google Analytics) still collect on you in &#34;Incognito&#34; mode."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People often defend companies with explanations of how the world is, when common folk often expect (or just want) the world to behave differently.Is it unreasonable to want, or even expect, an incognito window to disable all forms of tracking?Wouldn&#39;t the world be far better if a phone alerted me to an app scanning my local area network or contacts? Or if I got warnings when it took such actions?I think us tech folks need to, collectively, stop defending companies reasoning and explanations for the world they created, and start standing with and for a world which matches common folks expectations. It really seems like a better world.---EDIT: Ask what the layperson would think tracking is! Imagining the answer is pretty simple &#34;a website [or the web at large] learning or remembering anything about me.&#34; If we start from there, rather than the mumbo-jumbo thrown at us, we can make progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate tracking as much as the next person, but a simple reading of the &#34;You&#39;ve gone incognito&#34; screen ought to make obvious that its primary purpose is to hide your activity from others who use the same device. It&#39;s literally written on the first line:&#34;Now you can browse privately, and other people who use this device won&#39;t see your activity.&#34;It goes on to list other technical specifics about what is not saved, but those are pretty much just sub-points. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s fair to expect Incognito to do something it&#39;s not meant to do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work on a 3-person DevOps team that just finished migrating ~20 services from GCE vms running docker-compose to GKE.It&#39;s taken us a little over a year. Partly because K8s has a steep learning curve, but also because safely transitioning services without disrupting product teams adds a lot of overhead.The investment is already yielding great returns. Developers are happy. Actual quote: &#34;Kubernetes is the biggest quality-of-life improvement I&#39;ve experienced in my career.&#34;The same is true for me as a DevOps engineer. I never have to write a script to orchestrate a rolling deployment ever again. I&#39;ll never have to touch Puppet or wrangle OS upgrades. I no longer need to use Terraform to scale out a service.Now that we&#39;ve completed this transition, one of my goals for the next year is to get the team to a place where we spend 75% of our time on higher-level projects -- working on developer tools and Kubernetes extensions and setting site reliability standards, instead of the firefighting and operational work that has traditionally taken up so much of our time. Couldn&#39;t be happier about this change.... That is until management decides we&#39;re overhead and fires us to free up budget for feature developers. ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand their rationale. We manage thousand Kubernetes clusters and end-users can find lots and lots of creative way to shoot themselves in the foot:- I can store anything in a secret? Let&#39;s have thousands of cat images. Etcd then stops working because we have over 2GB of funny cats in the key store.- I can run a root Pod? Lets mount the docker socket and start building images with it. Oh and by the way, I never clean those up and my Node simply fills up. Also I add some additional docker networks that break Pod to Pod networks.- Istio is nice - why we don&#39;t add automatic injection for Pods in all namespaces? Including kube-system? And then they brick kube-proxy and the cluster stops working.- I can use validating webhooks for better security? Lets watch on all resources. To keep it more secure lets set the failure policy of the webhook to Fail, so we never admit any modification without the apiserver to make a call to out webhook. Whats that? My single replica webhook has was evicted from the Pod (we didn&#39;t add any resource requests and limits) and now it cannot even be created or scheduled because kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler cannot update their lease and they lost leadership and now are idling, effectively bricking the entire cluster.Google would reduce the pain points with this change, however they would still face countless other issues with Kubernetes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember trying out docker sometime back in late 2013. Something about it never fully stuck with me. I always felt like the final boundary for a piece software should be the process, not the computer. Plopping an entire VM into a zipfile and saying &#34;here&#39;s your software&#34; felt like lazy engineering to many of us at the time (and still today).For our current stack, the answer has been to make the entire business application run as a single process. We also use a single (mono) repository because it is a natural fit with the grain of the software.As far as I am aware, there is no reason a single process cannot exploit the full resources of any computer. Modern x86 servers are ridiculously fast, as long as you can get at them directly. AspNetCore + SQLite (properly tuned) running on a 64 core Epyc serving web clients using Kestrel will probably be sufficient for 99.9% of business applications today. You can handle millions of simultaneous clients without blinking. Who even has that many total customers right now?Horizonal scalability is simply a band-aid for poor engineering in most (not all) applications. The poor engineering, in my experience, is typically caused by underestimating how fast a single x86 thread is and exploring the concurrent &amp; distributed computing rabbit hole from there. It is a rabbit hole that should go unexplored, if ever possible.Here&#39;s a quick trick if none of the above sticks: If one of your consultants or developers tells you they can make your application faster by adding a bunch of additional computers, you are almost certainly getting taken for a ride."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have thoughts, and I agree but also disagree a bit.We are in the dark-ages with respect to streaming sockets, and I am the architect of one of the worlds largest WebSocket and streaming services.First off, unseating the operational benefits provided by request response is a huge challenge. It&#39;s possible, and I&#39;ve done it. One of these days, my co-authors and I will present an OSDI paper with the broad strokes. It&#39;s very easy to list a lot of the challenges with scaling WebSocket, but each of them can be solved.I believe we will have a nicer world with QUIC --&gt; Http/3 and the up and coming WebTransport discussion. SADLY, that will result in a decade long &#34;caniuse&#34; issue, so we should expect to see WebTransport polyfills to arrive...Second, HTML over WebSockets is nice, but what is better is reactive data binding over the socket. Let the browser maintain a DOM tree that templates over a JSON object, then reactive-ly update and it&#39;s an amazing experience. You have minimal data transfer, and minimal rendering updates. There is a great deal of power in having your UI be a stateless function over a giant JSON object.Finally, the big challenge is dealing with the server state in a meaningful way. The exceptionally nice property of using request response for everything is the shared-nothing stateless nature of the web server. It&#39;s exceptionally forgiving in both operational and developer issues.It&#39;s very easy to fuck up the implicit state tied to the connection, and this requires discipline to get right. It&#39;s very easy to ship unreliable software that then has issues based on the connection.Now, I&#39;m a HUGE believer in that we need to use streams for everything, but it requires a mind shift. The key thing to tackle is dealing with the server side state, and this is where I have my shitty idea of a programming language for board games. In essence, I am building a DIY database such that people connect directly to the database and get that sweet giant JSON object along with a stream of updates.The DIY part is related to the fact that I invented a programming language to transact on the JSON object such that you get all the benefits of durability with the mental model of working within a single machine.http://www.adama-lang.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like X Windows protocol over HTTPS with JSON as the wire encoding.It&#39;s sad to think how much effort is spent reimplementing technologies because the IPv4 address space wasn&#39;t large enough.If IP address space were larger, we wouldn&#39;t have needed to rely on Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT became a poor-man&#39;s firewall and effectively blocked peer-to-peer connections making it difficult to host a server at home. This incentivized early ISPs to offer only asymmetric connections that pushed users towards a consumer-only service that crippled early Internet protocols. With the World Wide Web being &#34;the&#34; reason people got on to the Internet in the first place, early NAT-enabled routers focused only on HTTP tunneling, so completed protocols that required inbound connections were finally killed off.Who would have thought that a small IP address space could result in a mass protocol extinction event from which only HTTP and HTML would survive...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seams really optimistic and kind of glosses over the subject of scaling out websocket connections apart from this.Anecdotally, the typical single Rails server process seems to be perfectly happy supporting nearly 4,000 active connections. And you can easily swap in the excellent AnyCable to bump that up to around 10,000+ connections per node by not relying on the built-in Ruby WebSocket server.That&#39;s not a lot of connections on it&#39;s own.  If you are implementing a chat service you&#39;ll still need some form of pub/sub (or something) to glue all of that together when users connect to disparate nodes.AlsoHow about client-side validations? Easy. On every input change, round up the form values and send ’em down the WebSocket.That&#39;s just server side validation.As a disclaimer, I haven&#39;t used any of the HTML over WS frameworks the author discusses, but I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time dealing with scaling socket connections.  It definitely makes the question of scaling horizontally more challenging.  I feel like this article really glosses over that aspect."</p>

You end up thinking of models like clay that you can shape and paint, not triangles with textures.Please, someone, somewhere, spend five years making that an open source project. (Realistically, it&#39;s a bit melancholy that such a project probably won&#39;t ever get made; there&#39;s no incentive to. ZBrush exists, and it has a fine price point.

But that feature was killed by the mass extension breakage in Firefox 57: https://github.com/hackademix/noscript/issues/133#issuecomme...So in a way, this feature can be seen as more than three years overdue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this.It&#39;s whack-a-mole, but better  whack-a-mole to learn-to-love-the-mole.Another way to think of it besides the futility of whack-a-mole is, it&#39;s pushback, resistance, sand in the gears. It&#39;s making an undesired behavior less valuable. Yes you didn&#39;t stop sites from including analytics, yes tomorrow google will have some counter move, but that doesn&#39;t mean the effort was pointless. If you can exert a 5% pressure on some system and maybe only get a 5% reaction, that&#39;s perfectly fine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey folks, I&#39;ve recently had the idea of building an e-ink laptop from the devices I had at home. I decided to document the process and share each step of the way:Some of the posts planned for the series are: Dasung Paperlike HD-FT teardown, Thinkpad T480 teardown, Creating the prototype, Installing and configuring NixOS, M-x e-ink-laptop-modeIf you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has anybody tried to retrofit a transflector into a laptop LCD screen? I&#39;ve got no idea if this is even possible but I&#39;d love to be able to just trigger a brightness=0 and see a smartwatch-type display that doesn&#39;t strain my eyes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can use Parabola-rM[1] with a reMarkable 1 tablet as an all-in-one solution, and like the T480 can be totally freedom-respecting using only libre software.[1]: http://www.davisr.me/projects/parabola-rm/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read about Taler a few years back, and I&#39;m excited to see that it is still under development.In my opinion, for those of us who aren&#39;t anti-government, Taler represents an ethical future of digital spending:It is interoperable, so unlike our current Visa situation, the free market should be able to bid down payment fees to a fair rate. It&#39;s insane to me that Visa and Mastercard have basically positioned themselves as exclusive middlemen on the vast majority of digital transactions, in an age when so much commerce necessarily is digital.It offers privacy that Visa / PayPal / etc cannot.It makes income traceable in a way that bitcoin does not, to facilitate lawful taxation.It is inherently scalable in a way that bitcoin arguably is not (bitcoin has offchain scaling mechanisms, sure, but if you&#39;re being honest it&#39;s a stretch)It&#39;s not introducing a new currency or coin that will be endlessly speculated on, unlike most every crypto solution out there (even stablecoins rely on eth or others for transaction fees)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are the core principles behind Taler: https://taler.net/en/principles.htmlNote: Taler is not a cryptocurrency. It&#39;s an electronic payment system."</p>
