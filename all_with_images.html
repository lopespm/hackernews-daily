								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of the tweets that are quoted in the article have been removed. For example, Twitter employee Cristina Angeli is mentioned in the story for having tweeted an image of &#34;staff members... flooding an internal Slack channel with blue heart emojis as they wait to learn their fate tomorrow&#34;, but that tweet is deleted on twitter itself because &#34;This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.&#34;This is ironic if you consider all the complaining that Musk does in the public sphere about &#34;freedom of speech&#34; (I know that the first amendment only applies to government censorship, but Musk likes to pretend not to), but it&#39;s also significant because -Smart journalists are going to stop relying on Twitter&#39;s API now. News and blog sites love to render Twitter URLs as a preview of the tweet; but if Twitter under Musk is going to start removing tweets that go against its corporate interests of the hour (is it against Twitter policy to post screenshots of any corporate Slack channel, or only Twitter&#39;s own?), then people had better take screenshots of the tweets they want to quote, just in case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And so the grand experiment begins. I feel bad for the folks losing their job because that always sucks, and I hope there&#39;s a decent severance package.Now we&#39;ll see what happens to Twitter... I hardly use it, so if it implodes it won&#39;t bother me too much. But I am curious to see if all the &#34;how do you need X people to do Y?&#34; commenters are correct in this case. The app is simple but doing simple things at scale is hard. I wonder if we&#39;ll see more downtime and issues now.I think this is also a great experiment for everyone who either thinks Elon is a genius and the greatest thing to bless this Earth,  or those who say he&#39;s overrated and Tesla and SpaceX were successes independent of him. I think Twitter has been around long enough that we&#39;ve all formed impressions of it. Let&#39;s see what this single change of replacing ownership actually results in.Anyone want to make predictions about the state of Twitter in a few years?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Musk and friends compare Twitter to other tech companies and see that it&#39;s ratio of employees to revenue is lowest. He therefore thinks he must halve the number employees and/or increase revenue to get this ratio up.From the chat log exhibits from the Twitter vs Musk case: https://danluu.com/elon-twitter-texts/#47A VC (Jason Calacanis) does back of the envelope calculations:Twitter revenue per employee: $5B rev / 8k employees = $625K rev per employee in 2021Google revenue per employee: $257B rev2/ 135K employee2= $1.9M per employee in 2021Apple revenue per employee: $365B rev / 154k employees= $2.37M per employee in fiscal 2021Twitter revenue per employee if 3k instead of 8k: $5B rev/ 3k employees= $1.66m rev per employee in 2021 (more industry standard)Elon: &#34;Insane potential for improvement&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author of this article is a public defender in the pacific northwest. He sometimes writes for Jesse Singal, but he also has his own substack.[1] Many of his posts provide a unique window into the criminal justice system. If that sounds interesting to you, I strongly recommend reading more of his writing. In my opinion, his greatest hits are Eleven Magic Words[2] and Death of a Client[3].1. https://ymeskhout.substack.com/2. https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/eleven-magic-words-unlocked3. https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/death-of-a-client"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PayPal is such a weird company. I was a loyal customer for 20 years until I wanted to convert my account from business to personal (I closed the business) and the site refused to do so. after months of calls with support, it became clear that no one was able to do this (something locked the flow and no one was able to see what; I guess my account was so ancient, it has some db flags no longer used but still checked by their backend?), so I asked just to terminate my account. That also was not possible. It took 6 months to figure out why; my company still existed they said; it most certainly did not. It took 2 months to find out why they thought that; apparently, somewhere in the past 20 years, they searched for my company in the NL company register and attached the wrong company number to my account. So I told them the real number and they said; now all is fine, we can even convert it to personal. 1 hour later I received an email from PayPal that I am permanently banned as I am trading with a business account of which the company no longer exists… Well done!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; the contract you “agreed” to means you are legally not allowed to take them to a real court. Your only recourse is arbitration.americans can sign away their rights to sue at their own courts? That seems wrong.For me, as a german, the paypal contract reads that i can escalate a conflict to the EU consumer protection agency or the french regulatory authority for financial institutions (which signs their banking license). It further reads that the governing body of law and court of of justice should be in Wales, but that this does not limit my consumer right to sue at my local court. No arbitration clause, especially no mandatory arbitration with an agency of the corporations choice.I do understand the idea that private arbitration may be cheaper than court proceedings, but is mandatory arbitration  even legally enforceable, or is that just scary text a court would overrule?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is my &#34;if I won the lottery&#34; dream.  Which it would have to be, since everything about it isn&#39;t cheap. Purchasing a Pullman car then upgrading it to Amtrak standards will cost at least $300k. Any interior upgrades are on top of that (renovating the galley with modern appliances, adding central air since some cars used block ice for cooling). Amtrak requires you add 480v head-end power (but you will likely want a diesel generator too), door control/communication wiring, and to upgrade the braking system.Once you have your car and you have passed your annual inspection, you will need somewhere to park it, which usually means finding a short-line railroad or commercial business with a siding near you, and paying them a fee. Getting the car from there to the nearest Amtrak station will require you to hire a locomotive with crew (some tracks require a second car coupled to the locomotive so crossings &amp; signals work correctly). Amtrak then has a whole schedule of fees they will charge you, from $4.09 per mile, overnight parking, fresh &amp; wastewater servicing, transponder tags, and parking fees.You will want to hire a chef to prepare your meals and perhaps also a steward to serve the meals, make drinks, and take care of the staterooms. I&#39;m not sure if they need to belong to the union since they would be your employees, not the railroads (but probably).For the less than 100 private cars in operation in America, why does Amtrak even offer this service? Like the first class section on an airliner, it&#39;s effectively all profit for them since the train was going there anyway and the extra fuel to haul it &amp; supply power is minimal.  Personally I wonder why Amtrak doesn&#39;t offer a &#34;Presidential&#34; fare, where 6 or so people can book a private car and get truly top tier service.Here&#39;s what a restored Pullman car can look like:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdroQ4JqlYQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We rode the New York Central 3, a private car built for a Vanderbilt a century ago, cross country, attached to the rear of the Lake Shore Limited, changing in Chicago to the California Zephyr. A great experience, watching the scenery go by for 4 days, with a 270-degree view from the sitting room in the rear.Basically, there are hobbyists who buy and upgrade these cars, and try to break even on chartering trips on them.  They’re clearly never happier than coming along for the journey (you need an official liaison on board anyway to interface with Amtrak staff) and fixing stuff along the way.http://www.nyc-3.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some of you might be interested in The Hacker Zephyr, a cross-country train hackathon with 42 teenagers from across the world.We worked with Amtrak and an amazing team of train enthusiasts to get 3 vintage train cars on The California Zephyr’s route across the US. We started in Vermont and ended in Los Angeles, traveling 3,502 miles over 10 days.Short documentary: https://youtu.be/2BID8_pGuqAPlanning documents and finances are open source at https://github.com/hackclub/the-hacker-zephyr"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve used RSS to follow all media for the past 2 years (FreshRSS+FeedMe, I have a guide here https://soapstone.mradford.com/hn-rss-guide/). It&#39;s been the single best thing I&#39;ve done to reclaim my attention. Here&#39;s a couple of other random thoughts:- Being able to dismiss articles where the headline is the story is really valuable. For example, I just dismissed &#34;Twitter’s mass layoffs have begun (techcrunch.com)&#34;- it&#39;s not worth my attention.- It&#39;s possible to accrue a large backlog of unread &#34;semi-interesting&#34; items that may or may not be valuable. In this sense, there&#39;s still a FOMO aspect to RSS, and you have to be aggressive in dismissing articles. For exmaple, a few 2-week-old backlog titles in my feed include &#34;SHA-3 Buffer Overflow&#34;, &#34;Show HN: Restfox - Open source lightweight alternative to Postman&#34;, and &#34;Five origami books by Shuzo Fujimoto are now public domain&#34;. These are semi-interesting, but really I should just dismiss them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I make heavy use of https://kill-the-newsletter.com/ to convert e-mail newsletters into RSS feeds -- IMO the RSS reader context is way better than an email inbox for consuming newslettery content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HN is a great place to gather RSS feeds. Any time there&#39;s an interesting site I always look for them. These days I usually see articles that appear on the HN front page a day or so before they hit HN. But HN isn&#39;t the only place I practice this. Back in the 2010s it was obvious reddit was going under so I did the same there till 2015. I have 1000+ RSS feeds now and very little need for news aggregators on the day to day (except finding new feeds).QuiteRSS is an excellent native reader that handles my thousands of feeds well. It is so multi-platform it even has an OS/2 version. https://quiterss.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Linked lists are great. But they have the problem that, almost always, whatever problem you&#39;re trying to solve would be better done with a regular resizable vector.This includes problems that they should be great for, like insert into the middle or the front.The reason is that in practice the way computers actually work is that there is an enormous time penalty for jumping around randomly in memory, and it&#39;s large enough that it&#39;s often worth paying a O(lg n) cost to switch to something that will be contiguous in memory and allow the CPU to prefetch data.There are exceptions when you really should use an actual linked list, but your default should be a vector and not a linked list."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I thought of writing this blog post full of all the things I love about linked lists.The blog post is short, and I think the author covered about everything.Yeah, linked lists are sometimes appropriate, especially intrusive linked lists (the author called them &#34;embedded&#34; linked lists). The hate they get is a backlash against CS programs that introduce people to them early and don&#39;t emphasize enough the reasons you should usually pick something else. If we have to err on one side or the other, I&#39;d rather it be telling people not to use them.btw:&gt; Redis can be wrong, but both Redis and the Linux kernel can’t.Yes, they can, and I&#39;d rather avoid argument from authority altogether."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, the linked lists that are useful are intrusive linked lists where the data you care about has a next/previous embedded pointer as opposed to an just storing an arbitrary object inside a linked list.One example would be if your thread structure has these embedded pointers, you can easily add/remove a thread to a linked list of threads waiting for some resource without any allocation just by pointer manipulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It compiles a custom kernel for every operation, allowing extreme shape specialization.This doesn&#39;t matter.  Just look at the performance achieved by CuDNN kernels (which back PyTorch), they&#39;re dynamically shaped and hit near peak.  For dense linear algebra at the size of modern neural networks, optimizing for the loop bound condition won&#39;t help much.&gt; All tensors are lazy, so it can aggressively fuse operations.This matters.  PyTorch teams are trying to implement that now (they have LazyTensor, AITemplate, TorchDynamo), but I&#39;m not sure of the status (it&#39;s been tried repeatedly).&gt; The backend is 10x+ simpler, meaning optimizing one kernel makes everything fast.The first part of that sentence matters, the second part doesn&#39;t.  Kernels are already fast and their reuse outside of being fused into each other (which you need a full linear algebra compiler to do) isn&#39;t very high.  If you make sum fast, you have not made matrix multiplication fast even though MM has a sum in it.  It just isn&#39;t that easy to compose operations and still hit 80+% of hardware efficiency.But it is easier to iterate fast and build a seamless lazy compiler if your backend is simple.  You can pattern match more easily and ensure you handle edge cases without insanely complicated things like alias analysis (which PyTorch has to do)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"    &gt; It&#39;s extremely simple, and breaks down the most complex networks into 4 OpTypes:
    &gt;
    &gt; - UnaryOps operate on one tensor and run elementwise. RELU, LOG, RECIPROCAL, etc...
    &gt; - BinaryOps operate on two tensors and run elementwise to return one. ADD, MUL, etc...
    &gt; - ReduceOps operate on one tensor and return a smaller tensor. SUM, MAX
    &gt; - MovementOps operate on one tensor and move the data around, copy-free with ShapeTracker. RESHAPE, PERMUTE, EXPAND, etc...
    &gt;
    &gt; But how...where are your CONVs and MATMULs? Read the code to solve this mystery.

Ok, I was curious, so I read the code. The answer is that it represents a MATMUL as a 1x1 CONV. And it lied about CONV, which is a ProcessingOps.CONV and explicitly represented and implemented: https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/c0050fab8ff0bc667e40... Quite the letdown of figuring out this &#39;mystery&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must say they gained instant credibility with the minimalistic website given how fast it loaded.Code looks simple and easy to follow, and I love how the comments are constantly mentioning hardware characteristics, making maxing the hardware the goal. It seems that it’s trying to achieve this by jitting optimal code for the operations at hand rather than hand-optimizing kernels, and betting that the small number of operations will make tuning the codegen tractable.I haven’t kept up much with what’s happening in ML, but at least in the realm of columnar database engines, interpreting a series of hand-optimized kernels seems to be the dominant approach over compiling a vectorized query plan. Are compilers good enough at optimizing ML operations that specializing on input shape makes a difference over hand-tuned kernels?"</p>

This was how it worked until the early 2000s. Google and Amazon weren&#39;t evil back then. Microsoft was actively developing IE and had good intentions after it won the browser war. Almost everything was decentralized."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an interesting thing: there are other fields too. People tend to forget we need Civil Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Electronic Engineers, etc... This is not the end of the world. STEM professionals were switching careers because of the money and other amenities tech companies were offering (See &#34;a day in x-company&#34; trend on social media).The way I see it (cynical take) is that there has been a push to get lots of people in this field just to have a bigger pool of workers and lower SWE/Dev Salaries. Heck, small companies can&#39;t compete on salary + benefits when trying to pouch SWEs/Devs. For these companies, this scenario will be a God send since they could offer lower salaries (45k ~ 70k) but with the added value of WFH. My prediction: We&#39;ll see everything ramping up  again in 2024 (Prob. Q1). On the other side, tech companies will start lowering salaries, taking advantage of the uncertainty. Basically win-win for companies."</p>

I think they would sue the heck out of me if I did that, and I believe the opposite should be true as well.I’m sure my own open source code is in that thing.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I never really appreciated the relationship and importance of bandwidth, latency and packet loss until I had to move a small office from all on-prem infrastructure to completely cloud based at a regional data centre, about 10 years ago. And I mean completely. locally we had firewall, router, riverbed, UPS that&#39;s it for max 40 people. No data at rest (besides riverbed cache) due to security.We had ridiculous bandwidth for the time, which users knew, and they would often come and ask &#34;why can I stream youtube in HD but accessing my document/file takes ages&#34; (ages being anything more than 2-3 seconds). A perfectly valid question. The answer was usually &#34;illegal fishing&#34;, or &#34;sharks&#34;. If the primary sub-sea cable was cut, we&#39;d have to route through another which would add at least 400ms round trip extra.Luckily this was a well known risk/issue for our parent company who had a team dedicated to negotiating peering and routing between office locations and their nearest regional DCs (these were not azure, aws, etc. usually local IX or Teclco). But they couldn&#39;t do anything about the sharks :(."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Folks ITT will talk about watches that are similar in hardware, but what was magic about Pebble was the software and ecosystem. The OS was just a delight to use, fast, wonderfully animated, and let you sideload whatever you want.I&#39;ve tried a couple of Garmin watches (Vivoactive 3 and Forerunner 55) and the Amazfit Bip, and this is where they all fall completely flat. The UX is just horrible by comparison. It&#39;s like these companies have no regard for designing the OS UX and are just trying to cram features in.And the fact that companies want to make touchscreen watches is just with few/no buttons is baffling to me. Tapping tiny buttons on a tiny screen is a horrible experience. And there&#39;s tons of moving targets because of the tiny amount of real-estate.Pebble _just got it_ with the 2.0 OS and beyond. They were a joy to use.I begrudgingly have gone back to using an Apple Watch, because despite being subpar, the UX is somewhat together these days, just enough to be tolerable. When I move away from iOS again, I&#39;ll probably either pull out an old Pebble that still has some battery life, or a Casio GBD200, which isn&#39;t really a smartwatch but ticks some major boxes for me (always-on-display, silent vibration alarm, and timers, chief among them). The GBD200 runs on a coin cell too, so I never have to worry about charging or a replacement being difficult to find!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a big Pebble fan, I was really sad to see the company go without any similar alternatives in the market (at the time). My watches ended up having various hardware issues over the years, so I switched to something else. The efforts Rebble has put in to keep these devices alive is amazing. If they grow bigger, I&#39;d love to see them do hardware.In the meantime, I&#39;m wearing a Withings ScanWatch [0]. Not as extendable as a Pebble, but it has some features I care about and doesn&#39;t distract me.[0] https://www.withings.com/ch/en/scanwatch"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That few?I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of Pebble, the company - they didn&#39;t sell replacement parts, for instance (the watch for geeks? yeah, sure).For some crazy reason, though, to this day, this watch is still almost the only one that gets such a basic thing right: Telling the damn time.The formula is as simple as it is unreplicated:- Always telling the time- Good battery life- ButtonsWhy nobody else makes such a watch is a mystery to me. The Amazfit Bip comes close, but it requires touch interaction and doesn&#39;t look as nice as the Pebble Time Steel. It&#39;s also supported by GadgetBridge though and also does heart rate tracking while having much better battery life (while being smaller!). When my Bip broke after a few months I bought another (5 years old at this point!) Pebble and am pretty happy with it. I could use some heart rate tracking, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context for those who don&#39;t follow Rust development closely:This release stabilises Generic Associated Types (GATs), a limited form of Higher Kinded Types. This is only an MVP release, but it already includes enough to be useful, and has been a huge multi-year effort (the RFC for the feature dates to April 2016).Novice users of Rust probably won&#39;t use this feature directly, but it gives a lot more power to library authors to write more flexible APIs while still keeping all of Rust&#39;s strict correctness guardrails (i.e. exposing a safe API). It will also form the basis of the upcoming &#34;async functions in traits&#34; feature.This is probably the most significant Rust release in the last couple of years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know GAT is a &#34;bigger feature&#34; for the language but personally I&#39;m most excited about `let else`. It is very common to write code such as:  let foo = match do_something() {
    Ok(f) =&gt; f,
    Err(e) =&gt; {
      // Do some error handling, maybe log a warning, maybe skip this item and continue...
    }
  };

This small change makes that so much more clear, removes the silly first row and removes a level of indentation.  let Ok(foo) = do_something() else {
    // Do some error handling, maybe log a warning, maybe skip this item and continue...
  };"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"`let else` looks strange to my eyes on first glance, but I can remember many cases when it would have been nice to have. (Not to mention, all Rust syntax used to look strange to my eyes so that&#39;s not a very useful criterion).Break from labeled blocks is a pretty niche thing. I can remember a few cases it would have been useful, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll remember the feature exists next time it comes up.I&#39;m glad that GATs are finally here. I tend to be wary of complex type-system things. I can remember being a new rust programmer around 1.0, dealing with some library with a perhaps-overly-clever API with complex traits and lifetimes and being very frustrated randomly changing code trying to get it to compile. It didn&#39;t help that rustc error messages and rustdoc weren&#39;t as good and we didn&#39;t have any sort of language server back then. Perhaps I&#39;m just not very smart. But even with my focus on simply-typed APIs I&#39;ve run into several cases where I couldn&#39;t do something the obvious way because it needed GATs.I used to be a lot more involved with Rust, reading a lot of /r/rust and blog posts and issue trackers. I get a warm wistful feeling seeing things like GATs, rust-analyzer, and MIR inlining get stabilized after all these years."</p>

And when they do, they multiply, this process is often faster than most people realize.The problem rarely are the bacteria themselves, but the byproducts of their own metabolism, that can be benign is trace quantities and harmful in larger quantities.The immune system also constantly monitors and reacts to those byproducts and bacteria population.What we usually call Lactose intolerance or Gluten sensitivity is in practice an indirect effect of some species of bacteria digesting those, and then the reaction of your immune system.Overall, the gut microbiome is a fascinating and complex subject, unfortunately often oversimplified or misunderstood.As an example, we&#39;ve often been told to eat more fibers to increase &#34;flow&#34;, the flow increase is because the fibers are digested by bacteria and the mild toxicity of the process forces the digestive system to flush everything.Same with Sorbitol (contained in dried prunes and often used as a soft laxative) but even more toxic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Exposure to saccharin and sucralose significantly impaired glycemic response, but this was not seen with the aspartame or stevia groups. None of the blood markers show real changes in any group except for insulin levels going up in the glucose and stevia groups (and since everyone was getting glucose as part of the dosing, that suggests a lowering of the glucose-driven insulin response overall).What does impairing glycemic response mean, exactly?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is happening more and more frequently in my locale. Several of my friends and many of my neighbors have had their catalytic converters stolen.It&#39;s good to see something is done. Let&#39;s hope this steamrolls into a nationwide manhunt for these criminals. They should also consider targeting and auditing shops that buy used car parts. Making it extremely difficult to fence these things will be practical and useful because they aren&#39;t sold and reused as is - the rare earth metals are extracted. Something your average criminal won&#39;t be capable of doing in their garage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I may be misreading this but the margins look insane. DG Auto paid like 38 million USD for stolen converters, performed a simple extraction process, then sold the precious metals for 550 million USD. Wow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think taking down the buyers is a the best tool we have right now for this issue.And there are things we could do to make that easier, like putting a serial number on the converter on new cars and replacement parts. Requiring the make, model, and serial number of the car it was removed from, and a web site with a DB that has the ID number of cars they&#39;ve been stolen from so buyers could check it.Make those who buy and sell and steal them pay for it. For new car buyers all they be paying for is the addition of the serial number. Can&#39;t add much cost to engrave those during production."</p>

The snap has been gone for almost a month, with seemingly no information given to the maintainer or users about why, except a belated &#34;we removed it for policy reasons&#34; 21 days ago. And if this happens to maintainers associated with Snapcrafters, imagine how you&#39;re treated if you&#39;re just some random person or company who maintains your own snap.This is the sort of reason why people are concerned about an ecosystem where Canonical has 100% of the control of the only distribution mechanism. I suppose this is just a confirmation of the legitimacy of those fears."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading the thread, I still have no idea why it got removed, so: why did it get removed? What part(s) of the snap policies did they violate, and how is it possible that even something doesn&#39;t charge $100 a year before you can even publish a snap doesn&#39;t even notify the maintainers that their app got removed? Just because you run an app store doesn&#39;t mean Apple and Google&#39;s opaque refusal system is the part you should take inspiration from, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a proper way to solve this issue, not specific to python but languages running in a VM in general, would be to have some sort of language support where you specifically define what access rights/ system resources you allow for any given dependency.Example of defining project dependencies:  {
    &#34;apollo-client&#34;: {
      &#34;version&#34;: &#34;...&#34;,
      &#34;access&#34;: [&#34;fetch&#34;] // only fetch allowed
    },
    &#34;stringutils&#34;: {
       &#34;version&#34;: &#34;...&#34;,
       &#34;access&#34;: [] // no system resources allowed for this dependency, own or transitive
    },
    ...
  }

It would probably require the language to limit monkey-patching core primitives (such as Object.prototype in javascript),
and it would be more cumbersome for the developer to define the permissions it gives to each dependency.
These required permissions could be listed on the package site (eg npm or PyPI) and the developer would just copy paste the permissions when adding the dependency.
But if you upgrade a dependency version and it now requires a permission that seems suspicious (eg &#34;stringutils&#34; needing &#34;filesystem&#34;), it would prompt the developer to stop and investigate, or if it seems justified add the permission to &#34;access&#34; list."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a previous HN discussion on the topic of rogue Python packages, readers had suggested bubblewrap and firejail for sandboxing. They limit the access a script and its packages have to your filesystem and network.I think that&#39;s the better approach - just assume all packages are malicious by default. Can&#39;t rely on scanners because of the large number of packages and attacks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started to develop only inside VMs, with a full Desktop, IDE, browser etc. inside the virtual machine.There have been to many contaminations of major package repos lately. Only one typo in an import statement up the dependency chain and you’d be compromised."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Indian-American father here, living in the Bay Area. My wife and I came to this country with a few hundred dollars between us and have worked hard to reach where we’re at. We&#39;re far from privileged.I am 100% against affirmative action on the basis of race. I think there should be some measure of AA on the basis of economic status. It&#39;s quite personal for me this year.My 17-year old is applying to universities to study CS for fall 2023. We live in a highly competitive school district. He&#39;s hardworking and studious, as reflected in his 4.0 GPA and perfect 1600 SAT score (thankfully, some schools like MIT have brought back the SAT.) He has always taken the hardest possible AP and college-level classes and has strong extracurriculars. In a normal world, his chances of getting into top-ranked CS programs (Stanford, Berkeley, MIT) would be decent, but we&#39;re Indian-American and are considered over-represented on elite college campuses.Our school counselor and other parents we&#39;ve have spoken with have flat-out advised us to: Apply to more lower-tier schools. Amongst the elites, target &#34;hard STEM&#34; schools like MIT, Caltech, Harvey Mudd, where he’s more likely to get a fair shot (Asians are 40+% of the incoming class at these places.) Forget the Ivies — the last thing they want is “another smart Indian male” (the counselor&#39;s words, not mine.) You see, that won’t help with “diversity.”Also — we use a system called Collegevine to keep track of applications. Applicants can input their GPA, SAT scores, extracurriculars etc. to understand their acceptance rate at specific universities based on historical data. For my son, keeping everything else the same but simply changing his race from Asian to Black/Hispanic increases his chances of getting in at the above elite schools from 4-8% to 60+%. I am not making this up — you can test this yourself.Is it fair to penalize my son for working hard and being an excellent student?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most pernicious consequences of this fixation on race is the definition of a person by an arbitrary social construct. Although they all check the same box, they have very different experiences and cultural backgrounds:* Black descendents of slaves vs African immigrants [1]* Chinese Americans vs Hmong Americans (a higher poverty rate than Black Americans! [2])* A Korean who grew up in Koreatown LA vs one who grew up in Utah* A Boston Brahmin vs an impoverished White Virginian whose family members were targeted by eugenic boardsThat said, Affirmative Action can reasonably make those from marginalized groups feel more welcome. In elementary school for example, I felt very out place among the largely affluent members of my accelerated math class. By contrast, I related much more to the mischievous truants who would later go on to be low-level criminals.[1] - https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/us/top-colleges-take-more...[2] - https://tcf.org/content/commentary/misleading-data-policies-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the youngens here on HN: TomTom was once one of the leading manufacturers of GPS navigation systems for cars - purchased as an accessory that was stuck to the wind screen. This was in a time before every car had a screen built in, and before everyone had a smart phone with Google Maps in their pocket.I guess that product is a prime example for becoming irrelevant by society progressing. I actually still use an old TomTom in my old car that doesn&#39;t have a screen (well, it does, but didn&#39;t come with a GPS built in - adding it after the fact would have been around 1000£), since I don&#39;t have a smart phone. But it has been years since I updated the maps, probably wouldn&#39;t even be supported any more?!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at Tele Atlas/TomTom until 10 years ago. There is literally nothing new in this announcement except that they are going to &#34;steal&#34; data from OSM now.sensor derived data, user generated content, camera vans all of that is not new. All this existed when I left, so did the people mentioned in this announcement that are still running the show. I always hoped they would eventually realize that they need a fresh top management, but they seem to just keep doing the same old stuff with the same old people until the final collapse of the company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems really well built. It&#39;s fast and responsive. It looks nice. But I just don&#39;t understand what I would use it for.It seems like the idea is to build a database of people, movies, Wikipedia articles and such and then be able to find them via search/links. But I&#39;m not at all sold on why I need this in my life.Is there a way to make the value clearer? Am I just not in the target audience? Who is going to see this and say &#34;TAKE MY MONEY&#34; and why?I&#39;m thinking of products that were instant sign-ups for me...Spotify: For one price, listen to all the music on Earth whenever you want. TAKE MY MONEY!Gmail: Fast email with 2 GB storage. This was such an instant sign-up they had to make an invite system to slow people getting access.Maybe could add something like Lichess: Chess training and games, with modern UX, offered open source as a public good. I mean, if you&#39;re at all interested in chess, that&#39;s an instant sign-up, right?Trying to say, this idea of presenting a clear value isn&#39;t limited to big players like Spotify and Gmail, but can also be done by smaller companies if the value presented is really clear.What should someone see that makes them instantly recognize they need this in their life, because that&#39;s what I&#39;m totally missing here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a beautiful branding. The UX seems to be very intuitive. I would love to try it without registration. Since you store the data in the browser, have you considered offering a fully offline version that doesn&#39;t need registration for users to get hooked? I would like to postpone syncing until the data becomes valuable.To me, it would also be important that the data is stored in an encrypted form on the server and that the key remains in the browser and has to be stored by me.Personally, I would like to have the option to discover people who work on similar notes, think travel app [1] for mental journeys. It would also be nice to have some social features like voting on links or sharing notes or sets of notes so that others can annotate them. Bonus points if those social features use an open protocol so that users from other note taking apps can join.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33344734"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Bart, Proton CTO here. For clarity, the issue mentioned here only impacts Proton Mail Bridge, our desktop IMAP/SMTP gateway to Proton Mail encrypted email.The fact that Bridge and its client can become desynchronized sporadically for some users is a high priority issue we have been working on. Bridge is open source, and as a result relies upon open-source components, and the root cause is an architectural issue in a library that Bridge uses to implement IMAP. When there are network issues, this library returns errors to email clients.Unfortunately, there are hundreds of email clients, and some email clients don’t handle errors properly, and this leads to desynchronization.Our error tracking shows this does not happen often (1-2% of Bridge users) and the symptom is usually incorrect display of messages or read/unread status which is fixed with an inbox resynchronization. There are cases where a combination of a desynchronized mailbox and a specific series of user actions can lead to accidental email deletion, but this is far rarer than desynchronization. Our implementation tries as hard as possible to avoid this. If you find you are missing an email, our implementation works around the issue by placing it in a users’ All Mail folder.As Bridge is open source, updates on this issue have always been publicly posted on GitHub. Addressing this issue at the source requires replacing the core IMAP library. Unfortunately, there are no FOSS IMAP libraries that are sufficiently well maintained. Therefore, the solution is to build our own IMAP library called Gluon, which we have been focusing on since this issue was reported to us. You can follow the progress of this open-source project here: https://github.com/ProtonMail/gluonWe are not refusing to fix the problem. The only possible solution is writing a new open-source IMAP library which we can maintain ourselves to ensure this class of errors cannot occur again. We have doubled the size of the team working on this this year so it is a priority for us.We’re confident that this addresses the main sources of desynchronization and will be available in the beta version of Bridge by the end of the year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a bit of context/back-story, Richard, who opened this issue, later also wrote a blog post about the whole ordeal:https://blog.sigma-star.at/post/2022/07/protonmail-adventure...In short: The idea was to move from a custom mail server to a paid, hosted solution. ProtonMail was chosen, with the bridge being used to get mails into a local mail client. Issues with the bridge eventually cropped up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didn&#39;t know what exactly is proton mail bridge. This is what I&#39;ve found:&gt; Proton Mail Bridge is a desktop application that runs in the background, encrypting and decrypting messages as they enter and leave your computer. It lets you add your Proton Mail account to your favorite email client via IMAP/SMTP by creating a local email server on your computer.Source: https://proton.me/mail/bridge"</p>

cannot explain in the way you can with other films.
Let&#39;s say, for example, that I were to
take a knife and stab you in the stomach.
You would howl and scream and you would look at me and say
‘Why did you do it?’ And you would
look in my eyes and you would see
something like an ecstatic convulsion of the soul
and you would know why I did it.
But you cannot say it.
And yet we both know why I did it.
That&#39;s why I think that all these different kinds
of attempts at interpretation are a waste of time.It seems that the conversations are recycled from a pool, because I&#39;ve managed to hit the same conversation upon refreshing a few times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the years so many different jurisdictions around the US and the world have stated their desire to be the &#34;next Silicon Valley&#34; and have poured an immense amount of money and effort to make it so, whether in the form of incentives for businesses, tax breaks, education, job training, or even just straight paying smart people to move there. Every such scheme has generally failed because they refused to emulate the one key piece of California law that is necessary for a startup ecosystem to exist – banning noncompetes.&#34;But I&#39;ll spend money to train my employees and they&#39;ll just take those skills to go work for a competitor or start their own business!&#34; Yes, that&#39;s a feature of the system, not a bug."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Makes a ton of sense.  Completely absurd for security guards and administrative assistants to have non-compete clauses.  Just another way businesses were trying to reduce the willingness of employees to quit so that they can suppress wages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO, companies should have to compensate the employee for the period of the non-compete since they&#39;re still effectively working for them.  Salary limits are okay, but don&#39;t really go far enough.  If they want this it has a value and should be compensated for fairly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ll offer a perspective unrelated to pay: It’s a pain to start learning C++, and even after you do, older devs will roast the hell out of your code because your book/tutorials of choice forgot to mention a crucial (in their opinion) feature that you absolutely should/shouldn’t use! Not to mention you’ve only programmed on Mac/Linux so far &amp; windows is totally different, has a different compiler, different ways to install libraries, different C++ standard features supported, etc.I like C++, and tooling has come a long way, but it’s so much easier to download rust/Python/node and you’re basically set on every platform &amp; immediately ready to go. NOW consider pay, and even someone enthusiastic about programming C++ will reconsider."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a C++ programmer for 25 years. Last 3 years, I&#39;m using Rust language in my daily job and for all my hobby projects. I will not return to work in C++ again. No money can make me to change my decision. Nowadays, programming is a pure joy for me again. This was not the case when I had to work with C++."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has been painfully self-teaching C++ for the last ~1.5 years on and on, these are my hangups:- The features that make C++ decent are often found in C++ 20/23, for which there are woefully few resources- Code taking advantage of coroutines and generators isn&#39;t commonplace yet, rare to find examples- C++ 20 concepts are a near mirror copy of Rust Traits and enable composition that&#39;s an alternative to inheritance, again difficult to find examples of- C++&#39;s way of &#34;implementing&#34; interfaces (IE iterator&lt;T&gt;) by having a magic defined set of type aliases and methods is not intuitive for me- Writing code to control things like parallelization and thread scheduling that&#39;s portable across libraries is difficult. I think std:: executor is supposed to fix this but if I&#39;m manually scheduling threads and I want to use IE oneTBB it&#39;s not obvious how to do this.- Dependency and package management is a nightmare. Need to condense CMake + vcpkg into a Cargo like tool and make it a standard- error messages are indecipherable. GCC 13-dev colors make this a bit better but human-written &#34;ELI-5&#34; errors succinctly explaining the problem and suggesting a solution (like Rust)- flags like &#34;-fsanitize=address,leak,undefined -fanalyzer -Wthread-safety -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=&#34; should be baked in to a default &#34;dev&#34;/&#34;debug&#34; mode newbies shouldn&#39;t need to know/think about- Profiling and instrumenting/monitoring should be a few CLI flags with nice UI visualizers (IE LLVM X-ray)- I have to Google what headers cstd/std stuff comes from half the time"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “I think the 12 MP shooting default is a wise choice on Apple’s part, but it does mean that the giant leap in image quality on iPhone 14 Pro remains mostly hidden unless you choose to use a third party app to shoot 48 MP JPG / HEIC images or shoot in ProRAW and edit your photos later.”This, 100%.The massive difference in image quality is when shooting in RAW. That’s when you actually get the 48MP &amp; the images are fantastic.But that’s not the default. The default is 12MP.That’s why reviewers are so torn on this camera system. If the default was a 48MP picture/quality, everyone would be praising it. But when the default is 12MP, it’s par for the course."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a huge potential for language models to get close to messy text problems (many of which are in Excel and Sheet). I am the founder of promptloop.com - the author of this tweet has been an early user.The challenge to making something like this, or Co-pilot / Ghostwrite, work well is about meeting users where they are. Spreadsheet users dont want to deal with API keys or know what temperature is - but anyone (like this tweet) can set up direct API use with generic models in 10 minutes. This document has all the code to do so ;). [1]For non-engineers - or folks who need a reliable and familiar syntax to use at scale and across their org - promptloop [2] is the best way to do that. All comments in here are great though. We have been live with users since the summer - no waitlist. And as a note - despite the name &#34;prompt engineering&#34; has almost nothing to do with making this work at scale.[1] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lSpiz2dIswCXGIQfE69d...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most sensible use for AI that I can see at this time is for supporting humans in their work, but only where the system is set up so that the human has to do the work first, with the AI system looking for possible errors. For example the human drives the car, and the AI brakes when it senses dangerous conditions ahead, or the human screens test results for evidence of cancer and the AI flags where it disagrees so that the human might take another look. The opposite scenario with AI doing the work and humans checking for errors as is the case here will lead to humans being over reliant on less than perfect systems and producing outcomes with high rates of error. As AI improves and gains trust in a field, it can then replace the human. But this trust has to come from evidence of AI superiority over the long term, not from companies over-selling the reliability of their AI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ability of language models to do zero-shot tasks like this is cool and all, but there is no way you should actually be doing something like this on data you care about.  Like think about how much compute is going into trying to autofill a handful of zip codes, and you&#39;re still getting a bunch of them wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The web pages and git aren&#39;t updated yet, here is the vulnerability straight from the .tar.gz on their FTP:Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions. 
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client
authentication and a malicious client connects.An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the . character (decimal 46) on the
stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). ([CVE-2022-3786])An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a
crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution depending on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
([CVE-2022-3602])-----------------------------------Doesn&#39;t sound that critical to me. CAs normally don&#39;t let you outright construct your own certificate, and I&#39;d expect you&#39;ll have a hard time to get a certificate issued which is both for mail encryption (so you get an email name constraint) and TLS (SAN constraint). And servers without TLS client authentication, which is about 99.99 % of them, aren&#39;t affected. TLS client auth is usually only used in enterprise networks and typically terminated by middleboxes running ancient software anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To put this in perspective, the 18300kg per hour from the Permian site is equivalent (over a 100 time horizon global warming potential) to a 500 Megawatt coal power plant&#39;s CO2 emissions (~1kg of CO2 per kWh of electricity) burning 24/7. Or, to put it another way, it accounts for the same emissions as about 0.3% of the entire US electricity grid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several questions ask to contextualize this measurement.Here&#39;s a highly-cited paper in Nature (including some of the researchers quoted in the OP) that describes how an earlier survey of California methane emissions went:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1720-3If I remember right, the state of CA asked for this survey. It was carried out by an instrument similar to that of the OP, but airborne, not on ISS as in OP.California has standards for methane emissions (e.g., https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/oil-and-gas-met...) that are now covering landfills and oil and gas infrastructure, and dairies -- three of the largest categories of large emitters.(One effect of these regulations, that lay people may have noticed, is trying to get food waste out of the landfill stream, and into composting, so that it doesn&#39;t decay anaerobically and produce methane. In LA, for example, the LADWP is test-driving a program where food scraps - vegetables, but also meats and fats - are diverted into green bins.)Strengthened regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure are part of this - I&#39;m not saying the studies motivated these regulations, just that they are all part of policies heading in that direction.It is believed that large oil companies are aggressively selling off oil pumps/fields to get out from under this responsibility. (https://www.propublica.org/article/california-oil-wells-shel...)The ISS measurements in OP have covered (and will continue to cover) a much broader area than the California airborne survey - but with less spatial resolution - so presumably a broad survey of mid-latitude super-emitters will be possible in the coming months."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this website is not a hivemind, but it&#39;s interesting every time an article like this gets posted the majority opinion seems to be that training diffusion models on copyrighted work is totally fine. In contrast when talking about training code generation models there are multiple comments mentioning this is not ok if licenses weren&#39;t respected.For anyone who holds both of these opinions, why do you think it&#39;s ok to train diffusion models on copyrighted work, but not co-pilot on GPL code?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a graphic artist. In the recent months I&#39;ve read dozens of articles and threads like this. I still can&#39;t see what the big deal is.Graphic artists don&#39;t have trade secrets or unique impossible techniques. If someone can see your picture, he can copy its style. It becomes publicly available as soon as you publish it. For the vast majority of graphic styles, if one author can do it, then hundreds of his colleagues can do it too, often just as well. If one author becomes popular and expensive - then his less popular colleagues can copy his style for cheaper. The market for this is enormous and this was the case for probably hundreds of years.I personally am a non-brand artist like that. More often then not clients come to me with a reference not from my portfolio and ask me to produce something similar. I will do it, probably five times cheaper than the artist or studio who did the original. It may not be exactly as good, but it won&#39;t be five times worse.Some clients are happy to pay extra for the name brand, and will pay. Some want to spend less, and will settle for a non-brand copy.The clients that are willing to pay for the name brand will still be there for the same reason they are now, and the existence of Stable Diffusion changes nothing to them. And the ones that just want the cheap copy would never contact the big name artist in the first place. The copy market will shift, but the big name artist doesn&#39;t even have to be aware of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The dynamics on Twitter are quite weird. There’s a small number of users with potentially lots of followers for whom Twitter is an important part of their work or life. If you’re a journalist, being on Twitter is basically part of your job so maybe you should have to pay a bit more just like the customer of some business software ($100 pa seems pretty cheap there). Indeed maybe media publications should be paying for the blue checks for their staff. But on the other hand, these people are going to represent a large part of the draw of Twitter and so maybe Twitter should be paying them instead.But other people use Twitter in different ways. If you mostly use it as a social network between your friends you might not care because they’ll presumably see your tweets because they follow you rather than because they found them in search or whatever.If you’re using Twitter as a forum for discussions about some topic of your interest, maybe you’ll end up feeling crowded out in replies by people with the check. But if you’re at risk of being crowded out then maybe Twitter isn’t working so well as a forum. And I think that if eg A follows B and B retweets you, A should see your tweet whether or not you have a check. Maybe that isn’t so true with the non-chronological feed. If people in the community follow you then, depending on the dynamics, your opinions could still be spread via retweet rather than getting lucky in your position in the replies, no?If you’re some reply guy, maybe your tweets should be downranked but then if you’re serious about it then I guess you’ll pay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The good:Twitter should not be editorally curating people through verification, making verification only about ID and being a real person is a broadly good change, as long as it&#39;s not necessary for participation. Brands, celebrities, those in the public eye could benefit from this. Needs to be implemented with care and ideally with a branding change so as not to confuse users as the semantics change.The bad:$8 is way more than the profitability of an ad supported user. There&#39;s no excuse for &#34;half the ads&#34;, it should be none at all. See: every streaming service. (Edit: ok some streaming services have ads, but for most online content - video, journalism, etc, if you subscribe there are no ads, it&#39;s just nickle-and-diming users to give them a bunch of ads, particularly when the marginal cost for Twitter Blue is essentially zero).The ugly:Paying $8 to get your voice heard by more people biases towards those with means rather than those contributing to the conversation. At best this will reduce conversation quality on Twitter, at worst this is ripe for abuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Half as many ads&#34; fascinates me deeply.Has a business ever publicly quantified how many ads you get?  Does YouTube say,  &#34;we expose you to an average of x seconds of commercials and y pixels of static ads&#34;?How do I know what half should be?  We&#39;ve all been there:  &#34;it feels like YouTube has cranked the ads way up lately...&#34;  Will &#34;half&#34; just become &#34;full&#34; when &#34;full&#34; gets doubled next year?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title/article seems to be a bit of a strawman, AFAICT countries (or their governments / citizens) do not consider the GDP as the one and only measure of national success. Politics are driven by tons of different interest groups (in the broadest sense, ranging from corporate interests, environmental activists, minority representatives, medical or teaching professionals, farmers, retirees living on state pensions, etc, etc.), not by whether some policy might give a boost to GDP. I could argue that it would probably be better if they actually did, but that&#39;s for another thread.In truth, pretty much nobody really knows for sure what policies actually will increase GDP, or what causes the short term fluctuations (business cycle / recession) or variation in long term divergense between different countries in the first place. The more honest academic economists will freely admit this. (I was explicitly thaught so in my graduate macro-economics courses). So I think it&#39;s a strawman to think that countries/governments are engating in some kind of myopic GDP maximization plan.I think the appropriate analogy is household or personal income. (GDP is just all incomes in a country summed up and corrected for inflation.)  It&#39;s probably not the most important thing in the world, and probably not the most important determinant of personal happyness or life satisfaction. But a severe lack of it (especially compared to the people around you) or an unexpected large drop will probably be considered problematic by most people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hard to overstate how terrible this idea is.GDP is a concrete measure that is difficult to fake.  Once you start arguing about the economic value of volunteering, divorce, income inequality, and crime -- you&#39;ve opened the door to never being able to trust GDP again.Should we create new metrics to track progress?  Sure.  Should we stop tracking GDP?  No way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been known since the idea was first conceived: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Limitat...The real issue is simply that, a lot of the things we want to convert to simple metrics can&#39;t be. Suppose I hand you a list of the exact rate each crime in a country was committed, and I ask you to convert that list to a single number, how would you do so? You could assign a weight to each crime, but how would you know which weights to use? What&#39;s the &#34;true cost&#34; of each crime?Of course, in reality we won&#39;t know the real rate of any crime. We will have estimates, which are likely quite far from the truth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read that doctors now spend as much as 50% of their time documenting their work. Companies such as Epic, which provide the software that hospitals use to build databases of patient data, have been big winners in the new world of hospitals-depending-on-software. But did the doctors become more productive? By almost any measure, they became less productive.People in tech keep thinking more tech will solve problems and they keep underestimating the flexibility of the old models. For instance, most large companies used to be run by armies of secretaries, and the senior secretaries functioned as what we would now call &#34;project managers&#34; -- they made calendars, oversaw who was working on what, followed up to keep track on whether work was being done, and kept a close eye on what money was being spent. The crucial thing about having humans overseeing such work is that humans can take a flexible approach to the rules: they know when to break them. By contrast, systems that are highly dependent on software tend to be more rigid. Software doesn&#39;t know when its rules should be broken.The flexibility of the old system is constantly underestimated, the rigidness of the new systems is often misunderstood.In his book &#34;The Design Of Design&#34; Fred Brooks talks about the power of trust, and he contrasts that situations where everything needs to be first negotiated and specified in a contract. High trust systems are flexible and fast, whereas a system where every detail needs to be specified in a contract is slow and rigid. We should stop and ask ourselves, our favorite Agile methodology resembles which of these? Are specifying things with needless detail?"</p>

It is higher now than at any point before July of 2020. YOY Productivity growth has dipped negative and then went back to positive 20 times in the past 22 years.To be concerned about the current level of productivity requires either the attention span or the intelligence of a goldfish.https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/productivity"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of another example of video-game inspired tactics:Just before he reached the end zone, with 17 seconds remaining, Stokley cut right at 90 degrees and ran across the field. Six seconds drained off the clock before, at last, he meandered across the goal line to score the winning touchdown. For certain football fans, the excitement of a last-minute comeback now commingled with the shock of the familiar: It&#39;s hard to think of a better example of a professional athlete doing something so obviously inspired by the tactics of videogame football. When I caught up with Stokley by telephone a few weeks later, I asked him point-blank: &#34;Is that something out of a videogame?&#34; &#34;It definitely is,&#34; Stokley said. &#34;I think everybody who&#39;s played those games has done that&#34; — run around the field for a while at the end of the game to shave a few precious seconds off the clock. Stokley said he had performed that maneuver in a videogame &#34;probably hundreds of times&#34; before doing it in a real NFL game.https://www.wired.com/2010/01/ff-gamechanger/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of those events that I&#39;m of several minds about:
1) This is what keeps people outside the scene interested and taking note - NASCAR absolutely should publicize and play up this moment, it brings a lot of folks to the sport. It was incredibly awesome.2) A lot of times something like this is how you form some new regulations - it&#39;s truly one of those &#34;You know, this was excellent but we can&#39;t do it again&#34; situations.3) The best course forward is to leave it alone and legal in this moment, publicize it, but also treat it as the formation of some new rules.Side note, Nascar 2005, which he referenced as one of his inspirations for this, is one of my favorite gamecube games. I remember picking it up and playing it for hours on end, the soundtrack was awesome, and it didn&#39;t feel like an EA cash-grab at the time. Man how times have changed...Edit: Extra info - the 11 of Hamlin has previously made it into the chase for the champion ship by _intentionally wrecking drivers_ , so by and large a huge part of the fan base believes he got what was coming to him."</p>

Though neither Remix&#39;s nor Shopify&#39;s blog posts make it clear, I&#39;m guessing Michael and Ryan will continue to lead Remix development while hopefully having a team of focused engineers working with them. Since Shopify really believes in and wants to use the tech, it&#39;s great that they&#39;ll be able to pay engineers to continue to develop it in the open. I believe Remix also was VC funded so Shopify probably also made their investors whole?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is huge. Remix is my favorite React framework at the moment. It is by far the best abstraction I&#39;ve seen of client/server model. Their API abstraction layer is just right, working with native browser and nodejs APIs, not obscure them. Typescript support is amazing.I&#39;d bet my money on Remix model and direction vs Nextjs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting move by Shopify, given that they have Hydrogen [0]. I was half expecting Hydrogen to become its own all-purpose framework, but alas, they seem to plan for both to co-exist.&gt; While Hydrogen is focused on commerce, Remix is focused lower in the stack, and will continue to be a general web solution that scales from content through commerce and all the way to apps. Shopify will use Remix across many projects where it makes sense, and you can expect to see more of our developer platform with first-class Remix support over time.[0] https://hydrogen.shopify.dev"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The original thread emphasized too much on a few grants, which I feel is a minor issue considering how small part of the annual revenue they were. Not surprised Wikipedia is able to defend it easily.&gt; &#34;Awards and grants&#34; amounted to $9.8 million, of which $5 million (possibly $5.5 million) represented a grant to the Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s own Endowment held by the Tides Foundation. This leaves somewhere between $4 and $5 million for actual grants made to the community – a figure dwarfed by the Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s $50 million budget surplus in 2020–2021. There was no lack of money for grants.The actual problem is that the Foundation reached its endowment goal, five years before the the deadline it set [1], and yet, they keep guilt-tripping and pretending as if they are running out of money. How&#39;s it not profiteering? They could be honest and add, &#34;We have already reached our goal. But raising more could help us find more avenues to increase the world&#39;s knowledge,&#34; and they would be completely in the right. I bet fewer people would donate if they realized that they are not funding running expenses, at all.Addendum: If you&#39;re considering donating to Wikipedia, I suggest you look into doing it for Internet Archive. The complexity of their project and running expenses is way more than Wikipedia, and yet, they just received 12% of the amount that Wikipedia got in 2020 [2]. They just have $4M in net assets, and yet, I have never seen them guilt-tripping regular users.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statisti...[2]: https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/943..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The money was transferred to an outside organisation, Tides Advocacy, sometime in the 2019–2020 financial year when the Foundation found it had a large amount of money left over because of an underspendThis is the root of the problem. Wikimedia rises too much money, and instead of putting it in a fund they &#34;need&#34; to find projects, programmes and - now apparently - outside organization that are in no way accountable to Wikimedia.Instead of burning all the money they are donated, Wikimedia should first and foremost strive to secure the technical and financial continuity of the project by e.g. investing a lion&#39;s share of the donations to a distributing fund that provides perpetual passive income from e.g. stock market dividends. Only once that passive income surpasses the current and foreseeable technical running costs (hosting, bandwidth, project and engineering staff) should they start giving money to external organizations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Basically the reason why I will not donate to any large organization. Imagine donating to an organization because you think it helps them pay for their servers or devs and then it enters an intangible web of different obscure organizations, all donating to one another in some obscure way. The cause it goes to is &#34;external organizations that support knowledge equity by addressing the racial inequities preventing access and participation in free knowledge&#34;, which is about the most nebulous, meaningless &#34;cause&#34; imaginable.
Where does the money go? Unkown.
Who benefits? The charities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes!!! I have been saying for years that lower level protocols are a bad joke at this point, but nobody in the industry wants to invest in making things better. There are so many improvements we could be making, but corporations don&#39;t see any &#34;immediate shareholder value&#34;, so they sit around happy as pigs in shit with the status quo.What&#39;s kind of hilarious about this paper is, these are just the network-layer problems! It completely ignores that the &#34;port number&#34; abstraction for service identification has completely failed due to the industry glomming onto HTTP as some sort of universal tunnel encapsulation for all application-layer protocols. And then there&#39;s all the non-backend problems!And that&#39;s just TCP. We still lack any way to communicate up and down the stack of an entire transaction, for example for debugging purposes. We should have a way to forward every single layer of the stack across each hop, and return back each layer of the stack, so that we can programmatically determine the exact causes of network issues, automatically diagnose them, and inform the user how to solve them. But right now, you need a human being to jump onto the user&#39;s computer and fire up an assortment of random tools in mystical combinations and use human intuition to divine what&#39;s going on, like a god damn Networking Gandalf. And we&#39;ve been doing it this way for 40+ years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get where this is coming from, but no. We don&#39;t need to replace TCP in the datacentre.Why?because for things that are low latency, need rigid flow control, or other 99.99% utilisation case, one doesn&#39;t use TCP. (Storage, which is high throughput, low latency and has rigid flow control, doesn&#39;t [well ignore NFS and iscisi] use TCP)Look if it really was that much of a problem then everyone in datacentres would move to RDMA over infiniband. For shared memory clusters, thats what&#39;s been done for years. but for general purpose computing its pretty rare. Most of the time its not worth the effort. Infiniband is cheap now, so its not that hard to deploy RDMA[1] type interconnects. Having a reliable layer2 with inbuilt flow control solves a number of issues, even if you are just slamming IP over the top.shit, even 25/100gig is cheap now. so most of your problems can be solved by putting extra nics in your servers and have fancypants distributed LACP type setups on your top of rack/core network.The biggest issue is that its not the network that&#39;s constraining throughput, it either processing or some other non network IO.[1]I mean it is hard, but not as hard as implementing a brand new protocol and expecting it to be usable and debuggable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The data model for TCP is a stream of bytes. However, this is not the right data model for most datacenter applications. Datacenter applications typically exchange discrete messages to implement remote procedure callsThis isn&#39;t just a datacenter problem. Every single network protocol I&#39;ve ever created or implemented is message based, not stream based. Every messaging system. Every video game. Every RPC transport.But, because we can&#39;t have nice things, message framing has to be re-implemented on top of TCP in a different, custom way by every single protocol. I&#39;ve basically got message framing-over-TCP in muscle memory at this point, in each of the variants you commonly see.The only kinda-sorta exceptions I know about are HTTP/1.1 and telnet. But HTTP/1.1 is still a message oriented protocol; just with file-sized messages. (And even this stops being true with http2 anyway).In my opinion, the real problem is the idea that &#34;everything is a file&#34;. Byte streams aren&#39;t a very useful abstraction. &#34;Everything is a stream of messages&#34; would be a far better base metaphor for computing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am of two minds of this and would invite people to give me some opinions on this thing.On one hand, I love free speech and think it is good. The innovation capable from people being ably to publish their views, congregate freely, etc. is a foundational good I believe in.On the other hand, I&#39;m aware that certain influential figures explicitly manipulate their speech in order to primarily amass personal power regardless of any second-order effects. E.g. cults are horrible, even though people are freely congregating, they just feel like they can&#39;t leave because of the emotional abuse these influential figures are heaping via their speech.On a third hand, the loved one of a politician was severely injured because of someone who believes the incorrect speech of influential figures and I desperately do not want further injury or violence to occur spurned by incorrect speech on the facts of reality.So what&#39;s to be done about the actual, real harm being done, while also protecting free speech? I don&#39;t want to assume that assaulting people is just the cost of free speech. That just seems so wrong to me."</p>

&#34;rights&#34; but people don&#39;t always care to exercise them, and can be
dissuaded from exercising them.Right To Repair sounds nice. It alliterates. But of course we have a
right to repair our stuff. That goes without saying.What&#39;s really at issue is a duty upon manufacturer&#39;s not to obstruct
the four R&#39;s, to;- refuse- reuse- repair- recycleLet&#39;s get specific, instead of a wishy &#34;rights&#34; formulation.No technology must ever by soft-mandated or made a dependency so as to
preclude an ethical, environmental or economic choice to not partake
in its use, or to substitute other choices.No technology should be encumbered with locks, licenses or mechanisms
that affect the post-sale rights of its owner to repurpose or modify
as they see fit (all other safety and contention (RF) issues can be
dealt with at a another layer of legislation and enforcement.)No impediment shall be made to the access, manufacture and distribution
of spare parts or consumables, software updates, power supplies,
connectors etcDesigns should not, by the use of adhesives, welding, non-standard
fixings, unnecessary integration, traps, and fuses, prevent the easy
disassembly and reuse of modular components."</p>

Otherwise you bought a service and not a product.Any service you decide to run on the device, should be possible (without explicit approval of the manufacturer) to be provided by any company. The current situation is like you bought a TV and you can only watch the TV-network of the manufacturer.Needless to say, within this law it should be allowed for any company to perform repairs too, or provide hardware extensions, etc."</p>

I&#39;m going out on a limb, but perhaps macOS&#39; Dark Mode, or VSCode&#39;s dark mode, wouldn&#39;t exist without Solarized blazing that path.It&#39;s kinda funny how, before Solarized, I would see tons of gimmicky themes like some that were going for a Matrix or &#34;classic terminal&#34; feel, going all in on a certain theme but eschewing real usefulness. I want my basic terminal colors to remain adjacent to their intended hues! I want different keywords/tokens in my code to be distinguishable!Ethan&#39;s application of color theory/science to the landscape was like a beacon in the darkness.Before Solarized, I used Zenburn (I actually still do in some environments, I&#39;m not too keen on the blueish hue of Solarized backround.)

Or is there some service being offered, or is it just design aficionados using this as a gathering place to talk about general design things?Are these projects created by design nerds who simply love it so much that they create things like this or the Dracula theme project for fun? (Excellent!) Or is there some corporate motivation for pushing people to adopt certain color themes?I think maybe the primary source of my confusion is that the nordtheme.com and draculatheme.com websites in particular feel like product pages rather than &#34;here&#39;s a cool thing&#34; pages.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is great overall, but there is some stuff you should do differently, if you&#39;re wanting to follow in the author&#39;s footsteps:1. Just use UPC connectors everywhere unless you have really good reasons not to.2. Use single mode fiber (SMF) everywhere, including internal wiring. SMF is infinitely scalable for future needs, multimode (MMF) is not. These days the cost differences for cabling and optics is negligible. In fact, SMF cabling is often cheaper than MMF. And no, you generally won’t have to worry about attenuating signal.Also, in my extensive experience, FS.com optics modules are typically better manufactured and more reliable than OEM modules.I resisted the &#34;cheap chinese&#34; modules for a long, long time, but then discovered that most of my uplink carriers used them.It&#39;s been years now. I&#39;ve had many Cisco OEM, Dell OEM, and a couple from another 3rd party manufacturer go bad, but I have yet for one FS.com SFP to go bad. I&#39;ve got several hundred deployed in a wide variety of environments, from great (cool, clean areas) to bad (hot, dirty areas)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always end up green with envy that people seem to have pre-existing conduits in their walls for running new cables.  There&#39;s no way, in my old house, of doing this without some invasive smashing in to walls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice read, and great work on the terminations.I did an extensive amount of both fiber and CAT6A in my recent house build, totally about 21 miles together. I did a mixture of single mode and multimode only because of some AV device support for multimode, and because all of it was so cheap compared to the labor and time.I ended up with significant fiber runs between the MDF and IDF closets, the server room, and all of the AV endpoints which is a typical layout. I did run single mode fiber to all 18 wireless AP access-point locations, but I suspect those will not get used much given I also have 2 CAT6A shielded wires to each AP that can support 10G AND provided power.  I do use a direct fiber connection in my office to provide 10G to my network core from that desktop, but that could have been done over copper as well.Perhaps the biggest gain over copper is my switch interconnects which are 40G from the upstairs closet to the server room.  If needed it would be easy to upgrade those to 100G, and since there are 24 strands available you really could expand as far as you are every going to need to go with WDM and the like.The one really good use case for only fiber was running it down my driveway to our gate, which is about a 1/4 mile in distance. That is something that would be more challenging to do with copper. [although I do have copper installed].From my perspective the cost of running fiber was almost 0 compared to the entire project because so much more cost is involved in path finding and clearing ( cutting holes, etc), and the actual pulling.  I was very fortunate to have a large group of friends who spent a couple of days working with me to do the large pulls, combined with many weeks of evenings and weekends doing the rest myself.  Many hands makes that task much much easier.My particular build is documented in a build thread:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It varies through regions. It is completely the opposite in China because:- No extra app. People scan the QR in WeChat (everybody has it) on the table, it will call a mini-app dynamically (somewhat similar to React Native but interpreted in WeChat).- You are putting orders directly.- You are paying within WeChat as well so it&#39;s seamless.- The app is smooth because almost every restaurant is using the takeout giant Meituan&#39;s mini-app.- Almost every single restaurants in China is tech savvy enough to use those systems because it&#39;s already a take-out centered society. Restaurants not leveraging these systems have virtually zero chance to survive the competition.- You don&#39;t have to wait for anything or talk to anybody in the whole process.The problems people mentioned in this thread:- Minorities, people without smart phone or those are less tech savvy, are left behind.- The walled garden and monopolies and such.These problems are real, but it&#39;s probably not the QR menu to blame, because it&#39;s a far greater problem - in China, you are not allow to go anywhere without WeChat and scanning QR code due to those draconian regulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it. It&#39;s annoying to wait for the waiter to come over with menus, it&#39;s annoying to wait to ask them to bring a menu back because you want to order more, and it&#39;s gross when you get a menu that hasn&#39;t been wiped down properly and is sticky with god knows what, and it&#39;s wasteful when they&#39;re printing hundreds of fresh menus a day for the places that give everyone a fresh one.Keep a few backup printouts for those who need them (like your phone gets no signal), but otherwise it&#39;s a fantastic step forwards. Goodbye to grimy wasteful printouts.Plus the bonus of never having to experience &#34;oh sorry we&#39;re out of that&#34; if they update the menus dynamically is fantastic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate QR code menus as they are often poorly implemented.However, I just experienced a QR code check for the first time.  That was really nice ..  I scanned the QR code with my iPhone, it downloaded the Toast &#34;app clip&#34;, which allowed me to pay the bill with Apple Pay.   It was totally seamless and far better than handing my credit card to a server to get lost or cloned."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another new tool in this vein is Fedifinder. It works by scanning Twitter bios of accounts you follow for strings that look like Mastodon addresses: https://fedifinder.glitch.me/5 years ago there was a neat tool called Mastodon Bridge that did what Twitodon says it does but much better, I think because it didn&#39;t require everyone opt in. It stopped working because of some change Twitter made to their API terms of use. https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-bridgeThere&#39;s also Moa Party, but it&#39;s so complicated I have never used it. https://moa.party/"</p>

Moving away from tactile in-car controls has to be among the more boneheaded things we&#39;ve allowed that industry to do."</p>

So if the car has no power, you can’t open the doors from inside.Granted, because of regulatory requirements there is STILL A MANUAL RELEASE… on the floor, near the chassis sill (and might be driver-seat only).  So you save money going to electronic releases, but still have to put a manual one in anyways.The glovebox is merely annoying (though I can think of edge case situations where it could lead to your death), but with the door release, there are documented instances where it HAS led to someone’s death:  https://jalopnik.com/texas-man-and-his-dog-die-after-getting..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hate the US penal system. I grew up a semi conservative individual. Good guys and bad guys. Three strikes and your out sounded great. Tough on crime. All of that.A couple years ago, I was asked by my faith congregation to serve as a volunteer at our local maximum security state prison, offering Sunday services to the inmates. I did so for 3 years. It changed me.We’re there some truly troubled/warped people there? Yes. Do I kid myself that their “stories” weren’t surely one sided? No.I was struck by how arbitrary the whole thing is. And how utterly ineffective it is. What troubled me the most is that we have outsourced    this whole raft of problems, without sending it overseas. We want “problems” to just go away. And stay away. And so we outsource the existence of human lives to an alternate universe that exists right beneath our toes. And we maintain fascinating opinions about these people and their lives, with almost zero insight into what the existence we consigned them to was.  When people heard I went to the prison every Sunday to visit with inmates, they would immediately wax their opinion about what it must be like. And I found over time that their imagination did not match my reality. Their can be no empathy in that scenario.I dream (pointlessly) about a world where a much higher percentage of lay civilians spent volunteer time in prisons. Awareness leads to empathy. And only then when we weren’t outsourcing the issue, we might actually be moved to find something more effective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a month in the hole. It wasn&#39;t pleasant.- I stayed asleep for as long as I could, whenever I could. Chlorpheniramine was readily distributed to prisoners.- Exercise was difficult for me after the first week, as was motivation for basically anything.- I read anything they would bring down there.- We didn&#39;t have a choice in the books we had, so picking something to study wasn&#39;t really an option. Outside of the hole, I eventually had an outside person send me a biochemistry textbook though. However, being autodidactic is difficult with a single reference.- No one talked to me in the segregated housing unit, except for correction officers and during the 5-10 minutes I was able to use the phone a day.- I didn&#39;t experience any prison administrators attempting to provoke any inmates. Although, the grievance system was basically a journaling activity.- I found it very difficult to write anything longer than a paragraph to anyone my whole time in prison.- I was a known atheist in prison, due to some reading material I received in the mail. Outside of the SHU, people often tried to engage me about my beliefs, which I avoided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So is prison meant to reform or punish? Life without parole clearly means the person will never renter society, so there’s no point in reforming. It’s just punishment. So why not allow the guy to read literature? Or is it because that would be enjoyable for inmates, and we want them to be punished? But the analogy of a tree falling in the woods and no one around to hear it is apt. I can’t think of a single time I’ve contemplated how prisoners are punished and thought “man it’s so great they’re sitting in there bored out of their minds, this makes my life so much better and I feel happy about it.”  They’re completely removed from society, they may as well be on Mars. It has no bearing on me or anyone else whether they’re having a good or shit miserable time. They will never leave, they will die in there. Can’t they just read a goddamn book if they want to?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wasn&#39;t aware of SAFe until one new manager got our director to loose his head for it and institute it in all teams.It was a total disaster.The idea of Agile is for each team to be responsible to improve their processes. Because improvement loops involving higher management are taking forever to complete and because each team has its own needs. &#34;Agile&#34; (quotes intentional) as practiced today is bad enough -- teams are not really improving their process, only implementing something taken from a book.SAFe is taking it one step further by absolutely obliterating team&#39;s ability to influence the process.At least with &#34;standard Agile&#34; it was possible for some teams to do the right thing, as long as they had a manager that understood what Agile really is.With SAFe that was gone.I was told that we can&#39;t even modify our t-shirt sizing because &#34;It has to be standardised, otherwise there would be too much chaos. BTW, we are definitely not creating a new request form to change t-shirt sizes in Jira&#34;Forget about changing any other part of the project. We had a bunch of testers and business analysts which did absolutely nothing but had to stay on the team because they were required in the process by higher management. We did not need them. I spent time hiring people who could do the work from discussing requirements with the business people through design, implementation up to deploying it to prod, but that did not matter.Talk about crazy projects..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SAFe seems to be a bit like &#34;internet scale&#34;, it&#39;s designed for very large organizations building very large single software solutions. Most organizations wildly overestimate their size and the size of their solutions. A Microsoft Office release probably can benefit from SAFe, an update to an auth microservice maintained part/time by a team of .75 FTE doesn&#39;t.SAFe seems to sort of be a micro-waterfall approach inspired by Conway&#39;s law [1]. It build massive communication and coordination teams so that this gets reflected into short-term development waterfalls that produce software that mirrors the system that managed it. But this team needs to be dwarfed by the development effort they are trying to push forward or they&#39;ll end up dominating all of the activities with largely useless communication and coordination activities resulting in very slow forward software movement, confused goals and priorities, and overstaffing of projects.Example: I once ran a team that was developing some internal tools for a large org, but we were outside of the main SAFe effort. At one point we became dependent on some service the SAFe effort was going to produce. It took 60 people 3 years to not produce a correctly working service. Exhausted with this, I finally just had 1 person build the service we needed as a stopgap. She spent 3 months building it with part-time support from one other engineer for a couple weeks. More than 3 years later that is the service that&#39;s still running and the SAFe effort never did manage to get a properly working solution out the door. I can think of half a dozen similar examples where the parallel effort by a smaller team with less organizational overhead radically outperformed the giant SAFe team -- and they did it mostly by just ad hoc communication channels between the small teams.1 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_law"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t say nice things about Oracle very often, but they deserve some praise here. Graal is a very, very ambitious project, and Oracle has been funding it for years. It&#39;s still rough around the edges, but it promises to enable new programming languages to run on a high-performance JVM, compiled to native code. Write-once, run anywhere, at native speed. And now they&#39;re donating it. It&#39;s very decent of them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GraalVM is truly great stuff.GraalVM native compilation helps Java in the data center to avoid being a cost sink and to reduce start-up latency. Oracle needs Java to sell enterprise software.Oracle contributing to OpenJDK may be required for Amazon cooperation (since Amazon is pushing its own JDK build) and probably helps the library ecosystem work towards native compatibility.Native support for reflection (used in many libraries) requires &#34;reachability metadata&#34;, maps of reflective API usage, at build time.  Anyone can do it, but enterprise requires authoritative sources.  Until authoritative reachability metadata covers the transitive graph of library+version dependencies in enterprise software, GraalVM native AOT builds are a PITA.- https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata- latest release: https://medium.com/graalvm/graalvm-22-3-is-here-jdk-19-build...- graalvm &#34;community&#34; roadmap: https://github.com/orgs/oracle/projects/6(As a side note: Mark Reinhold has run the JDK team since 1997: is there any comparable example of such stellar leadership for broadly-adopted software across multiple technical and organizational eras?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I refuse to praise Oracle for anything. But I could make an exception if they put Isolates in the CE version of Graal and not only the Enterprise one. :)Also, obviously Oracle didn&#39;t do this out of the kindness of their hearts, if they didn&#39;t contribute Graal into the OpenJDK the would risk to Graal never become anything other than a niche VM because most people, specially big clients don&#39;t want to change VMs and the CE version will be their new gateway drug to their Enterprise version of Graal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m sure not everyone came here to hear tech book recommendations, but I will add another vote for Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppman. It’s one of the best tech reference books I’ve ever read. It manages to explain SO much while requiring so little prior knowledge from readers.Another book that is relatively new that I loved was Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen. I worked in productionizing ML systems for 3 years and this book equips you with exactly what you need to do so. It does a great job of explaining the whole ML modeling pipeline and some of the commonly overlooked nuances that can cause your models to fail spectacularly in production. I will be referencing this book for years to come."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How the World Really Works by Vaclac Smil is one of the best book I&#39;ve read this year. It gives such a great perspective on how much energy and material we use.It&#39;s one of the most readable books by Smil and has gems like this :“Moreover, within a lifetime of people born just after the Second World War the rate had more than tripled, from about 10 to 34 GJ/capita between 1950 and 2020. Translating the last rate into more readily imaginable equivalents, it is as if an average Earthling has every year at their personal disposal about 800 kilograms (0.8 tons, or nearly six barrels) of crude oil, or about 1.5 tons of good bituminous coal. And when put in terms of physical labor, it is as if 60 adults would be working non-stop, day and night, for each average person; and for the inhabitants of affluent countries this equivalent of steadily laboring adults would be, depending on the specific country, mostly between 200 and 240. On average, humans now have unprecedented amounts of energy at their disposal.”My review is at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4708765021Another excellent book is Arbitrary Lines by Nolan Gray - which is a great book about zoning and why we should all be YIMBYs.My review is at :  https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4800787011How Asia Works by Joe Studwell is a fascinating look at why Japan, South Korea and China have done so well.My review is at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4806521204Another book I really enjoyed was Firepower : How Weapons Shaped Warfare by Paul Lockhartreview at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4417950705"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Non-Fiction / Self-Help:No Bad Parts: Healing Trauma and Restoring Wholeness with the Internal Family Systems ModelIFS for short.Written for normal people, not psychologists/psychiatrists. It has a very valuable core philosophy/teaching about who we are underneath all the masks of our personality(s). It closely resembles something I experienced during an Ayahuasca retreat in 2018, about the soul / inner child/god entity.For something a little more tangible that digs in closer to the mechanism/science, see Dr Tori Olds on youtube, she has 5 videos on the topic that is incredibly powerful in understanding your own behaviours. Will take less than 2 hours of your life but can change it permanently for the better!"</p>

I was too curious to see what would happen, even though I expected nothing. Amazingly, a couple of people actually signed up!I&#39;m definitely relating to this experience. Feels hella pretentious and weird to set up donations. Was likewise surprised to actually get people sending me money. I guess the moral of the story is if you build cool things, people are willing to chip in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah, Andreas YT programming sessions. The length, the sincerity, the mood. The way he is able to communicate with us while being alone in a room. His very conscious effort to not get side tracked. And, of course, him just being a really effective programmer, while not being flashy or pretentious about tech or tooling in the least (and also probably because of it).Sometimes I watch and listen intently, and learn a lot. Sometimes I zone a little. It&#39;s perfect. If you are interested in programming in general I can just highly recommend checking it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for sharing Andreas! It&#39;s absolutely phenomenal how far along SerenityOS has come and it&#39;s also a peek at how FOSS is supposed to be - a way to learn, hack on something fun, share it with others but without any huge expectations.Building the next unicorn is awesome and all but in my opinion, this has it&#39;s own place. I am glad some people out there get to work on their dream projects and actually can make a living out it. Kudos to all the supporters, obviously.I also love how focused SerenityOS is and what kind of audience it caters to. Some people might say, &#34;make it for everyone&#34; but that doesn&#39;t work most of the time. Having a focused audience allows a lot of freedom in the way of UX/DX, docs, communication etc. So I am glad Andreas set that down upfront."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In this particular case, I suspect a trademark complaint against Google would make sense.Google misrepresented the ad as the product of the Gimp project, and were paid as a result.  They usually use an &#34;obeying the law would not scale&#34; type argument in court, but that would clearly be bullshit in this case.  They have a business relationship with the ad buyer, and should have verified their affiliation with gimp.org.  Also, a simple string match on the URL would expose the attempted fraud on Google&#39;s end.I&#39;m not sure how to check if Gimp is a registered trademark in the US.  This page kind of implies it might be (or that the author of the page does not understand trademarks):https://www.gimp.org/about/selling.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think people are missing the actual issue here. Google used to have a clear distinction between what&#39;s an ad and what is organic.In these screenshots you have to pay good attention to see the top result is an ad.To keep their conversion numbers up they had to constantly reduce the difference between the ads and everything else. The fact that they can do this and we are so used to it that we don&#39;t first identify that as the culprit is quite interesting.I have ran a few Google ads in the recent years and the people who come through them, some of them, clearly have no idea that they have clicked on an ad. This might be good for business but I think it does more harm overall."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have said this countless times, and I will say it again - it is just marvelous how Lichess provides so much value being completely free (both libre and gratis).I would love to see more publicity of Lichess though - and seems like this move will help in that regard.I don&#39;t know for sure, but is there any other chess organization in the world of this scope that is truly non-profit? Sure, FIDE itself is non-profit, but profit-motives of its commercial counterparts and allies are controversial, to say the least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I think a US non-profit makes a lot of sense, I would exercise caution with the non-profit board.The board’s job is to provide oversight and to appoint a director [1]. In this case it would clearly be Thibault, but what happens in a few years when Thibault is ready to go? Does he have say in his replacement? Does the French organization take precedent over the US nonprofit when it comes to leadership and governance?I say this because Lichess is extremely valuable (even as a non-profit) and that will attract the wrong kind of people. Thibault should take every precaution to make sure he retains control of the org, with good people around him. I’m not sure if there is a non-profit equivalent of retaining voting rights, but I’d want to be sure he retains control until it’s well established as a non-profit and a succession plan is in place.The wrong board could evaluate his performance (which right now he says he works at his leisure and loves what he does) and say “we need more fundraising and appearances in the US at tournaments” and he could balk / want to focus on the product. They could then look to appoint a US director of the nonprofit and things could get awkward and extremely costly.It’s incredible what has been built and maintained with a small team. I think they will see extreme diminishing returns after they hit a certain level of governance. Whether that’s going international with a nonprofit status in the US or at another point is beyond my level of expertise.If someone more knowledgeable that I am can correct what I’ve written above and point out that my concerns are overblown, I’d be happy. I’d also ask that person to volunteer and help Lichess establish a presence in the US.[1] https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/board-ro..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Therefore, in 2016, Lichess was formally registered under French law as an association loi 1901. This type of association applies to groups with clearly defined purposes that benefit the public, similar to charities. However, it’s quite easy to form one - the total number in France is over 1.5 million!It is surprising that Lichess is a French charity, much like VLC. France also has a very low entry barrier for forming an LLC, so it seems to be a rather good approach all things considered.&gt; once we become an association of general interest, our French donors will be able to make tax-deductible donations, meaning they can reduce their individual tax burden through supporting us. In theory, this should also apply to donors who are citizens of other EU countries, but the last bit of legislation supporting EU-wide application was passed in 2009 and we’re still waiting for it to be cleanly implemented. Classic EU.It really is a running theme that EU member state governments have to be dragged kicking and screaming to implement beneficial EU directives as local laws while they at the same time blame the EU for everything unpopular they do themselves. If that&#39;s not a clear indicator that the Parliament should have more authority to assert itself I don&#39;t know what is. At least we get the &#34;project funded by the EU&#34; signs on random buildings to not make the good stuff completely invisible on the local level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t at all object to code reviews/evaluation, but the thing I wonder about is this: I rarely open an empty file and write some big block of code. 98% of the time I&#39;m fixing bugs in legacy code or shimming in some new feature. It would be trivial to produce the diffs I generated in the past 30 or 60 days, but the volume of code isn&#39;t really a great metric for my productivity.There may be some three line change that was the result of eight hours of debugging and analyzing how to best fix the bug without disturbing the stuff that is working. Is that more or less productive than someone who cut &amp; pasted a 100 line routine they found via google?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at Facebook and remember what it was like to first face the total complexity of the system.It’s really hard for me to imagine myself working at a company that deals almost exclusively with machine-generated data (as Tesla does) and being assigned to judge a social platform’s engineering qualify in one day. Cars and spaceships on a closed network are fundamentally “clean” compared to having hundreds of millions of people who produce dirty and often adversarial data.But I guess the point of this exercise isn’t really to judge code quality, but to drive fear at Twitter."</p>

Anyone who has contributed to the gitea project more than 2x PRs is invited to be a maintainer. Every maintainer gets 3 votes.
Maybe there are some suggestions for improving - please open a PR.&gt; Describing the ways in which democratic decisions are to be made.Again, I&#39;m just confused what&#39;s being requested.

&gt; The Gitea trademark and domains are transferred to the non-profit.
&gt; The name of the company is changed to avoid any confusion with the non-profit.Does anyone have experience with how this is typically handled? It seems like this is the only actionable request. What are some examples of non-profit open-source companies? Is that typical?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the story from the announcement[1].&gt; We have a long history of trying to bring Factorio to other platforms, including consoles and mobile phones (not including April Fools). We even worked with some external companies, but the projects never even got to the point where they would run technically, let alone the complicated part of making the game playable using controllers or touch screen.&gt; We had some history of starting Factorio-related sub-projects that ended up in development hell for yearsThis reminds me of their post on good foundations[2].It sounds like they discovered the pain of growing tech debt and paralysis due to an aging stack, and the lack of results when you throw money at the problem (in other words, contract work to some external entity).What&#39;s also interesting is that this work ended up being a one-person project. It&#39;s just too hard to make progress fast when you add people to a project: people don&#39;t agree, they need to communicate not to overlap or to understand the changes added by others, this all slow things down. And if the stack is complicated, this can really put a stop to productivity.I think there&#39;s a real case for having one-person teams for the first X months on a new project. As long as the one person understands how they can later scale themselves. (This usually requires documentation, good architecture, good delegation, etc.)[1]: https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-370[2]: https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-366"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure why this pops up now, nothing new afaik, but I&#39;ll take this as a chance to leave a quick review ;)I bought one during the kickstarter, mostly for note taking; but also as a ereader &amp; perhaps drawing tool.
- For note taking: I prefer a simple paper notebook, as my notes are more procedural. I don&#39;t really look back often. It&#39;s fine. Just not better then paper for note taking imo. 
- As a e-reader, it is absolute dog shit. period.
- If you are not artistic, this will not change that
- The subscription model is terrible, I&#39;ve cancelled my &#39;grandfathered&#39; account and tried to sell my rm2 over it.
- Currently using it as exceedingly expensive notepad, no cloud crap etc.
- Battery life is kinda meh, either you have it go to standby and have to wait a few second to use it. Or it is constantly empty when you want to use it. Not the eInk experience I had expected.You can install custom software, as it is not locked down, that might solve some of these issues. I haven&#39;t tried. For me, this is just a notepad. And not a great one at that. I use it mainly because I paid for it tbh.I have several friend that have one too and enjoy it much more, but this how I experienced it, ymmv obviously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am one of the original kickstarter backers and got mine at a very favorable price compared to what they are selling it for now. As a original kickstarter backer they also provided me with a free tier for their subscription service so I am not paying anything extra to have full functionality, this is very important to me because I am not very excited of subscription based software features - remarkable please take note of this!The remarkable unit is still a thing of beauty. It excels at what it does, and I bring it with me everywhere. I use the cloud features to pick up documents and use it to hold my PDFs and eBooks and it is an important device for my note taking. I have modded the unit a little bit by replacing the original back-ground pictures. To be able to access this device as root appeals very much to me, I very much feel in control of my device.From a security point of view, they still have some work to do. It is embarrassing when the unit goes into sleep mode and private notes are kept visible to everyone. I created a ticket in they support system, but they don&#39;t seem to take it seriously. There is also the issue with only having a 4-code pin to unlock the device. This means that you must be very careful with what you write and store on the unit. Sensitive notes should not be stored on the unit.There is also no way to deprecate the unit and the content if it is lost or it hasn&#39;t check in against the cloud.The software that is installed on your PC/Mac has very basic functionality.Overall, would still strongly recommend, 8/10."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought a rm2 a while back but abandoned it when I discovered it had extremely weak security: no fde, a weak remotely-resettable 4 digit pin, no local file syncing (doesn&#39;t appear as a mass storage device when plugged in as a usb, doesnt support standard file transfer protocols), non-e2ee (!!) cloud syncing (their company can see my notes unencrypted).Now I use an android tablet that I locked down + synching and i couldn&#39;t be happier. The only thing I&#39;m missing now is a good note taking app that writes my notes to a directory that can be synced with synching. Recent versions of android broke this for all apps except Google&#39;s Files app unfortunately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Going off on a tangent, but the scale of production is very hard to grasp.  I&#39;m probably not the first person to observe this, but I once did some napkin math about steel production, and what I realized kind of blew me away.  About 1.9 billion tonnes in 2020.  Like with billions of dollars, I have no intuition for such numbers.  Context is needed.Global steel production just before WW I was about 70 million tonnes.  So production has increased about thirty-fold in one century.  That wasn&#39;t so shocking to me, at first.  But 1910 was not the beginning of the industrial era; things had been under way for more than a century then.  Railroads.  Ocean liners.  Factories.  Knives and rivets for fabric owned by hundreds of millions of people.  Dozens of skyscrapers in New York by then; the Brooklyn Bridge hung on thousands of tonnes of cable.  All made out of steel.Then it struck me.  A few million tonnes a year in 1850.  70 million tonnes in 1910.  All of it adds up to less than 1900 million tonnes.  Every single tonne of steel manufactured by humans from prehistory until about a century ago -- the entire output of the industrial revolution -- amounts to less than one year at current production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The sad thing is that 100 years ago humans and livestock accounted for around 5% of the biomass (all zoomass, not land mammals only), 95% being the wildlife. Now the numbers are reversed.We&#39;ve stolen the land from the wildlife and dedicated it to a few species we consider edible (agriland is more than forests now, and 75% of it for animal agriculture).Is anybody surprised that we&#39;re living in the anthropocene, defined by massive die off of wild species?We have to (as a species) return the land to wildlife and let it repopulate the earth, otherwise we&#39;ll lose them. We don&#39;t even know what gems we&#39;re losing. I&#39;m not talking about some bugs, but about dna - those are millions of years of (computer) code generated by nature, code so precious we don&#39;t even have an idea how to simulate it, let alone understand it (at this point in our evolution).If we lose it, goodbye new medicines, new regenerative dna techniques, new technologies, and who knows what. We simply cannot know what we&#39;re stealing from future humans (this point was made for the selfish humans we are, better arguments could be made)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"They need to re-free up the API. Early adopters and hackers really did some great work using the API until they walled-gardened it and rate limited it to make it unusable.  They need to do this for goodwill at the very least, but I think it will spark the fire to make it popular with techies again.Based on the recently published discovery chats we will probably see:* High def video* Focus on music publication* The highest revenue sharing cut from any social media platform for content creators to get people to switch.* Removal of twitter blue but some kind of subscriptions to edit tweets* Paid push DMs to followers (e.g. follow this account for drops, then the tweeter has to pay to tweet to this group)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the spirit of trying to be high-information and add value:Where Musk is going, there are no maps. So it&#39;s very very hard to project. But we can predict likely developments.At a very high level, it&#39;s going to involve: bringing back controversial personalities like Donald Trump; increasing Twitter&#39;s commitment to &#39;free speech&#39;; assuaging skittish advertisers; retaining users who might be concerned, while bringing in new ones; managing the exodus of users (size:?) that will happen regardless; cutting a large amount of staff, while keeping Twitter&#39;s lights on; open sourcing the code, discussing the impending rearchitecture; and - long term - folding this into Elon&#39;s vision of America&#39;s WeChat, and ultimately expanding Twitter, under X.com.That&#39;s a lot. But at a high level, I think that&#39;s correct.I would expect Elon to take the fight to the media. Whether he&#39;s going to focus on neutrally spreading a message, going more on the attack on media outlets that would support him, or doing something in between, is unknown.Musk has an unusually large amount of media power: that&#39;s his unique value add, in a way. I would expect this to be a &#39;bigger deal&#39; as a story, as multiple stories, than I would for any other company undergoing a takeover. We&#39;ll be hearing a lot more about Twitter in the weeks to come, since the developments will keep piling up, and the press/public loves to read &amp; discuss stories about Twitter &amp; Musk.We&#39;ll see how it goes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"~5 years ago, I hired three Indian developers. They asked me if we could set up an Indian legal entity, so that they could just get regular salaries in India with tax payments, deductions etc taken care of. I agreed and we got it done.One of the worst business-decisions of my life. The amount of red tape, stupid rules, corruption, signatures, stamps, showing up physically in a certain office etc etc... Mindblowing.I will not tire you with all the details, but to this day, Indian tax authorities still hold money hostage, that they agree my Indian company is owed (GST refunds). But all attempts to actually get the money back falls on deaf ears. We have sent experts to the relevant tax offices etc, but the ONLY guy who can handle it is never there, refuses to deal with it, then says we need to go somewhere else - where we are sent back etc etc. Sent around in circles, basically - with everybody recognizing the money is in fact owed...I will never do business in India again. Happy to work with Indian developers (I still do), but they will get paid as freelancers and deal with the red tape on their end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"India&#39;s obsession with paperwork is unceasing and baffling. Everything requires an application, even when everything can be done digitally. You need letters and stamps to get anything done.Case in point: the &#34;company stamps&#34; that are required for everything you do with your business. From getting a debit card to changing the maturity instructions for a corporate deposit, you need to sign your name AND stamp it with your company stamp.The company stamp can be made by anyone for $1-2. It has no bearing on security at all. Yet, you need to carry it with you if you want to get anything done.It&#39;s utterly baffling. I can access my corporate bank account online and make any number of transactions, yet if I want to apply for a debit card, I need my company stamp and signatures from all directors.Why? I have no idea!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is my competing take:The biggest problem I see in developer communication is what I call the &#34;assumed context&#34; problem.As in, you talk/write to people as if they know all about your code, except the detail being discussed. In reality, they usually have much less detailed understanding, and you&#39;re making no sense to them.I&#39;m pretty sure this is related to people &#34;on the spectrum&#34; often having low &#34;theory of mind&#34; capabilities. People without that will just assume people know what they know, and proceed to fail at communicating with those who don&#39;t.It also makes it easy to think of those who don&#39;t know what is obvious to you as idiots.The workaround, if you want to communicate with the idiots surrounding you, is to start conversations by fact finding. The question &#34;so how much do you know about the flurbigator system?&#34; can help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has little to do w/ being a developer vs. being human.People joke about the programmer in a dark corner plugging away and never talking to others, but that&#39;s actually pretty rare. In 20 years I&#39;ve only worked with a handful of developers who don&#39;t want to socialize, collaborate, or solve problems together.The truth is that people - regardless of discipline - generally all want the same things from their work: to work on something meaningful, to be productive, and to be recognized for that work (both output and input).That&#39;s pretty much it. If - as a leader - you can do those, you&#39;re going to generally have rather happy employees.When it comes to this article, the issue is that there are a lot of people who believe that documentation and effective communication ARE necessary, but that work ISN&#39;T recognized, and (because it isn&#39;t recognized) steals time that could be spent being productive doing something that is.If you want effective communication, documentation, etc. at your workplace, it&#39;s incumbent on leadership to create that culture. Nurture it, get better at it themselves, and help those less eloquent to find their [written] voice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who went from engineering to product management, partly due to having developed a skill of communicating effectively in writing and in speech, I would suggest perhaps the most important part of communicating effectively is storytelling.  If what you are sharing does not have a clear and obvious narrative arc, people are going to disengage quickly.  This is not necessary for short bursts of information in a high-context environment, but any time you need to level set and share context before communicating the critical information, you should do so in story fashion.If you want to level up your technical communication, I&#39;d highly recommend taking classes in creative writing, participating in things like NaNoWriMo, or taking a class in improv comedy/theater.  All of these things emphasize construction of narrative arcs and how to draw people through a story, which are essential communication skills. This gets more important the farther up the chain of command in a company you are communicating with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; … support persistent client-side storage using available JS APIs. As of this writing, that includes the Origin-Private FileSystem (OPFS) [0]This is really good news, and exactly what the OPFS was designed for.You may have seen “Absurd SQL” [1] which was a proof of concept for building a SQLite Virtual FS backend using IndexedDB. It provided full ACID compliment transactions. Incredible work but a hack at best.The OPFS supersedes all that and makes it possible to have proper consistent and resilient transactions.WASM SQLite with the OPFS is the future of offline first web app development. The concept of a single codebase web/mobile/desktop app with proper offline storage is here.What I really want to see next is an eventually constant sync system between browser and server (or truly distributed with WebRTC). The SQLite Session Extension [2] potentially has the building blocks needed for such a system.0: https://webkit.org/blog/12257/the-file-system-access-api-wit...1: https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql2: https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not about the colors, FYI. This is about someone referencing a specific Pantone product as a spot color. And the automatic conversion from that spot color name to the regular RGB / CMYK color values is now gone. But if you embedded the actual RGB/CMYK values into your file, then it&#39;ll still open just fine and display those colors just fine.Edit: Also, converting from Pantone to regular RGB/CMYK is a lot more lossy than one would think. If I reference a Pantone product, that pretty much covers all properties of the printed surface, including things like reflectivity angles, fluorescence and phosphorescence. A cheap xRite will already measure reflectivity in 13 wavelength bands. And then it&#39;ll average those 13 characteristics into 3 RGB numbers. Professional color measurement tools can have hundreds of properties per ink type, thereby making reduction to 3 values even more lossy.If I give you RGB, that merely specifies the color at direct reflection under normal light. If I give you a Pantone ID, you also now how it&#39;ll look from the side or under UV light. RGB specifies an averaged wavelength mixture, Pantone specifies a chemical ink mixture.Edit2: You know these car paints that have fresnel reflections, meaning they appear to have a different color of you look at them from a different angle? That&#39;s an excellent example of a case where you need to specify a specific ink type like Pantone, because the RGB value changes based on the viewing angle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The comments here seem to be mostly litigating whether Pantone ought to be allowed to license colour names. To me though, the scandalous thing about this is that a piece of software which you paid for can work fine one day can stop functioning the same way the next because of a change in the vendor&#39;s license agreements. Like imagine if you bought a song which uses samples and one day the backing track just disappears because the artist didn&#39;t renew the sample clearance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are in the USA, then what you received are unsolicited marketing phone calls under the TCPA, a law which allows you to personally collect up to $1500 per violation of the law or associated regulations, per phone call that you received. If your personal phone is on the federal &#34;Do Not Call&#34; registry, it&#39;s possible that there are at least two violations of the law per phone call you received.I would suggest sending a demand letter to Meta&#39;s legal department offering to settle for somewhat less than $1500 per violation. Here&#39;s an example: https://www.junkfax.org/w/images/0/0b/SampleDemandLetter.pdfIf they ignore you, be prepared to file a local case in small claims court (which you can do yourself without an attorney). The court can force them to pay you if you present evidence of the calls and the law(s) or regulations that were broken.Disclaimer: I am not a laywer and this is not legal advice, but I have collected money from TCPA legal settlements in the past, each without needing to go to court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to be clear...You&#39;re absolutely sure, 100%, this is Meta employees themselves calling you? And Meta sending you e-mails?Not spammers, of which there are many, and they get your contact info from all sorts of places? And which often lead you to believe they&#39;re Meta when they&#39;re really just scamming you or trying to sell ad placement consulting/optimization services?Because with &#34;multiple&#34; calls and emails... this sounds like 3rd-party spammers, not something Meta does. And while Meta has been loose in the past with walling off information internally (to put it mildly...), it&#39;s not like they sell your contact info to spammers or anything (simply because it&#39;s not worth the effort, the money&#39;s way too small for a company of their size). Third-party spammers, on the other hand, will get your personal info from anywhere and everywhere.For you to make a credible claim that Meta is using your 2FA contact info for marketing, you&#39;ve really got to be sure that it&#39;s 1) actually Meta contacting you and 2) that they got your phone number specifically from 2FA and not just from looking it up publicly the way salespeople do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a feeling that Meta has some kind of internal system for slurping up everyone&#39;s contact info, and that some kind of bugs/criteria occasionally cross some streams.Meta recruiting somehow got a hold of my name@amazon.com employer email -- which I have never posted publicly -- and started sending me recruitment emails to my work email. This struck me as incredibly unprofessional, though I understand it&#39;s almost certainly an automated system doing it.I still don&#39;t know how they got the email address (though I guess it&#39;s just lastname+first initial, so they could have guessed?). I may have DM&#39;d it to someone in a FB messenger chat? Maybe I used it in an &#34;work email&#34; field during sign up for some industry conference whose data later got hacked? A colleague accidentally merged their work/personal contact list and uploaded it somewhere? Who knows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sort of justifies the viewpoint that despite all his bluster, Elon will probably run Twitter the way a &#34;reasonable executive&#34; would.  Not just release the hounds.Keep the advertisers happy, but try to reduce the reliance on advertisers.  Keep moderating content to reduce abuse, maybe eliminate the high profile banning but a person on the ground will have largely the same experience. (probably less action on more contentious issues, but you still can&#39;t use racial epithets and call for violence).  Evaluate most employees or teams on the merits, there will be layoffs, probably big layoffs but they&#39;ll be managed incremental and strategic.  Build more products and pivot the product strongly but again, not in the image of a Parler or a Truth Social.
Twitter won&#39;t become a cesspool because he understands that people need to be able to control what they see or they&#39;ll leave.  Essentially try to create more safe spaces on twitter, not less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a 7 day ban for a tweet that included “political suicide pact” as an idiom.I then got permanently banned for including the line, “sending their children to die in Ukraine” in a tweet.The “appeal” button causes me to get a denied email within one minute. This tells me no humans are in the loop on any of this.I don’t think these tweets were controversial or require any diversity of viewpoints. They just require appreciation that you cannot automatically moderate anything accurately unless you are prepared to be very very VERY relaxed about the rules.I’m not sure Elon is even interested in fixing this kind of problem.

The decision where &#34;you can&#39;t yell fire in a crowded theater&#34; was from was actually overturned in almost entirety in Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969. And even then, it was only an analogy, and never actually was the law. You actually, theoretically, CAN yell fire in a crowded theater. Websites on both sides of the isle have admitted it is a terrible analogy for defending censoring certain content for being potentially harmful. It is, quite literally, a legal myth. A legal myth that still affects our Congress today while they examine how to prevent the spread of misinformation [1].https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/why-falsely-claiming-its-ill...https://reason.com/2022/10/27/yes-you-can-yell-fire-in-a-cro...https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/its-tim...https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/shouting-f...https://www.whalenlawoffice.com/legal-mythbusting-series-yel...https://www.thefire.org/you-can-shout-fire-in-a-burning-thea...[1] For an example (out of many) of why regulating misinformation is legally almost impossible, see United States vs Alvarez, which ruled that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 (which criminalized faking having a military honor) is legally protected speech and the act was a violation of the constitution. Since then it has been extended with a new 2013 act which requires intent to gain something by fraud, which hasn&#39;t been struck down (yet)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On youtube&#39;s desktop site, I&#39;ve also noticed that sometime within the last couple months the home page no longer shows the duration of videos when the page loads. After 3-6 seconds, the timestamps pop in. I don&#39;t know if this is intentionally or a result of lazy-loading - but seeing that the video thumb, title, author, view count, and age all load instantly with the page, I struggle to come up with a reason it could be unintentional.This bothers me because I like to know how long a video is before I commit the time to sitting down and watching it. This feels like an attempt at a dark pattern with the intent to improve metrics - surely watch time is a metric youtube cares about."</p>

It&#39;s been happening for months now but it&#39;s on and off.When you&#39;re watching a video and you go back, the url updates but the page doesn&#39;t refresh/redirect, the video just ends up restarting. Very annoying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The only two possible filters on the list of videos of a channel now are most recent and most popular.Isn&#39;t that all there&#39;s ever been? Just chronological and popularity? This post isn&#39;t very helpful unless you say what you think has been removed. (I, for one, have always wished for most popular over the last 30 days, but oh well.)&gt; Also, there&#39;s less videos on a single row now.You&#39;re going to have to tell us how many there were before and how many there are now. I&#39;m not seeing any difference. It also depends -- are you talking about the home page? Channel home page? Channel videos tab? Because they all act differently.Are you sure you just haven&#39;t changed your zoom settings or something? Or your window width?"</p>

I wasn&#39;t aware of this particular one but it looks like it&#39;s going to have issues with recording anything that requires user input.My post describes how to make high quality recordings of terminal sessions that can be replayed in the terminal, or shared on the web. I&#39;m defining high quality as recordings with zero typos, and relatively controlled timing between commands.I&#39;m going to assume this works well because all the stuff from Charm seems to, BUT its limitations are ... problematic.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hands down, shell scripting is one of my all time favorite languages. It gets tons of hate, e.g. &#34;If you have to write more than 10 lines, then use a real language,&#34; but I feel like those assertions are more socially-founded opinions than technically-backed arguments.My basic thesis is that Shell as a programming language---with it&#39;s dynamic scope, focus on line-oriented text, and pipelines---is simply a different programming paradigm than languages like Perl, Python, whatever.Obviously, if your mental model is BASIC and you try to write Python, then you encounter lots of friction and it&#39;s easy for the latter to feel hacky, bad and ugly. To enjoy and program Python well, it&#39;s probably best to shift your mental model. The same goes for Shell.What is the Shell paradigm? I would argue that it&#39;s line-oriented pipelines. There is a ton to unpack in that, but a huge example where I see friction is overuse of variables in scripts. Trying to stuff data inside variables, with shell&#39;s paucity of data types is a recipe for irritation. However, if you instead organize all your data in a format that&#39;s sympathetic to line-oriented processing on stdin-stdout, then shell will work with you instead of against./2cents"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Use bash. Using zsh or fish or any other, will make it hard for others to understand / collaborate. Among all shells, bash strikes a good balance between portability and DX.I think fish is quite a bit different in terms of syntax and semantics (I&#39;m not very familiar with it), but zsh is essentially the same as bash except without most of the needless footguns and awkwardness. zsh also has many more advanced features, which you don&#39;t need to use (and many people are unaware of them anyway), but will very quickly become useful; in bash all sorts of things require obscure incantations and/or shell pipelines that almost make APL seem obvious in comparison.In my experience few people understand bash (or POSIX sh) in the first place, partly because everything is so difficult and full of caveats. Half my professional shell scripting experience on the job is fixing other people&#39;s scripts. So might as well use something that doesn&#39;t accidentally introduce bugs every other line.Most – though obviously far from all – scripts tend to be run in environments you control; portability is often overrated and not all that important (except when it is of course). Once upon a time I insisted on POSIX sh, and then I realised that actually, &gt;90% of the scripts I wrote were run just by me or run only in an environment otherwise under my control, and that it made no sense. I still use POSIX sh for some public things I write, when it makes sense, but that&#39;s fairly rare.I think bash is really standing in the way of progress, whether that progress is in the form of fish, zsh, oil shell, or something else, because so many people conflate &#34;shell&#34; with &#34;bash&#34;, similar to how people conflate &#34;Google&#34; with &#34;search&#34; or &#34;git&#34; with &#34;GitHub&#34; (to some degree)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Use the .sh (or .bash) extension for your file. It may be fancy to not have an extension for your script, but unless your case explicitly depends on it, you’re probably just trying to do clever stuff. Clever stuff are hard to understand.I don&#39;t agree with this one. When I name my script without extension (btw, .sh is fine, .bash is ugly) I want my script to look just like any other command: as a user I do not care what the language program is written in, I care about its output and what it does.When I develop a script, I get the correct syntax highlight becuase of the shebang so the extension doesn&#39;t matter.The rest of the post is great."</p>

Hundreds of millions of Indians probably use it and if the company were to suspend service because the Indian government mandated a backdoor all hell would break loose!For the same reason both Australia and the UK haven&#39;t as of yet forced WhatsApp to install a backdoor, even though legislation forcing them to do so is already in place there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is my article from 2017.Here&#39;s a short update on what happened since then:1. DMCA takedowns did not destroy ad blocking (thank god), but there were a couple more times when it was tried, nothing huge though.2. Streisand effect is a thing and the domain in question was blocked by everyone and everywhere. There was even a special filter list and later a browser extension which only purpose was to block such domains. It got some traction but later got abandoned: https://github.com/paulgb/BarbBlock. If something like that happens again I am pretty sure it can be revived very quickly.3. The corporations still try different angles to prohibit ad blocking. The last example I know about is something like this: Axel Springer claimed that the web page and all its content (including subrequest) and ads is subject to copyright law. So when you modify the web page with adding new styles or blocking a web request you violate the copyright."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the article is from 2017, the relevance is high today.Large adtech companies are coalescing and supporting a single browser framework that gives them a modicum of control around how adblockers are integrated into the extensions, while also funding directly or indirectly realistic browser competition through Firefox (sorry Brave and Vivaldi... still a ways to go market share-wise). The economist in me thinks there is formal and informal coordination to make this ad &#34;market&#34; exist (no one wants ads, really, they want search engines with relevant results) and there is exercise in market power to the detriment of businesses purchasing advertising (and waste to society writ large)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ad blocking is by definition attacking ads and all the companies and interests that revolve around that.So ad blocking is and always will be &#34;under attack&#34;, that was always expected, &#34;small&#34; players, like individual news sites for example have been fighting ad blocking for years, now big players are feeling the heat too and since ad blocking is an &#34;existential threat&#34; ( Meta just learned that ), they no longer ignore it or &#34;kinda deal with it&#34;.It always has been a war. And like every war, there are endless philosophical theories and discussions about the &#34;sustainability&#34; of the Web &#34;without ads&#34;, the  tracking, etc.But the reality is: It always has been a war."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is neither shocking, nor new.A decade ago I remember a friend who had a small business selling some niche collectors items. One day, he was scammed. The guy reported that the package was never delivered and, without even investigating, Paypal banned my friend&#39;s account and awarded the buyer their money back.Paypal has always, and will always be a shit company. Charging people $2,500 for wrongthink is simply asinine. They must be betting BIG on either woke politics being mainstream for the long term, unbreakable bonds with their existing customers, or both. I can&#39;t even think of someone around me that uses paypal regularly.I will be interested in reading the technical report on how they plan on implementing this because I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be silicon valley diarrhea. I am currently working out how to pay companies in a similar fashion to Paypal. I&#39;m looking at Privacy.com but something is off about it to me for some reason. Once that is solved I&#39;ll get this ape off my back forever.I wonder what happens if I just say &#34;lol, not paying&#34; to them. Would they put me in collections? It seems infeasible to even enforce this and it strikes me that clicking a button doesn&#39;t amount of a legal agreement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How exactly do conditions like this work in practice?I can go ahead and write a ToS or even a contract that says &#34;if you don&#39;t give me a blue M&amp;M on Saturday 29 October 2022, you owe me $1M&#34;. I can get a client to sign it, perhaps it&#39;s part of my conditions as a freelancer.I can&#39;t realistically see any court enforcing that.As far as I can tell PayPal can only get away with this nonsense because they hold your money anyway. It&#39;s exactly the sort of reason people are fighting against cashless/custodial financial systems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something similar happened to my dad (USAF fighter pilot) in around 1961 or 62: He was test-flying a T-33 single-engine jet trainer assigned to his unit after it&#39;d had repair work. The engine quit and wouldn&#39;t restart. He ejected, but his parachute didn&#39;t deploy fully (much the same as in the article) and he got tangled in the shrouds. He said a quick Hail Mary just before crashing head-first in a muddy, fresh-plowed field. The pilot of another plane in the area saw the crash and radioed the tower to send the meat wagon and not the ambulance, but my dad walked away with just a headache — and with his helmet split open like a melon. The impact apparently damaged his inner ear: five years later he started getting vertigo while aloft, and soon afterwards got medically grounded. (That meant he lost the extra flight pay and was reduced to his base pay, with four school-aged kids while stationed in the Washington DC area — to make ends meet, my mother had to go back to work as an RN [registered nurse].)EDIT: What I remember was that when my dad crashed (see above), my mom came to get me from playing with the neighbor kids in their yard. Dad had called her from the flight surgeon&#39;s office and told her about the crash (very nonchalantly, she later said), and that he was OK. So six-year-old me blithely went on playing. Of course, my mom had been living with that possibility all their married life ...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a story of insane luck (and unluck!), the craziest part is definitely this&#34;  He said that if I had had a spleen, it almost certainly would have ruptured when I hit the water, and I would have bled to death. Of the 25 pilots in our squadron, I am the only one without a spleen. It gives me something to think about. Maybe it does you as well.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This happened in 1963.  Planes had only been flying for 60 years at that point; it really is pretty amazing how quickly we progressed on technology during those early years.  We still fly 737s, which are descended from a design that first flew in 1967.  As well as the C130, which was part of this story.  And don&#39;t get me started on B-52s, which are even older.We have made great strides since then, of course, but it does feel like 90% of the fundamental aviation technology we have today was created just in the first few decades."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The IME gets a lot of hate around here, but let&#39;s not get distracted by it: higher-privilege co-processors running code outside the main OS&#39; control is becoming (or already is) the norm everywhere. Intel-based PCs are just one instance of it (and perhaps not even the most egregious one).Most hardware has evolved to effectively run the main OS under a sandbox where it &#34;thinks&#34; it is in control, but isn&#39;t.A nice talk on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36myc8wQhLo"</p>

They make it sound plausible, and I think &#34;why isn&#39;t this talked about or investigated more?&#34; The section of the Wikipedia page that discusses the &#34;backdoor&#34; claim is frustratingly thin. I just don&#39;t know what to make of it. Hyperbole about a crappy thing, like the bloatware pre-installed on most new laptops and phones by the vendor?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As others have noted, they still have an education focused robotics set, it’s just not called Mindstorms:
https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-education-spike-prim...As a now-successful robotics engineer, I was the target age when the first Lego mindstorms set came out. Due to the cost it had to be a combined birthday and Christmas present (still obviously very privileged). The simple scratch-like programming system that kit used was great for me as a tween learning robotics.Today I am designing an open source farming robot as a non profit project! (See my profile)The early history of Lego Mindstorms is interesting. I didn’t realize Seymour Papert was involved but that makes a lot of sense! Especially with the name Mindstorms:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstormshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms_(book)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got the original Lego Mindstorms 1.0 kit for my 8th birthday - there was no programming interface, just a way to select one of 256 possible sequences of high-level actions the robot would perform in a loop. I paid for my first car by working at summer camps that taught kids how to use the Mindstorms 2.0 and NXT, and built my first 3D printer with Lejos (https://lejos.sourceforge.io/), Lego Technic parts and a tiny spindle router that could sculpt shapes into floral foam.While I&#39;m saddened by this news for nostalgic reasons, I personally believe that today&#39;s young learners are better served by the proliferation of hobby robotics platforms like Arduino/Raspberry Pi. Every summer camp I worked at would claim that Lego robotics teaches real-world engineering skills, while in reality the students were just happy to stay within the comfort zone of playing with Legos and using a block-based programming environment (one that has quite frankly gone from bad to worse to absolutely horrible with each product cycle). Also, FIRST Lego League does nothing meaningful to prepare students for FIRST - when I donated supplies and a few weeks of mentorship to my former high school&#39;s FIRST team, I was dismayed to see how much dead weight the team was carrying in students who participated in the middle school Lego league, who did not have even the basic coding/engineering skills to make any contribution to the high school team other than paying the membership dues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to see this as someone who enjoyed these as a kid and entering robotics competitions based off of them; hopefully the new products will keep the spirit alive.There was even some decent FOSS tooling that developed on top of Mindstorms: I used NXC (Not eXactly C, https://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/welcome.html) which was a C-like language  for programming Lego Mindstorms. It looks like the last release of NXC was in 2011."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When people say they want career progression, and opportunities, what they mostly mean is they want more money. Unfortunately, most companies have fallen into the trap where if someone has a title of X they can only make up to Y, regardless of how good they are at their job or how long they&#39;ve done it. When that happens then the name of the game is getting a promotion in order to keep making more money. That creates a perverse incentive, and the result is political bullshit that is typically misaligned with the company&#39;s interests which further drives away your high performers.End the perverse incentives. Pay your people well if they&#39;re doing a good job, regardless of how long they&#39;ve been doing the same job or what their title is. Reward seniority and loyalty. Suddenly, you&#39;ll find that employee retention goes through the roof, and you don&#39;t have to worry about hiring new people all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Too many times in my career have I seen an employer lose an employee, who has a ton of institutional knowledge and performs adequately or even excellently, only to replace them them with someone that ends up costing much more money, and then takes a lot of time to get up to speed (which also slows the folks who help get them up to speed).It is like they haven&#39;t taken the time to even make a rudimentary calculation on the costs involved in keeping the employee versus replacing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hazard of retention is creating dependency. Dependency means, not just high bus factor, but opening yourself (the business) up to being vulnerable to another person&#39;s superior negotiation position. Then CEOs/boardmembers would have to spread their wealth rather than hoarding it all for themselves. Without a way to force CEO/boardmembers to spread their wealth (unions), I think we can expect companies to do what is in their best interest, maintaining a monopoly on power by ensuring no dependencies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I used play soccer regularly, I&#39;d occasionally experience being &#34;in the zone&#34;. It&#39;s a blissful experience where my body is able to execute incredibly complex set of moves in perfect coordination as my mind enters a state of zen-like calm.The sensation is almost like a being spectator in my own body. My brain feels like it&#39;s been relieved of the task of managing the moment-to-moment decision. Instead I start noticing moves 3, 4 steps ahead as time slows to a crawl around me. I don&#39;t know if this type of experience is related in any way to the theory of consciousness, but it feels like the unconscious mind holds a lot of secrets that I&#39;d love to see unlocked in my lifetime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a rumored experiment called the &#34;precognitive carousel&#34;, supposedly run by Grey Walter, where:(1) Subjects are told to push a button to advance a slide projector carousel, but not told that the button is inert(2) The carousel advances based on electrical signals measured by wires on the subjects&#39; scalp.(3) Subjects supposedly report the uncanny feeling that the projector advances &#34;just before&#34; they were about to push the button -- 300-400 milliseconds before, a pretty long time.I read about this a long time ago in a since-deleted post on an old timey internet forum (everything2).The writer suggested this research supports the idea that your body chooses what to do, then informs your brain, and your consciousness convinces itself that has decided to do what the body is about to do on its own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I realize that the link between consciousness and quantum effects are far from proven but if you will entertain the idea that they are...Delayed-choice experiments demonstrate the seeming ability of measurements in the present to alter events occurring in the past. eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraserNow I&#39;ll throw out another completely unprovable thought...Perhaps consciousness has the ability to affect how wavefunction collapse occurs, perhaps it even has the ability to influence the observed outcome.I&#39;m not going to try to prove these two ideas but together they can help form an idea that perhaps observations on the past actually influence the past and perhaps despite this &#39;observation after the fact&#39; there&#39;s still free will.It&#39;s not provable but then neither is the &#34;there&#39;s no such thing as free will&#34; arguments that this sort of research leads to. The point of the above is to highlight that there&#39;s still a way out for free will."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. 90% of the Application&#39;s Data are already in my LinkedIN, or my CV / Resume. Why the heck do I have to fill it in again.2. Some companies even / still requires you bring your University Certificate or whatever as proof. For Pete sake. That was decades ago. Can I pay $5 to LinkedIn or whatever so once and for all they can verify it from there.3. The other 8% of the application that I have not included details in my CV/ Resume or LinkedIn could have been reused across all applications. Why do I have rewrite it again.4. You are not fucking suppose to verify or reference check on me before I even had my interview or offer. So now my boss / management knows I am job hunting?5. By the time I get to the end of the application I am already exhausted depending how bad the day I had. And some form of PTSD from previous interview where i had to contain my thermonuclear anger or else going absolute animal against the HR / agent / interviewer. Because I have to be professional.6. My thought on why all these are so bad is because job application, listing site, social network ( LinkedIn ) all work for hiring companies, they are the ones who pay them. And not job seekers. Someone needs to figure out a way where we can turn this around and empower ( I hate this word, but I dont have anything better in my vocab ) employees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I m one of these, i fill out the form, then i get the memories i had interacting with some of these companies, working at other companies. The Process-Dementia, the hostilitys, the relentless culture of using all things in human interaction as renegotiation ammonition. The relentless pressure, ignoring all social norms and employee health, to complete a task. The shallow friendliness, that ended as soon as your usefullness expired. The internal fights, silos and slightly drunk employees, who hated it there, but couldnt say it, cause big Brother Middle Management is everywhere.Its considered the &#34;good jobs&#34; in my area, as in well paid enough to own a house, but every time im tempted to apply and see the logos, and the memories come back, i abort these applications.Some companies are cesspools and its good to remember that and stay away from them. I also warn others to stay away from them. Some people hack these companies and get the easy life there, which is nice, but for people who actually want to work and not interact with such a culture.. not even as customers, if it can be avoided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently I wanted to apply to a company. First they had you read some weird document telling you how they can’t pay high salaries, so you should be modest with your expectations.Then further down the form they require you to record a video introducing yourself and telling them why they should hire you.Ended up closing the form right there.Do these people not realize how annoying their process is and how talented people don’t have to put up with crap like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Checking for my own “benchmark”, a gameboy emulator in several different languages[0]; it’s CPU-bound but across ~3k lines of code, so slightly more representative of real-world apps than a single-function tight-loop microbenchmark:     zig: Emulated 600 frames in  0.24s (2521fps)
      rs: Emulated 600 frames in  0.37s (1626fps)
     cpp: Emulated 600 frames in  0.40s (1508fps)
     nim: Emulated 600 frames in  0.44s (1367fps)
      go: Emulated 600 frames in  1.75s (342fps)

Doubling the speed is pretty nice :D Still the slowest out of all implementations though :P[0] https://github.com/shish/rosettaboyEDIT&gt; updated the nim compiler flags to build in release mode like most other languages, thanks @plainOldText!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Besides strict typing and having a generally ugly syntax, C++ also requires ahead of time compilation.”What’s wrong with strict typing and ahead of time compilation as long as it compiles fast?  Doesn’t this prevent many runtime errors that can occur in Python?Python is a higher level language than C++ so it requires less effort but newer compiled/typed languages offer more of what Python is good at"</p>
