								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fully agree with this. Scanning Google News or a couple of the more professional international news services like BBC / Al Jazeera / Reuters I still feel pretty well informed (and confident that there&#39;s usually nothing of immediate consequence to me) but it doesn&#39;t grow into &#34;expert analysis&#34; or impact my feelings much. Here&#39;s another thing I noticed: how manipulated / manipulative it is. And not just news and I don&#39;t just mean politically - I know everyone thinks that news that doesn&#39;t align with their politics is just brainwashing. Broadcast TV is just generally awful now IMO.We went quite a few years without ever seeing cable. My kids would stream shows and consume other media on-demand, but any advertising was minimal and fairly non-intrusive. And then they were watching a kids show at a hotel once and the ads came on and the effect it had on them was crazy. They suddenly desperately needed all the toys in the commercials and were repeating catch phrases from ads after only seeing them a couple of times. The contrast in their behavior was insane. And they HAD to keep watching it like I hadn&#39;t seen before. I spent a week off-grid with my parents a while back and it was great. We came home and my Mom put on the news suddenly everything was terrible and she was angry, but she had to keep watching.Just awful for mental health if you can&#39;t separate yourself from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who just stepped back into pop culture after being in prison for years (so might as well been on the moon) my first shock was just how horrible it all is now. There is no news worth watching. Cable news is just a pile of filth excremented by a Labrador Retriever that solely eats baby diapers. I thought I will watch Bloomberg since if real money is involved it can&#39;t be too manipulative. Nope, wrong. The internet is just a fireheap. Let&#39;s check Reddit. Oh god close the browser window immediately. WTF? Slashdot? Um, what is this, someone wearing a Slashdot skin suit? How about the sites by supposedly rational academics on each side of the political persuasion to get some balance. WTF? Just hate and anger and toxicity on a crazy level otherizing any opinion not their own. People are once thought great intellectual insides making incredibly uncharitable frankly hate filled comments and self isolating in echo chambers. Google Discovery app... &#34;here&#39;s some blog posts summarizing relationship posts made on Reddit&#34;. Huh? Why would anyone want to read this let alone have it further aggregated for them? Seriously, modern American discourse has less humanity, compassion, depth, and recognition of nuance THAN PRISON. Or maybe prison just made me less patient of bull crap and able to immediate horrible people by their mannerisms. Seriously this site is the only place I have found still sane and enlightening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the value-added of journalism to society has changed drastically since the Internet. If I&#39;m interested in a topic or issue I can find writing by people who actually practice it, and I can find the primary sources if at all possible.In particular, I question the need for giant journalistic institutions like the New York Times or Fox News or any other. If anything happens anywhere I tune to the local news first, because I&#39;d rather read that then the NYT copy/pasta from that, along with some quote from some friend-of-a-former-professor expert.That said, the news fills a valuable function even if you don&#39;t read it. When Alzheimer&#39;s gets cured, I will likely learn about it from a headline.I am torn on this issue, partially because I don&#39;t want to let my past deeply unhealthy relationship with reading about current events affect how I view it vis a vie society."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I avoid all things Samsung for a much more important reason: They spy on you mercilessly, up to about the same level as Facebook.For example, they take screenshots of what you watch on your Samsung Televisions!Don&#39;t believe me? Take it from them: https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/resources/tv-... and https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/insights/You&#39;re not their customer, you&#39;re the product.Additionally, Samsung have a habit of releasing forced updates that almost-but-not-entirely brick their TVs, slowing them down to molasses. They do this right before the next model becomes available for purchase.Last but not least, a colleague worked there as a consultant, and his stories of their lax IT security were nearly unbelievable. Even though they spy on you like Google or Facebook, they are not like a FAANG when it comes to protecting your private info! They&#39;ve been hacked for sure, probably by multiple nation state actors. Whatever you watch or do with their TVs is being relayed to the US, Russians, Chinese, or whomever. Assume that nothing you do with a Samsung device or Samsung software is remotely secure or safe.They&#39;re a slimy company made up of unscrupulous people trying to squeeze every last drop out of every rock.Don&#39;t give them your money. There are many other companies with much better track records."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am truly, deeply, unsurprised that foldable phones fail along the seam.I know that&#39;s not the point of the post, and I&#39;m not blaming the author. It just seems like such a ridiculous concept in the first place. My old flip phone had its own problems, and there wasn&#39;t even a display along the seam."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the author had a folding phone that failed and couldn&#39;t get it repaired/replaced. The narrow take is that you&#39;re kinda crazy to buy a folding phone but Samsung was selling them so is really on the hook for the inevitable issues.The story of getting it fixed is really why people love Apple and even Amazon.I&#39;ve had the Wifi go unreliable on an iPad. I got a Genius appointment for later that day. They confirmed the Wifi module was shot and just gave me a new device on the spot. They even offered to do the transfer for me. This sort of convenience is what gives people confidence in buying Apple products.Even something as simple as accessory access matters. If my Macbook charger dies, I can walk into any number of stores and buy another. Dell charger? Not so much.Amazon has pretty accurate shipping estimates. This matters. So does Apple for the record. Just last week I got sent the wrong product. I didn&#39;t have to talk to anyone on the phone. I simply went to my order on my phone and clicked &#34;return item&#34; -&gt; &#34;wrong product&#34; and the entire matter was dealt with.I don&#39;t want to deal with support that is deliberately hard to contact that is monetarily motivated to not do anything for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I changed careers at 40+ years old.  I&#39;m very happy that I did it.People have all sorts of constructs / ideas about how careers work (based on experience) or how they think it works, or how they want it to work.   I talk to some college graduates who tell me what they&#39;re planning for and have ZERO clue what industry they&#39;re talking about, their description is unrecognizable to me ... even tho I know it is the one I work in.I find your experience and paths can vary greatly company to company, even job to job.We all find truths we want to hold on to about work.   I recall trips to the valley where my coworkers where astonished to hear tales of people doing the same work they did, but doing it slightly differently elsewhere in the country.  Their view of how that job was done was entirely shaped by the couple places they worked (and everyone seemed to cycle through those couple companies).   You&#39;d think these folks though that if you didn&#39;t fill out the TPS report right to left that the world would end... I&#39;m pretty sure the vast majority of people fill them out left to right but I didn&#39;t feel like telling them that, it might have been too much for them to handle.&#34;
I think there are three main kinds of career destination, at least in the tech industry:    Independent
    Senior individual contributor (IC)
    Management
&#34;I have no idea why those are the only destinations ... for an article worried about being happy that seems kind of limited.The whole article feels very pie in the sky to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;It&#39;s not surprising, then, that many of us find ourselves in less than fully satisfying jobs, with doubtful or non-existent prospects for advancement.&#34;Very true. I can&#39;t wait for my career to be over. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever find the position where I feel I belong, so I&#39;ll just be miserable anywhere now that I know how broken the system really is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I think there are three main kinds of career destination, at least in the tech industry:&gt; Independent&gt; Senior individual contributor (IC)&gt; ManagementI guess I&#39;ll stick my neck out and just admit that I don&#39;t want to give any more fucks about any of the above and just wake up, sip my tea, read the news and take a bloody nap whenever I want to. Also volunteering/open source but mostly, not doing things I don&#39;t want to do any more. Yep, I don&#39;t want to be &#34;incredibly excited&#34; about the &#34;next growth chapter of my life&#34; - I just want to live my life in a non-agile way without sprinting towards the end of it. That is about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The simple answer is to reject the cashless society.In the medium to long term it&#39;s simply incompatible with any reasonable definition of freedom. Surveillance is bad enough, but a system that allows governments to arbitrarily &#34;turn off&#34; thousands or millions of people at the push of a button is too powerful to not be abused.Even the mere existence of such a system has a chilling effect. Which I suspect is precisely what these people want and is exactly why we can&#39;t give it to them.I&#39;ll take inconvenience over slavery any day of the week.This isn&#39;t some sort of anarcho-libertarian paradise opinion, I have no issue with there being a well functioning justice system.But yeah, if you want to seize assets, get a court order and go and lock someone in a box and take their things, don&#39;t take the cowardly way out and pretend that you&#39;ve just flipped a database key and it&#39;s not really a big deal.By the same token, if you tell me there&#39;s been a murder on my street I&#39;ll give you the CCTV footage of my door cam. If you ask me for a backdoor, I&#39;ll tell you where to shove it. That&#39;s what being a member of a free society is, that seemingly minor distinction is one of the most important things we have and better minds than mine have sought to elaborate on why.Even a child is able to understand that force is still force regardless of whether it involves the direct visible physical kind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that this needs to be taken very seriously. However, the author overstates his case significantly when he writes:&gt; Doing this to someone—a small business owner in BC, a public servant in Winnipeg, a student in Halifax—who made a small donation to support the convoy is a clear abuse of power.However:&gt; The RCMP, banking sector and federal government said Monday that account-freezing powers bestowed under the Emergencies Act to help authorities deal with convoy protests do not affect donors to the protests, despite unsubstantiated claims by a Conservative MP that a constituent had her bank account frozen over a $50 contribution.&gt; “At no time, did we provide a list of donors to Financial Institutions,” the RCMP said in a statement Monday. [1]Facts are important!1: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-rcmp-banks-an..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most concerning thing about Trudeau&#39;s use of the Emergencies Act is that it was both unnecessary and, despite the protests being quelled, ongoing.First, the police in Ottawa chose not to enforce even basic laws in the area of the protest for several weeks.  The result was lawlessness and a total lack of respect for the police.  They were being jeered at for putting threatening flyers under windshield wipers one day, and the next they brought in armoured vehicles and riot squads.  If the police had consistently written tickets and made arrests from the start of the protest it likely would not have grown as large as it did.Presently, Trudeau is keeping the Emergencies Act in effect, not because there is an ongoing emergency, but because there might be.  He&#39;s argued that some of the protesters have not left Ottawa and might return to the protest site if given the chance to do so, but there is nothing in the Emergency act that is required for the police to maintain peace and order.  Trudeau wants the act to remain in effect for other reasons apparently.The opposition is introducing a motion in parliament to end the Act, but that will likely fail unless Trudeau loses the NDP&#39;s support.  However, the senate could also end the Act at any time.  Given that the emergency is over they should do just that.  It is entirely unclear what Trudeau hopes to accomplish by holding onto these powers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had the chance to work with a few people I&#39;d consider genius level.  While I&#39;m pretty smart myself, they all have something I don&#39;t always have:  The ability to be happy in any situation and interested in everything.For example, we were walking trough a hallway. On a wall is an old, damaged, ugly map of my country, half covered with graffiti.  I&#39;d walked past it almost every day for half a year.He checks it out, and starts noticing a lot of semi-interesting factoids about names, merged cities, obscure places, old mapping conventions, etc...  All of this with an absolute positive energy of pure interest.  We spent a fun hour just looking at it.  I should have known all this, and yet an hour with him makes me look at it with new eyes.Wherever he was, he instantly attracted a group of friends and wannabe girlfriends, and never really seemed to notice.  Same in this case:  There was a group of beautiful partygirls we&#39;d never met before, no nerdy interests at all, which accreted around the map in less than 5 minutes. They loved the situation just as much as us nerds did.I learned a lot from him, and try to follow this example, but I still can&#39;t do this today and am humiliated (in a positive way) by this way of living."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; we suggest that leaders follow the science and take a structured approach to hiring for, promoting, and developing employee happiness&gt; Measure happiness in both employees and job candidates.&gt; we conservatively advocate using measures of happiness and optimism as discriminators, or tiebreakers, because the risks are low and the benefits could be important.Good luck getting a job, unhappy people…I don’t think they have the evidence to make this recommendation, since they surveyed people already employed (by the US army), who may have been unhappier pre employment.&gt; might dismiss these results if you believe that military data somehow doesn’t apply to the business world, but you would be wrong to do so. After all, the U.S. Department of Defense is the single largest employer in the worldTheir entire argument for this also applying outside the military domain seems to be that the military is a very large employer… However, is not the military a vastly different environment from normal civilian workplaces?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading these comments is forehead slap inducing. People think that just because something is mental that it has to do with your mindset, your parents, your this your that.When a dude can run faster than other people, it’s written off as genetics. When someone is resilient to depression, it’s anything other than genetics. Both cases are the same: it’s just biological.I’ve been suffering super hard with depression recently and it’s made something clear to me: your mindset is bullshit. It might tip things one way or another but the actual mechanisms of depression will change your life. Everyone will be super humbled when we figure out how to turn off depression, and everyone gets it and everyone experienced on average a 50% boost to their intelligence and productivity. They will be humbled because they will realize that all of that relative suffering was totally pointless and for no other reason than a quirk of evolution. And that some people had it good for absolutely no reason. But it’s exciting to know that this day will come and it can’t come fast enough for me!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool demonstration of regular expression power!
Note that as implemented, this is a space bounded Turing Machine with a hardcoded tape length limit:&gt; With the current implementation, the read/write head looks at the 22nd element of the tape whenever we want to read the current position. With complicated machines that utilize long lengths of the tape, you would need to increase this number so that you never delete a necessary tape element as you scroll along it. This can be done by increasing the {20} that appears at the beginning of the expression.Embedding the tape head pointer ^ within the tape, just to the left of the scanned bit, should remove this restriction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"   The instruction sets are the remaining lines, formatted like &gt;C.I:WMN
   C current instruction name.
   I the input from the current tape position. Either 0 or 1. Each instruction has 
   execution parameters for both inputs.
   W the output to be written to the tape at the current position. Either 0 or 1.
   M the movement of the read/write head. A 0 moves the head one position to the 
   left. A 1 moves it to the right.
   N the name of the next instruction to be executed at the new tape position.

Would it have been clearer to use &#34;&lt;&#34; or &#34;&gt;&#34; to specify whether to move left/right from the current position?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen a lot of commentary about the fact that the Emergencies Act provisions &#34;expire&#34; automatically after 30 days, and include &#34;safeguards&#34;, ergo there&#39;s nothing worry about. People getting hung up on the text of the bill forget that it&#39;s merely an Act of Parliament, and thus can easily be amended or replaced via a simple majority vote.What played out last night indicates that none of these checks and balances really matter in a parliamentary system where the nuclear option of a non-confidence vote (and subsequent election) can be invoked to force any MPs with qualms to vote along party lines.It&#39;s easy to see what will happen next, based on this government&#39;s track record: they will introduce amendments to the Act, or new legislation containing only the provisions they would like to make permanent, and once again proclaim that voting against the amendment will result in a new election.They will probably also use it as an excuse to ram through their &#34;Online Harms Bill&#34;, i.e. internet censorship, targeted at &#34;misinformation&#34; (disagreeable speech) and, many suspect, independent media outlets that the PM despises.Internet censorship + government-directed financial de-platforming = Canada&#39;s near-term future if the situation doesn&#39;t change somehow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Occupy Wall Street was started by a group of organized Canadians and they blocked access to NYSE facilities. OWS was obviously an occupation (it’s right there in the name), but the better question is: was OWS a protest, too? If so, why can’t this be called one as well?There are generally more parallels between OWS and the truckers than people are willing to recognize, because there’s been a hell of an inversion: if you supported OWS 10 years ago you probably don’t like the truckers today and if you like the truckers you probably weren’t for OWS 10 years ago. There are a handful of Tim Pools that like both, and there are elites that disliked both, but the average person has to do some gymnastics.All that I ask is that everyone is consistent: if OWS is a protest, then this is too. If you don’t like that Americans funded the truckers, you have to be willing to call out that OWS took place in NYC but formed from a Canadian nonprofit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A related report from the BBC (published a few days ago):Europe gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/58888451Some key points in the BBC article:- Russia supplies about 40% of the EU’s natural gas imports. Most of the rest comes from Norway and Algeria.- Russia sends gas to Europe through several main pipelines - such as the Nord Stream, the Yamal-Europe and the Brotherhood (see the map in the article).- Overall, Russian gas exports to Europe have been decreasing over the last couple of years - down 32% in February this year compared to February 2020. One factor - during the pandemic - has been falling demand as economic activity shrank. Stocks of gas across Europe have been depleted, which in turn is driving up prices.- Gazprom, Russia&#39;s majority state-owned energy company, supplies gas to Europe under two different arrangements: 1. Long-term contracts often lasting from 10 to 25 years. 2. &#34;Spot&#34; deals or one-off purchases for a fixed amount of gas.- It is understood that Gazprom met its obligations to European buyers last year under these contracts.- &#34;Spot&#34; sales don&#39;t appear to be happening in any significant quantity, going by data from Gazprom&#39;s own electronic sales platform.- The International Energy Agency&#39;s executive director, Fatih Birol, has accused Russia of reducing gas supplies to Europe for political purposes.- Gas storage across Europe is well below the 10-year average, with levels currently at about 75% of storage capacity, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is not remotely pulling the plug. This is &#34;thinking about it&#34; again. They already stopped accreditation a few weeks ago, otherwise it would already transport gas as the pipeline is already filled. They just say that they have officially stopped the process which they more or less already did. I think in a year it might come online again if the news cycle is on another topic.Overall it will be much more expensive for Europe than for Russia. Who do you think will profit the most if gas prices hike?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s some quick numbers I just googled to understand the big picture.This pipeline has an annual capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. It&#39;s the same capacity as the Nord Stream 1, which is already in operation. If Germany was truly meaning business, they&#39;d stop Nord Stream 1 the moment Russian boots enter Ukrainian territory. But let&#39;s leave that aside.55 billion cubic meters translate to about 0.6 billion MWh. The price today for natural gas Dutch TTF futures is EUR 78/MWh [1] , so that translates in about 40 billion EUR per year.  It has been as low as EUR 13 and as high as EUR 165 over the last 2 years. It&#39;s quite likely that Russia would make a profit even at the lower range, so the 40 billion EUR/year is pretty much pure profit for them.[1] https://www.theice.com/products/27996665/Dutch-TTF-Gas-Futur..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank goodness. Bethesda&#39;s launcher was uniquely awful in a number of unpleasant ways. Slow, prone to crashes, bad user communication, not suitable for use on small monitors. The worst of the launcher apps I have used - and there are so many!I remember when it was in vogue for every game maker to build their own launcher or even full Steam clone - when EA pulled all its new games from Steam to get people to use Origin, when Ubisoft forced uPlay on you no matter how you bought the game, and so on. Now, it seems like we&#39;re pulling back from that situation somewhat - a lot of EA games are back on Steam, for example.I wonder whether the experiment didn&#39;t work, or if it worked, but now the goals have changed again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a technical reason why Steam is a such a force in the space? People, myself certainly included, often criticize Apple for taking 30% of developer revenue for merely existing in it&#39;s walled garden. Right or wrong, they control the ecosystem, so their ability to monopolize and heavily tax the App Store is unsurprising, they&#39;re exercising their pricing power as much as they possibly can.But how is it that on PC, where we have a mostly open field on which anyone can participate freely without a gatekeeper&#39;s blessing, Steam managed to consolidate so much of the gaming marketplace that even a titan like Microsoft is throwing the towel and bowing to Steam&#39;s cartelish 30%? I get that being the dominant two-sided marketplace of a given space is a strong network effect and moat, and consolidation is certainly convenient for users (I like having all my purchased games on a single account), but intuition tells me Bethesda doesn&#39;t need Steam&#39;s exposure to sell games or make new arrivals known (their announcement will go viral regardless), similarly to Riot, Mojang, Epic and co not listing on Steam. So I&#39;ve always found it surprising they were dual listing their games in the first place, but the fact they&#39;re now entirely giving up on direct selling is a testament to Steam&#39;s might in the gaming industry.Is Steam&#39;s product particularly good and hard to reproduce from the publisher&#39;s PoV, even one backed by Microsoft, to the extent it is hard to compete against with something like Microsoft Store? Or is this just another case of being early enough to establish the initial brand and let the self-fulfilling network effect kick in - with the userbase acting like gravity to bring in more users and developers - until it&#39;s large enough that sheer force of habit/inertia makes it quasi-&#34;indisruptible&#34;?Either way, I found it fascinating how Valve turned into Steam, whether it was accidental or not, what a homerun pivot. Seems that is the way of the Internet, being first matters more than just about anything, having the superior product (not claiming there is one for game stores) is irrelevant if you&#39;re remotely late, it just won&#39;t matter how much cash you pour into a Microsoft Store or a Google+. My gut tells me Microsoft is salivating at the idea of buying out Steam, seems like a perfect fit for the conglomerate if it wasn&#39;t for the scrutiny it would bring their way while they are positioning themselves as the good FAAMG."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a matter of principle, I think digital delivery platforms benefit from competition, and we should not be locked down into a single monopolistic, stagnating platform.As a selfish consumer though, I hugely wish we just had Steam and Netflix:The Origins and Uplays and Battle.nets of the world exist solely to make my life difficult, refusing to play my game when I want it due to obscure update required or forgotten password or old email account (especially when they are an overlay on top of Steam), and have zero repeat zero positively zero benefit to myself as a consumer. It is blatantly anti-consumer, and not made with customer view in mind.(Gog.com gets a pass because it allows me to JUST download the game, with no launcher and crap, so essentially going into opposite direction from all publisher-owned platforms and provides a unique value proposition)Same for Netflix.  It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good. It&#39;s great! Over the last 5 years, proliferation of Disneys, Amazons, HBOs, Hulus, CBS All Access, Paramount Ultra Plus Exclusive Diamond Platinum... the whatEVERs, all they do is make me have to guess which  service is content I want to play on. All they are, at any level, is &#34;we want more money for less consumer convenience, and we think we can get away with it due to exclusive content lock-in we refuse to license to the convenient platform&#34;.I understand I&#39;m supposed to vote with my money, but with exclusive lock-in that&#39;s difficult. My kid wants their Octonauts and their Stinky &amp; Dirties, dammit :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always liked the embedded system model where you get flash hardware that has two operations -- erase block and write block.  GC, RAID, error correction, etc. are then handled at the application level.  It was never clear to me that the current tradeoff with consumer-grade SSDs was right.  On the one hand, things like the error correction, redundancy, and garbage collection don&#39;t require the attention from CPU (and more importantly, doesn&#39;t tie up any bus).  On the other hand, the user has no control over what the software on the SSD&#39;s chip does.  Clearly vendors and users are at odds with each other here; vendors want the best benchmarks (so you can sort by speed descending and pick the first one), but users want their files to exist after their power goes out.It would be nice if we could just buy dumb flash and let the application do whatever it wants (I guess that application would be your filesystem; but it could also be direct access for specialized use cases like databases).   If you want maximum speed, adjust your settings for that.  If you want maximum write durability, adjust your settings for that.  People are always looking for that one size fits all use case, but it&#39;s hard here.  Some people may be running cloud providers and already have software to store that block on 3 different continents.  Some people may be an embedded system with a fixed disk image that changes once a year, with some temporary storage for logs.  There probably isn&#39;t a single setting that gets optimal use out of the flash memory for both use cases.  The cloud provider doesn&#39;t care if a block, flash chip, drive, server rack, availability zone, or continent goes away.  The embedded system may be happy to lose logs in exchange for having enough writes left to install the next security update.It&#39;s all a mess, but the constraints have changed since we made the mess.  You used to be happy to get 1/6th of a PCI Express lane for all your storage.  Now processors directly expose 128 PCIe lanes and have a multitude of underused efficiency cores waiting to be used.  Maybe we could do all the &#34;smart&#34; stuff in the OS and application code, and just attach commodity dumb flash chips to our computer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve actually run into some data loss running simple stuff like pgbench on Hetzner due to this -- I ended up just turning off write-back caching at the device level for all the machines in my cluster:https://vadosware.io/post/everything-ive-seen-on-optimizing-...Granted I was doing something highly questionable (running postgres with fsync off on ZFS) It was very painful to get to the actual issue, but I&#39;m glad I found out.I&#39;ve always wondered if it was worth pursuing to start a simple data product with tests like these on various cloud providers to know where these corners are and what you&#39;re really getting for the money (or lack thereof).[EDIT] To save people some time (that post is long), the command to set the feature is the following:    nvme set-feature -f 6 -v 0 /dev/nvme0n1

The docs for `nvme` (nvme-cli package, if you&#39;re Ubuntu based) can be pieced together across some man pages:https://man.archlinux.org/man/nvme.1https://man.archlinux.org/man/nvme-set-feature.1.enIt&#39;s a bit hard to find all the NVMe features but 6 is the one for controlling write-back caching.https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/472211/list-feature..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very similar to A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling by M. J.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It is obvious that Swift has outgrown my influence, and some of the design premises I care about (e.g. &#34;simple things that compose&#34;)As someone who was heavily invested in Swift, and an active member of the community from around 2015-2019, I&#39;m a bit sad to see the direction the language is taking.From the time I started experimenting with Swift, I absolutely loved the philosophy of the language.  It seemed to really prioritize having a set of well-factored systems, each with their own very rationally designed interfaces, which could be composed to do really powerful things.  It was an incredibly expressive language which allowed for writing code with an incredible level of clarity - when writing Swift code I always felt I was writing at the level of the problem domain, not writing syntax.  At the same time it offered really nice features for ensuring safety and correctness, like ADT&#39;s and best-in-class nullability syntax.It was a language which sometimes seemed to move at a glacial pace, but the implicit tradeoff was that when a feature landed, it was for the most part very well thought out, and would add to the language with minimal negative impact.A few years ago that seemed to start to change.  From my perspective, some of the features added to the language to support SwiftUI - specifically property wrappers and function builders - very much felt rushed and forced into the language based on external deadlines.  And imo they have a largely negative impact on the language: it used to be the case that you could look at a piece of Swift code and roughly understand how it would compile to assembly pretty easily, but with these new features there&#39;s a ton of compiler magic going on behind the scenes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I clicked on this thread because I knew exactly what I wanted to comment about, and was surprised to see that Chris mentioned exactly it in his message:&gt;After several discussions generating more heat than light, when my formal proposal review comments and concerns were ignored by the unilateral accepts, and the general challenges with transparency working with core team, I decided that my effort was triggering the same friction with the same people, and thus I was just wasting my time.I stopped paying attention to Swift for this exact reason. I have actually submitted and implemented a feature in Swift and I think it was one of my most frustrating experiences with open-source projects. It seems that almost every thread in this forum devolves into people fighting over the most irrelevant details, and my proposal specifically took months to be submitted into review because a couple of users simply refused to back down from how they personally wanted it to work, ignoring the actual problem the feature aimed to solve. After a long time deflecting the comments, the feature was accepted the way I originally intended and I never entered the forum again.Example aside, it doesn&#39;t take a proposal to see that almost every thread in the forum looks like this. Open sourcing Swift has benefits, but I think when it comes to the actual progress of the project, this particular democratic process was a mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key takeaway for me was the note that it “definitely isn’t a community designed language”. This is telling, I’ve watched a lot of neat languages over the years and absolutely none of the ones without community involvement have grown beyond the sphere of influence of their primary companies.I like swift enough I’m learning it to build my own personal tech nerd ideal podcast client because I own apple devices and want an app that works between macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS,and watchOS. but I doubt I’ll ever use it for anything beyond this one personally motivated project. Even if i release it as an app on the store for download or purchase I don’t know if I will ever be motivated enough to build anything else using it. Because the scope is too narrow. Business work is converging on open stacks like react, and angular, and the dark horse of C# with its latest release supporting WASM web components backed by GRPC-web and a C# function driven stack from front to back, even without SQL Server costs this is a compelling ecosystem backed by PostgreSQL and other completely open source tools.But Swift remains Apple’s language for apple stuff and… while a profitable niche, it’s still a niche.Edit: typo fix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see this as high-IQ software developers building systems to shut out non-high-IQ people from society. Managers look at these CAPTCHAs and think &#34;oh I could solve these no problem, let&#39;s use them&#34;. In fact, they can only be solved by unusually smart people or by ML bots. Arkose Labs (the maker of this particular captcha) explicitly advertises that their methods can keep out &#34;low-skilled workers&#34; on &#34;human fraud farms&#34;. They keep out everyone else too if they&#39;re not that good at mental rotation and mental arithmetic or logic -- this dice puzzle and the mouse labyrinth puzzle are pretty much prototypical IQ test problems."</p>

There&#39;s some more links here: https://github.com/dessant/buster/issues/178 (Buster is a browser extension for automated captcha solving). You can subscribe here https://github.com/dessant/buster/issues/320Their audio captcha (no longer available?) involved listening to 3 MIDI tunes and picking &#34;the sad one&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Airbnb has been very human hostile since the beginning.The first time I had to create an account, they required that I connect with a google account with access to all my contacts. Then ask me to make a video of myself.I didn&#39;t create the account and booked an hotel.Now they are less aggressive with their new procedures, but still, you can see that the people behind it see technical solutions way before they perceive the human impact.My grand-father was like that. A brilliant engineer from the most elite school of his generation in France. He once told me very seriously a solution for making more accommodations for the poorest people would be to remove individual bathrooms, and create common ones for the whole building instead.Airbnb tech teams remind me of him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Validation on holdout sets.When I was a student in the 1990s, I was taught about hypothesis testing (and all the hassle of p-fishing etc.), and about Bayesian inference (which is lovely, until you have to invent priors over the model space -- e.g. a prior over neural network architectures). These are both systems that tie themselves in epistemological knots when trying to answer the simple question &#34;What model shall I use?&#34;Holdout set validation is such a clean simple idea, and so easy to use (as long as you have big data), and it does away with all the frequentist and Bayesian tangle, which is why it&#39;s so widespread in ML nowadays.It also aligns statistical inference with Popper&#39;s idea of scientific falsifiability -- scientists test their models against a new experimental data, data scientists can test their model against qualitatively different holdout sets. (Just make sure you don&#39;t get your holdout set by shuffling, since that&#39;s not what Popper would call a &#34;genuine risky validation&#34;.)The article mentions Breiman&#39;s &#34;alternative view of the foundations of statistics based on prediction rather than modeling&#34;. Breiman does make a big deal of evaluation on holdout sets; but his &#34;prediction&#34; idea isn&#39;t general enough, since it doesn&#39;t accommodate generative modelling (e.g. GPT, GANs). I think it&#39;s better to frame ML in terms of &#34;evaluating model fit on a holdout set&#34;, since that accommodates both predictive and generative modelling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Off-the-cuff, i.e. without digging deeply into a set of history of statistics books:Tied 1st place:• Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm• Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi algorithm for most probable sequence in linear time• Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory of statistical learning (Vladimir Naumovich Vapnik &amp; Alexey Chervonenkis) and SVMs4th place:• Edwin Jaynes: maximum entropy for constructing priors (borderline: 1957)Honorable mentions:• Breiman et al.&#39;s CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm (and Quinlan&#39;s C5.0 extension)• Box–Jenkins method (autoregressive moving average (ARMA) / autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to find the best fit of a time-series model to past values of a time series)(The beginning of the 20th century was much more fertile in comparison - Kolmogorov, Fisher, Gosset, Aitken, Cox, de Finetti, Kullback, the Pearsons, Spearman etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a side issue, but I wonder what changes could be made to the teaching of statistics, most importantly &#34;stats for scientists&#34; taught in college and even high school. What occurs to me right off the bat is that I learned stats by the use of formulas to boil data sets down to answers. For example, null hypothesis significance testing and the dreaded p-value. We had to do it this way, as widespread availability of computers was still on the horizon.Today, computation is easy and cheap. I wonder if we could learn stats in a different way, perhaps starting by just playing with data, and simulated random numbers, graphing, and so forth. Can something like null hypothesis testing be taught primarily through bootstrapping, with the formulas introduced as an aside?Yes I know that statistics is a formal branch of math, with theorems and proofs. I took that class. But the students who take &#34;stats for scientists&#34; don&#39;t ever see that side of it. Understanding the formulas without seeing the proofs is like trying to learn freshman physics without calculus."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the idea of nix but the inconsistency and developer experience is terrible.   I want to suggest people use it but there is too many rough edges currently.For example, if you want to install a package the old way, you&#39;ll install it including the channel:    nix-env -iA nixpkgs.ripgrep


but then if you want to remove one, you don&#39;t reference the channel:    nix-env -e ripgrep

You have a similar issue if you want to use the new `nix` command.  To install a package you&#39;ll do:    nix profile install nixpkgs#ripgrep


but running:    nix profile remove nixpkgs#ripgrep


will do nothing.  It won&#39;t say &#34;I didn&#39;t remove the package&#34; or &#34;package not found&#34;.  It just returns silently.    The only way to remove it is to point to the number from `nix profile history` or the actual path.It is unbearably slow:    &gt; time nix-env -qaP ripgrep
    nixpkgs.ripgrep  ripgrep-13.0.0

    11.17s user 2.70s system 73% cpu 18.970 total


Overall I love the idea but it has a long way to go in developer experience and quality before it is ready for any mainstream adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; Nix often scares newcomers and experienced devs alike, because it proposes a fairly radical overhaul to how we think about package management and how we run software in general.

I am not sure this is the main put-off of nix.Ideologically, I love nix. The syntax/language itself is a massive barrier IMO.I use Nix for personal projects, but I prefer the experience of Devcontainers. They&#39;re easier to understand and debug (for me).I&#39;m watching eagerly the work being done by the ostree/rpm-ostree folks who are also trying to solve for a similar problem. Hoping to see something like &#34;Nix but with YAML/JSON&#34; come out of that.https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/related-proje..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been running NixOS and uxing Nix for almost everything since I switched to it, and my experience has been great so far. It is one versatile solution to a lot of applications:1. I run NixOs on on laptop and workstation, for work and for personal use. Any change to the configuration can be immediately transfered to other machines. And give me a new machine, I can quickly bring it up with the configuration that I am always using.
2. I run NixOS on my home server and machine learning cluster. Deploy experiment and service on them is as simple as updating the git-managed configurations. Meanwhile, if I want to use more power to run an experiment, NixOps can quickly bring up a set of machines on AWS with the configuration identical to my local experiment. You do not need to worry about setting up CUDA/pytorch and other dependencies every.
3. In my start-up, it definitely took more time to train the developers to learn Nix, but once they get familiar, everyone becomes a good DevOps engineer, which solves development environemnt (that invloves C++/Python), CI/CD and release really well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great if it works for you, but for those who are dealing with babies, I wouldn&#39;t beat myself up if this advice doesn&#39;t apply. The parenting advice world is chock full of people who found something that worked for them and who then made the unwarranted conclusion that it is universal truth. For example, their techniques that &#34;always work&#34; definitely do not always work. Maybe they always worked for their particular babies, but I have been in situations with my kids where neither shushing and patting nor holding and walking worked to stop crying.My general feeling is that you can drive yourself nuts trying to figure out why your baby is crying, and, as the blog author mentioned in his conclusion, you may still be unable to figure it out. IMO this is a great time of one&#39;s life to discard the illusion of control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of kids I&#39;ve always thought &#34;maybe one day&#34;.  I can see how it&#39;d be a tough, but extremely rewarding and meaningful endeavor.But reading this article made me think for the first time &#34;actually, I think I don&#39;t want kids.&#34;So many &#34;mental CPU cycles&#34; spent learning about pregnancy, babies, why they cry, how to care for them.  It just doesn&#39;t appeal to me at all - I think it&#39;d resent it taking me away from spending time on the topics that legitimately interest me -   stuff like space, technology, fiction, stocks, politics, philosophy, hobbies.  (I realize how much this comes off as a young white tech nerd... But that&#39;s exactly what I am!)And all this just of the knowledge gathering.  We haven&#39;t even touched on the truly hard part - executing it!I guess this article made raising a kid real in a way that none other have before.  Took the high ideal of &#34;raising a family&#34; and shined light on all the tough, hard realities.Of course this is all from my current perspective.  I&#39;m sure it all totally changes in ways I just can&#39;t conceive when it&#39;s your own kid.Open to any insights from others who may have been here before!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Newly minted dad of twins and uncle for 5 others.Infant phaseThe work is intense when they are young since they can’t do much on their own and need help very often. But this doesn’t last for too long. Most parents exaggerate this phase since it is very intense from their otherwise happy days without kids. I had enough nephews and nieces around that I helped with so my kids are not the first time I am doing something this intense.Toddler phaseThey are very manageable because of their size. Not those helpless poor little things any more. But they need to be entertained. Having others kids help a lot here. One more reason to have more than one kids. Only kids can match kids energy level.Beyond infantsThis is when things get interesting they start engaging with you a lot with words and actions.Most of the problems with millennials for fear of having kids got to do with not having much experience before having their own. So they get overwhelmed, this is very specific to societies with lack of communities (western urban societies).Once your friends have kids they are out of your circle since they cannot come out and do as much as they used to do.With medical advancements and tools available to raise a child it is lot easier to raise kids than before. Over focusing on parenthood is also another issue. This is product of abundance of time and money. My mom of 3 children didn’t have tools and time to engage with us like our generation do. She did exceptionally well without over indulging in the name of parenthood.Note: I am leaning game development and reading books while having full time job and having twins as my first children on my own at 40.It’s totally doable. Try being around your friends with kids, that’s helpful for them as well as you.Most rewarding thing and easily attainable for most of us is to raise children never forget the entertainment and stress buster aspect of having kids as well.Once a wise women from the east said to us raised in the west: If you can have pets I don’t seem to understand your issues having kids.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like we have so much leverage and don&#39;t use it at all.We&#39;re still attending stand-ups every day with non programmers telling us when we can and cannot refactor. It&#39;s nuts to me that a skilled profession - that not many can do - lets themselves get micro-managed like this.If anyone has read Developer Hegemony, I&#39;m fully on board with that general premise - we start operating like lawyers with partnerships, and turn bosses into customers. Though that does require us to think of ourselves as professionals not nerds who are too smart for business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it ends with everyone becoming a developer.Making machines do things will never end. However, the tools for making machines do things is evolving very quickly.The general art of being a developer will continue to get specialized and at some point specialists at any field would be expected to be able to program their machines.Very few people are learning how to run their servers and much more are moving into AWS type of infrastructure and “cloud literacy” has become a thing.I would expect layers of abstraction to continue to build up and programming to become something like using spreadsheets to do your actual task.Eventually, “true programming” will scale back to building these tools. It would be rather niche, very high skill serious engineering - an elite, hard to get in profession that continues to fetch high salaries. They probably will have some kind of association similar to the lawyers/doctors, the code they write will no longer tolerate bugs as a fact of life but they will be responsible as any other licensed professionals. Skipping unit test will land you in jail or very high fine due to malpractice if something goes wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Programmers are increasingly needed for *everything*.I mean, we&#39;ve entered an age, where a farmer can&#39;t milk their cows, if the software of the milking robot has a hitch - can&#39;t plow their fields, when the gps-software that drives the tractor isn&#39;t working.Apart from that, programming is becoming every other job - as far as domain knowledge is concerned.I&#39;ve personally experienced (multiple times!) professional accounting companies complaining about not being able to just modify official invoices (totally illegal) but having to cancel and re-issue them with a new invoice number (how it MUST be done).
-&gt; It&#39;s now the responsibility of the programmers to understand how accounting works. Professional accountants just click a button and expect the software to &#34;do the right thing&#34;.
-&gt; As in this case, the professional accountant no longer adds much value, they&#39;ll probably be entirely replaced by software at some point.A more relatable example might be Taxis drivers. It might take years still, but at some point, all Taxis will be self-driving vehicles, created by robots in a fully automated factory. Programmers will be needed for the driving software and the factory software. You might still need some mechanics to repair the factory robots - until when that job is done by robots as well (that have to be programmed).It currently seems more likely to me, that we are headed towards a future, where programming is the *only* job - and everything else is done by software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting quick dive into how some of the artifacts of historical implementations can carry forward decades later. I&#39;m saving this one. While everyone on HN is probably familiar with a pile of examples of this in our own work particularly if you do anything lower level, this is a nice example because it&#39;s really easy to grasp even for total non-programmers and gives a feel for the layers upon layers the digital world is built on. Details on the x86-64 bootstrap sequence are interesting to tech people but this is the sort of thing I might show in a school class.That said at first I thought the author was being a bit tongue in cheek on the suggestion to fix it with:&gt;A downside to making any changes is that the badly formatted GIFs won&#39;t render any more. I reckon just be bold, like the release of Netscape 2.0...If Netscape was fine with breaking poorly-made GIFs, we should be too!But we kind of have a bit more content now then when Netscape 2 was released, and it seems they&#39;re serious?  Support more than 256 colours in a single frame of GIF animation
  Support fast GIFs (10ms delay)
  No confusing behaviour with small delay = slow GIF
  Better compression for GIFs with multiple small areas updated per frame

But frankly at this point why? We&#39;ve got good universally adapted image formats that do more than 256 colors. We&#39;ve got webm and so on (even Apple caved on that one in the end) for baked animation which is much smaller and more powerful than gif, and plenty of CPU and libraries for generation on the fly. We&#39;ve got powerful ways to do animation purely with HTML/CSS/SVG/JS. GIF is a historical artifact with a lot of its value at this point purely about old things. This wouldn&#39;t even retroactively bring newer capabilities to older systems because it would require updated code which by definition means the ability to run new browsers and thus modern capabilities.I get they really enjoy hacking on gif but come on. Only way I can see it working is if all the players agreed on some metadata that could be added to gifs which wanted &#39;standards&#39; vs &#39;historical&#39; playback with the default remaining historical, and potentially also make it a browser setting. That&#39;d still leave the ad issue, but maybe at this point that&#39;s moot given the advancements in blockers (and it&#39;d be a very easy thing to look for as an indication of an ad, and thus be selected against)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the ”Internet Explorer 5 is closed source, but could hypothetically look something like this” bit.Is this source code available through MS partnership programs or an old leak?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rate limiting or clamping &#34;0&#34; delays upwards can also help for polling applications where you want to be as fast as possible, but you&#39;re never going to be actually zero. For example if you have a thread that&#39;s pulling images from a camera (publishing at 30 fps) in a loop, you can delay for 1ms between polls and nobody is going to know, but that can have an enormous impact on CPU usage; especially on embedded platforms. Instead of running at 100% thread usage (calling camera.read() and waiting for it to return true), the spin/loop cost is basically free and you only need to worry about the cost of acquiring/decoding the frame. In theory branch prediction should help because you&#39;ll take the &#34;no image yet&#34; branch 99% of the time, but in practice that just makes the loop iterate faster. I learned this the hard way writing a custom camera publisher in ROS, but I&#39;ve seen it a lot in tutorial code and I think a lot of beginners make that mistake."</p>

The first turn that&#39;s &#34;up&#34; or &#34;down,&#34; can be defined as &#34;up.&#34; That leaves two ways to read any shape, but that&#39;s an uhh constant-factor overhead. :)(I can&#39;t think of a way to define a normal form reading direction that wouldn&#39;t involve potentially reading an arbitrary distance in before having to re-start the other way.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this would be more enjoyable if the shapes were more different morphologically, and fewer (ideally no) close pairs which differ only in the length of a segment by a single block.After the first couple of wrong guesses (though I&#39;m pretty sure one guess was correct - could be the bug https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30408567) I started to count segment lengths rather than relying on mental shape rotation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As careful as some of the things he suggests are...if you&#39;re truly wanted by a state-level actor or sufficiently motivated attacker, you won&#39;t be able to hide by simply using VPN and Tor. Especially if you&#39;re running something with many transactions like AlphaBay. You would need to obfuscate quite a bit more:- if you&#39;re using VPN traffic but most people &#34;around&#34; you aren&#39;t, you&#39;re a suspicious node; your ISP could easily flag you to your government. If you use wifi at a common point you&#39;re likely to be flagged and there isn&#39;t an easy way other than keeping on the move. But moving often is another anomalous event, and it&#39;s very difficult to do even for Drug Lords ( El Chapo ) or Terrorists that it behooves to do. This puts you in a sort of Zugzwang, to borrow a chess term.- there&#39;s always leakage, for instance, in the way you talk with people in the real world. At some point you send enough communication for sophisticated frequency analysis.- and there are other patterns of usage that could be used to identify you, like searches or even keyboard frequency on anonymized accounts can be de-anonymized by very specific markers ( ML works! ).- off ramps for crypto aren&#39;t very good. If you&#39;re in e.g. Brazil, haha, yeah, good luck spending bitcoin or any other crypto and going unnoticed. Mixers and tumblers will eventually leak and you&#39;ll be caught.- you&#39;re very vulnerable to social engineering by people you do business with. one slip where you stop communicating in a transactional mode of communication and that&#39;s a weak link in your armor.In the end, the FBI only has to be right once, and you have to be right every time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Or you can just be a known drug lord, launder billions of USD through a respected  international bank, no one goes to jail, small fine, and they&#39;re probably still laundering 10 years later and no one cares. No one is anonymous. They&#39;re probably all using SMS and corporate email.Sell a little bit of drugs through the silk road and you&#39;ll get royally f-ed! Sell all the opioids in the world through a public pharma corp and you can keep enjoying your jet-set life and yacht.The allegedly smartest people in the world are focusing on the dumbest problems while being reamed by the frat-boys that went to Wall Street and Politics, guns and drugs.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s good advice. The problem with anonymity in an environment of ubiquitous surveillance is that it&#39;s paradoxical. The point of anonymity is achieving freedom, but staying anonymous expends energy and makes you a target, so you can&#39;t actually do any things that anonymity was supposed to get you.If what you really want is sovereignty, which is what most people confuse anonymity with,  the goal is to be like what Ernst Jünger called the anarch (in contrast to the anarchist), which is someone who complies and renders herself indifferent to authority, rather than standing out and drawing attention.A much better practice is to be as open as possible about the boring stuff, so you&#39;re not constrained and can do what everyone else does. Trying to be absolutist about anonymity is automatically like wearing a straitjacket."</p>

This is what led me to introduce new static network filter options:- strict1p, strict3p [1]- header=, experimental, disabled by default [2]I used Simo Ahava&#39;s blog as test case, and with these new options, I could craft a filter to block the Google Tag Manager script on Simo Ahava&#39;s blog. However due to the lack of more test cases, no more progress has been made about this since then.Things that stood out to me when reading about all this:Simo Ahava&#39;s refers to the CNAME approach as &#34;vulnerable&#34;[3]:&gt; This way you’ll be instructed to use A/AAAA DNS records rather than the vulnerable CNAME alias&#34;Vulnerable&#34; to what? To uncloaking as I understand it, and by extension, &#34;vulnerable&#34; to users taking steps to protect their privacy.Whether the very experimental solution in uBO ends up working or not, this case shows very well how Google Chrome&#39;s Manifest Version 3 (MV3) put a lid on innovation content-blocking wise: All the new filter options introduced above can&#39;t be implemented with declarativeNetRequest.===[0] https://www.pixeldetracking.com/fr/google-tag-manager-server...[1] https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#...[2] https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#...[3] https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/server-side-tagging-goog..."</p>

When you’re trying to scale from 0 to 1 user then everything should help you explore the user’s problem space, even if it seems backwards to build the UI before the backend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That shouldn&#39;t be a surprise. At an old job with far smaller user base, we used to do something very similar and while the shadow profiles were not materialized in the form of actual profiles, the amount of data you can gather about someone just by having his/her number pop up in the contact list of several of your actual users is staggering: full name, workplace, city/neighborhood where they live, their partners, their hobbies and all sorts of things which you generally should not know. And we are not talking people who have their entire life published online, but people with little to no online visibility. Assuming that facebook is not doing something similar considering that their main business comes from profiling and modeling user behavior is just naive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook also has shadow profiles for non-users that connect directly to name, email address, and/or phone number.  At the very least these seem to be populated when people share their contact list with Facebook.I have long wondered whether they can match these two kinds of shadow profiles together. One profile with personally identifiable information. The other profile with detailed browsing history. That would raise a huge privacy concern especially since these are non-Facebook users and therefore people who have not opted into this at any level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A link that is shared on facebook gets an additional fbclid query parameter (interesting that google has it&#39;s equivalent glclid query parameter for links from google adds).I think that it is easy to get rid of this query parameter, when want to use such a link. (just adding, as I don&#39;t see that mentioned in the pdf)I think that the purpose of this query param is to act as a substitute for cross site cookies: when you click on some link then the original url is further transfered as the http referrer header of the http request, if they can get hold of the logs of some affiliated site, then they can possibly track the flow of these fbclid attributes.Interesting to observe, how every tiny detail is getting used for tracking purposes. I guess that browsers won&#39;t get rid of any specific query parameters when the url is passed as the referrer header, as that would be a violation of the protocol. However it may be possible to write a browser plug-in that does so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love little compression hacks like the one given in the article.I created a word search game way back in late 1978/early 1979 4KB of RAM. I had about 2KB for storing the word database. And I recall I had about 2,500 words. Which I had to type in by hand.I used the 26 tables of words trick too, to drop the first letter. I also treated each word being made up of 32 symbols. I called them letters, but they didn&#39;t represent individual letters necessarily.Edit 36 minutes after writing my original comment: Having just checked my notes from December 24th 1978, I need to correct myself and say it was 38 symbols. Though I seem to recall I actually got it down to 32 symbols. I need to keep looking through my notes to refresh my brain on the solution.A word might end in &#34;ING&#34; so that was considered a single letter/symbol. Words were between four and seven letters long.Most words took up two bytes, some only took up a single byte, only a few took up three bytes, maybe a few dozen took up four bytes. And I judiciously pruned the database to minimize the words that took up three or four bytes so that I didn&#39;t have too many of them. I also packed the bits, so that there was no gaps between words.And it was all written in 6502 assembly, originally for the CBM PET, and later for the Acorn Atom.I was 11 years old and so proud of myself for such cleverness. I still have my notes and scribblings, including the digitised versions from all those years back.Later, when I wrote a much more complex Bookworm type of game I had to take a word list that was about 8MB long, uncompressed, which would just barely fit on the hard drive, and turned it into a trie, which brought it down to just a few dozen kilobytes, which handily fit on a SS/SD 100KB 5+1/4&#34; floppy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got nerd sniped and compressed it to under 28K, which was good enough for the goal of fitting it in a 32K NROM cartridge for the NES. On the NES, you don’t need to do better than that, because you get a separate 8K for graphics, and 4K is plenty of space to fit the code for your Wordle clone.https://www.moria.us/blog/2022/01/dictionary-compressionThe annoying part is that the NES only gives you four background palettes, and you are constrained to use all four of those to color your words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And far better than gzip compression. Nice work. My takeaway is that context matters - this is not General Purpose Compression, but compression made specifically for this case. Good Stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, I used to,but No, I fixed it :)Among other things, I am team lead for a private search engine whose partner-accessible API handles roughly 500 mio requests per month.I used to feel powerless and stressed out by the complexity and the scale, because whenever stuff broke (and it always does at this scale), I had to start playing politics, asking for favors, or threatening people on the phone to get it fixed. Higher management would hold me accountable for the downtime even when the whole S3 AZ was offline and there was clearly nothing I could do except for hoping that we&#39;ll somehow reach one of their support engineers.But over time, management&#39;s &#34;stand on the shoulders of giants&#34; brainwashing wore off so that they actually started to read all the &#34;AWS outage XY&#34; information that we forwarded to them. They started to actually believe us when we said &#34;Nothing we can do, call Amazon!&#34;. And then, I found a struggling hosting company with almost compatible tooling and we purchased them. And I moved all of our systems off the public cloud and onto our private cloud hosting service.Nowadays, people still hold me (at least emotionally) accountable for any issue or downtime, but I feel much better about it :) Because now it actually is withing my circle of power. I have root on all relevant servers, so if shit hits the fan, I can fix things or delegate to my team.Your situation sounds like you will constantly take the blame for other people&#39;s fault. I would imagine that to be disheartening and extremely exhausting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What do you find exhausting?One anti-pattern I&#39;ve found is that most orgs ask a single team to handle on-call around the clock for their service. This rarely scales well, from a human standpoint. If you&#39;re getting paged at 2:00 in the morning on a regular basis you will start to resent it. There&#39;s not much you can do about that so long as only one team is responsible for uptime 24/7.The solution is to hire operations teams globally, and then setup follow-the-sun operations whereby the people being paged are always naturally awake at that hour, and allows them to work normal eight hour shifts. But this requires companies to, gasp, have specialized developers and specialized operators collaborate before allowing new feature work into production, to ensure that the operations teams understand what the services are supposed to do and keep it all online. It requires (oh, the horror!) actually maintaining production standards, runbooks, and other documentation.So naturally, many orgs would prefer to burn out their engineers instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience is that the expectations on what your average engineer should be able to handle has grown enormously during the last 10 years or so.
Working both with large distributed systems and medium size monolithic systems I have seen the expectations become a lot higher in both.When I started my career the engineers at our company were assigned a very specific part of the product that they were experts on. Usually there were 1 or 2 engineers assigned to a specific area and they knew it really well.
Then we went Agile(tm) and the engineers were grouped into 6 to 9 person teams that were assigned features that spanned several areas of the product. The teams also got involved in customer interaction, planning, testing and documentation. The days when you could focus on a single part of the system and become really good at it were gone.Next big change came when the teams moved from being feature teams to devops teams. None of the previous responsibilities were removed but we now became responsible also for setting up and running the (cloud) infrastructure and deploying our own software.In some ways I agree that these changes have empowered us. But it is also, as you say, exhausting. Once I was simply a programmer; now I&#39;m a domain expert, project manager, programmer, tester, technical writer, database admin, operations engineer, and so on."</p>

She is brilliant but not technical and while the backups would have been expensive and difficult due to size, I should have built multiple NAS and distributed them geographically and used Syncthing to keep them updated.To be clear we were legacy G-suite users and have converted to paying customers, so it was a free service while this happened, and is a paid service (I guess is youtube part of that?) now.I just assumed if there was a problem we could youtube-dl everything, it didn&#39;t occur to me that control of the account would be suspended arbitrarily with no recourse for literally no reason. Despite reading about similar things here for years.I guess I just thought those were lightning strikes, and I was focusing my time outside of work on the new SPA rollout we were working on for the company. I understand excuses like armpits are something we all have and they all smell, so I&#39;ll just say I fucked up and own it.I appreciate all the advice and I understand why you are all saying what you are saying.This was spur of the moment post (I didn&#39;t think it through) and I hadn&#39;t updated my contact information on my profile.

At some point, fair credit reporting didn&#39;t exist and we decided to create that to regulate a different industry.Is there a real and lasting solution to this problem that the firm hand of democracy can address?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Open core&#34;, seems to mean the low level libs (useful for sure) are FOSS while the full featured apps are proprietary.  This is kind of unpleasant since it creates a tension between a natural desire to build featureful apps with the low level stuff, and not wanting to &#34;bite the hand&#34; that supplied grist-core.  Similar things happen with other partly-proprietary programs like ansible.Aren&#39;t there already some FOSS alternatives to google sheets?  No idea about airtable, don&#39;t even know what it is.As for simple ways to write a form app, ActiveAdmin is one of the few things I like about Rails."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of commentators are missing the point. Caselaw is what lawyers rely on to determine what the law is. For years, there was a monopoly, the privately-held West Corporation in Minnesota. In the 1970s, the field became a duopoly, with the advent of Lexis. West eventually sold out to Thompson, the company is now Thompson-West. Computer-assisted legal research was extremely expensive. The Air Force set up FLITE, but efforts to access their database of cases failed. Manual research is effective, but paper publication meant you ran the risk of not knowing yesterday&#39;s results. In the 90&#39;s with the advent of the Internet, a lot of new players moved into the scene; some more successful than the others.  Public-interest organizations sued for access to the cases, which, after all, were all in the public domain. There was a Washington-based group that called the caselaw the &#34;Crown Jewels&#34; of this effort--though EDGAR filings probably have more significance for the public. Time has provided a solution; access to anything older than the most recent 400 volumes of the Federal Reporter is really not needed, as any Thompson-West salesman will tell you. But these efforts to open caselaw to the public is not scammy and has nothing to do with shaming. In the United States, these cases state the law which governs our lives. I&#39;m glad they&#39;ve succeeded in the effort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had some criminal charges expunged, and I notice they show up here.  Is there any way to request removal of court records which are no longer publicly available from the originating court?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat. I&#39;ll add this to my sources on case law -- another one I&#39;ve come across is https://case.law/Per my close friend, the value of these (or, why people subscribe to LexisNexis) isn&#39;t solely the texts, but the cross referencing. It would be really cool to see that get implemented (and no doubt a non-trivial problem!).How do you source your case inputs, as it is bigger than PACER?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, this scratches a lot of my itches about Git. I teach a Git course at my alma mater, and the things that confuses people the most (the index, how to undo mistakes etc etc) all seem addressed head-on. At first glance, this seems substantially easier to teach than Git.The Git compat seems like a great idea for this to really take off. My team is totally PR based though so if/when doing (Git compatible) feature branches lands in JJ I&#39;m excited to switch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting ideas! I especially like the automatic rebasing and associated ideas.It&#39;s a bit strange to see &#34;jj st&#34; will automatically add all files to the &#34;working copy&#34; commit. This means that when I initially create my project, run &#34;npm install&#34; to install 500 MB of dependencies, and then run &#34;jj st&#34; to figure out what to include in my first commit, the command is going to copy all of that into a commit object for no reason. I don&#39;t think I like that behavior, to be honest. Is this a requirement of any of the other unique features? Could this be turned off, or modified to be an explicit operation?[append]To be clear, the fact that it&#39;s `jj st` is actually a big part of the problem for me: this is the command I use to figure out what to put into my `.gitignore` in the first place! I don&#39;t think that any of the &#34;read-only&#34; commands should be making these kind of changes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34; It also means that you can always check out a different commit without first explicitly committing the working copy changes (you can even check out a different commit while resolving merge conflicts).&#34;That&#39;s really interesting. Having to manage stashes is annoying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Using Windows with a Microsoft account introduces all sorts of issues that only power users tend to come across, and power users are who Windows Pro is targeted for.For example, RDP&#39;ing to a Windows Pro computer with a Microsoft account becomes a lot more difficult. Another example is that Windows still needs a local username and password, even if you&#39;ve logged in with a Microsoft account, and this can get out of sync if you change your Microsoft account password online, meaning you now have a different local password to your online account.It&#39;s a frustration that power users don&#39;t need and this is probably going to force me to relegate Windows to a VM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Never again windows with Microsoft accounts. I have two windows 10 licenses, one home and one pro.

The Microsoft support site is a complete joke of unpaid chatterers that send you on wild goose chase, the web is full of SEO bullshit site that keyword-dance around the issue...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Windows 7/8 are the last good versions of Windows IMHO. Yeah they have security issues, but I run them in a virtual machine not connected to the Internet where I need things like iTunes and MS Office. Some games don&#39;t run in a VM very well because of the overhead and abstraction (unless they&#39;re lightweight or not resource intensive). I have a separate Alienware laptop for gaming on Windows however.My hypervisor OS is a Linux Mint install, with Virtualbox. I use Mint as a daily driver. I also use Cloudready[0] for interacting with the Google ecosystem. I can&#39;t recommend Cloudready enough, although I think Google bought out[1] Cloudready and it&#39;s now called Flex[2][0] https://www.neverware.com/freedownload[1] https://cloudreadykb.neverware.com/s/article/Neverware-is-no...[2] https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/products/chromebooks/chro..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that it sold the DNA to third parties.  The government &#39;data watchdog&#39; appears to be stepping in to stop this overt failure.Of course, all the testing agencies are collecting DNA.  The records will be somewhere.Do we think that government agencies will be able to access these?  Will the NHS?  Will government access even be stated in the agreements that they signed to be &#39;government-approved&#39;?  Will the data be available to other companies down the line for research?  Or when they are bought up by a big corporation?The point is that this is another erosion of privacy, another cat is out of the bag.  It is all very foreseeable.Once we sanction the collection of private information, eg DNA for health! to prevent child abuse! to stop terrorism! the over-reach is never withdrawn.  Government access to your dna, online record, etc, etc - becomes the new normal.  All while the actions of the government are ever more hidden - eg secret courts, collection of data, etcIn every instance of privacy erosion, a plausibly valid excuse is supplied by the government.  But it is a one-way street.  Why we continuously accept government justifications of excessive over-reach amazes me.  But that we do in general (I don&#39;t!) destroys privacy for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can&#39;t ask for (nor give) a consent that broad: &#34;use my dna for whatever research you want by whoever&#34;. Having been involved a bit with asking for informed consent in a hospital, it&#39;s sooo difficult to design a specific- and useful-enough consent form for legitimate not-for-profit medical research.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t discussed much, but I think homes would become noticeably more affordable for families just by having the government stop subsidizing the mortgages of investment properties (e.g. only one mortgage subsidy is available for each family). This isn&#39;t even getting into tax write offs which are too complicated for me to understand the consequences of changing.As it stands, mortgage rates being below the rate of inflation make housing a very attractive investment.The sources of mortgage subsidy that I am aware of are secondary market purchases:  * Federal reserve mortgage purchases
  * Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac mortgage purchases

A big portion of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve is buying billions of mortgages every month. The Fed is trying to start unwinding this now, but they have had trillions of mortgages on their books since the GFC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Housing will never be relatively cheap until it’s easier to build a house. It will never be easier to build a house until zoning is more lenient.No state is incentivized to make zoning more lenient. Therefore it falls on the federal government, who lack the authority.The only thing they can do is something similar to what they do with the highways and threaten to take away funds unless all plots of land can be zoned for up to 4-family houses (FHA limit).Potentially quadrupling the amount of housing will do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re in the housing hunt right now and we&#39;re losing to all-cash offers and ridiculous terms (like months of rent-free to the previous occupany: those sort of terms don&#39;t come from someone looking for a new place to live). We even lost on two offers where we were the high bid. We have pre-approval, solid financing and were willing to even waive the appraisal. It&#39;s not enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hmmm... I&#39;m skeptical.  Not necessarily because I don&#39;t think that pneumonia could be detected by testing VOCs in breath, but because I&#39;m currently working on a project that uses sensors to do breath analysis and my amateur research has informed me that it&#39;s fairly hard to get right (which is why my primary goal is to identify deltas rather than achieve numerical accuracy).For one, VOCs can be present in breath for other reasons besides some sort of infection in the lung, and VOCs are incredibly hard to differentiate with just a sensor.  The fact that they tend to be faint in human breath even at their highest (in contrast to O2 and CO2) doesn&#39;t help.  Even the most expensive PID sensors for VOCs (they get up into the several hundreds a pop) can&#39;t really tell you whether the predominant gas is acetone or alcohol or acetaldehyde or hydrogen sulfide.  So you&#39;ve got to figure out whether the presence of VOCs is truly an anomaly and not just a part of ketosis.  In which case you will also need to measure at least VeO2 to see whether the VOCs correspond with the Respiratory Quotient.The &#34;e-nose&#34; project, as described on the MakeZine article, doesn&#39;t appear to do that.  It does have an alcohol sensor.  But these sensors aren&#39;t particularly sophisticated.  They use semiconductors with heating elements to detect the presence of gases, and there is almost certainly some overlap between the alcohol and VOCs sensors.If VOCs are produced by pneumonia, then yes, it&#39;s conceivable that even just the VOCs sensor alone would detect this.  But can this group of sensors used in the e-nose differentiate pneumonia from catabolism?Maybe? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯After all, this thing uses AI.  And maybe AI can recognize something that a human can&#39;t by simply looking at a line graph.  I dunno...  Such things should be tested against known inputs before being suggested to diagnose anything."</p>

Obviously, this kid is very bright, but giving kids the tools to understand how the ideas they&#39;re learning can be applied in the real world is so satisfying. They aren&#39;t blinded by previous failures, or the current market, or what can and can&#39;t be done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anybody have a link to what the kid actually did?  I skimmed the video, looked at the diagram, read the original MAKE article, and it seems like the kid did a science project and it doesn&#39;t actually diagnose pneumonia.  Am I missing something important?The reason I&#39;m asking is that I see a lot of these (used to judge science fairs, worked with smart undergraduates who build their own equipment) but most of it overstates the technical advances made by the kid."</p>

It’s where I:* first learned about CRDTs, kickstarting an interest in distributed systems* first learned about TLA+, kickstarting an interest in formal specification* first saw the book Quantum Computing Since Democritus recommended (in a post about Professor Sussman’s reading list), kickstarting an interest in quantum computing* first learned about the LEAN theorem prover, kickstarting an interest in machine-checked proofs of correctness for mathematical theorems* first learned about tree-sitter, leading me to write a tree-sitter grammar for TLA+All of these (well, except quantum computing really - that remains a pleasant side-hobby although I did work in Microsoft’s quantum program for a bit) are now things I use in the contracts I work on as an independent software engineering consultant, and the open source work I do in between. TLA+ especially has had an enormous impact. Five good posts over the course of ten years is still a pretty good signal/noise ratio!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “You can’t exercise your way out of obesity,” […] “you can’t outrun a bad diet.”While this article is being a bit dramatic and possibly understating the impact of exercise slightly, I feel a little dumb that I didn’t know this earlier. It took me several decades too long to understand the obvious, that exercise is for building strength, and losing weight happens by eating less. I tried for way too many years to exercise my fat off, and it never really worked because I’d unconsciously eat to compensate. Once I tracked what I ate, exercise actually became more effective.A lot of people know this already, so it’s not busting everyone’s myths, but we also do have a strange narrative surrounding exercise and weight loss that I bought into. It makes me wonder if we’re physiologically wired to be allergic to the idea of less food, from an evolutionary perspective, because being hungry is literally risking death to our alligator brains."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The conclusion is almost certainly wrong:1. From a simple sniff test, if this were true, then athletes wouldn&#39;t need a lot of calories. This obviously isn&#39;t true, eg Phelps eats 8-11K calories a day. I personally eat around 3.5K calories a day. If exercise didn&#39;t impact caloric burn I assure you I&#39;d be a lot fatter...2. The only plausible mechanisms for why exercise wouldn&#39;t result in more overall caloric burn is that less energy is expended in non exercising states, eg the body is trying to conserve energy and either reduces metabolism or reduces fidgeting, walking, etc. This often happens to people trying extreme calorie loss diets.The implication of this is that somehow the sedentary lifestyle of your average couch potato is the &#34;normal&#34; lifestyle for a body, and the lifestyle of a hunter gatherer is &#34;overactive&#34;, and their bodies are chronically tired and trying to reduce their metabolisms. That... seems quite unlikely.3. Finally, this blog post dives into some methodological issues: https://darrendahly.github.io/post/2012-08-31-hunter-gathere...EDIT: Increased metabolism due to muscle mass is not as big an effect as you’d think: https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/metabolismcon..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The underlying case looks to be a pretty straight developing country &#34;referral fees&#34; / kickback type case.One issue is how long these cases take to resolve. This was a whistleblower blowing the whistle.Basic deal was Watson (who ran Northstar) a property developer signed a deal to kick back referral fees to an entity that did literally no work (Villanova Trust) created by a brother of the two amazon employees (Nelson and Kirschner) who were the transaction managers for 9 data center lease deals. The kickback deal was signed after these two Amazon employees met with Watson (the Vendor).Amazon then did $400M in deals with Watson, who then kicked back $5M to the trust in &#34;commissions&#34;. Then amazon discovered deleted files indicating the employees were entitled to &#34;shares&#34; in these projects from Watson of something like an additional $16M.Others in the mix at developer also did some kind of land flip thing. One example was property that they bought for $20M, then sold to Amazon for $116M. In one case there was something like a $20M increase in price on property that was sold to Amazon the day that it was bought?! So they were frontrunning things. Watson was pissed, and wanted a cut, so recorded a meeting with the folks doing the flip scam. But that backfired because the folks doing the flip scam knew about the leasing scam and said, hey, if you don&#39;t back off we&#39;ll blow lid on your lease scam - claiming &#34;that&#39;s FBI&#34;. They did end up compromising on kicking back $5M to Watson from the flip scam.Anyways, all allegations, and thousands of pages so I&#39;ve no doubt got some parts wrong, but it makes for interesting reading!My question - it seems to take a long time to get these white color criminal types into jail.In the linked post, there is a lot of complaining that the FBI messed up the guys career, but man, this court case - why would you hire a guy like this into a position of trust?Note these allegations are contested. “My only hope in defending myself against its false allegations is that the process will be fair and impartial.” Mr. Nelson said per a WSJ article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a weird story. I have limited, tangential experience with getting the FBI involved with crimes of an employee. In our case, they were not in a rush to make any moves against the person until they had an airtight case with indisputable evidence. Honestly felt strange given how obvious the crime was during the investigation.Although in this case the seized funds were apparently returned. I have a feeling a lot of crucial details have been left out of this piece (EDIT: See links below to the investigation details. There are multiple parties involved and some of they were keenly aware that they were breaking laws that were &#34;FBI-type stuff&#34;). The devil’s advocate take on this outcome would be that the person cooperated with the FBI to provide evidence and/or testify against bigger fish in the case in exchange for being let off the hook. If this was the case, we’d probably see some headlines about an Amazon-related criminal charges in the coming months or years. Although in our case the released documents were full of “Company 1” and “Individual 2” anonymity, so someone (usually a journalist) would have to figure out the connection.Or maybe this really was some big misunderstanding with disastrous consequences to the family. Impossible to know from an article from this perspective.EDIT: There&#39;s a more in-depth review of the case here: https://www.geekwire.com/2021/former-aws-real-estate-manager...From the summary, it does appear that multiple people are involved in the case and the person in this article (Nelson) doesn&#39;t look like the key player in the alleged frauds, though he would have played a significant role in facilitating the accusations. There&#39;s definitely some shady business going on, but this guy could have been more of a pawn than active player.One of the text messages from transcripts is notable (Note &#34;Nelson&#34; is the accused person in the Medium article):&gt; “Flip me a couple buildings … and let me really line your pockets like we were discussing!  ” Ramstetter wrote in a Dec. 17, 2018 message to Nelson, according to a copy of the exchange Amazon filed with the court.The transcript in that article is also enlightening, because it&#39;s literally a conversation between two of the partners who acknowledge that what they&#39;re doing is &#34;federal, FBI-type stuff&#34; and express concern over it. If you ever get a message like that from someone proposing to &#34;line your pockets&#34; in exchange for facilitating deals with your employer, maybe don&#39;t work with that person any more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Terrible story. Civil forfeiture seems utterly incompatible with any notion of a just society. It&#39;s like democracy just gave up and regressed to feudalism.Even _if_ the author had turned out to be 100% guilty of whatever Amazon accused them of - this form of civil forfeiture is still punishment without trial and not in line with the sixth amendment.In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"sigh. My team is facing all these issues. Drowning in data. Crazy S3 bill spikes. And not just S3 - Azure, GCP, Alibaba, etc since we are a multi-cloud product.Earlier, we couldn&#39;t even figure out lifecycle policies to expire objects since naturally every PM had a different opinion on the data lifecycle. So it was old-fashioned cleanup jobs that were scheduled and triggered when a byzantine set of conditions were met. Sometimes they were never met - cue bill spike.Thankfully, all the new data privacy &amp; protection regulations are a life-saver. Now, we can blindly delete all associated data when a customer off-boards or trial expires or when data is no longer used for original purpose. Just tell the intransigent PM&#39;s that we are strictly following govt regulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have caused billing spikes like this before those little warnings were invented and it was always a dark day.  They are really a life saver.Lifecycle rules are also welcome.  Writing them yourself was always a pain and tended to be expensive with list operations eating up that api calls bill.----Once I supported an app that dumped small objects into s3 and begged the dev team to store the small objects in oracle as BLOBS to be concatenated into normal-sized s3 bjects after a reasonable timeout where no new small objects would reasonably be created.  They refused (of course) and the bills for managing a bucket with millions and millions of tiny objects were just what you expect.I then went for a compromise solution asking if we could stitch the small objects together after a period of time so they would be eligible for things like infrequent access or glacier but, alas, &#34;dev time is expensive you know&#34; so N figure s3 bills continue as far as I know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The AWS horror stories never cease to amaze me. It&#39;s like we&#39;re banging our heads against the wall expecting a different outcome each time. What&#39;s more frustrating, the AWS zealots are quite happy to tell you how you&#39;re doing it wrong. It&#39;s the users fault for misusing the service. The reality is, AWS was built for a specific purpose and demographic of user. It&#39;s now complexity and scale makes it unusable for newer devs. I&#39;d argue, we need a completely new experience for the next generation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple of years ago, I was attacked by a Kiwi bot near a UC campus. This is my story.The bot and I were moving towards each other on a sidewalk, and when I came close it stopped, as they do when sensing an object in front of them. But there was an awkward moment as I tried to go around it and it repeatedly jerked forward an inch as its motor kicked on and off. Maybe I was walking around the very edge of its radius. In any case, my behavior must have triggered some pathfinding bug, because it turned and drove right into my legs, after which it stopped and sat stationary. Luckily they&#39;re small and move slowly so it wasn&#39;t a big deal, but that memory stuck with me. Articles about Tesla pathfinding issues always bring it back to the surface."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We were walking past one of these robots whose wheel got stuck halfway off the curb, so it was completely stuck. My friend helped it back up, and it had a prerecorded voice say “thank you for helping me!” It was unexpected and delightful to be thanked by a robot, we make sure to help any we see that are in distress, even though we know they’re owned by a private company with profits in mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for this specific company, a couple years ago, as a robot handler and operator.In situations like this it is possible for an operator to manually organize the robots.Before I left we were making great strides to allow 1 operator to be able to keep tabs on up to 5 robots at a time in certain neighborhoods.Campuses, which are fully and thoroughly mapped, can probably have 1, maybe 2 operators at a time.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On the question of &#34;why 12 notes&#34;, I STRONGLY recommend this video by David Bennett:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvmzgVtZtUQThere&#39;s a really important step missing in the article which has been aluded to by a couple of comments already. It&#39;s the step between:   1. a series of notes defined by the harmonic series, that is, exact integer multiples (or ratios, if you prefer) of a base frequency, a physical phenomena found in nature

and   2. the well-tempered scales used by most western music, which adjusts the ratios to allow certain compositional &#34;tricks&#34; to be used without sounding dissonant.

The set of notes defined by (1) are typically referred to as &#34;Just Intonation&#34;, and was the basis for most western music (and some non-western music) until somewhere between about 1400 and 1600 (lots of room for discussion/debate there).The &#34;problem&#34; with just intonation, if indeed it is a problem, is that if you define two series of notes (call them a scale, if you like) using these integer ratios but starting from two different notes, you will trivially find cases where &#34;the next higher E&#34; is a different frequency. So starting from (say) A and moving by integer ratios gets you to a different (say) F than if you start from (say) B.This means that if you are writing in a just intonation scale with (say) A as the root, you have a set of notes that are not actually the same frequencies as if your scale started on (say) B.By itself, this is not a problem at all - there is all kinds of lovely music written through history that works just fine with notes and scales defined this way. You just stay in the same scale throughout, and there are no issues. There are even some scale changes you can make that still work, you just have to know what they are (and they depend on the root note and the set of integer ratios you&#39;re using, so it gets complicated).But ... somewhere in the period mentioned above, a subset of western musical culture started to want to experiment with &#34;modulation&#34; - changing from one scale to another in the midst of piece. On continuous pitch instruments (e.g. violin, voice), this is entirely possible to do, since they can play any frequency in their range at all. However, it does require significant skill on the part of the performer, since the pitch of a (say) &#34;F&#34; will differ depending on the scale currently in use in the piece.The breaking point, such as it was, came with the development of fixed pitch instruments (keyboards). These can only play the notes they are currently tuned to, and so if the (say) F in two scales is a different frequency, you cannot play in both scales without retuning - an obvious impossibility in the middle of a piece.So, &#34;well-tempered&#34; tuning was developed - the ratios described in TFA. These are tweaked by relatively small amounts so that the notes are close to where Just Intonation (integer ratios) would have placed them, but not precisely the same. These small shifts mean that the (say) &#34;F&#34; is the same frequency whether your scale began on (say) A or B. You can now play a fixed-tuning instrument like a harpsichord or a piano, change from one scale to another, and everything remains &#34;in tune&#34;.Of course, to ears used to Just Intonation, &#34;well-tempered&#34; tuning sounds out of tune. But in the west, most people (even within our musical academies) have grown up used to the sound of well-tempered tuning, and it is Just Intonation that sounds &#34;off&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don&#39;t understand all the hate in the comments for this article. This seems like a really fine introduction to a lot of the concepts. I had to scour the web a long time before understanding that the scales were constructed because of the simple/reduced ratio of root note to the others, which is clearly spelled out in this article.Music theory is, in my experience, typically taught as a list of facts to remember. Deriving it from first principles, insofar as it can be, is not common. This article is attempting to start that process.Some commentators are saying that the article doesn&#39;t address why we have 12 notes but I wonder if they even know why (one answer is because it&#39;s a good compromise between number of notes and that have simple/reduce ratios to each other [0]). I&#39;m also skeptical of music theorists that can&#39;t even attempt an answer to basic questions about note length frequency, why some chords are &#34;sad&#34; or &#34;happy&#34; and other basic questions. It&#39;s difficult because music theory is a hodge podge of theory that&#39;s attempting to describe what&#39;s effectively an evolved language (with different music evolution for different regions), but there are some basic tenets that probably apply.I don&#39;t claim to have deep knowledge but there are a few key facts about music and music theory that are really obscure unless you know where to look. Any attempt at coming to music theory from a more rigorous foundation should be encouraged.[0]  &#34;Measures of Consonances in a Goodness-of-fit Model for Equal-tempered Scales&#34; by Aline Honigh (https://github.com/abetusk/papers/blob/release/Music/measure...)EDIT: corrected spelling (thanks for the comments pointing it out)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Music was taught as part of the quadrivium (alongside arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy), so it has a long history of being thought about in mathematical terms. There&#39;s nothing wrong with looking at music that way. What is so interesting about music is its ability to turn mathematical beauty into aesthetic, artistic beauty.Sometimes the math is just there in the background: &#34;This chord progression is based on certain physical facts related to the harmonic series. That makes it sound good, and I like it&#34;. Sometimes it is brought to the forefront: &#34;All of this music appears to be generated from a short pattern of notes which is recognizable even as it is subjected to rotations, elongations, truncations, etc. That is beautiful.&#34;Certain types of music play up the lovely-pattern-ness of music, and some don&#39;t. Neither is better than the other (denigrate the art of Justin Bieber who dare), but you can probably guess which I prefer :)Consciousness, pattern-recognition, spatial rotation of abstract objects, natural mathematical beauty, poetry, drama, acting/performance, nonverbal collaboration, shared rhythm: music is a nexus for all of these things. Music is nothing short of awesome, in the truest sense of that word."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One egregiously loud motorcycle rolling through manhattan can be a nuisance to literally millions of people. This is unreasonable and a ticketing system like this makes a ton of sense.Police enforcement could probably solve the issue just as effectively.  Cops ignore loud honking and loud cars when its right in front of them.  If they would just stop ignoring such things the frequency would surely go down as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. I look forward to this enforcement in my city. I currently live against a major road. During the night, the traffic noise isn’t disturbing, except for about one vehicle in a thousand. And that motorcycle wakes me at 3am. For weeks on end. My neighbor’s kid’s motorcycle. On his way to work at 3am, has to gun it when turning out of the neighborhood, waking everyone. These are neighbors who had shot their next door neighbor’s cat, so unlikely to adapt their actions based upon my request. I’d happily pay for this device for my town. And yes, I’ve investigated soundproofing my bedroom. Quote was around $16k. Multiply that by the dozens of neighbors he wakes each night, and he forces everyone else to bare hundreds of thousands of dollars in upgrades so he can make noise at 3am. As much as I don’t want to step on anyone’s “freedoms”, noise sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangent: We should outlaw leaf blowers in cities while at it. It&#39;s february and freezing out and for some reason the idiotic management in the apartment across the street has contracted some crew to do daily leaf blowers on nearly completely clean sidewalks disturbing probably hundreds of people WFH. Not to even mention how particularly awful leaf blowers are for the environment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of fun. Wish I understood it better though. Seems a bit unintuitive when geoguesser works better probably because the proximity is truer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When do you get a yellow square? I couldn&#39;t find this documented anywhere, so I took a look at the code.Here&#39;s what I found: For each guess, Worldle calculates a proximity score from 0 to 100 -- higher is better. Each row is basically a quantized proximity score meter, from 0 to 100 in increments of 20. If you get at least half-way to the next increment of 20 (i.e. to the next green square), you get a yellow square, too.Example: If your proximity score for a guess is 63, you&#39;ll get 3 green squares and two blank (white or black) squares, i.e. GGGBB. If your score is 71, you&#39;ll get three green squares, and since 71 is at least half-way to 80 (i.e. &gt;= 70), you&#39;ll also get a yellow square, so GGGYB.The proximity score is round(100*(MAX_DISTANCE_ON_EARTH - d)/MAX_DISTANCE_ON_EARTH). Though that max distance is defined to be 20,000,000.This is the important part: https://github.com/teuteuf/worldle/blob/67db30bdf79c0965c19a..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was extremely confused about the distance values in relation to the percentages until I read the help:&gt; The distances displayed correspond to the distances between the selected and the target territory centers.&gt; For instance, the computed distance between United States and Canada is around 2260km even if they have a common border.That&#39;s extremely deceptive and non-obvious unless you read through the documentation. One of the appeals of Wordle is that it is an extremely intuitive game which doesn&#39;t require rule reading."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a tool at Amazon once that incorrectly calculated royalties, not because Amazon was greedily trying to steal from publishers, but just because of general incompetence (or, lack of sufficient competence maybe).Basically, of the people who wrote the tool, tested the tool, and used the tool, none of them knew exactly how royalties should be calculated and none of them could tell whether or not they were being calculated correctly. They weren&#39;t. We eventually figured out something was wrong and went through a very annoying process of learning about royalties and how they interplay with prices, discounts, and other factors and then set things right.Still, if I were paid by Amazon royalties in any capacity I would carefully double check their math and read the fine print.Maybe it&#39;s greed in this case, but in my time at Amazon I saw many teams in &#34;Keep Lights On&#34; mode where one or two people with vague memories of how services are supposed to work try to keep them running. There&#39;s also high turnover, so it&#39;s very easy to be the person on your team with the longest tenure and also be mostly in the dark about how your services should and do work.  As I say, maybe it&#39;s greed, but I would never rule out the people responsible just not understanding (or doing) what they should be doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The twitter thread and the accompanying website don&#39;t quite tell me what&#39;s going on besides &#39;not as much money as expected&#39;. But I can&#39;t quite see what the &#39;Net Sales&#39; problem is, it&#39;s just stated as &#34;less money&#34; for no reason? Although I am tired so maybe something just isn&#39;t clicking. I don&#39;t doubt that the terms of the deal are poor though.I had wondered for a while how the credit system worked, and if the increase in sales made up for the &#39;deal&#39; off audiobooks. I get $50-$60 audiobooks for $15, there&#39;s something mismatched there. Either the audiobook was priced at an extreme premium, or, it seems, Amazon just isn&#39;t paying the price I would expect.Edit: I found one response from an author that I think makes a simple point, if not perhaps what the thread describes (still can&#39;t tell). It&#39;s impossible for authors to calculate their expected royalties as there are so many varieties of discounts and price points that customers can pay for a single book: https://twitter.com/AdamEcclesBooks/status/14933236569105489...Which makes sense to me, as there&#39;s purchases and credits and various subscription tiers and audible unlimited and these are just the things I can think up off the top of my head. But again, I would buy a small fraction of the audiobooks I have purchased at full price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s terrible for the narrator too. In many cases the narrator makes a bad decision to record the Audiobook not for a per-finished-hour rate, but as a &#34;Royalty Share&#34; where they only earn on the Royalty -- that&#39;s 20%  (50-50 royalty split with the author) on the audiobook version.In most cases a narrator will never earn even close to minimum wage for the effort to create an audiobook. And it&#39;s more effort than you might guess. A skilled narrator might produce a finished hour of audio in 5 hours, and a less skilled narrator may take 10 to 12 hours to create that same finished hour. So for a 10 hour audiobook a narrator will have between 50 and 100 hours of work, depending on the material and the production skills of the narrator.It can take literally years to earn $500 to $1000 in royalties -- thats $10/hr -- on a book. And most books never sell enough audiobook copies. And that&#39;s why any narrator who understands this should never accept and ACX / Audible exclusive Royalty share audiobook deal.Now with this Audiblegate revelation it&#39;s all to clear that we narrators are destined to never make our money back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This F_FULLFSYNC behaviour has been like this on OSX for as long as I can remember. It is a hint to ensures that the data in the write buffer has been flushed to stable storage - this is historically a limitation of fsync that is being accounted for - are you 1000% sure it does as you expect on other OSes?POSIX spec says no: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/f...Maybe unrealistic expectation for all OSes to behave like linux.Maybe linux fsync is more like F_BARRIERFSYNC than F_FULLFSYNC. You can retry with those for your benchmarks.Also note that 3rd party drives are known to ignore F_FULLFSYNC, which is why there is an approved list of drives for mac pros. This could explain why you are seeing different figures if you are supplying F_FULLFSYNC in your benchmarks using those 3rd party drives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic thread.The history is also interesting. It&#39;s not that &#34;macOS cheats&#34;, but that it sincerely inherited the status quo of many years, then tried to go further by adding F_FULLFSYNC. However, Linux since got better, leaving macOS stuck in the past and everybody surprised. It&#39;s a big problem.Here&#39;s Dominic Giampaolo from Apple discussing this back in 2005, before Linux fixed fsync() to flush past the disk cache: https://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/Feb/msg0008...And here&#39;s TigerBeetle&#39;s Twitter thread with more of the history and how projects like LevelDB, SQLite and various language std libs were also affected: https://twitter.com/TigerBeetleDB/status/1422854779009654785"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a type 1 diabetic, and this was a helpful post at showing non diabetics why it is so. hard. Non diabetics typically think the difficult thing must be the shots and the finger pricks, right?Not really. The majority of diabetics get used to those things quickly (of course there are some  of course that deal with a major major needle phobia that can make it even harder). The hard part is that it never ends. Almost every moment of every day, your brain has a background process running that&#39;s evaluating every decision in context of your diabetes. There are no breaks. Your prefrontal cortex now has to take the place of a previously complex and automatic bodily process. It&#39;s the last thing you think about when you go to bed and it&#39;s the first thing you think about when you wake up. It&#39;s what you think about when you want to go on a walk, are about to enter a meeting, go into an interview, get on a plane, take a shower.It&#39;s usually little things: &#34;okay, where am I at now? which direction is it going? when did I last eat? do I have snacks ready? do I have enough insulin for the day? what if I start to go low during this meeting? should I pop some carbs and run high for this interview, so I don&#39;t risk a hypo partway through? why am I going low right now when I took the same dose I took yesterday for the same meal? why am I now skyrocketing for no discernible reason, I didn&#39;t even eat anything? shoot, I&#39;m starting to hypo out of nowhere in the middle of this great conversation, which I now have to interrupt to eat a snack and recover for 15 minutes. I fell asleep with a perfect BG, but now I&#39;m awake at 2AM half delirious because my BG fell all the way down to 50, and I&#39;m in the kitchen shoving cookies down my throat because hypoglycemia activates a survival instinct to EAT EVERYTHING that&#39;s extremely hard to control, and I know that I&#39;m gonna shoot all the way up to 250 shortly, which I&#39;ll have to treat with insulin, and I&#39;m basically not going to get any sleep tonight&#34;.And then the math often doesn&#39;t make any sense. There are so many factors that effect it. One day the same number of carbs + insulin may make you go high, and the next low, because of other environmental factors. (See the &#34;42 factors that effect blood glucose&#34; chart in the post.) You&#39;re constantly having to adjust.I&#39;m literally crying while writing this post, because it&#39;s so exhausting and it never ends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a type 1 diabetic and data scientist. Estimating the causal effect of a unit of insulin or food on blood sugar is an absolute crap shoot. Consider that there&#39;s a +/-20% margin of error on the reported carbohydrates on nutrition facts. We might consider this irreducible error that just cannot be modelled (Maybe you could get a calorimeter, estimate the distribution of errors, and reduce that error somewhat). Therefore, even if we created a model that explained all explainable variance, we still have a 20% margin of error. If a meal has enough carbohydrates, a 20% overestimate of insulin requirements would lead to an insulin overdose that would kill you if the resulting low blood sugar is not dealt with. In other words, the irreducible variance is so large that a &#34;perfect&#34; model would regularly suggest lethal insulin doses.My &#34;solution&#34; is to eat low-carb/keto as a &#34;variance reduction&#34; strategy. Still, removing carbs also introduces gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from protein) as a factor to consider. The synthesis of protein to glucose also occurs on a much time different time horizon than the consumption of carbs themselves which has implications for insulin dosing and insulin type.I could go on! But long story short, modelling blood glucose is bloody hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, I&#39;m an artificial pancreas developer! Our device has been approved for human trials which we&#39;re going to begin shortly, probably near the end of this quarter.One thing that the article (which is very well researched, by the way, kudos!) does not quite get right is that the insulin sensitivity _changes_ hour to hour, day to day, month to month. It changes nonlinearly with exercise, stress, sleep, diet, and in a million other subtle ways that we&#39;re still trying to characterize. This dynamism is part of what makes management of blood sugar so hard, because the same dose that got you in range a couple days ago now sends you into a hypoglycemic episode, which can be really really dangerous!The good news is that, while cures for diabetes have been Five Years Out (TM) since the 1980s, artificial pancreas technology (like Loop, OpenAPS, and recently approved Omnipof 5) is here _today_ and already giving people a real solution, not to mention peace of mind, but we still have a long way to go! Access issues, trust relating to years of anxiety induced trauma, cost etc are all barriers to making these solutions widely available, but I feel hopeful that in 20 years, a T1D diagnosis will be as manageable as an eczema one.If anyone has any questions about APs, I&#39;d be happy to field them!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the 90s-00s, when I was a younger, (even) more arrogant nerd, I looked down on Microsoft and their stupid technologies: Visual Basic, Access, Word, and more. Simple, limited tools that I only saw ugly, half-broken systems built with.Until I saw a something by Steve Ballmer (I think), explaining that their strategy was to provide tools for those &#34;99% developers&#34;. The ones who don&#39;t read HN, the ones who don&#39;t code for fun. Everyone for whom coding is something that gets in the way of their real objective.No wonder they produced bad code! But that&#39;s not the point: they&#39;re solving something else. They&#39;re not spending effort making bug-free maintainable code, they&#39;ve got more important things to do. They&#39;re doing the accounting for their small company, point of sale for the shops in their city, all the kind of things that may not be glamorous but that&#39;s all around us (for better or for worse)So while I puttered around in my self-congratulatory ivory tower of unix, Microsoft understood what the real world needed, for the 99% of developers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;d be surprised at how fast you can create something with an SQL database, a well used backend framework (eg. Rails) and a well used frontend framework.The things big tech companies do are usually to avoid scaling problems. In particular scaling on the engineering side. The above can scale to billions on the user side if needed but 10k engineers constantly updating and messing with a traditional SQL schema doesn&#39;t work.You&#39;d be crazy to try to replicate something like the big tech companies database storage systems when you&#39;re just starting out. You don&#39;t have 10k engineers. You may think &#34;but i want to scale to a billion users&#34;. Well you still don&#39;t have those problems. The scaling problems big tech companies have are scaling to 10k engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Too many people believe that aiming for good software quality means you need to fully adopt that new technology, whether it’s microservices, GraphQL, or distributed tracing. You’re not done until you’ve switched fully over to the ideal technology.This. We are constantly presented with new and shiny things. And then, barely a year later, there is the next ideal technology. And the next, and the next, and the next.We have seen this with everyhing: Languages, coding standards, paradigms, editors, organisational methodology, interview methodology, frameworks, databases, security, design basics,...the list is endless.But here is some truth:C is still written. As is pure JS. Imperative/Prodecural code never went away. Websites on servers we can physically touch are still deployed. People still write working implementations for almost everything under the sun from scratch. Information-Dense, slim, efficient interfaces that get jobs done are still there. As are monolithic architectures. Good &#39;ol RDBMS still work great. bash is still the dominant shell. grep/cut/awk are still great for analysing logs. Water still flows downhill.&#34;new&#34; and &#34;better&#34; are 2 different words, with different meanings. Something that&#39;s new could be better. But he fact that it&#39;s new, in itself, doesn&#39;t automagically make it better. And even if its better in one scenario, its doesn&#39;t have to be better in all scenarios."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unfortunately not available to compare on https://www.programmingfonts.org/While I&#39;m here: Victor Mono has been my programming font of choice for a while now: https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/Oh, look at that, the Victor Mono homepage has a font comparison slider that allows you to compare it to MonoLisa! MonoLisa advertises that it&#39;s wider than other monospace fonts, and you can really see that in the comparison. One of the things I appreciate about Victor Mono is that it is narrower than many other monospace fonts (while still being very readable), allowing you to fit more code side-by-side."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please stop it with the &#34;coding ligatures&#34; already.  They are not helpful and only serve to obscure the code being written.This has got to be one of my least favourite trends in programming aesthetics these days.  For a font claiming to &#34;follow function&#34; to devote so much effort to sacrificing function for the _vogue du jour_ is especially rich."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am the only one who finds fonts a bit expensive for personal use? It is not a rant, I am not saying it isn&#39;t worth it, that font designers can&#39;t make money, etc... But that puts it on the same level as tools like Sublime Text or Beyond Compare. For me, it is enough of a turn off not to use a commercial font, especially considering that the free offering is quite good.I totally understand the higher price for commercial use, here, it is cheap compared to the costs of hiring a designer, and it may have a real impact on your sales and ultimately earn you money.But why is the price for personal use around $60? Is it some kind of a sweet spot because most people won&#39;t buy fonts anyways, even for $1, but those who do expect to pay that kind of money. Does it account for piracy, which I guess is easy and goes unnoticed if you only use it personally?"</p>

It showed a very large (but finite: the site itself estimates 30-45 minutes) number of alerts. It also a prompt for your name and referred to you by your name.At the time I knew only HTML so I was blown away by a web page &#34;talking&#34; to me, and by inspecting the source I learned about the script tag, alerts, prompts, loops and variables.When it came out, the main browser was Internet Explorer, which became unresponsive until you got rid of all of the alerts.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Newegg doesn&#39;t limit their fraud to selling broken open-box items.I personally saw them try to pass off an expensive mouse that was crusty and scratched as &#34;new&#34; (I double checked and it was NOT marked as an &#34;open box&#34; on the product page or order page).Newegg support refused to process the return, so I had to contest it with the credit card company. Pro tip: the CC support rep told me to process it as &#34;product never received.&#34; He said if you pay for a new item and you get a used item, then you never received the item you paid for. Hopefully I never have to use that again, but now I know (and now you do too)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a theory on what happened at NewEgg with this motherboard:1. GN gets motherboard from NewEgg, never opens the shipping box.2. GN sends motherboard back to NewEgg, as allowed by NewEgg’s policy.3. NewEgg decides to decline the RMA just because they can, claiming whatever excuse they are forced to make up when anyone asks.  (NewEgg went back and forth regarding whether it was thermal paste on the motherboard or damaged pins on the CPU socket.)4. GN knows they didn’t damage the motherboard, since they didn’t even open the shipping box, so they relate the story to their surprisingly large audience, and the whole story blows up.5. NewEgg goes “Oops, bad publicity, we’d better refund them.”6. GN wants the motherboard returned, too.7. NewEgg goes “Oh crap.  We said the motherboard was damaged, so if we actually send the real motherboard back, GN will see that it’s fine and know we lied.  But GN said that they never opened the shipping box, so GN has never seen the motherboard.  We can just send back any old motherboard which is actually damaged.  Genius!”, and NewEgg picks a motherboard which is marked as damaged in their inventory system, and ships it to GN.8. GN opens the newly-received motherboard box, and finds it indeed has damaged CPU socket pins, but also finds an RMA sticker from Gigabyte, with an RMA number on it.  GN investigates, and finds out the whole history of that board, painting a very ugly picture of NewEgg if that was the motherboard which they were originally sold.NewEgg is now in a bind.  They can’t admit to lying about blatantly refusing legitimate RMAs, nor can they admit to knowingly shipping back a fake damaged motherboard to GN.  So what they will probably try to claim is that the damaged board was the one sold to GN, but that it was a mistake in inventory management.  However, this story still would not explain why NewEgg’s returns department missed seeing the huge RMA sticker from Gigabyte, and why they sometimes claimed thermal paste on the motherboard, and sometimes damaged CPU socket pins.  Unless, of course, NewEgg lied and shipped a fake damaged motherboard back to GN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Newegg had a broken motherboard, already tried to RMA it themselves, then (likely accidentally) sold it as open box.I see no big problem with that first part at all. Seems like a honest accident - stuff like that can happen. No big deal, imho.But investigating the returned board - not seeing the RMA sticker on it, mis-classifying the damage, not checking their own records on the board - and claiming it was &#34;customer damage&#34; without any hard evidence... and not ever double-checking anything at all, after the customer repeatedly insisted they didn&#39;t even open the box...That&#39;s the real problem. It&#39;s almost impossibly sloppy to miss all that during any damage investigation, it&#39;s outright offensive to claim &#34;customer damage&#34; without having done any investigation to substantiate that claim, and it&#39;s complete madness, to spend a lot of time insisting on &#34;customer damage&#34; in discussions with the customer, without ever double-checking the board, the damage or the records.That&#39;s the reason why it&#39;s hard to believe this was a honest accident. Because if it was a honest accident... how could they have never noticed their accident, while &#34;investigating&#34; and refusing a refund multiple times over? With an RMA-sticker right on the board, dated to before the date of sale?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A huge problematic deficiency of 1Password is that it lacks literal multi-line text field types.The items in its database let you define custom fields for them, but there is no literal multi line text field. There&#39;s a &#34;File&#34; type, but you can&#39;t simply define fields with multi-line text values. However, every item has exactly one built-in &#34;notes&#34; field, but that&#39;s actually styled markdown text. And you only get one. And its name is always &#34;notes&#34;.It would obviously be extremely useful to be able to define an arbitrary number of arbitrarily labeled multi line text fields that are not interpreted as markdown text.It boggles my mind that 1Password doesn&#39;t support this. What were they thinking??? It makes it a real pain in the butt to store ssh keys and certificates and a lot of other types of information in 1Password.A single markdown &#34;notes&#34; field just doesn&#39;t cut it. It&#39;s not as if it&#39;s technically challenging or a security risk. It already has a &#34;notes&#34; field, so just turn off the &#34;rich text&#34; feature and allow me to make my own! I would have thought it was a pretty obvious and often requested feature, but as far as I can tell, it&#39;s impossible!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah neat, the app exposes an ssh agent socket:    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.1password/agent.sock

So you would essentially replace Keychain, Gnome-keyring, or the vanilla SSH-agent with 1password. Very nice solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a bad idea for users. I don&#39;t think SSH keys are things you should share across machines in a password manager. If you have two devices, then you should have two keys (though this is the subject of some debate; see [0]). Using the 1Password SSH agent encourages people to have &#34;one&#34; SSH key across devices, which means that any leaks will disproportionately impact them.It&#39;s unfortunate, because there is some real innovation around the per-application usage permissions:&gt; 1Password will ask for your consent before an SSH client can use your SSH key. Because of this, there&#39;s no concept of adding or removing keys like with the OpenSSH agent.If an organization wishes to solve the SSH pubkey distribution problem (the main reason one would copy a private key across machines), then they should use SSH certificate authorities like [1]. In fact, I think that would be a far more interesting 1Password product—HashiCorp Vault could use some competition for this kind of use-case.[0]: https://security.stackexchange.com/a/40061[1]: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-cert..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; lost access to paid services that I had set up with social loginI signed up to Quora with my Facebook account, back in the day. Deleted Facebook in 2013 and lost access to my Quora account, with no possible way to recover it.I haven&#39;t used a social login since. In my case, it was fairly harmless, but it made me realise how dangerous social login is. Every time there&#39;s a signup, I look for &#34;signup with email&#34;. It&#39;s the safer option. And if you can, use your own domain for email (Google&#39;s paid email offering supports this, as does Fastmail and countless other email providers). That way if your email provider decides to flip you off, you switch DNS records and you&#39;re up and running somewhere else, and everything keeps on running.But: If you don&#39;t have a copy of emails then you lose all saved emails, so make sure you have a backup strategy in place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google is simply not a very reliable business partner for tech. I have a decade worth of experience in the Danish public sector, where I’ve had plenty of great experiences with both Amazon and Microsoft. I know that a lot of people would prefer things to be open source, but part of what you pay for in an Enterprise Organisation is availability of support. When AWS first entered the European market, most of what they sold in the support side was rather automated. Which just couldn’t compete with what Microsoft sells, where Seattle will call you with updates every hour on the hour if you’re a big enough customer. This is a big part of why Azure managed to capture the market share it did under the nose of AWS, the other part being that once you buy Office365 well… Anyway, I’ve never seen a huge tech company change their ways as quick as Amazon did, and today they’re actually ahead of Microsoft in terms of compliance with EU legislation and Enterprise support.Google mean while has the same business-to-business support that it does for private customers like the author here. For some services it’s because Google doesn’t care, but they do care about Education and they still can’t figure out how to readjust to be a valuable business partner even when they actually want to sell you something.So my best advice to anyone using Google services would be to find a better vendor as quick as possible. It’s completely ridiculous that you can lose your business account over someone replying to a spam mail.Just imagine if Microsoft kicked the Danish government out of Office365 every time one of our employees did something silly in their emails. I know there is a difference between us as individuals and the Danish governed, but the point in trying to make is that there isn’t, not to Google at least. So maybe they are just a terrible vendor?This is all anecdotal by the way. I haven’t seen anyone complain about getting locked out of their azure essential subscription, so in my eyes that is simply a safer way to pay for g-suite type services than g-suite. That being said, I do personally host my domain and DNS stuff on their own separate accounts at their own separate vendors, both privately and professionally, exactly because you want that stuff to remain unaffected by everything else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When you put it this way, it&#39;s really quite remarkable how tenuous our hold is on even paid for digital services.There is really nothing you could do with a car to prompt the car maker to take it from you. And the state will only take it if you break the law in particularly dangerous ways.When it comes to other possessions it&#39;s even harder for anyone to take them away from you. If I take a kitchen knife and stab someone with it I will go to prison for sure, but I don&#39;t think they will take the knife away. They definitely won&#39;t ban me from buying knives.But when it&#39;s a digital service, even something as crucial as a banking service, it&#39;s seen as normal that you can lose them for posting offensive things on twitter. Perhaps it&#39;s because we haven&#39;t had these digital services for long enough to consider them as really belonging to us, so we accept that they can be taken away at the slightest provocation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lorinda helped me massively with my attempts to bring back online some hardware that had escaped early 90s Bell Labs so that, as a pre-teenager trapped in rural Illinois, I could run Plan 9 and build some software for it. She did not stop at connecting me to the right people to locate the hardware I needed to restore my computer to the living. She also went above and beyond by introducing me to individuals whom I did not deserve to talk with nor did I appreciate how lucky I was to be sharing e-mails with these people at the age of 12. These unlucky (former) Labs employees included both Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.Lorinda, thank you for taking such extensive efforts to encourage my passion and interest in obscure operating systems. I have not lost my drive to explore this area of computing. My only wish is that I had sent you more than one of the coffee cakes from Morton, IL that you loved and said made us even. Hopefully, wherever you are now, you can have as much coffee cake as possible. Thank you again, truly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tool `eqn`, which she wrote (joined by Brian Kernighan) is an &#34;ancestor&#34; of TeX: The mathematical syntax of TeX (design started 1977) was based on eqn (1975). For example, the eqn paper (https://research.swtch.com/eqn.pdf) has the expression    sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i = pi over 2

which would have been entered as something pretty close to that in the first draft design of TeX (the second draft introduced the backslashes), and today as:    \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x_i = {\pi \over 2}

and you can see the evolution. The Wikipedia page has more examples (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eqn_(software)&amp;ol... ). Knuth credits Lorinda Cherry explicitly a couple of times in the first draft design (https://www.saildart.org/TEXDR.AFT[1,DEK]):&gt; A special syntax is used in formulas, modeled on that of Kernighan and Cherry, Comm. ACM 18 (March 1975), 151-157. For example, ``sup 9&#39;&#39; in line 41 specifies a superscript 9, ``sub {n+1}&#39;&#39; in line 74 specifies a subscript n+1.and in the last page/paragraph:&gt;  To conclude this memo, I should explain how TEX is going to work on math formulas. However, I will have to sketch out the code in more detail and it is only fuzzy in my mind at the moment. […] it may be necessary to build the parse tree first as Kernighan and Cherry do.(Yes indeed TeX builds the parse tree first, as we can see from the second draft: https://www.saildart.org/TEX.ONE[1,DEK] )The eqn system was a pioneering and capable one: although Knuth did not use any of the code of troff/eqn as-is (not sure if it was available to him; in any case he was targeting &#34;book&#34; quality), clearly it influenced the design, and I imagine it inspired him about what was possible in the first place. Even after TeX became widely used, there have been some math books typeset with troff and eqn.Reading about Lorinda Cherry&#39;s other accomplishments like `typo` and the Writer&#39;s Workbench, it&#39;s clear we&#39;ve lost someone who was a pioneer in multiple respects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As one of few authors of an implementation of `dc` and `bc`, but one who never actually met Lorinda Cherry, perhaps I have a slightly different perspective of her work.I&#39;ve read the closest thing we have to the original sources of `dc` and `bc`: the source bundled with Plan 9. It didn&#39;t take me long to read the entirety of the source because they were simple and concise. That immensely impressed me.However, I hate to say that my youth (compared to Ms. Cherry, at least) caused me to look at the source with disdain, mostly from a lack of handling errors caused by user mistakes.It took several days for me to think more carefully about the context. She was writing for herself and other programmers, who would probably be able to recognize when they made a mistake and fix it.The code has a simple elegance that mine will never have. Sure, you might call mine &#34;industrial strength,&#34; but I think a quote by ** Gabriel sums up the difference between Ms. Cherry&#39;s code and mine:&#34;I&#39;m always delighted by the light touch and stillness of early programming languages. Not much text; a lot gets done. Old programs read like quiet conversations between a well-spoken research worker and a well-studied mechanical colleague, not as a debate with a compiler. Who&#39;d have guessed sophistication bought such noise?&#34; [1]And that says nothing of the design of her software.`dc` was, and in many ways still is, the simplest calculator that could ever exist. It was the simplest shell too, with the `!` command. I personally believe that it was for this reason that `dc` was the first program Bell Labs made run on the PDP-11. [2] `bc`, while more complicated, is also a great design (for the time).In short, Ms. Cherry was a master of her trade, and I only recognized that from afar.One of the items I had in my bucket list was to meet Ms. Cherry; because of her work on `dc` and `bc`, I felt a kinship to her having written my own. It is sad to know that item will never happen. Oh, well.[1]: https://people.csail.mit.edu/alinush/6.824-spring-2015/l07-g...[2]: https://youtu.be/EY6q5dv_B-o?t=1767"</p>

Shouldn’t it just be black and white since the text is black?&gt;  I’m actually not 100% sure why this happens (and sometimes doesn’t), but it’s an artifact of the rasterization process when text is rendered to screen.This is a brilliant technique called subpixel rendering.[0] A &#34;typical&#34; computer screen&#39;s pixels are split into three columns of red, green and blue, instead of lighting up as a solid square. Using color fringing at non-pixel-aligned edges of characters can effectively triple the perceived horizontal resolution.Wrong assumptions about the pixel layout will show up very badly, as shown in [1]. 
HiDPI displays (also mobile, not just 4K) get no real benefit from this and usually have a more complex subpixel layout anyway. I remember seeing old iPads usually showing awful fringes as subpixel rendering was enabled without considering the actual orientation of the display.[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering[1] http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/subpixel.php"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think these criticisms aren&#39;t just relevant to HN, they apply to all social media and online conversation. Even (group) email can become quite toxic if people don&#39;t convey their emotion well.I have been on HN for 15 years, I have spent far too much time on this site. Eventually you learn which topics will be &#34;toxic&#34; and avoid them (if you want to). To some extent it just maturity (or lack there of) but I actually think HN is far less toxic outside of some specific topics than other sites.The topics that are liable to become flame wars change over time, currently it seems to be anything &#34;Crypto&#34; or &#34;Online Advertising&#34; as people have very strong feelings on both sides. I&#39;m certainly still guilty of getting drawn in at times, especially when I feel I have a horse in the race. There is always insightful comments in these threads too.Fortunately HN is designed to detect topics that are getting out of hand (far more comments than up votes) and they drop of the homepage quickly massively reducing the exposure. Exactly where this thread is already going.I think the best decision HN made was not breaking the site into categories or &#34;Sub-HNs&#34; where specific toxic topics can grow and mutate, everything is forced though the front page ensuring a level of self moderation.After 15 years on the site I have no intention of leaving it."</p>

MySQL will work on anything.&#34; Instead of taking a look at this laptop and working on the problem with him, I just told him that he&#39;s wrong and he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing (basically).&#34;I catch myself doing this, without realizing it far too often. It&#39;s good to catch yourself and try to change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;These are typical, HN-esque responses that may get upvotes online, but they hurt personal relationships.&#34;As a regular, I disagree completely. Comments that point out that something is wrong and have the empathy to try to help and identify a solution are much more upvoted that cynical ones that just point out that something is wrong without much caring for the other part.If you dig up HN only paying attention to potentially toxic comments, you will find them. It doesn&#39;t make HN toxic. If you create the habit of reading yesterday&#39;s posts, giving them enough time for the best comments to be upvoted and settle at the top, you will see much much less toxicity.It seems to me that the author is trying to get away from a certain behavior and, in the process, everywhere they look they just fit what they see in that exact behavior. Like when Woody Woodpecker is hungry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Corn in the US is mostly used for harmful purposes. It&#39;s used for producing fodder for intensive cattle farming (which of course produces lots of CO2). It&#39;s used for biofuel production, which as the article observes releases more CO2 than that it saves. And it&#39;s used for producing corn syrup which is an ingredient that nobody needs in their diet.The rest, which would be usage for e.g. corn bread or other staples of North American cuisine, is of course fine. Nothing wrong with e.g. organically farmed corn. It&#39;s a crop that does well under a wide range of circumstances and popular for that reason all over the world. And as a grain, it&#39;s an important part of food production.So, why does this exist? Very simple, federal subsidies to states that have become very dependent on that. Kill the subsidies and that whole industry slowly dies. That would be a good thing. Maybe repurpose the subsidies to have those farmers do something that actually is more productive and less harmful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article misses a key point: Ethanol is used to oxygenate the fuel, which reduces carbon monoxide and soot emissions.  It replaced MTBE in that role.It was never intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Producing it requires more energy than it provides, and this was known long before it was introduced.  It might be possible to power the production with renewable energy, but that&#39;s just extra steps for powering cars with renewables."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. I can&#39;t believe 2005 was the rage with biofuels.2. Many people, AV, boats, powertoys, lawn equipment (it&#39;s own pollution there but that&#39;s another article) dislike ethanol in gasoline, especially for older cars.3. Who wins in the end? The corn farmers for the past, 17 years?4. Why did it take 17 years for this study to be funded and published.5. If it&#39;s economical to move back to &#34;pure gasoline&#34; will we? Just using pure gasoline means we are 24% more efficient on carbon:&#34;The research, which was funded in part by the National Wildlife Federation and U.S. Department of Energy, found that ethanol is likely at least 24% more carbon-intensive than gasoline due to emissions resulting from land use changes to grow corn, along with processing and combustion.&#34;Simply incredible, back in 05, it was one a gas shock, gas used to cost $1.25&#39;ish on average and went up quite a bit, $3 or so - https://money.cnn.com/2005/09/01/markets/gas_prices/index.ht... and that was in 2005 dollars. Average car MPG got 14-22mpg.6. This was not new, even back then everyone knew: https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-etha... but not exactly how it was 24% more intensive then gasoline."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"EDIT: Author has pointed out that the interpolation mode can be changed. Very slick!It looks like this is interpolating in HCL or HSV space— that tends to produce unexpected results, including intermediate colors with unrelated hues (pink between orange and blue?), or sharp discontinuities if one of the endpoints changes slightly (try mixing orange and blue, and then shifting the blue towards teal until suddenly the intermediate pink pops to green).This document[1] also illustrates pretty well.Interpolating in RGB space has its own issues (more so if gamma is not handled correctly) due to the human visual system&#39;s differing sensitivity to different colors— the result is often that two bright colors will have an intermediate color which is darker than either endpoint.There&#39;s a known solution, thankfully: Mix colors in a perceptual color space like Lab or Oklab[2].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some really good thoughts here. I&#39;ll summarize the ones that hit me:- &#34;Why are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying. The long answer is that most of the web has become too inauthentic to trust.&#34;This is it for me exactly. I search for the following kinds of things on Reddit exactly because results on other sites aren&#39;t trustworthy: Reviews are secretly paid ads. The &#34;best&#34; recipe for pancakes is only what&#39;s trending on instagram right now. The latest conditions on mountain bike and hiking trails are being shared inside communities like Reddit but not on the web. The same for trending programmer tools.- &#34;It is obvious that serving ads creates misaligned incentives for search engines...&#34;What I&#39;m shocked by is that Google somehow maintained a balance on this for so long. Well, at least a good enough balance that people still use it primarily.- &#34;Google increasingly does not give you the results for what you typed in. It tries to be “smart” and figure out what you “really meant&#34; ...&#34;This is the most annoying behavior because I really mean what I write.- &#34;There’s a fun conspiracy theory that popped up recently called the Dead Internet Theory...&#34;I hadn&#39;t heard of this. Now that&#39;s some sci-fi level of conspiracy but in today&#39;s world it seems totally plausible."</p>

This is usually a good first step, and you&#39;ll be surprised at how often...&#34;).Likewise, I wonder how long appending &#34;Reddit&#34; will work. As others have pointed out, Reddit shills are already relatively common, and it&#39;s becoming increasingly common for bot accounts to create lots of random comments to appear to be human (such as finding a thread with thousands of comments, then copying and pasting the comment to another place in the thread or to another thread, or auto-generating a simple sentence based on other comments in the thread).Sometimes the advertising hordes move so fast they kill something before it even takes off, like what happened with Clubhouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google used to be really, really good at finding exactly what I told it to find. Nowadays, it&#39;s turned into the yellow pages; sponsored content from businesses trying to sell me goods and services.Can people suggest good alternatives or search patterns for certain categories of information or search types?Some of the search patterns I currently I use:* Youtube for product reviews and demos, entertainment, music and educational material.* Google with site:reddit.com at the start for questions best answered by other humans; crowd-sourced answers, authentic replies from mostly real people.* Google with site:news.ycombinator.com if I want to find &#34;forum-like&#34; discussion on topics I&#39;m interested in.* Google Image search with site:amazon.co.uk when looking for niche products I need to buy, because Amazon&#39;s search is so incredibly broken and game-ified.What I&#39;m having a heck of a time finding is technical content; long-form programming tutorials, deep dives into academic concepts (I do a lot of signal/audio processing and search for blog posts related to these topics), circuit schematics, electronic engineering content. These used to exist on enthusiast forums 10-15 years ago, but Google often no longer surfaces hits from these forums, both because the content is old and the forum model is dying. Reddit is the &#34;replacement&#34; but it plagued with low-effort &#34;look at my thing&#34; posts that help nobody."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Marketing.The one thing I pushed off for as long as possible. Because it was always easier to build more, than it was to go into marketing / sales.No clever tricks, or growth hacks. Me and my cofounders just connected with everyone we could on LinkedIn, twitter, discord, etc. and talked to people about the product: https://rysolv.com/.In fact, part of the reason we delayed marketing was looking for some clever way to 10x, or make it go viral. A big motivator was Paul Graham&#39;s &#34;do things that don&#39;t scale&#34; post [1]. So we just sat down and talked to people.[1] http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It might sound dumb, but monetizing my site was the stepping stone to make it take off. I run a solitaire website called https://online-solitaire.com/ that ran for a few years without me earning any money from it. I kind of thought that no-one earned money from banner ads anymore, so I didn&#39;t even bother with them.One day I decided to try it out and earned around $1000 the first month. That gave me the boost to spent time improving the site, optimizing speed and improving SEO. A couple of years later, the site is now earning $10k+ a month ."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Commoditize your complement&#34;I had hosting issues in many of my companies and consulting projects, running from &#34;WTF is this AWS bill $10k???&#34; to &#34;WTF did our 10gbit/s download just kick Heroku offline?&#34;But people can only appreciate the things I build for them if they are hosted well. So I took the obvious next step and purchased a small struggling hosting company. We then introduced nicer tooling that imitates the AWS and Heroku APIs if possible, to make using their servers as easy as possible for me. And now I can offer managed hosting to all of my consulting clients. For them, it&#39;s slightly cheaper prices and (in contrast with AWS and Heroku) they can just call me when things don&#39;t work. And for me, it&#39;s reliable high-margin revenue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was really close to becoming a Linode customer last week for several large boxes, but ended up buying hardware and self-hosting.The cost to cut in an enterprise fiber link (1000/400) to our office was surprisingly low.My experience trialling linode as a paying customer was really positive (VERY competitive price, great performance), only complaint being their NodeBalancer can’t automatically handle certificates like CF and AWS can.Also, it needs to be mentioned because there’s a lot of negative in this thread: HUGE shout out to Linode for being massive community supporters and donating HEAPS of free compute to uni clubs and such, pretty much anyone with a charity certificate who asks for it. Fantastic company that’s easy to ‘just talk to people’ rather than trying to find the right support silo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is Akamai figuring out they need to address the self-serve market.Akamai has 6x the edge network footprint of Cloudflare and has all the cool trendy stuff like edge workers, they just suck at selling to the developer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a long time Linode user, I hung in there through a lot of service issues and growing pains. Linode has always been just one of a handful of providers I have, and I figured at _some_ point, all of these issues will result in a solid platform. Well, over the last couple years, Linode HAS achieved this, and is now one of my most reliable platforms.I also use Prolexic DDoS service from Akamai, which was a standalone company until 2014. Akamai bought them, and the service actually vastly improved, so let&#39;s hope that Linode + Akamai&#39;s size and buying power will result in something even better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve done this a few times, some things to think about if you decide to take the plunge.1. New backs aren&#39;t always made well, often with the mounting posts not lining up as well as they should.2. New batteries are a crap shoot. Most don&#39;t last as long nor are rated as high as advertised. On the 5g and later, you can put in a much larger battery in them, but you need the thicker case.3. If you mod an iPod mini, use a higher quality sd to compact flash adapter. The cheaper ones, end up having weird issues when transferring files.4. If Rockbox seems temperamental it&#39;s not just you. It can take a bit to work out the issues it has with your iPod, from buggy themes to random crashes.5. If your music doesn&#39;t play right through Rockbox (clipped music) or playing music on rockbox seems to crash device, the issue was the file transfer. To fix, reboot the iPod to the stock Apple Firmware, delete the old files, and then transfer them again. Apple firmware handles file transfers much better than Rockbox.6. If your iPod hasn&#39;t been charged in a long time, it might not come up when first connected to power. Sometimes, leaving the iPod attached to power for a day or two will allow it to get enough charge to get into actual recharge mode. Older models re"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The big thing here is the concept of a device doing ONE thing and doing it well. Is there a name for that?I&#39;ve been rocking an iPod Video for like 15 years and it is still my go-to music device. All the stereos in my office, house and shop have a 3.5mm cable hanging from them.I&#39;ve also been using rockbox so I can play FLAC files. The ipod is on it&#39;s 4th battery at this point and I&#39;ve also upgraded to SD cards from the internal HD about 6 years ago. The screen is not working in a few places now, but the thing keeps working and I&#39;d be very sad if it ever stopped because I&#39;m not sure what would replace it.Whenever I&#39;m programming and I feel like I&#39;ve been very productive, it&#39;s often the times I&#39;m using this ipod with headphones - instead of a music playing piece of software. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m less inclined to open up the software and spend time choosing an album/podcast/etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love rockbox on the ipod6g.I have been through a number of iterations of them and compile my own custom builds of rockbox. One thing I would do is avoid the iFlash SD card adapters as in my experience files tend to corrupt. With an upgraded battery the iFlash mSATA SSD adapters work very well.You can use transflac/oggenc to transcode your lossless library and it works really well for maximising space.Edit: here is a link to photos of some of my iPods:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They should focus on saving Firefox.- Cut out all (or at the very least, most) initiatives that don&#39;t serve the goal of promoting Firefox&#39;s market share or sustainability going forward- Donate the major money drains that aren&#39;t Firefox to the Apache Foundation or another worthy custodian- Fire all inessential staff that don&#39;t want to work on Firefox.- Get a CEO/upper management that are in it for the passion, not the money, and cut their salaries (bonuses tied directly to increase in Firefox market share).- Make sure that all donations from now on are redirected to things that support Firefox development and nothing else, period.- Make whatever partnerships are needed to have a steady stream of income, be that donation or selling out to Google or Bing.Firefox is in trouble. Firefox is also Mozilla&#39;s raison d&#39;être, and they should embrace that. We as a community, cannot afford to let Firefox languish until the only browsers in the world are Chromium derivatives. The diversity of truly independent browser engines is far too important to give up without a fight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thoughts on this are that every time I see a news piece about Firefox it&#39;s about &#34;social justice&#34;, some code of conduct controversy, or something else utterly unimportant to web browser selection.Being &#34;Open Source&#34; does nothing for me when Firefox engages in the same crap as other closed source browsers, like Pocket. Mozilla also allowed social issues to take precedence over retaining good engineers. Whether you like it or not, even assholes have a basic right to exist and the more recent culture of shun and cancel has had negative consequences for society as a whole. Maybe they were assholes, but I don&#39;t give a shit how nice the developers who made my web browser are.I suppose the problem with Mozilla is the CEO/people who make decisions about Firefox, replace them and maybe Firefox could be revived. But I have extraordinary doubts that Firefox is salvageable at this point. Mozilla&#39;s priorities have strayed so far from mine that I cannot see them becoming something I care about any time soon. I suspect it is similar for others.There is not one issue with Firefox, the people in charge are not competent. It&#39;s mistake after mistake after mistake. These mistakes are a direct result of prioritizing diversity over talent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would:- Prioritise getting the new extension framework fully functional. And continue innovating on the capabilities that are exposed. Especially on mobile where the new fenix engine is still limited to a small whitelist of extensions- Sort out the multi-profile story. Container tabs are great, but the chrome model is also a great fit for many workflow (e.g. different people in a house or home vs. work profiles).- Try and work on making Gecko easily embeddable again. Webkit/Blink gets all the attention because it&#39;s easy to embed into things. I suspect Gecko needs to compete in this market if it hopes to survive. It needs to have more than one company invested in it.This ship has probably sailed now as they&#39;ve fired most of their Rust and Servo teams. But IMO they ought to have created a rust-based cross-platform UI framework. They tried to do it web-based with Firefox OS but that was too slow. But with a Rust solution I think they could have owned both the mobile and desktop application spaces, which could potentially have made them a bootload of money and been a huge win for linux."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We never hear about broken and worn-out products. Pretty much all gear nowadays is baseline ok, it’s the negatives that really set things apart.For once, let&#39;s turn it all upside down:We should build a collection about how things break - review broken and worn-out products to teach how to identify cheap products. That&#39;s why I built failscout.coIt&#39;s simple: You upload your broken products and quickly describe how long you owned them, how often you used them, and where they failed.Everything breaks eventually, but when it does, can you easily repair/fix it? That&#39;s why users can suggest a fix to a broken/inconvenienced product.What could we do with all this data?- Identifying the common failure modes of product- Collect fixes for common product failures- See if a product&#39;s quality has changed or gone down at some point- Add a simple JSON API so other sites and projects can leverage our data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a fan of the exit review.  Something that is no longer being used (for any reason) and there is now perspective.  I first saw bunnie do it at https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=242 quoting the first two paragraphs:&gt; I think it’s time to start a new kind of gadget review: the exit review.&gt; Gadgets always seem to arrive on the scene with a lot of splash and hype, but rarely do you find an article telling you how the gadget fared in Real Life. The Exit Review is something I’m going to try doing every time I retire a major gadget of mine; the idea of it is to reflect upon how the gadget performed over its duration of service. Of course, reviews like this are all hindsight, so they don’t drive sales — which probably explains why nobody does them, because there’s no money to be made doing them. However, as a design engineer I think there are lessons to be learned through reflection, and as a consumer I believe that apples don’t fall to far from the tree — a good gadget maker will get my business again, and a bad one will never see another dime from me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"i love the idea of the site but i would like to see one change.  Instead of adding a product when it breaks, let someone add it when they buy it then send a yearly reminder of the products they have added and if they want to update their status.  this would have the benefit of:
-tracking % of product failures
-finding out if they function longer then they are needed.
-finding out which products outlast others before they get to the point failure
-potentially notify/warn users of potential issues that come up to before theirs breaksI think a lot of people dont care enough to upload info just to help product designers, some will do it to help out other consumers, but if you can provide more value to the person with the product you want info on that should get you the most engagement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can read and write binary, including null, in pure bash, without even subshells, let alone external processes like dd and xxd.This is a driver/client for a vintage portable disk drive that has an rs232 interface. Any disk drive obviously has to handle arbitrary data including binary including 0x00.It&#39;s entirely in native bash with no external tools and not even any subshells. It does have to call stty and mkfifo once at startup, but that&#39;s just startup like to open the serial port, not part of the work.https://github.com/bkw777/pdd.shThe gimmick for reading nulls is not exactly efficient. Basically you read one character at a time and look at the errorlevel from read to detect the difference between &#34;got nothing&#34; and &#34;got 0x00&#34;It&#39;s fine for this case because the drive is so slow and small that even the entire disk is only  200k max. Making bash read one byte at a time for 200k is still nothing today but only because hardware is insane today.But it&#39;s possible. And the beginning of the post does say &#34;as a thought experiment&#34;.Similarly, you don&#39;t need xxd to convert back &amp; forth between raw binary and text encoding.My own similar thought experiment included the idea that, if I&#39;m not going to use any external process I can possibly avoid and only use internal bash features, on the flip side of that, I will squeez bash for all it&#39;s worth, allow every bashism possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long ago I worked tech support for a company that supported some mainframe equipment.Eventually after some incidents they introduced “special instructions” for customers who we had to gather extra troubleshooting data for because of some complex issues they had.Then a few more customers had special instructions… and a few more.Eventually these involved things like “Send the account manager an email for each call, this customer is very sensitive.”After just a year EVERY account had special instructions.Many people oriented instructions were impossible to follow “Page Jim.”  Jim didn’t carry a pager anymore and when he did he would never respond so you couldn’t do step 2.Some involved gathering loads of memory dumps for issues long solved.  Others would have you follow program pointers to memory that didn’t exist so you would start over and over until you gave up and decided failing to do your job was preferable to losing your mind at 4am….Some instructions were multi page word documents expected to be read every time the customer called.  After reading it a dozen times a week it almost became impossible to notice if it had a slight change or not.One clever account manager trying to make sure tech support “noticed” his special instructions tried using a &lt;blink&gt; tag… entirely ignoring the issue that upon noticing the instructions they would be hard to read.   Thankfully the tag failed to work.As you can imagine eventually there were exasperated executive meetings about how nobody follows the special instructions.This is the world of protecting against corner cases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This (designing processes for rare edge cases) is endemic not only in people processes, but in technology-enabled business processes. I&#39;ve had numerous clients fall into the trap of trying to over-engineer their process flow with validations for every conceivable parameter and variation.This sort of implementation inevitably becomes a mountain of technical debt that overfits to the current process and reduces operational agility when the current process changes. At some point with business applications you have to trust your people to do the work and view the technology as something that enables that rather than necessarily constrains every dimension of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When protests were happening in India this is what Trudeau had to say:&#34;Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protesters. We believe in the process of dialogue. We’ve reached out through multiple means to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns. This is a moment for all of us to pull together,&#34;Justin Trudeau said.https://indianexpress.com/article/india/situation-is-concern..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Emergencies Act is the modern-day replacement to the War Measures Act. It allows the federal government to force companies to provide services, it can require public protests to end, and limit mobility rights by preventing people from moving to designating areas.&gt;&gt; The act also allows for the military to be used as police, but several sources said that is not under active consideration.Not a good look for Trudeau. This definitely looks like an authoritarian response to a loss of mandate. The protestors will dig in more, the response will become harsher, and the government will be in deeper trouble."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting way to approach it, my approach might be less technical, when someone comes to mind randomly, I just txt them with:  Hey, you just popped into my mind, I hope all is well with you and yours!

It&#39;s simple, lightweight, and you&#39;d be shocked how often the other person pings back.My completely un-scientific view is that most people think of others once in a while. Perhaps we&#39;re too busy to reach out, or the guilt of getting out of touch makes it hard to push through that resistance. I just push through it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some comments here claim that he is treating people not as friends. IMO these comments are not charitable a interpretation. While it is a plausible interpretation, I have strongly learned from HN to be charitable and optimistic when reading someone else&#39;s point of view. I know with topics like this that perspectives vary more wildly among people, so let me show you why I can be more optimistic in my interpretation.I think it&#39;s perfectly fine to separate emotions and reason like this. The reason: I am on the other side when it comes to managing my friends: I am not separating reason and emotion. Because of that, I am failing hard at staying in touch with people that I would like to stay in touch with (I am noticing it with certain friends of my as well). I am succeeding to stay in touch with a few people, but if I&#39;d have a system like this I might be able to stay in touch with many more people that I&#39;d like to stay in touch with anyway but for some unknown reason have some sort of blockade or friction.Other than that I think the interpretation is not charitable enough, I also have personal experience that it might be wrong. For example, I view the dating markets strictly from a market perspective that is heavily inspired by micro-economics and &#34;common sense&#34;. Initially, such a perspective is detached from emotion, but there are certain points where it is attached (e.g. with supply/demand questions like: &#34;what do I want/need from a partner&#34; or &#34;What can I offer? What do I want to offer? What do I need to offer?&#34;). Moreover, upon meeting people there is empathy, sympathy  and human intuition involved. Sometimes the emotions will be so strong that I have a compulsion towards meeting a person again (e.g. falling in love). Those emotions are not helping! Sometimes I feel the right amount that is also in line with my other needs and in other cases I don&#39;t feel enough about a certain person when I don&#39;t see them (but when I do see them, I am delighted to catch up).Management of personal life != how people are on a moment by moment basis in personal lifeI think by having a system like this, you can put Dunbar&#39;s number to shame."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think so-called ASCII-art is more in the spirit of Markdown.The nice thing about the original Markdown (modulo bugs) is that things are written the way one would write plaintext documents which are supposed to be easily read in a text editor.  So you don’t write bullet lists like this:- Bullet 1 - Bullet 2 - Bullet 3And hope that some post-processing will add linebreaks for you.  You write it like this:- Bullet 1- Bullet 2- Bullet 3Similarily there have been many tools that let you add so-called ASCII-art diagrams to Markdown documents.The spirit behind the kind of thing in the OP, on the other hand, is that one should get nicely formatted HTML from Markdown for the purpose of online consumption.  Which is a very different goal.So if I were to judge the syntax itself (since that is what matters most to the original spirit of Markdown.pl) I would say that it seems pretty decent.  Not as “declarative” (!) as ASCII-art, but most probably much easier to edit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m super excited for this!One thought though, on the syntax. Wouldn’t it be a bit odd if suddenly this line in a README.md:   ```js
   const foo = 1 + 1
   ```

Rendered as:   `2`

? Isn’t that kind of what we’re doing here with the mermaid source tag? That tag is for showing source code, no? Feels like there should be another tag for rendering it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Joplin, the Open source note-taking app¹, has Mermaid built-in.I use those a lot when keeping my notes on arcitectures, design patterns and software design. I prefer this, vastly, over Google Docs + draw.io.The only thing I dislike about Mermaid-in-Joplin is that the live-pre-render of the actual chart fails and shows an error whenever there is an error in the source of the diagram. Which makes sense. But is annoying because *when you are typing out the syntax, there always is an error untill you finish the class, object, some bracket or relation.¹https://joplinapp.org/ EDIT: I&#39;m not affiliated to joplin in any way. Just love it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an XPS, top of the line with full warranty/premium support. Horrible experience. They swapped many models to a shitty wifi card that caused bsod. I had to spend over 15+ hrs with support to finally convince them the fix was to swap the card to the original Intel and not doing another system restore or reformat.Then the battery. Oh the battery. The computer would randomly wake up from hibernate and drain the battery till it was dead. This also caused premature drain. Guess what? Dells batteries are rated for less cycles (half compared to apple) and this seemed to coincide with the end of my warranty period (time to buy a new one) but it doesn&#39;t even matter because their premium support only covers battery replacements for the first year!And get this! They only sell refurbished batteries. Just everything about this company is trash.The XPS is a nice line. It is very premium, but only skin deep"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The conflict between the market wanting systems that are (a) as small and light as possible and (b) as fast as possible means that modern systems are designed to have close integration between the platform and the OS to perform appropriate thermal management. If the OS doesn&#39;t indicate that it supports doing this, the hardware will run in a much more constrained mode. Apple can do this without too much trouble since they implement the whole stack, but it&#39;s more complicated in the PC space. Intel have a spec called Dynamic Power and Thermal Framework (DPTF), but the useful part of it is the adaptive thermal policy, and Intel refuse to publicly document it.I reverse engineered a chunk of this (https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/54923.html) and it got merged into Intel&#39;s Thermal Daemon (https://github.com/intel/thermal_daemon) which /should/ improve things, but it&#39;s complicated by this mechanism allowing for vendor-specific controls that are usually implemented by having a background service running under Windows that triggers them.There&#39;s multiple things that can be criticised here:
1) Intel pushing OEMs to adopt a technology that they (a) don&#39;t document and (b) don&#39;t write proper Linux support for
2) Canonical not making it clear that OEM certification only requires that the system work, not that it work as well as it does under Windows
3) Dell not figuring out a decent solution for this, even for systems that they nominally support Linux onDell could build hardware that doesn&#39;t rely on adaptive thermal management, but that hardware would either be bigger or slower than competitors&#39; hardware. Fixing this unilaterally is hard - we need an open spec that&#39;s implemented by both hardware vendors and integrated into mainstream Linux distributions. Given where we are, the easiest way to get there would be for Intel to publicly document DPTF."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a reminder: don&#39;t buy Dell, they have a history of ignoring issues and refusing to fix.The US needs to adopt EU-style consumer laws."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This last summer/fall really put things in perspective for me.  We did a major outdoor renovation at our house, which involved landscapers, plumbers, electricians, and carpenters.Every day these guys would show up at 8am and long sleeves and jeans and hard hats, work super hard, pee in a port-a-potty, and be exhausted by the end of the day.  They worked out in the 100 degree heat as well as the rain as the job got near the end.  Luckily the bosses were pretty cool and provided them with decent food for lunch and plenty of drinks (but I still offered them food and drinks too).I on the other hand was working at my desk in my air conditioned house in comfortable clothes.  A few times a day I&#39;d put on my flip-flops and wander around outside to check on their work, ask a few questions, and then head back in when it got too hot.And a couple of times the plumbing sprung a leak just as they were getting ready to leave, despite their best efforts to get all the risky work done early, and they they had to stay super late.  Once the plumber was here till midnight after arriving at 8am.I used to have thoughts about how it would be nice to have a job with totally spelled out requirements that end at 5pm and then you have the rest of the day off.  But no more.  I&#39;d much rather work at my comfy desk inside and deal with the occasional call at 9pm on a Saturday than deal with what they all went through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A professor of mathematics noticed that his kitchen sink at his home leaked. He called a plumber. The plumber came the next day and sealed a few screws, and everything was working as before.The professor was delighted. However, when the plumber gave him the bill a minute later, he was shocked.&#34;This is one-third of my monthly salary!&#34; he yelled.Well, all the same he paid it and then the plumber said to him, &#34;I understand your position as a professor. Why don&#39;t you come to our company and apply for a plumber position? You will earn three times as much as a professor. But remember, when you apply, tell them that you completed only seven elementary classes. They don&#39;t like educated people.&#34;So it happened. The professor got a job as a plumber and his life significantly improved. He just had to seal a screw or two occasionally, and his salary went up significantly.One day, the board of the plumbing company decided that every plumber had to go to evening classes to complete the eighth grade. So, our professor had to go there too. It just happened that the first class was math. The evening teacher, to check students&#39; knowledge, asked for a formula for the area of a circle. The person asked was the professor. He jumped to the board, and then he realized that he had forgotten the formula. He started to reason it, and he filled the white board with integrals, differentials, and other advanced formulas to conclude the result he forgot. As a result, he got &#34;minus pi times r square.&#34;He didn&#39;t like the minus, so he started all over again. He got the minus again. No matter how many times he tried, he always got a minus. He was frustrated. He gave the class a frightened look and saw all the plumbers whisper: &#34;Switch the limits of the integral!!&#34;"</p>

Someone may legitimately prefer the stresses of a trade to the stresses of working in software, and that&#39;s great for them. But it&#39;s not an objectively easier path: if it were, plumbers would be much less expensive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a multi-week long social engineering scam targeted at Thomas. Thomas has a Discord for a drone transportation startup, and the scammers proceeded to embed themselves in the community and provide valuable labor such as web design and graphics design in order to earn his trust.Thomas&#39;s wallet is public and advertised on Twitter via his ENS domain. He had $100M+ in aETH, a derivative token provided by Aave when you lend out your assets for interest. The aETH is redeemable for the underlying asset.The scammers created a fake NFT project associated with space and drones, and proceeded to give Thomas a free one, but asked that he stake it (or deposit it into a smart contract), to earn yield in the form of Armstrong ETH, a token they made up that had the same acronym as Aave&#39;s (aETH).The catch was that when he went to stake his NFT, they asked for an approval for spending aETH from his wallet. Approvals such as this are normal when interacting with smart contracts, since the contract has to be &#34;delegated&#34; responsibility over the tokens in order to move them. However, what wasn&#39;t normal is that the approval was actually for Aave ETH.If he had only looked at the front end of the scam site, it wasn&#39;t obvious what was going on. However, a quick glance at Etherscan revealed that he had signed off on an unlimited spend approval for Aave ETH.Luckily, he had done so on a fresh wallet and not his main wallet that has $100M in aETH. When the scammers tried to get him to stake a second NFT from his main account, he got suspicious and discovered the truth.This scam was specifically targeted at Thomas, and orchestrated over multiple weeks, for the specific assets in his primary wallet.Couple takeaways:- divide your assets across multiple wallets. New wallets are free. Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket.- use a hardware wallet or an audited battle tested smart contract such as Gnosis Safe for storing significant sums of money.- always verify your transactions- avoid associating your public identity with your main wallet / vault address- be careful, scammers are getting more creative and advanced in technique including standing up professional front end websites to give the appearance of legitimacy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can get behind cryptocurrency and stuff, but the idea that anyone can write a contract that says &#34;I get to do what I want with your money&#34; and then build their own custom, one of a kind UI with no way to limit what the user thinks the button does for you to sign such a transaction, it&#39;s got to be the biggest, most massive security hole I&#39;ve ever seen brushed off. You want me to put the title to my house on it? You want code to be law?This shit isn&#39;t ready for the mainstream, and some of these architectural decisions are indicative of engineers who are in over their heads (but that&#39;s almost all code nowadays, even mine).They build a mechanism that enables me, at the click of a button, to give away control of my fortune, and they designed the system so that anyone can design whatever interface they like to get you to sign any transaction they like. It&#39;s laughable. I&#39;m in disbelief. And this is web3? No thanks, I think I&#39;ll stick with bitcoin or whatever, keep it simple. At least I can tell what a bitcoin transaction does without having to learn a programming language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was an absolutely fascinating and chilling story.The thing that struck me about it is the scam didn&#39;t work for a few reasons:1. He typically had a practice of not using his main wallet for things like this.2. He got wary and actually read the smart contracts.This is a level of technical competence required that&#39;s going to mean most people have to offload this to a trusted intermediary. And then what&#39;s the point of all the decentralization ideology? Because we just re-invented banks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like a lot of people are missing the point of this one.PG/YC invest at the earliest stages. The information they need is pretty much:1. What are you doing?2. Do people like it?3. How big is the market?4. What are you/team like?Could you cover all of those in a formal business plan? Sure, but you can also do so in a short-form application that&#39;s 1/20 the length or in a 10-minute back-and-forth conversation.You don&#39;t have to ever view formal documents or financials to do that.That is PG&#39;s broader point, and isn&#39;t really that controversial IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to contrast this with PG&#39;s most recent essay &#34;Putting Ideas into Words&#34; where he argues that people who don&#39;t write don&#39;t have fully formed ideas. What else is a business plan besides a thoughtful writeup? I think it would give me a good idea into how a person thinks.[1] http://paulgraham.com/words.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blind person here, happy to answer any questions. I&#39;m speaking from the perspective of someone born blind, so whatever ends up working well for me might not work as well for someone just losing their sight, though I tried to take that fact into account.The most immediate suggestions that come to mind are:1. Learn to use a screen reader. You don&#39;t need an expensive one. NVDA on Windows, Voice Over on the Mac and Orca on Linux are the way to go. NVDA is probably the least quirky and easiest to find resources for. I&#39;d recommend against Orca, while it can be used, we all know how tricky Linux on the desktop can get, and throwing a screen reader into the mix doesn&#39;t help.2. Forget about the mouse. Screen reader users use the keyboard exclusively. Try disabling the screen too, many sighted users who practice with a screen reader end up relying on what they can see, which makes things more difficult.3. Accept that inaccessibility is a fact of life, and it has to be worked around. Not all tools are accessible, and some are more accessible than others. If you&#39;re looking for an accessible IDE, Vs Code is great and constantly improving. Emacspeak exists, but I don&#39;t actually know anyone who uses it, and I know quite a few blind people in tech. Some things that you&#39;re now doing through a GUI are best done via the command line, Git is a good example. Programming tools usually aren&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s everything else that causes issues. Slack and Zoom work great, for example, but many smaller collaboration tools don&#39;t.4. Not all areas of programming are equally accessible. I can&#39;t imagine a blind dev working exclusively on the front end, where there&#39;s a lot of CSS involved, and where you have to look at Figma designs and debug issues solely based on screenshots. Backend stuff is much more accessible, same with lower-level systems programming. Dev Ops is very much a mixed bag.I&#39;m happy to answer any further questions either here or via email, my HN username at gmail dot com."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Outside of the dev needs take a look at bemyeyes.com, it allows a person with vision problems to video call a volunteer to help answer questions. I&#39;ve helped people read labels, sort boxes of chocolate for Christmas presents and help a person find the login dialog after they lost track ofwhere it was. Each call only took a minute or two. Highly recommended to volunteer, only takes a minute to help and you don&#39;t have to answer the call if you are unavailable, it just hops to another volunteer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this is the end of &#34;sending customer data to the us&#34;.
Quite impressive how fast the US-politics can burn billions in $, endanger the technological lead and build a massive opportunity for Europe!I, as a European could not be happier about this, from a economic standpoint.Hope you guys over there are not drifting to a surveillance dystopian."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"US folks who are interested in writing their Senators can find information at https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy...FWIW, I sent the email below (largely cribbed from the EFF).Dear :I am a constituent.  I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act, S.3538.  It does not strike a reasonable balance between fighting crimes and the rights of users to privacy and encryption.The bill empowers every state or territory to create sweeping new Internet regulations, by stripping away the legal protections for websites and apps in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The states will be allowed to pass whatever law they want to hold private companies liable, as long as they somehow relate their new rules to online child abuse.The bill’s sponsors have stated that EARN IT will pressure Internet companies to do widespread scanning of user messages and photos. This scanning is incompatible with strong encryption.  Consequently, the act allows states to pass laws that will punish companies when they deploy end-to-end encryption, or offer other encrypted services. This includes messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage, as well as web hosts like Amazon Web Services.The sponsors have falsely claimed that the act would protect children. But abusive images are already highly illegal under federal law. Any Internet platforms that knows about child sexual abuse material being distributed or received are required to take action on it, and can be severely prosecuted if they do not.EARN IT would lead to penalties for people and companies that use encryption.  The harm done by this will fall on vulnerable people. Once we allow encryption to be compromised in order to scan for one thing, authoritarian regimes will demand the same capabilities to track information shared by activists and journalists. Another example is that people subject to domestic abuse, including children, won’t have secure channels of communication to report and reach out for trusted help.Once again, I urge you to oppose the EARN IT act.Thank you,"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me SO_REUSEPORT was only a solution to be able to immediately reuse a port when a process crashed in some odd way and the OS was not releasing the port immediately.When I read that multiple processes can use the port it finally made sense to me how nginx is able to spawn so many workers. If they are listening to port 80 or 443 with SO_REUSEPORT, each worker would get a new client in a round robin fashion, effectively spreading the workload without depending on the main parent process to pipe the data to them (and back to the client), which is how I thought that it was working.The funny thing about this submission was that when I read the title I somehow thought I was reading it on Stack Overflow and was expecting a noob asking this question and didn&#39;t know what kind of answers I was about to be confronted with and if I should get excited to see a really good one.Then, while in the article, I liked how it started to raise so many issues, fanning out into these special cases which really made it a valid question to ask what it does mean to listen to a port, how complicated it can become.Sadly the article does not go into any detail, like showing snippets of C code from the networking stack and explaining how it is really working, how each requirement (or kluge, for that matter) is being satisfied, but it&#39;s OK, it&#39;s an article which touches the subject in an enticing enough way while having an excuse to not deep-dive into the details by keeping it in the form of a dialog between two students.I liked it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What is strange about Discord is this great discrepancy between the ones that love it and the ones that hate it. If I were to guess on the reason of why that might be it would be that Discord is probably really good for the people that are constantly on it, and don&#39;t really miss any communication going in. These people have probably been there for some time so they don&#39;t feel the problem of not knowing where the past information is, because they were there when that information was communicated and therefore never need to look back at it. These people will (obviously) recommend using Discord, since it works so well for them!The problem arises when you have people that just now-and-then hop into the Discord. These people are not in the &#34;clique&#34; so they don&#39;t feel comfortable talking/discussing too much in the channels, and they also really have no clue where to go for any of the lost information these super users don&#39;t even think about. This is probably why I never really use Discord except for voice, since I just don&#39;t get anything at all from reading an endless chat log. It&#39;s like being someone stepping in to a tight knit friend group with a long history and no way of looking into it.Discord will most likely have to figure out how they can keep it so that it works for these super users, but somehow make the information organized for people that aren&#39;t hard core community members.Edit: Wrote &#34;clique&#34; wrong"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Endless scrolling is a black hole for information. And the hawking radiation that comes out is keyboard diarrhea.If I were trying to subtly encourage pounding out content free crap, I would probably want people to use difficult to search, non paginated scroll feeds as much as possible.Discord might be a black hole, but Discourse has some of the same properties. Facebook is the same way.Anything that funnels people into multi-thousand post individual pages is going to lose information.Old proboards forums, github issues, and wikis don&#39;t have this problem.  Content is in smaller blocks that can be linked to easily, and there is a strong culture of keeping topics focused.  You don&#39;t have multiple unrelated conversations in one place.You can jump to the end or beginning of a thread when quickly skimming to see if it&#39;s relevant.And you can see all threads in a given time period pretty easily with pagination, when you want to understand the larger picture at a point and time.These are all things that are useful both for a sense of community and for technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a strong believer in Zulip with respect to a perfect mix between instant messaging and actually retaining information- functionality for a public export (can also restrict to specific channels), .e.g. https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/- in addition to the above, they are working on a guest mode, so you can read the discussions without logging in -- hopefully that would make it possible to index without setting up a separate archive hosting https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13172- messages/threads have proper meaningful URLs (unlike random obfuscated UUIDs like in Discord)- you can easily open things in new tabs -- unlike Discord, where search pane takes like 10% of the screen, or Slack where once you clicked on search result, you lose the context about the remaining results- you can login with Github (so no need to register for many people, at least for programming-related projects)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there any word about when sci hub is going to start adding new articles again? It&#39;s currently only useful as an archive of old research articles. New papers from the last year are not available. I never understood the rationale for stopping new content, though I believe it had some relation to some court case in India...but I don&#39;t understand why that was a reason to stop adding articles, and why it hasn&#39;t been restarted yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The publishers now encode their papers with individual identifiers, that generationP calls UUIDs on all pdf&#39;s. That means they can trace it back to the institution(and perhaps the actual prof?) They have then sent nastygrams to threaten them with fees or loss of access to the institution - potentially serious punishment.
What is needed is a way to run the papers through an OCR recognition program to create renewed text and to further process to randomly vary a large number of adjacent letter spacings. (this is called &#39;micro kerning&#39; and it allowed a second order of unique document recognition where the document is scanned by the journal to look for these fractional kerning gaps in the letter spacing which can lead back to the institution). I suppose a program flow could be made to OCR + random micro kerning changes - it would take time, but once set up it would be a rapid computer based document flow process. Photos/charts could be sanitised as well, but legends etc on them would also need OCR and micro kerning adjustments. With 25 words of text, each with 6 letters, micro kerning can easily create 10,000 unique ID&#39;s, easily enough to cope with all subscribed institutions - and that is on one chart/photo.
I suspect the subscribing institutions have acted with firm words to their profs and grad students to block this. This can easily be told to us if a few people in assorted institutions let us know if they have been read firm words about this?I am not sure how Sci-hub can get past this, unless they get a good Indian court ruling and can use Indian friends to scan printed copies of journals - if they exist in this online age?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting how sci-hub&#39;s papers on medicine dwarf those in many other fields like comp-sci, math, and physics.  I wonder if that reflects the number of papers in those fields, or if sci-hub just has a non-representative sample.  If the latter, why?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Prior discussion of this incident (and the $2M bounty) here on Hacker News:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30289240My (I&#39;m the hacker) article / post-mortem this blog post is referring to:https://www.saurik.com/optimism.htmlAt the time of this last getting traction a few days ago, some people were sad that the title of my article and the discussion that resulted focused more on the bug instead of the bounty (which my article gets into near the end as part of some high-level thoughts on ethics), which is maybe why I am suddenly seeing this appear here again this morning (as this news article is instead focussing on the bounty angle)?FWIW, the $2M bounty--which was actually listed as $2,000,042 (as they wanted it to sort higher on the list at Immenufi, lol)--was potentially (none of us realized this at the time I &#34;won&#34;, and I am honestly still not 100% sure of it now, though I haven&#39;t yet come across any counter-examples) the largest single bug bounty payout ever (...though, by only $42 ;P)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just any white hat hacker, it&#39;s saurik who was behind the original jailbreaking tools for iOS and the creator of Cydia, the unofficial app store back then. He is also now the &#34;CTO&#34; (if the term applies) of a well-known blockchain-based VPN, Orchid.Edit: He has a great write-up about the vulnerability and its discovery on his blog:https://www.saurik.com/optimism.html(which was on HN a couple days ago)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember walking down the main street in my hometown on my way to drink at a bar and seeing saurik and some friends at a bars all with their laptops out and hacking on something.  What caught my eye was a terminal open and a Vim session.  I walked up and we all chatted for a bit.  Back in the day you didn&#39;t run into that very often where we lived so it was pretty cool to see.  That boosted my conviction for my choice of IDE and I started bringing my laptop out to the bars in the evenings as well.  Years later my friend and I built a business and pretty much all the code was written in the evenings at one of those bars.  You can be social and code at the same time it turns out, and coding prevented me from drinking too much while I was out.  No real morale to the story, just an anecdote I wanted to share.  That said, congrats on the bounty saurik!"</p>

Actually the HTTP/2 TCP head-of-line issue and all the workarounds for that probably make it harder to scale without technical debt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SSEs are one of the standard push mechanisms in JMAP [1], and they&#39;re part of what make the Fastmail UI so fast. They&#39;re straightforward to implement, for both server and client, and the only thing I don&#39;t like about them is that Firefox dev tools make them totally impossible to debug.1. https://jmap.io/spec-core.html#event-source"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We use SSE for our APIs Server Events feature https://docs.servicestack.net/server-events with C#, JS/TypeScript and Java high-level clients.It&#39;s a beautifully simple &amp; elegant lightweight push events option that works over standard HTTP, the main gotcha for maintaining long-lived connections is that server/clients should implement their own heartbeat to be able to detect &amp; auto reconnect failed connections which was the only reliable way we&#39;ve found to detect &amp; resolve broken connections."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I grew up in Egypt, my dad is from a town on the Suez Canal called Ismailia, famous for its mangoes. We would wait the whole year for mango season (August/September). As kids, our clothes would all get mango stains. Our parents would make us take our shirts off before we eat them to avoid that.I moved to the US, and I haven&#39;t had a good mango here. When friends visit Egypt, I tell them to get mangoes (in season, around September), especially a variety known as Eweis. They get obsessed. I&#39;ve never figured out why the US just doesn&#39;t have good mangoes, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re hard to grow locally or ship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For growing mango from seed, or really anything from seed, you cannot beat a small plastic container (like what cottage cheese, sour cream, or green yogurt might come in) filled halfway with coconut coir. It&#39;s absolutely the best medium for germinating seed. Fill halfway with coir and water once a week. Coconut coir keeps water evenly distributed and I&#39;ve never had a seed or seedling mold over using it.I personally use 2 lb greek yogurt (or soup, as in from Costco) containers because the extra height also lets me keep the seed in there longer and develop initial root structure. That&#39;s incredibly helpful for transferring to pots, and a little coconut coir in the soul doesn&#39;t hurt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want a solar powered time lapse camera that takes a photo around noon every day, saves to SD card.Would be great for plant time lapses.I haven&#39;t been able to find anyone who&#39;s done this already.   It seems like there are trail cams and similar that have all the parts, so this should be possible to manufacture for a price point of around $50, and I think it would be an amazing product: I bet every gardening enthusiast would want one.Anyone know of a sku that already exists?  I Google it a couple times a year, still haven&#39;t found it.  Anyone want to get this made, maybe send me one as thanks, and you keep all the profits you reap? :-D.  I really just want this to exist.(Happy to 3d model prototype housings to help! But I don&#39;t know EE.  Chris at mckoss dot com)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"COVID and the autoimmune response to it damages the endothelial layer of your cardiovascular systems. https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.316101
and
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00819-6The big question is how quickly and completely can that layer restore itself? If damage accumulates over time and people are catching new variants every 3-4 months it is only a matter of time before mortality from cardiovascular issues in COVID negative formerly infected people goes much higher and much younger. We need studies on the cardiovascular recovery pace after COVID damage in different age groups, and after repeat COVID diagnosis from different variants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many of the &#34;Covid-19 increases risk of XYZ&#34; popular media articles lack baseline comparisons to other virus infections. (Disclaimer: Yes, we know Covid-19 isn&#39;t the flu, and it&#39;s more deadly.) My point is: how much does heart-disease risk increase post-Covid compared to say post-Influenza? Is it comparable or is the risk magnitudes larger than with other virus infections? This is an important benchmark, I understand scientific journals don&#39;t cater to laypeople but popular media does.From CDC website: &#34;Studies have shown that flu illness is associated with an increase in heart attacks and stroke. A 2018 study found that the risk of having a heart attack was 6 times higher within a week of a confirmed flu infection.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I&#39;m reading Figure 5 right in the original paper*, it looks like the biggest cardiac impact is on people who were hospitalized or went to the ICU for covid, and the effect on people who were not hospitalized is present but relatively small. Am I interpreting the data correctly?* https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01689-3 h/t to @greenyoda for posting elsewhere in this thread."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my mind, state is the real enemy impacting: comprehension, 
brittleness towards making changes, and the surface area exposed to potential bugs. OOP as frequently implemented, while claiming to encapsulate state, ends up creating so much more.In accordance with this view, I think project architecture should be approached with an emphasis around how much state is necessary for it to run. This is why simulations like say someone making a game or simcity with like relatively independent entities that map to something in real life use OOP. If you&#39;re writing a service doing requests, you want as minimal state as possible. Singletons are state. Initialized/non-static objects are state. The smaller amount you have the easier it is to reason about the system.As I write this however, I worry a little that my view is overly simplistic, or maybe applicable only to domains that I have worked in. If anyone wouldn&#39;t mind poking holes in this argument or offering examples I would appreciate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not read the article but I&#39;ve seen other blog posts on the subject.
The issue with &#34;OOP is bad&#34; is that OOP means different things to different people.Abstract Data Types are sort of a subset of OOP and are massively useful, I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to expose the internal implementation of a data structure most of the time. Any sort of plugin system works in an OO matter. It is a useful tool, no question.Even things like Actors like in Erlang (which are much closer to the Alan Kay style OO) are massively useful in a distributed setting where state is naturally distributed.Where you get into trouble is when you go the whole &#34;lets model a taxonomy of the world&#34; style with inheritance hierarchies or go ham on design patterns, layers upon layers of abstraction and other nonsense like that.The saddest thing about the &#34;object–relational impedance mismatch&#34; is that the focus went totally to the wrong side. The relational model is a much nicer way to model relations than a graph of objects (that&#39;s the whole point after all). SQL sucks but that&#39;s a separate issue, Entity Component Systems are a form of relational modeling for example and work really well, or even better Datalog."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My issue with OOP is: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.I don&#39;t take issue with the authors, with their insights, or anything related to the content of the book. It&#39;s that the book exists at all: it&#39;s a book filled with solutions to imaginary problems.When using a procedural language the first thing you do is start implementing a solution. When using OOP, you first have to solve the imaginary problems created by OOP, only then can you start down the path of typing out a solution.It&#39;s significantly more difficult to refactor OOP (even with great tools) than it is procedural.If you could spend 20% less brain power, possibly 40% fewer keystrokes to describe the exact same solution, why wouldn&#39;t you?"</p>
