Second, just because you can, doesn&#39;t mean you should :)I think it&#39;s art, so be careful about adding more.  The minimalism is beautiful.  Just a bunch of moving lights, but they capture the feel of night driving! If you add everything mentioned as upgrades, it will be a simulation.  An impressive engineering feat, but (I think) less as a work of art.I wonder, what does someone who&#39;s never ridden/driven in a car at night &#39;feel&#39; when they see this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of a passion project I started in high school that went completely viral and took on a life of its own. Wrote a small script for my friends to check their AP scores a few days early. Required high schoolers giving clear text access to their entire CollegeBoard account so I could log on and scrape their scores. Somehow it got posted to Reddit and from that year on, grew wildly. Got to almost 2 million students checking their score in its peak year. It was immensely fun while it lasted (ran for about 7 years) and honestly I miss the thrill of it. CollegeBoard now releases all scores on the same day so the site is pretty much useless now. Definitely always looking to chase the thrill of that score release day again though.Congrats on a successful end to a fun high school project! Stories like this are always fun to read."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Epic stuff, and I think this experience may well be more valuable than the homework you avoided. Basically you did harder homework in order to avoid easier homework.The problem is letting other people use it; of course it&#39;s nice to help people, and it&#39;s altruistic to do so for free, but some of those people might actually need this homework to learn, and you may have deprived them of that. (Although I also think watching a video and doing some multiple choice questions is the laziest low-effort homework assignment there is, and the damage may not have been all that big.) But you used logic and programming to work around a math problem, which are roughly in the same field, so I think that&#39;s fair.A slightly similar situation: my previous job was at a bank, and banks over here are bound by all sorts of ethics and rules, and are required to regularly train all their employees in balancing the interests of customers, society, and the bank. This bank did that by gamifying it: we had an app where we had to answer all sorts of ethical questions and make sure our score in the app was over 70% at the end of every month.A coworker used our testing framework to access the app, answer questions randomly like you did, and store the correct answer to use next time. It apparently worked very well, but using tech to avoid ethics questions is quite a different issue than yours. (He shared it with me when he left, and I tried it, but it didn&#39;t work for me.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was in university, I scraped an internal job postings site for students to find internships. The site was terrible- each job description would load in a pop-up window controlled by Javascript, and loading a second description would override the first. It was also really slow and had limited filtering. My version could load job descriptions in new tabs, presented the table on a single page, and you could mark jobs that you weren&#39;t interested in or had already applied to.The university didn&#39;t take kindly to that. They accused me of trying to take down the co-op system and threatened to sue me for copyright infringement. Since I linked into their system for job descriptions, I was able to show that the data I actually had (company, title, location) wasn&#39;t creative work and therefore not copyrightable. I also had some friends in the university faculty and staff who spoke up for me, since I had reported security vulnerabilities in the past, indicating that I wasn&#39;t acting with malicious intent. In the end, I just had to take a business ethics course, which I probably would have taken anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let&#39;s see..
Software I am thankful for.. there is a fair amount of such.Anki - Software, that helped me build up habit, and made learning language an easier taskEmacs - Wonderful text editor, made interacting with system a bliss.Nix/NixOS - Distro, that made updates a painless, and fearless task. I love it.ZFS - Filesystem that I love, for it has many wonderful features, and they all just work. (Also cute compression)Wine + DXVK/VKD3D - Thanks to this, I was able to completely drop windows partition, and go full Linux.LaTeX - Thanks to it, I could have cute workflow for writing documents (And yesterday, wrote CV with its&#39; help :D)Calibre - Man.. what a behemot of book software. Makes anything ebook related painlessCommon Lisp(SBCL) and Haskell(GHC) - Very interesting 
languages, with very wonderful features. I love them both.Cool retro term - For playing roguelikes, lets me experience them in very retro, retro way.Obviously, ublock origin, makes browsing web not a nightmare.Aseprite - wonderful pixelart software.There is more, but... I will stop there, to make the comment.. not too long."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fish shell, makes using the shell feel almost painless.Hammerspoon, I use it to automatically switch audio devices based on context, so every call uses the best microphone currently available, window management via keystrokes, limiting media keys to Spotify, tons of other things. Indispensable.Arduino, I don&#39;t think I would be able to tinker with microcontrollers as much if I had to write C and use obscure toolchains directly.Solvespace, a limited but usable free CAD for simple parts to be 3d printed. Wish there was a real contender to the commercial ones though, or a free tier that doesn&#39;t smell like it&#39;s going away any time. Still very thankful that SolveSpace exists.The Scala 3 compiler and the VSCode plugin for v3. Absolutely love the language and the experience is so much better than with IntelliJ, haven&#39;t had as much fun writing code in ages.This will be a bit controversial, but Kubernetes, because if people use it via GKE, EKS etc. then I won&#39;t have to learn their organically grown solution to the same dozen-or-so operations problems, and I have yet to see one that isn&#39;t a hot mess in some way or other. Also anything running on top of Kubernetes won&#39;t be built the very old-fashioned vi-edits-on-server way, great for sanity.Various modern messenger apps (Telegram, Whatsapp, Instagram&#39;s direct messages, ...) because I would hear a lot less from some highly cherished and very non-technical people in my life without these incredibly slick and fun and convenient apps. As one who&#39;s old enough to remember being dependent on landlines and payphones and letters, this still feels like a miracle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Python - It (still) makes writing software enjoyable for me.Type annotations: Started using them this year and it allows my editor to give me all sorts of hints about things I&#39;m doing wrong.Typer / Click: I&#39;ve been writing a bunch of CLIs this year and Typer and Click make this really fun.Wezterm: Went all in on this terminal 3-4 months ago and it&#39;s really great!  In particular I like the &#34;copy mode&#34; features and it&#39;s &#34;tmux+mosh&#34; abilities.LunarVim: Been using it for ~9 months, and it gives me all the advanced developer features I felt like I was missing in my various attempts at a custom vim setup, without the pain.sway / i3wm: On my 4th year using it and it just fits my workflow so well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I keep imagining the fantasy scenario where some day I stumble on a software download or repo or something. Nothing special, no fanfare, just a random piece of code to do some random task.Inside the repo or zip, is a simple text manifest file. The file has some bog standard readme stuff and then lists all the files and their hashes, you know, so you can check nothing&#39;s corrupted whatnot.But in that list of files, is a line item for the manifest file itself and along with its own hash!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They&#39;re right, recently I&#39;ve installed some Windows update for my parents and I had to reject like 5 suggested changes - installing Office trial, switching default browser to Edge yet again, and more.But this goes way beyond the browsers - I&#39;ve never explicitly installed Keychain on my iphone and yet it shows as an option next to 1password every time I fill in a password field. Google calendar asks me to install an app every time I open a web version on my phone, my work laptop has 1 active notification in system settings for a year because I didn&#39;t enable iCloud backup.I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the solution here. I stick to the apps I use because I know what I&#39;m doing, but so many users will just click &#34;yes&#34; when shown a pop-up. On the other hand, the built-in integrations provide value (e.g. it&#39;s better that people use and save random passwords in Keychain than using the same one everywhere). I feel it&#39;s always a cat-and-mouse game where the big tech is punished after they&#39;ve already gained a lot, so they win anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Without commenting on the claims, it&#39;s interesting to consider how times have changed. Microsoft originally lost an antitrust lawsuit [1] over little more than tying Internet Explorer into their OS and not readily including alternatives. They not only lost that case, but the initial judgement was that the company was to be broken up.Microsoft started spending dramatically more money on &#34;lobbying&#34; following that.[1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Cor...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the next frontiers as a barrier to browser switching will be &#34;software&#34;-backed WebAuthn/FIDO2/&#34;passkeys&#34;.If you look at the APIs available on MacOS/iOS at present [0], and how WebAuthn works, you need to &#34;trust&#34; the client-side software to correctly identify the site origin (i.e. protocol, domain, port) and pass it to a physical security key. In the case of a software token, you need to restrict which app(s) can pass this information through to the system carrying out authentication.The end result right now, as I can see it, is that if you sign up to a website using a &#34;passkey&#34; via Safari (for example), there is no real supported workflow that isn&#39;t site-specific, for migrating to a new browser - you are effectively beholden to Apple&#39;s keychain for getting you back into that site.If you want to enrol a new device (say an Android phone using its own software implementation of WebAuthn), you would need to find a way to sign into your old account (which requires your MacOS/iOS passkey to log in), then enrol your Android device (which is a separate physical device). You&#39;ll likely get stuck here.An expert user could add a physical FIDO2 token to their account from the old device (Safari), and use that as the authenticator to log in on the new device, but this is significant friction for a non-technical user.While moving users away from passwords might make sense, I do think we&#39;ll see these &#34;passwordless&#34; authentication mechanisms become the next major point of friction in user browser choice. Even if you can implement WebAuthn in your rival browser, unless you get access to the system key store, you won&#39;t be able to let users sign in. That will prevent them switching.[0] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think you partly may just be biased by happening to notice ads more if they fit the topic you sent to your wife or being lenient in deciding if ads meet the categorization. And if you dwell on an ad because it seems to match, you may get more similar ads.Here is how I think you could design a more robust (but less fun) experiment:- Come up with a bunch of topics, write them down on slips of paper, put the paper into a hat- Each Monday, draw three topics from the hat, send some WhatsApp messages about the first, Messenger messages about the second, and don’t discuss the third. Don’t put the topics back in the hat.- If you see any ads relating to one of the topics, screenshot them and save screenshots to eg your computer with a bit of the topic- Separately, record which topic went to which platform- After doing this for a while, go through the screenshots and (each of you and your wife or ideally other people) give a rating for how well the ad matches the topic. To avoid bias, you shouldn’t know which app saw the topic.- Now work out average ratings / the distribution across the three products (WhatsApp vs Messenger vs none) and compare"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(wrt some comments in this thread)Is it so hard to believe that Meta is snooping on WhatsApp conversations? Meta, a company of unprecedented size that was built over monetizing your private data? A company who&#39;s been caught in plenty of scandals (like Cambridge Analytic) about this exact sort of thing (violating their users&#39; privacy)?Someone from this community, which generally means educated, tech-literate and sensitive to these topics shares a perfectly plausible observation, of something that has been experienced as well by plenty of other folks, me included; and then some people come and try to make up the most convoluted explanations (candy boxes from Kazakhstan just happened to be trending that specific day, nothing to see here, move along!) to this phenomena and try to shift the blame away from Meta. Why do you do this? Are you Meta employees? A PR agency they hired?It&#39;s just baffling. Apparently some people DO want to be abused.Plot twist: we all get ads about candy boxes from KZ now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has actually worked on end to end encryption at Meta, I can tell you I am not aware of anything where the company reads your WhatsApp messages - either in transit or device. The company takes fairly serious measures to ensure it cannot even accidentally infer such contents.I don&#39;t know what is happening in this specific case. Perhaps the ads came from some other similar search queries. Perhaps they came from the keyboard intercepting what was typed. Or perhaps something else that I can&#39;t think of. But I&#39;m nearly certain it did not come from meta intercepting the contents of your messages.It&#39;s hard to convince people at this point because many have lost trust in Meta as a company, and I understand that. But I still find it stunning that so many people are making so many false claims without any actual knowledge to back it up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really happy that Gorhill has listened to feedback on the branding and explanation of this, and added back in the ability to &#34;opt in&#34; to extended permissions on individual sites. Thank you for your work, and I&#39;m sorry if my comments in the preview HN thread came off as overly hostile, because given the original comments you made about MV3, I couldn&#39;t imagine this sort of outcome. I hope that you or someone else still works to release an MV3-compatible &#34;Full site permissions&#34; version of uBlock as well, since I think there are a lot of potential options for improvement by using declarativeNetRequestFeedback, and it&#39;s certainly more convenient to not have to opt-in. And I&#39;m still worried that without an MV3-compatible version of full uBlock Origin, users are still going to assume that &#34;MV3 means that ad blockers are broken&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is everyone else&#39;s MV3 upgrade going?I have 3 extensions and each one has multiple feature-breaking changes that will take hundreds of hours to implement less than ideal work arounds.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, I understand why Apple doesn&#39;t pull FB/IG/WA/Uber/etc but as a smaller developer it&#39;s incredibly frustrating to have the full rules applied to me but not the big players.A week or two ago I had to fight with app review over some functionality that was behind a login screen (they thought it should be public, I disagreed) and for my pre-permission-request screens (you know, the screen almost every app shows before firing the system prompt). Turns out you can have that screen but you can&#39;t ask a question on that screen or offer a way to dismiss and not get the system dialog. That was news to me since I had seen countless &#34;Do you want to enable push notifications (yes|no)?&#34; screens in top apps but that rule has changed and no longer allows you to pre-ask. I complied but the very next day I opened an app from a billion dollar company and I got a pre-ask that I was able to dismiss without popping the system dialog. wtf...Why am I expected to bend over backwards for app review when these serial abusers get a free pass (no ban AND they can do things smaller apps get slapped down for)?I know the answer is &#34;money&#34; but I fucking hate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A little while back I recall some pundit describing Facebook as believing that this kind of data was theirs. Not “theirs for the taking”, but literally if they could find a way to obtain it, they considered it their right to have it. Like it was baked into the culture of the company. The more I read about Facebook’s practices, the more it rings true."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If an app needs a webview, it should always strive to open that view in an embedded Safari webview (called an SFSafariViewController) or link to the view in the user&#39;s own choice of browser. 
The app is prevented from seeing ‘inside’ this view.Sometimes an app needs to control some aspect of the external view - for instance listen to some Js event, or inject authorization - and this can be for totally legitimate reasons in the flow of the app. Then the application needs to use another type of embedded webview called a WKWebView, which by definition allows the app to see into the user&#39;s interactions in the embedded browser.Most developers and apps use these for totally necessary reasons - but Facebook is deviously abusing this functionality.Some of the posters in this thread are blaming Apple for Facebook&#39;s evil behavior, but a lot of totally legitimate functionality that needs this type of app/browser communication would be impossible without the ability to enable it for genuine and well-founded reasons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Teams doesn&#39;t have to be good to succeed. It just has to exist. It&#39;s not even very important how good it is. Given it exists, IT will make everyone use it on Microsoft&#39;s behalf regardless of how bad it is.Or another way to look at it is that the real customers for Teams are IT departments. It makes their lives easier because they don&#39;t have to do anything and it meets all the compliance requirements they are supposed to enforce.Which in turn reflects that the real customers of IT are regulators and auditors. Nobody with decision making power actually cares whether any of the software in use in enterprises works well or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long ago Microsoft had MSN Messenger, which was one of the leading messaging apps. It worked well, and many &#39;normal&#39; users were using it. Then Microsoft dissolved the team behind it and screwed up the product so bad with bloatware and ads that everyone moved to WhatsApp (except in the US where people went back to texting).Then Microsoft came out with Communicator, renamed it to Lync, which was a corporate messenger/meeting software. It used its own server, that could federate outside. It worked very well. They added LiveMeeting as a separate app for meetings, built on the same protocols. Our company used it with the &#34;roundtable&#34; camera from 2008, and it all worked amazingly well. We had meetings with people joining in from home and other offices over the internet using inexpensive webcams, 15 years ago.Then they bought Skype and it went downhill from there. I don&#39;t know what happened, but they took a lot of time integrating technologies from Skype (peer-to-peer) with their own tech (which was more telecom/server based) and tried competing with ever-changing perceived competitors by copying parts of their features and UI, without ever making any feature really good. They integrated everything into a single program, Skype for Business, now renamed Teams, and made it bloated and obnoxious. Just try to get it to not start at login... It&#39;s like MSN all over again.I think the Communicator/LiveMeeting software combo they had 15 years ago would still (conceptually) do pretty well as messenger/meeting software now, when modernized. It was much less intrusive and behaved like nice software that you actually wanted to use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My 2 cents of venting on this sorry excuse of software- Backtick formatting in a chat post only works after typing the closing backtick, deleting it, re-typing it- Text copied from a conversation is polluted with names and time stamps. &#34;I really want this feature&#34; said nobody ever- The mute/unmute button is hard to find, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever attended a Teams meeting without someone struggling with this. Teams should change its name to &#34;You&#39;re on mute&#34;- Multiple windows, I never know which is the &#39;main&#39; window, which is the meeting window, where are they, which has focus- Too hard to know which chat you&#39;re replying to, who is in it- Updates in chats are not consistently acknowledged, you have to change focus, and back again. Even then the &#34;Activity&#34; tab still shows unread items that I have read- Random crashing- Random communication freezes, everyone else is chatting, I don&#39;t see any updates nor notification of any problems until I restart the app- &#34;Reply&#34; is sometimes in the chat context menu, sometimes not.- Media handling is inconsistent, sometimes I can&#39;t paste photos, sometimes I can- The size of the text chat column in a meeting cannot be changed and is very narrow, forcing you to find the same chat in the &#39;main&#39; window"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A summary of the original findings by the European Commission (1):&#34;By decision of 18 July 2018, the Commission fined Google for having abused its dominant position by imposing anticompetitive contractual restrictions on manufacturers of mobile devices and on mobile network operators, in some cases since 1 January 2011. Three types of restriction were identified:1. those contained in ‘distribution agreements’, requiring manufacturers of mobile devices to pre-install the general search (Google Search) and (Chrome) browser apps in order to be able to obtain a licence from Google to use its app store (Play Store);2. those contained in ‘anti-fragmentation agreements’, under which the operating licences necessary for the pre-installation of the Google Search and Play Store apps could be obtained by mobile device manufacturers only if they undertook not to sell devices running versions of the Android operating system not approved by Google;3. those contained in ‘revenue share agreements’, under which the grant of a share of Google’s advertising revenue to the manufacturers of mobile devices and the mobile network operators concerned was subject to their undertaking not to pre-install a competing general search service on a predefined portfolio of devices.&#34;1: https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/p1_3862705/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool. The EU does have its [many!] faults. But they have a pretty good track record when it comes to consumer rights and consumer choice. Next up I&#39;d like to see them do the same for the plethora of incompatible cordless power-tool systems out there as they did with insisting all mobile phones standardise on a USB connector."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fallout from this should be interesting. This fine is a substantial part (roughly 25%!) of Google&#39;s overall revenue from the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, Africa), of which the EU is probably like 90%, at least, of the total, so it&#39;s probably toing the line of actually making the EU unprofitable to Google considering the costs of future compliance to avoid being fined again. Worse: this was not as steep as the fine could have been, they could&#39;ve fined them about double this amount under current regulations, but chose not to. Probably because that would have pushed Google&#39;s EU operations into the red for sure and made the decision easy for them.To be sure the company won&#39;t be in trouble financially, their global revenue can cover the fine, but that doesn&#39;t stop the EU from potentially being a net loss for the company going forward. Abandoning the EU would be a drastic step, though. It&#39;s going to be interesting to see how they adapt to this. Another fine on this scale and I think they will pull out."</p>

Seems like we&#39;ve been building toward this, the interactivity of the internet was the paradigm shift (to use a 90&#39;s term). EDIT: I realize it isn&#39;t news messing with youths&#39; self-esteem (well, in some cases it is), but it is related in that the media is custom-made to drive engagement at all costs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I took a long break (maybe 5 years or so) but I have recently started using both FB and Instagram and have been surprised at how positive my time has been on these platforms. On FB I have been finding interesting local groups and events (just moved to a new city) and on Instagram, I have been enjoying seeing updates from real friends.On the other hand I recently deleted Twitter from my phone. I love twitter for getting interesting infromation and staying up to date with news, but the whole culture there has just turned into cheap dunking on one another, and its just guaranteed to leave you feeling angry about something. Extremely disruptive to mental state.I spend some time on the TikTok-like products as well (youtube shorts / fb reels) and have found them to be just a really easy way to completely waste an hour for no reason whatsoever. Less disruptive to mental state than twitter though."</p>

Calories In, Crust of the earth OutEdit: I feel like a lot of people are arguing about something that should be considered totally uncontroversial, basic physics. Before you get all worked up over this, please look up Yuri Gagarin. His weight loss journey absolutely proved that it is possible to lose 100% of your body weight through simple orbital mechanics and hundreds of people have followed in his footsteps and experienced similar results. There is not room for debate, this is a proven weight loss method and what the I&#39;m suggesting is essentially a very similar thing, but one that could help a lot more people at once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kind of a meta comment, it&#39;s always interesting to see / hear that when a somewhat well-known author writes a new book, you see interviews with them cropping up on &#34;all the usual&#34; places, other outlets write about it etc.It&#39;s nice with something like &#34;What if? 2&#34;, because Randall is an interesting podcast guest, and there are just so many different things to talk about.It&#39;s a bit more annoying in other cases, where within two month you hear the same author on 5 different podcasts, and the author says the same thing on each of them. Time to use the skip button.I guess that&#39;s simply how it works nowadays in publishing: writing the book is work, but then you also need to spend quite some time promoting it, in the hopes not only that it boosts sales, but also that the boosted sales put the book in some bestseller lists, boosting sales even further."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is already an open media format (edit: for object-based immersive audio), it&#39;s called SMPTE 2098. Granted it&#39;s basically the mutant stepchild of DTS and Dolby ATMOS, but it does exist.The real problem isn&#39;t the hardware manufacturers but the content producers. Dolby engages in blatant anticompetitive behavior that basically requires hardware manufacturers to support their codecs and make it impossible to innovate on the actual media formats in a way that might compete. For example: paying for content to be released in atmos or giving away the tools to author it for free."</p>

They may think that their job is actually to suppress free speech unfortunately.Especially common is for national security to override free speech in the minds of government officials. They can easily convince themselves that they need to suppress certain viewpoints in order to save many lives. It just coincidentally also saves their own jobs.I think unfortunately that young people would prefer less free speech and for the government to enforce more confirming perspectives.One other core issue for people who want the tech companies to stop listening to government to consider is the fact that the government has police, guns, prisons, and legal sanctions available to enforce it&#39;s policy decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The central issue in these cases are the difference between the following two scenarios:1. The CDC or other government agency says &#34;We believe X is misinformation, do with that advice what you will&#34;.2. The CDC or other government agency says &#34;We believe X is misinformation, and if you don&#39;t act on that, we will penalize you in some way&#34;.The former is perfectly legitimate, and exactly what e.g. public health agencies ought to be doing: offering opinions and advice to the private sector and public. The latter is a first amendment violation.Presumably, some of these cases will also turn on whether there was an implicit regulatory threat in the &#34;recommendations&#34; given. In some cases, according to this article, the threats seem to have been fairly explicit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article highlights that the easiest way for these companies to let go of staff right now is to dissolve entire teams. I&#39;ve heard from friends that work at these companies that recent hiring freezes have actually made managers more hesitant to fire low performers because anyone they fire can&#39;t be replaced and they&#39;d rather have a low performer than no one at all. The team dissolving process seems to sidestep this management hesitation to fire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t read WSJ while at work, but after checking on the financials for both Meta and Alphabet, I do not understand why either would be cutting staff. Both look pretty strong, so I am not sure how cuts are justified or why Zuckerberg has a negative outlook, especially since 2021 was such a great year for both.Do American executives, investors, and start up owners not have the guts for even a moderate stock price drop? I guess the reaction is to cut staff, or threaten to, when there is a whiff of negativity. Fuckin weak."</p>

Although there exists some off the shelf underwater lidar solutions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YevvMcc6Zu4 and underwater drones, it&#39;s likely to be too turbulent (and with air bubble) for them to stay in place at a known position to work properly out of the box (but maybe not because it seems to be possible to scuba dive the strid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUamSryCUK4)."</p>

Will be super curious to see other folks trying it out and seeing if it&#39;s as robust as it seems, including when confronted with audio speech with natural tics and uhhh&#39;s and uhmm&#39;s and everything in-between.I think it&#39;s fair to say that AI-transcription accuracy is now decidedly superior to the average human&#39;s, what the implications of this are I&#39;m not sure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is distributed SQLite 3, running (I assume at least partially managed?) LiteFS[5] for you. Which is pretty cool!What I&#39;d like to have seen is how this compares to things like rqlite[1] or Cloudflare&#39;s D1[2] addressed directly in the articleThat said, I think this is pretty good for things like read replica&#39;s. I know the sales pitch here is as a full database, and I don&#39;t disagree with it, and if I was starting from scratch today and could use this, I totally would give it a try and benchmark / test accordingly, however I can&#39;t speak to that use case directly.What I find however and what I can speak to, is that most workloads already have database of some kind setup, typically not SQLite as their main database (MySQL or PostgreSQL seem most common). This is a great way to make very - insanely, really - fast read replica&#39;s across regions of your data. You can use an independent raft[3][4] implementation to do this on write. If your database supports it, you can even trigger a replication directly from a write to the database itself (I think Aurora has this ability, and I think - don&#39;t quote me! - PostgreSQL can do this natively via an extension to kick off a background job)To that point, in my experience one thing SQLite is actually really good at is storing JSON blobs. I have successfully used it for replicating JSON representations of read only data in the past to great success, cutting down on read times significantly for APIs as the data is &#34;pre-baked&#34; and the lightweight nature of SQLite allows you to - if you wanted to naively do this - just spawn a new database for each customer and transform their data accordingly ahead of time. Its like AOT compilation for your data.if you want to avoid some complexity with sharding (you can&#39;t always avoid it outright, but this can help cap its complexity) this approach helps enormously in my experience. Do try before you buy!EDIT: Looks like its running LiteFS[5] not LiteStream[0]. This is my error of understanding.[0]: https://litestream.io/[1]: https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite[2]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-d1/[3]: https://raft.github.io/[4]: https://raft.github.io/#implementations[5]: https://github.com/superfly/litefs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool! Unfortunately i primarily am interested in offline databases so perhaps i&#39;m just not the target audience. However i have to ask, on that note, does this have any application in the offline space?Ie i wonder if there&#39;s a way to can write your applications such that they have less/minimal contention, and then allow the databases to merge when back online? Of course, what happens when there inevitably _is_ contention? etcNot sure that idea would have a benefit over many SQLite DBs with userland schemas mirroring CRDT principles though. But a boy can dream.Regardless, very cool work being done here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Developing against a relational database requires devs to watch out for &#34;N+1&#34; query patterns, where a query leads to a loop that leads to more queries. N+1 queries against Postgres and MySQL can be lethal to performance. Not so much for SQLite.This is misleading AFAICT. The article(s) is actually comparing remote RDBMS to local RDBMS, not Postgres to SQLite.Postgres can also be served over a UNIX socket, removing the individual query overhead due to TCP roundtrip.SQLite is a great technology, but keep in mind that you can also deploy Postgres right next to your app as well. If your app is something like a company backend that could evolve a lot and benefit from Postgres&#39;s advanced features, this may be the right choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hesitated posting this, because I don&#39;t want to be too negative, but: ugh.  ChromeOS is just more Google adware/tracking-ware, locking people into the Google ecosystem, and (by default, at least) creating a more locked-down environment than a general-purpose OS would have (not quite iOS or even Android, but still not with the flexibility of a &#34;mainstream&#34; OS).  I feel like Framework could be spending their time doing much better things.  Granted, if they believe that this will be a big boost to their bottom line / margins / sustainability, then I&#39;m in favor of it on the grounds of helping make sure Framework is a successful company.My hope was that this is just running on the standard Framework laptop hardware, but it looks like it required a bit of a mainboard redesign, as well as a different input cover and keyboard.  Extra hardware like that just makes their offering more difficult for a customer to navigate and understand, not to mention the added support and manufacturing burden on the company&#39;s side."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a couple HP Chromebook 13 G1 laptops that I loved quite a lot for ~5 years as my primary personal laptop.  It worked really well for 95% of my needs, especially once it got the Linux container support (which was ~4 years in).The first one I got was $550 for the 8GB RAM model with i5 and &#34;retina&#34; screen, that was a refurb from Woot, almost half off.  The second one I got around a year ago when Linux container support landed, 16GB RAM, i7, &#34;retina&#34; screen.  That one I got off ebay for $120 landed.  I also got my son one that he used until a few days ago.  Pretty decent little machine for that price.My son switched to a $120 Windows ASUS laptop this past weekend because the Chromebook wouldn&#39;t run Windows games.  I was half expecting him to give up on the new laptop because 4GB isn&#39;t much RAM, but he says it works great.My mother in law was recently asking for laptop advice for a &#34;ward of the court&#34; she oversees that could do with a laptop to do zoom meetings for the court appearances, and to use for school.  I went looking for Chromebooks and found: they are all priced the same as a similarly speced Windows laptop.  The things I value about ChromeOS (&#34;instant&#34; updates, &#34;nothing really on the device&#34;, &#34;security&#34;) aren&#39;t things the average person (let alone teen) really care about...  Kind of hard to recommend a Chromebook for the average person these days, unless I&#39;m missing something."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A little historical tangent:Tomorrow (23rd) marks the 176th anniversary  of the discovery of Neptune (~ 1.07 years on Neptune; 164.8 Earth years).Johann Gottfried Galle an astronomer at the Berlin observatory found Neptune at the behest of Urbain Le Verrier who calculated its position by hypothesizing that some body must perturb Uranus orbit to explain the distinct deviation from the predicted motion by Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation.Le Verrier couldn&#39;t find a single French astronomer willing to take a look out at the sky after presenting his extensive calculations to the French Academy on 31 August. On 18 September he then wrote a letter to the German astronomer Galle at the Berlin observatory.After receiving the letter 5 days later Galle immediately set up his telescope the same night and found a +8 mag star (within 1 degree of the Le Verrier&#39;s calculation) not listed on the official Prussian star chart. The next night he managed to measure the star itself moving by 4 arcseconds, finally confirming Le Verrier prediction of a new planet (and to this day last).At ~30 AU (30x the distance sun-earth; Uranus being at ~20 AU) the discovery instantaneously made the solar system 1.5x bigger ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow! If anyone is curious as to why Triton is so bright...&gt; Covered in a frozen sheen of condensed nitrogen, Triton reflects an average of 70 percent of the sunlight that hits it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting to see the amount of negative comments.Most of the negativity seems to come from the following points:- EU-funded project cannot succeed in tech because previous EU-funded projects have failed in tech in the past (and generally government-funded project in tech are suspicious)- Search is hard, and therefore it will fail- The project is underfundedEven if the points above can all be valid (though the obvious US-funded startup launched by a bunch of uni students seemed to have fared pretty well) it seems we are missing the point of this project.The proposal is to contribute to the creation of open building blocks necessary to enable others (including private US companies) to make better search products.Better search product are needed.Shall we remember HN of some of the intense conversations that happened here about Google failing us:- Google Search is Dying [1]- Every Google result now looks like an ad [2]- Google no longer producing high quality search results in significant categories [3]So while, yes search is a hard topic, we should welcome initiatives aiming at improving the ground infrastructure needed to lower the barrier to entry on this subject and hope it will allow many companies to build better search products (or inspire other initiatives to contribute in similar and even more successful way)1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=303477192: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=221078233: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29772136"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have written this before but I’ll put it here again. What I would like to see is a federated search engine. Based on activitypub that works like mastodon. Don’t like the results from one source? Just remove them from your sources, or lower their ranking. Similar to yacy but you can work with the protocol to connect or build whatever type of index you want using whatever technology you like, and communicate over an existing standard. Want to build the worlds best index of Pokémon sites, then go do it. Want to build a search engine using idris or ats? Sure! I did note the professors are on mastodon so perhaps this may actually happen.One of these days I’ll actually implement the above assuming nobody else does. I figured if I can at least get the basics done and a reference implementation that’s easy to run it could prove the concept. If anyone is interested in this do email my in my bio.What I worry about for this project is that it becomes another island which prohibits remixing of results like google and bing, and its own index and ranking algorithms become gamed.I wish the creators best of luck though. I am also hoping for some more blogs and papers about the internals of he engine. So little information is published in the space that anything is welcome, especially if it’s deeply technical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seriously... I really wanted to like this project, but it seems everything EU touches as of recently gets worse.From the webpafe that half of the time shows &#34;Resource Limit exceeded&#34; to a technology stack diagram on the bottom of this page https://openwebsearch.eu/the-project/ being completely unreadable due to bad scaling.It is very disappointing really. Another example from the top of my head. Here in Poland we have ID cards(as every other EU country) . Those ID cards have to be renewed every now and then (10~15years). In last years an online system for government services was implemented  including for renewal of those cards. One could take a photo with a mobile phone, submit an application and pick up a card from a gov office in few weeks time. Unfortunately, EU made a law that ID cards applications have to be acommpanied by biometrics (fingerprints) so this system has been thrown away. One has to physically go to the gov office, scan their fingerprints, apply for a new id card and then go again to pick it up...Ok, so what happens in 10 years time? They should have the fingerprints already, right? No. They take the fingerprints, they store them only until one picks up the id card and then they are deleted. There are no fingerprint database, they are not stored anywhere. The fingerprints are used only to ensure the same person that submitted the application picks up the document. It makes zero sense, other than to break the previous online system. Thanks EU."</p>

  (&#34;Plaintiffs remain open to considering an alternate proposal ... but
  cannot do without some indications of what the B/T Defendants intend to
  produce[.]&#34;)), the Court finds that Plaintiffs&#39; financial records RFPs
  are not overly broad, particularly given that Defendants have had
  opportunities to make sample productions of the financial records RFPs,
  but have failed to do so despite Plaintiffs&#39; agreement to such proposal
  (id., Ex. 1 at 5). Plaintiffs plainly explain why they need this
  information: to assess the backing of USDT with US dollars, and to
  allow a forensic accountant to assess the USDT reserve...
  
  The documents sought in the transactions RFPs appear to go to one of
  Plaintiffs&#39; core allegations: that the B/T Defendants engaged in
  cyptocommodities transactions using unbacked USDT, and that those
  transactions &#34;were strategically timed to inflate the market.&#34;...

Just like RTX Voice and other gimmick &#34;exclusives&#34; I expect it to be available to older cards the moment they realize their backlog of 30 series cards aren&#39;t clearing as quickly as they thought.They&#39;re competing against an over-bloated secondhand market, AMD, Intel, much better integrated GPUs, and comparatively cheaper consoles that maintain sky-high demand with subsidized games via new subscription programs. They&#39;re vastly overestimating their brand loyalty (think Microsoft v Sony after the 360) and EVGA&#39;s exit makes more sense now than ever.[0] https://developer.nvidia.com/opticalflow-sdk"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the 4090 is 38% faster (in FP32 FLOPS) than the current top server GPU (H100) and 105% faster than the current top desktop GPU (3090 Ti). And it&#39;s also more than twice as efficient (in FLOPS per watt) as all current top GPUs, even compared to the H100 which is manufactured on the same TSMC 4N process. This is impressive.The computing power of these new GPUs (in FP32 TFLOPS) is as below:  Nvidia RTX 4090:      82.6 TFLOPS (450 watts¹)
  Nvidia RTX 4080-16GB: 48.8 TFLOPS (320 watts¹)
  Nvidia RTX 4080-12GB: 40.1 TFLOPS (285 watts¹)

Compared to Nvidia&#39;s current top server and top desktop GPUs:  Nvidia H100 (SXM card): 60.1 TFLOPS (700 watts)
  Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti:     40.0 TFLOPS (450 watts)

Compared to AMD&#39;s current top server and top desktop GPUs:  AMD Instinct MI250X:    47.9 TFLOPS (560 watts)
  AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT:  23.7 TFLOPS (335 watts)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like they&#39;re really emphasizing the difference in RT performance from the previous generation, but I think the gaming market at least will care more about the difference in raw frames and memory size from the previous generation and AMD&#39;s offerings.Personally, I like using RT for some single player showpiece games with a 3080 Ti, RT was useless on my 2080, but the games that I play the most do not use RT at all. DLSS is always great on any title that offers it, but again the real issue is that most of the games that people put real time into are the types of games for which RT is irrelevant. Graphical showpiece stuff is just a lot less relevant to the contemporary gaming market than it used to be."</p>

Centiclops is a lot like a cyclops with one eye, except the as a reading of the roots clearly indicates, this is a creature with 100 eyes.Today I learn that Centiclops effectively has a Unicode character. As Centiclops&#39; representative in the world of the non-imaginary, we accept that a Unicode character with a hundred eyes is not practical and we accept the representation with just a few eyes, but generally agree that upgrading to 7 to 10 is a nice improvement, as 7 does not evenly divide into 100 but 10 does. This is important, because... reasons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There were 84 errors for GCP, but the breakdown says 74 409s and 5 timeouts. Maybe it was 79 409s? Or 10 timeouts?I suspect the 409 conflicts are probably from the instance name not being unique in the test. It looks like the instance name used was:    instance_name = f&#34;gpu-test-{int(time())}&#34;

which has a 1-second precision. The test harness appears to do a `sleep(1)` between test creations, but this sort of thing can have weird boundary cases, particularly because (1) it does cleanup after creation, which will have variable latency, (2) `int()` will truncate the fractional part of the second from `time()`, and (3) `time.time()` is not monotonic.I would not ask the author to spend money to test it again, but I think the 409s would probably disappear if you replaced `int(time())` with `uuid.uuid4()`.Disclosure: I work at Google - on Google Compute Engine. :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdotally I tend to agree with the author. But this really isn&#39;t a great way of comparing cloud services.The fundamental problem with cloud reliability is that it depends on a lot of stuff that&#39;s out of your control, that you have no visibility into. I have had services running happily on AWS with no errors, and the next month without changing anything they fail all the time.Why? Well, we look into it and it turns out AWS changed something behind the scenes. There&#39;s a different underlying hardware behind the instance, or some resource started being in high demand because of some other customers.So, I completely believe that at the time of this test, this particular API was performing a lot better on AWS than on GCP. But I wouldn&#39;t count on it still performing this way a month later. Cloud services aren&#39;t like a piece of dedicated hardware where you test it one month, and then the next month it behaves roughly the same. They are changing a lot of stuff that you can&#39;t see."</p>

Just people who clearly dont get paid/paid much to make this content but I found it useful/interesting/helpful. I think that stuff goes a long way and it really doesnt take that long to do.I&#39;ve got a tech podcast now and about once every month or two someone contacts me to say they liked it or something nice.

Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s React, Angular, Class based components, Functional components with hooks, Just Some HTML, PHP, Rails views, etc.The frontend just collects the cruft of a product organization changing course very frequently. There are always a dozen half-finished fix-the-world ideas conflicting with each other, half-finished move-to-new-framework initiatives.I just mean to say that when I hear &#34;it&#39;s because React&#34; or &#34;it&#39;s because rails views&#34;, any other of the infinite variations of this, I kind of just tune out.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a developer who’s been working with React since the beta, I can confidently say that the author is speaking the truth. Especially so near the end of the article where they can’t seem to quit React.For all the annoyances of Hooks, they really are a godsend when it comes to composing state. And refs do indeed suck, but they sucked even more with class based components. I can’t tell you how many times I was able to solve a complex DOM state issue with custom hooks wrapped around refs.Newer tools like Svelte and Solid do look promising as far as removing boilerplate, but they personally feel a step too far off the path of “it’s just JavaScript.”Has anyone else here successfully left for greener JS pastures?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must be the only person in the world who likes class components in React.Sure, it&#39;s often overkill and a functional component does the same thing with less code. Use a functional component in these cases. But if you&#39;re doing something more complicated then stop treating class components like the fucking devil. They have their place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great idea.  Now, everyone that learns this stuff, show some restraint!The drawback of a powerful type system is you can very easily get yourself into a type complexity mudhole.  Nothing worse than trying to call a method where a simple `Foo` object would do but instead you&#39;ve defined 60 character definition of `Foo` capabilities in the type system in the method signature.Less is more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Over the years, the type system of TypeScript has grown from basic type annotations to a large and complex programming language.Give someone (particularly a developer) the opportunity to build something complicated and undoubtedly they will. So now you have two problems, the complicated program that actually does some hopefully useful work, and another complicated program on top of it that fills your head and slows you down when trying to fix the first complicated program. You may say &#39;ah yes, but the second complicated program validates the first!&#39;. Not really, it just makes things more complicated. Almost all bugs are logic bugs or inconsistent state bugs (thanks OOP!), almost none are type bugs.However, static analysis of existing code (in Javascript), without having to write a single extra character, may well have great value in indicating correctness.Edit:&gt; TypeScript&#39;s type system is a full-fledged programming language in itself!Run! Run as fast as you can! Note that this &#39;full-fledged programming language&#39; doesn&#39;t actually do anything (to their credit they admit this later on)Edit2:&gt; [...] is a type-level unit test.

When I write code as an outsider (Java and Go developer), I feel like I use the type system in sensible and readable ways. When I look at the code written by the native TypeScript experts in my company it is a bewildering, abstract, unreadable morass. I have no idea what&#39;s going on half the time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice work!However, a cautionary tale on AI medical image &#34;denoising&#34;:(and beyond, in science)- See the artifacts?The algorithm plugs into ambiguous areas of the image stuff it has seen before / it was trained with.
So, if such a system was to &#34;denoise&#34; (or compress, which - if you think about it - is basically the same operation) CT scans, X-rays, MRIs, etc., in ambiguous areas it could plug-in diseased tissue where the ground-truth was actually healthy.Or the opposite, which is even worse: substitute diseased areas of the scan with healthy looking imagery it had been trained on.Reading recent publications that try to do &#34;denoising&#34; or resolution &#34;enhancement&#34; in medical imaging contexts, the authors seem to be completely oblivious to this pitfall.(maybe they had a background as World Bank / IMF economists?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something interesting about the San Francisco test image is that if you start to look into the details, its clear that some real changes have been made to the city. Rather than losing texture or grain or clarity, the information lost in this is information about the particular layout of a neighborhood of streets, which has now been replaced as if some one were drawing the scene from memory. A very different kind of loss that with out the original might be imperceptible because the information that was lost isn&#39;t replaced with random or systematic noise, but rather new, structured information.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few thoughts that aren&#39;t related to each other.1. This is a brilliant hack. Kudos.2. It would be great to see the best codecs included in the comparison - AVIF and JPEG XL. Without those it&#39;s rather incomplete. No surprise that JPEG and WEBP totally fall apart at that bitrate.3. A significant limitation of the approach seems to be that it targets extremely low bitrates where other codecs fall apart, but at these bitrates it incurs problems of its own (artifacts take the form of meaningful changes to the source image instead of blur or blocking, very high computational complexity for the decoder).When only moderate compression is needed, codecs like JPEG XL already achieve very good results. This proof of concept focuses on the extreme case, but I wonder what would happen if you targeted much higher bitrates, say 5x higher than used here. I suspect (but have no evidence) that JPEG XL would improve in fidelity faster as you gave it more bits than this SD-based technique. Transparent compression, where the eye can&#39;t tell a visual difference between source and transcode (at least without zooming in) is the optimal case for JPEG XL. I wonder what sort of bitrate you&#39;d need to provide that kind of guarantee with this technique."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One bill opposed by the App Association is the Open App Markets Act, which aimed to help app developers use alternative in-app payment systems and avoid Apple&#39;s standard cuts of 15 to 30 percent.The cut is a platform fee, and collecting it via the in-app payment system is mechanism, not policy.The core issue is Apple&#39;s rate: although it is usually comparable to rates on other game platforms (eShop, Google Play, Steam...), (some) game and app developers want it reduced so that they receive a higher percentage of an app&#39;s retail price.The largely unfounded expectation that some developers seem to have is that changing IAP payment methods will cause Apple&#39;s platform fee to drop to zero, rather than causing Apple to simply collect it by other means.Edit: for some reason people are responding to me with complaints about Apple&#39;s policies and downvoting me because they don&#39;t like Apple&#39;s platform fees. I&#39;m trying to shed some light on what is actually going on: a dispute over platform fee rates.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well into the second day of Cloudflare’s blockade of my home internet connection, Google Search also began blocking requests. It required me to resolve a CAPTCHA challenge for every other search. This luckily only lasted a day.Cloudflare shares IP reputation data with partners like Google, coordinated through a program called the Bandwidth Alliance. So, my original offense might not even have been against Cloudflare. It might have received the reputation data from a partner, and it just propagated through the Bandwidth Alliance network.That&#39;s not what Bandwidth Alliance is at all. It&#39;s about reducing or eliminating egress fees between a cloud provider and Cloudflare. Not sure where the idea that it&#39;s about sharing IP reputation data comes from.https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/So, if Google Search started showing a CAPTCHA that&#39;s not Cloudflare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;d like to experience this treatment first-hand, try surfing the web using the Tor Browser.Spoiler alert: many websites simply refuse to load at all (e.g. any google service, and lots of websites &#34;protected&#34; by CF). Captchas are everywhere: in many cases, you can&#39;t even complete simple GETs of blogs without donating free labor to CF.And the most infuriating part, you get CF marketing messages right in your face while your browser is calculating hashcash (I guess?)... At this point I can recognize every single one of them: something about bots making up 40% of all internet traffic, something about their web scraper protection racket, something about small businesses (???), etc etc...To be fair, Tor exit nodes have an awful reputation for sure. Nevertheless, I have a hard time forgiving how CF makes browsing the Internet hell for those who actually need Tor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Harsh blocking/limiting/challenging is way too valuable to sites that are actually trying to make money online. It&#39;s not going away short of legislation banning it. Losing 1/10,000 legitimate customers to cut fraud attempts, spam, exploit attempts, and so on, by 90% or more, is just too good a trade-off.I have bad news about the most-likely fix for it, longer term, so we can lay off the IP-based reputation stuff and the geo-blocking: it&#39;s tying some form of personal ID to your browsing activity, so that bears the reputation instead of the address.Sorry. Said it was bad news."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PGs take on why early stage VCs gain so much experience reminds me of my opinions on why car sales is the best sales experience.I sold cars for almost a decade and was pretty good at it averaging 30 cars a month. That means every year I helped people sign for $16 million of products. In the end I probably sold 3000 cars for over $100 million.(Note, I stayed in it way too long. I think most of these benefits would come from 2 years)I made close to 50,000 phone calls, leaving probably 20,000 voicemails. I closed atleast 1000 deals purely on the phone.I&#39;ve heard excuses, stalls, lies, promises and objections over 10,000 times.I&#39;ve seen thousands of married couples discuss if they should go ahead with spending $30-100k. I&#39;ve seen how they interact while waiting. (Nothing pains me more than couples, or moreso one party, playing games on their phones ignoring each other).While there is a lot more to modern tech sales than just closing incoming leads, I think car sales is an accelerator course for interacting with, reading, and closing people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This essay is getting a surprising amount of hate, and I must confess that my first impression on reading it was that it sounded an awful lot like a Robert Kiyosaki book [1].  But then I followed the two links in the essay [2] [3] and that put it into perspective: the thing that Paul learned from his users is that they are looking for The Answer, the formula, the procedure for how to succeed, and there is no such formula.  It&#39;s like Goedel&#39;s incompleteness theorem, except that it&#39;s not a theorem.  People come to YC and buy Robert Kiyosaki&#39;s books hoping to find an Answer that simply doesn&#39;t exist.The difference between Paul and Robert is that Paul is up-front about this while Robert is cagey and deceptive and makes his money by stringing people along thinking that The Answer can be found by buying one more of his books.  But I think a lot of the hate here is driven by disappointment that Paul is honest, and that his answer is that there is no Answer.  It can be frustrating to hear that (which is also something that Paul explicitly points out).---[1] https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680...[2] http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html[3] http://paulgraham.com/before.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompted by the negative feedback that this essay received, ranging from being a sales pitch in disguise, to being a word salad going in all directions without answering the central question posed by the author right in the opening paragraphs, I had to go and re-examine the piece and see if these concerns are valid or not, and unexpectedly the second reading reaffirmed my initial positive reaction that this is actually a good piece, maybe not the best, but still good.In spirit of open discussion and intellectual curiosity here, I share my insights in the following order matching that of the post:1) PG opens with the best advice that he could dispense to prospective applicants which is &#34;what you&#39;ve learned from users&#34;.2) He proceeds to ask himself the same question.3) He then informs readers that his users; startup founders, usually face the same set of problems across the board.4) Since these problems are the same, he thought of automating the solution to scale his business (dogfooding in some sense).5) That blew up in his face spectacularly that he had to rework the plan and concede that his solution won&#39;t scale.6) But these same problems are not recognized uniformly by founders as they sometimes face difficulties identifying them in the first place, that&#39;s where the YC partners&#39; role come to fill this unmet need.7) Even when people are good at identifying problems, some are bad at determining the severity or urgency that these problems pose, cue again the YC partners&#39; role.8) Even when they&#39;re good at risk assessment, some are bad at risk mitigation, and won&#39;t listen to the advice given by the partners but it is not made clear what he means exactly by &#34;not listening&#34;, dismissing/not acting on solutions proposed by YC staff, or not acknowledging that there&#39;s a problem to begin with?9) Getting down to business to solve these problems warrants focus, and how this focus is tied into speed, and how YC can help with that.10) Startup colleagues are more important than YC partners when it comes to realizing success with their feedback, guidance and even practical help, and how YC is the best in class in this regard.Even though the marketing language, esp the value propositions in the piece is a bit stronger for my taste, but I can&#39;t say with honesty that it overpowered the core message of the essay nor was it incoherent or disjointed in anyway that made following or understanding impossible as some have claimed here.Verdict: 8/10"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats to the Wasmtime team on the 1.0 release!I&#39;m happy to see that more runtimes are maturing and getting use on production cases... I can&#39;t wait to see and show what the future entails for WebAssembly on both the server side and the browser!Keep up the good work. Also I&#39;d like to use this message to congratulate other runtimes that I&#39;m excited about (apart from Wasmer, of course!): Wizard Engine [1], Wazero [2] and Lunatic [3].The future is bright in Wasm land :)[1] https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine[2] https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero[3] https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instantiating a runtime in microseconds is deeply exciting!Though after skimming through the docs, I&#39;m still left wondering a few things:- JS is notably missing from the list of languages supported on the front page. But I see mentions of a Spidermonkey.wasm in the blog post. Is running JS on top of wasmtime in production a realistic prospect today? If so, where can I read more? (mainly interested in this for the instantiation time benefits, though maybe all/most of that will be negated by the embedded JS engine?)- How should I go about building a typical web service on top of wasmtime? Can wasmtime itself handle network requests/connections or would I need to build the web server in some other host language and pass request data to wasmtime modules? Haven&#39;t been able to find anything in the docs about this.- What would it take to build a multitenant web service where customer code is isolated using wasmtime, like the one like described in the post?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sold on the future of wasm. What really still bothers me is the effort and hoops I have to jump through to actually leverage it. Networking, just fix networking so I can drop in most things and it would be great. The fact that I have to rewrite the majority of my network access to do any external IO is painful but I get that containers took more than a decade after Google&#39;s use to get there too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unfortunately this caching is still per-path. For example:    GET /v1/document/{document-id}/comments/{comment-id}

For every new document-id or comment-id, there will be a new pre-flight request.Alternative hacks: Offer a variant of your API format that either1. Moves the resource path to the request body (or to a header that is included in &#34;Vary&#34;). Though the rest of your stack (load balancing, observability, redaction) might not be ok with this, e.g. do your WAF rules support matching on the request body? You also will no longer get automatic path-based caching for GET requests.2. Conforms to the rules of a CORS &#34;simple&#34; request [1], which won&#39;t trigger a pre-flight request. This is what we did on the Dropbox API [2]. You&#39;ll need to move the auth information from the Authorization header to a query parameter or the body, which can be dangerous wrt redaction, e.g. many tools automatically redact the Authorization header but not query parameters.[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simpl...[2] https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/docume...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The trick to improving YouTube recommendations is to regularly prune uninteresting videos and channels. Eventually this should start surfacing videos you&#39;re more likely to find interesting.I&#39;ve actually hit the end of my recommendation stream on the mobile app after marking dozens of videos with Not Interested. Once this happens it starts recommending videos you&#39;ve already watched or older videos from creators you&#39;ve been watching lately.Personally, I&#39;d love it if you could curate the recommendation system a bit more. I&#39;m never interested in rewatching stuff I&#39;ve already seen. And the recency bias for recommendations means you&#39;re always getting more if what you&#39;ve recently consumed. I&#39;d like it if more older interests were mixed in. Finally, I&#39;d love to be able to blacklist certain topics and games entirely.There&#39;s so much missed potential with YouTube recommendations.Some might say that you can still use search, but that has been crippled to include unrelated recommendations after one page of results. Not only that, I want YouTube to help me discover new content. When the recommendation system works and it shows me new kinds of interesting stuff, it&#39;s superb. TikTok is eating YouTube&#39;s lunch in this regard.Edit: forgot to mention this. On mobile if you do a recommendation refresh it&#39;ll show a New to You filter which you can use to explore more diverse recommendations. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s hidden in this manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didn’t like when they removed the dislike counts, and I still don’t like it.When I look for videos of folks working on Subarus, I don’t want to have to manually scrub through the video to gauge the quality. Before I’d just look at the ratio and if I was feeling generous I’d preview the frames to see if they had what I wanted.Now it takes me at least 2 mins longer to get to the same judgement which begs the question of why I’m watching a video when I have a book on my lap and a car waiting outside."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of how games (coughLeagueOfLegendscough) match me up with a player that I literally just reported for harassment, griefing etc. in the previous match.  Like, there weren&#39;t any other possible players to match me with out of the many thousands?  I don&#39;t mind waiting a few more seconds to match up with someone else!I&#39;m getting a lot of responses as if I expect the player to be totally blocked from matching with me, but that&#39;s not really what I mean.  Even a basic &#34;temporary match score reduction&#34; would work.  I would also expect a cooldown system where the reduction caused by reporting no longer applies.  Arguing against the idea &#34;because it creates a prisoner&#39;s island&#34; misses the subtlety of a well-thought-out implementation where reporting simply lowers the matchup &#34;rank&#34; for a while, and serial-false-reporters have their reports basically nullified/ignored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple started offering home repair kits for iPhone this year, but they’re super difficult to use: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/technology/personaltech/a...There’s speculation that offering the kits is an attempt to head off right-to-repair legislation. But seeing this redesign, I wonder to what degree the repair program is incentivizing repairability within apple’s corporate structure. Now that “profit/loss per self service repair” is tracked in a spreadsheet - does repairability matter more?Anyways - it’s great to see some improvement here, for whatever motivation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has got to be one extremely expensive toolchain and supply chain redesign to do, but since they have done it a few times before (instead of incremental changes) I suppose the money department has worked out when it is feasible to do that kind of thing while keeping the people in charge happy.I&#39;m curious to see if this is a &#39;test&#39; to see if this doesn&#39;t have too many downsides, I imagine ingress area increasing this much might be a point of worry (well, there are flexible seals for that now), and instead of having a one-way stack you now have a two-way stack so tooling and workstations around that (even if we just think in terms of assembly and rework) are going to be a PITA to convert or completely replace.Either this will be a success and allow for the architectural change to be applied to other products, or it&#39;s a medium-success in which this only works for specific parts/antenna/power envelope configurations and we won&#39;t see this design in other form factors.What does itch a little is iFixit whining about the parts needing be a signed set to work together. Nobody has come up with a better integrity protection method, and no-protection isn&#39;t an option either for the ecosystem. Besides, instead of having a &#39;safe&#39; and &#39;unsafe&#39; option for which practically no user will ever be able to make an informed decision, you can simply choose not to buy it if this is a feature you seriously despise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of the strong points of this calculator is the main thing I use in RPN calculators with stacks.  It&#39;s so helpful for me to duplicate a value and then operate on that, and be able to throw it away if I mess up, sanity check from where I started at intermediate calculations, etc.  it&#39;s not identical, but many points others are mentioning in this thread are what I value from an RPN stack based calculator.BTW, for anyone who is comfortable with RPNs, MacOS added the mode to their built-in calculator recently-ish.  it&#39;s not terrible either.  I&#39;ve switched to it for my default experience. (even though nothing beats the HP 48g, as it&#39;s what I&#39;m the most familiar with).Also, on the article, really cool that someone added this on mobile.  I love hearing about devs developing something that fills a niche and does so well.  I feel like I&#39;m out of ideas most days.  Good for her!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I want is a phone app calculator that works like the Python REPL/console. Save ALL previous calculations. Display the last dozen or so. Can scroll through them. Tap on one to recall it, edit one number, recompute. Done.This would beat by far the convenience and usability of this 2-in-1 calculator. I would KILL to have this.In fact, on my laptop, I use the Python REPL as a calculator. I hit Ctrl-T python ENTER. It opens a terminal and I start typing 48*152 ENTER and I see the result. The history of calculations is saved. I can access previous calculations, edit one number and recompute. I see the last 100 lines or so, on one screen.The only one somewhat usable Python REPL on Android is &#34;Pyonic Python 3 interpreter&#34; but it&#39;s clumsy to use as a calculator because it uses the standard alphabetic keyboard so you have to keep switching to the special characters layout to type math operators (-+/...) If this ONE detail would be fixed, and with some minor UI polish I believe it could become more popular than the 2-in-1 calculator..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a wonderful kludge. People can’t imagine that they would be able to go back and edit, or even see, the history of their calculations, so putting two calculators side by side seems like a brilliant idea.It’s like if a new word processor consisted of two faithfully recreated typewriters, with a special button to send the most recently typed word back and forth between them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty cool.The program itself was written in an existing intermediate language called URCL, which was then compiled to CHUNGUS2 assembly. CHUNGUS2 is the processor made with Minecraft&#39;s redstone mechanics. The processor was emulated for development, but the demo is running on MCHPRS, a Minecraft server that uses Wasmtime&#39;s Cranelift to JIT the redstone operations, which are represented as a weighted directed graph. Before MCHPRS, optimizing redstone performance using compiler techniques was not thought to be possible. With MCHPRS the demo takes 9 hours to run, it would take decades using Minecraft.https://github.com/sammyuri/minecrafthttps://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRSAs for CHUNGUS2 itself, it&#39;s a proper RISC processor, it has a 4-stage instruction pipeline, 64 byte 8-way associative data cache, even branch prediction.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDiapbD0Xfg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is truly amazing.Comment from one of the creators;This build does NOT run in real time. It runs on MCHPRS,   the server developed by StackDoubleFlow, which speeds up the game roughly 10-20,000x while running redstone. That brings the framerate to a much more reasonable 0.1fps, so the long timelapses in the video only took 9 hours to record in in total."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on a CPU in Minecraft years ago and designed it to be a 7-bit CPU. I chose that number because it gave me the an appreciable number of operations plus space for arguments. I had only 6 bytes of RAM and about 32bytes of ROM. The ROM was just a circle of transparent blocks (zero) and solid blocks (one) pushed around by pistons.The whole thing was real slow, but it was so much fun trying to design something that would perform interesting calculations. I stopped working on it as at the time Minecraft had some odd bugs with pistons that would cause non-deterministic behavior.I think the most challenging aspect wasn&#39;t the programming or circuits, which were well understood and mapped out, but trying to create modules I could copy-paste inside a special Minecraft save editor to make the machine quickly, then manually dragging out data/command lines to hook the modules together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really love the idea, and the passion behind it. Def could have legs.Here’s the pitfalls I see you falling into:(1) seriously, what data are you collecting? “Everything” isn’t a great answer (who’s supposed to use ‘everything’, anyway? “Anyone”?). “Apples-to-apples police misconduct statistics” is a good one.(2) it’s important to clarify 1 because you need to know who you’re serving, and why. Different activists need different data. “Have all data” sounds good until you need to decide how to allocate your resources.(3) more deeply, data is the land of edge cases. Even just with police misconduct, you need to get DEEP to rigorously compare seemingly-simple stats like “# of unjustified police killings”. If you don’t start narrow, you’ll never show value. If you don’t show value, nobody will ever care you exist.When I look at the data you’ve collected, it ranges from annual reports, to municipal contact info, to crime stats. What’s important to collect at scale? To whom? What do they need it for?Again - great, ambitious idea! But $250k goes fast. Show value before it runs out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You might try defining what the &#34;ideal&#34; department&#39;s data would look like: what categories of data, what columns each record has, what the values are for each, etc. Ideally you&#39;d stamp it with a year and give it a spiffy name so it could be the National Police Data Reporting Standard 2022 (NPDRS.2022) or something.Departments that are trying to be transparent (or who just don&#39;t want to deal with figuring it all out from scratch) may be happy to adopt something considered a &#34;standard&#34; for tracking and reporting data. In some cases it means it is a checkbox they can check without having to deal with annoying people and their annoying questions... but that hardly matters so long as the data is made available. It would also give companies developing software for police departments a target to aim for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is important. Locally, we had a sheriff who was being heavily, heavily criticized due to several deaths at the county facility. This was at the height of the protests a few years ago.It was a lot of work to find data on policing nationwide, because the question really was &#34;Is the sheriff doing a bad job, or do bad things happen sometimes?&#34;After some hard work trying to identify other cities with similar socioeconomic circumstances and populations, it became clear that our local sheriff was actually better than average, and that much of the outrage was fabricated.That&#39;s also when I learned that many people don&#39;t want to listen to statistics unless they agree with their own preconceptions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t wait to get home to play it.Secret of Monkey Island 2 was my first PC game on a 486SX and VGA monitor.  The sound came out of the PC speakers... One day I got an Adlib card and was blown away.  Go ahead and download the remake on steam and notice something that kind of doesn&#39;t exist in any game (that I know):  when you enter the scene on Scabb Island, the relaxed reggae beat changes ever so subtly depending on the  bridge, the carpenter shop, the mapmaker, the bar, etc.For example, you enter the mapmaker and the Wally music comes on, which is the same reggae bagdrop to a clarinet or oboe, the music is a little deeper in the carpenter shop, there&#39;s an evil background tone when Largo LaGrande shows up and a more subtle one in the hotel, etc.With gorgeous hand painted digitized art.They don&#39;t make games like that anymore.  Can&#39;t wait to see if they actually did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two hours in and I&#39;m enjoying it.So far the puzzles have been fun, but not very difficult. The plot is a bit heavy with references to the story of the earlier games, but perhaps not too much (my partner enjoyed it too, having only played The Curse of Monkey Island, but not the others).The &#34;new&#34; art style is a bit odd at first but it&#39;s nice and consistent and it has a style of its own. All the earlier games had a different art style to each other too, partly because the early installments had technical limitations they had to cope with (and then there was that thing with the 3d graphics).The sound track is very nice with some tunes you&#39;ll probably know.I&#39;ll rate it four monkeys and a pegleg."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have the same problem (i.e. terrible short-term memory, though my long-term memory is fine), and I&#39;ve picked up a number of compensating behaviors over the years. By far, documentation is my #1 go-to strategy. I document code extensively, even if I&#39;m the only person who is ever going to read it again. People have mocked me for this, but I believe it&#39;s a superpower.Most programmers believe a number of blatant falsehoods about documentation, with the most prevalent being &#34;comments go out of date quickly, so there&#39;s no point in investing in them&#34;. Maybe I&#39;m just hyper-aware of it because my short-term memory sucks, but code comments have saved me on so many occasions that they&#39;re simply not optional.You can document your code. You can keep it up to date. It isn&#39;t that hard. You just don&#39;t want to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed as I&#39;ve gotten older that I lean more on remembering pointers to information rather than the specific information. I know something exists and can find it quickly, but may not know it off the top of my head.For example, how to get the length of an iterable in a given language. I may not remember the function name (or if it&#39;s a top-level function vs a method) but I know I can search &#34;string length in $LANGUAGE&#34; and find it. This scales better than memorizing every language feature I&#39;ll ever use.---PS: Dash is a great mac app, highly recommend. Your job will likely cover it if it&#39;s something you think you&#39;ll use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote Private Comments[1] specifically to address this problem in code. My coworkers can maintain context about how a given thing works months after the fact. I can&#39;t. So, I leave private comments throughout the code. Things they&#39;d never want committed, but save me hours of re-leaning when next i encounter a given piece of code.Currently has plugins for Vim (proof of concept) and Emacs (actually good). It&#39;d be lovely if one of you folks would make a VSCode plugin for it. I&#39;ve thoroughly documented the API and diagrammed the code flow you&#39;d need[2], so that this would be as easy as possible to add to your favorite editor.[1]: https://github.com/masukomi/private_comments[2]: https://masukomi.github.io/private_comments/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried Rust about five years ago and I had trouble expressing cyclic data structures because there is no clear &#34;owner&#34; in a cyclic data structure. The &#34;safe&#34; solution recommended by the rustaceans was to use integers as references to the data in a vec or hashmap. I was rather put off by this: Instead of juggling pointers I was juggling integers. It made the code harder to debug and find logic errors. At least when I was troubleshooting C I could rely on the debugger to break on a bad pointer, but finding where an integer became &#34;bad&#34; was more time consuming.The borrow checker worked fine when all I needed to do was pass data up and down the callstack, but anything beyond that was difficult or impossible to express. Has the borrow checker become smarter since then? At the time I was very put off."</p>

Unfortunately there isn&#39;t much English-language coverage about the monumental feat, but this is readable with Google translate:

At all.From what I was able to gather, Wayland/libinput say they shouldn&#39;t be responsible for handling it and instead window managers should[0][1], meanwhile gnome says wayland/libinput should handle it[2] and ultimately - several years later - it&#39;s still not possible to in pretty much any Linux distro that uses Wayland(?)When I switch to my Linux laptop to test things, my trackpad is bonkers and I have to move my finger in like 1mm increments because otherwise I&#39;d scroll like 10 pages in Firefox. It&#39;s infuriatingly frustrating.[0] https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/18...[1] https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/87[2] https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Wayland
&#34;The X11 protocol was designed around running graphical apps across the network. While some people use this feature, it&#39;s far from common. Wayland drops this requirement as a way to greatly simplify its architecture.&#34;X client and server are usually the same machine, but they don&#39;t have to be.  While on the road, you can use your notebook to open a Gimp session on your home machine and edit an image stored there.  That is, the Gimp runs on your home machine while your notebook has the GUI.This is a lot to give up for cool compositing effects..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I dislike about Wayland is:  Sometimes the server will crash. Video drivers or something. Hasn&#39;t happened much with 22.04, but used to happen more frequently before. Both with Intel and AMD.When this happens in X11, the server restarts, I see the screen go black for an instant, that&#39;s it.When this happens in Wayland, all my open programs are killed. No save prompts or anything, just insta-killed. This makes Wayland unusable unless they can guarantee no crashes, ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still don&#39;t see how they can pretend these anti-circumvention takedown requests are legal. The DMCA clearly lays out the path to challenge an alleged circumvention, and it involves a court order barring distribution of the product. Takedown notices are only for violations of copyright."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously, this tool does circumvent YouTube&#39;s mechanisms to download and edit a video. The user kinda accepts the risk (how many of them even read that privacy policy?) but there is no verification that they have any rights to the video. Which is imho as it should be.It&#39;s neither wrong nor illegal to download someone&#39;s video and edit it. It&#39;s explicitly allowed in many jurisdictions under fair use. However, OP seems to accept complaint&#39;s framing.Speaking of youtube-dl, there&#39;s an excellent fork, yt-dlp[1], which circumvents the newer speed limiting features YouTube implemented. (From what I gather, they use APIs for older devices.)[1] https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First off, no, a full rewrite is not only not necessary, but probably the worst possible approach. Do a piece at a time. You will eventually have re-written all the code, but do not ever fall into the trap of a &#34;full re-write&#34;. It doesn&#39;t work.But before you re-write once line of code - get some testing in place. Or, a lot of testing. If you have end-to-end tests that run through every feature that is currently used by your customer base, then you have a baseline to safely make changes. You can delete code as long as the tests pass. You can change code as long as the tests pass.Once you are at that point, start picking off pieces to modernize and improve.Also, respect the team. Maybe they aren&#39;t doing what you would, but they are keeping this beast alive, and probably have invaluable knowledge of how to do so. Don&#39;t come in pushing for change... come in embracing that this beast of a codebase makes 20 million a year. So talk about how the team can improve it, and modernize their skills at the same time.Because if you walk in, saying, &#34;This all sucks, and so do you, lets throw it out&#34;, do you really have to wonder why you are hitting resistance?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; this code generates more than 20 million dollars a year of revenueFrom a business perspective, nothing is broken. In fact, they laid a golden goose.&gt; team is 3 people, quite junior. One backend, one front, one iOS/android. Resistance to change is huge.My mistake, they didn&#39;t lay a golden goose--they built a money printer. The ROI here is insane.&gt; productivity is abysmal which is understandable. The mess is just too huge to be able to build anything.But you just told me they built a $20M revenue product with 3 bozos. That sounds unbelievably productive.&gt; This business unit has a pretty aggressive roadmap as management and HQ has no real understanding of these blockersYou should consider quitting your job.As far as the business is concerned, there are no problems... because well... they have a money printer, and your team seems not to care enough to advocate for change. Business people don&#39;t give a damn about code quality. They give a damn about value. If 2003 style PHP code does that, so be it. Forget a rewrite, why waste time and effort doing simple refactoring? To them, even that has negative financial value.From their perspective, you&#39;re not being paid to make code easy to work with, you&#39;re being paid to ship product in a rats nest. Maybe you could make a business case for why its valuable to use source control, dependency management, a framework, routing outside of nginx, and so on... but it doesn&#39;t sound like any of that mattered on the road to $20M a year, so it will be very difficult to convince them otherwise especially if your teammates resist.This, again, is why you should consider leaving.Some developers don&#39;t mind spaghetti, cowboy coding. You do. Don&#39;t subject yourself to a work environment and work style that&#39;s incompatible with you, especially when your teammates don&#39;t care either. I guarantee you will hate your job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lovely knot to unravel!First, get everything in source control!Next, make it possible to spin service up locally, pointing at production DB.Then, get the db running locally.Then get another server and get cd to that server, including creating the db, schema, and sample data.Then add tests, run on pr, then code review, then auto deploy to new server.This should stop the bleeding…  no more index-new_2021-test-john_v2.phpAdd tests and start deleting code.Spin up a production server, load balance to it. When confident it works, blow away the old one and redeploy to it. Use the new server for blue/green deployments.Write more tests for pages, clean up more code.Pick a framework and use it for new pages, rewrite old pages only when major functionality changes. Don’t worry about multiple jquery versions on a page, lack of mvc, lack of framework, unless overhauling that page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To some extent I disagree with this, not that Google+Meta are under attack, but that the threat is coming from competitors.I’ve spent most of the last 10 years earning my living from an e-commerce business I own. The online advertising industry is unrecognisable from when we started. My thesis, in beef, is that the industries excessive uses of personalised data and tracking lead to increased regulation, and then a massive pivot to even more “AI” as a means to circumvent that (to some extent). The AI in the ad industry now, I believe, is detrimental to the advertiser. It’s now just one big black box, you put money in one side and get traffic out the other. The control and useful tracking (what actual search terms people are using, proper visible conversion tracking of an ad) is now almost non-existent. As an advertiser your livelihood is dependant on an algorithm, not skill, not intuition, not experience, not even track record.Facebook, Google and the rest of the industry were so driven by profit at all cost, and at the expense of long term thinking, they shot themselves in the foot.Advertisers are searching for alternatives, but they are all the same.I think online advertising, as a whole, is probably f***ed…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"‘Microsoft’s social network, LinkedIn, is unglamorous but its business-to-business ads allow it to monetise the time users spend on it at a rate roughly four times that of Facebook, estimates Andrew Lipsman of eMarketer. It generates more revenue than some medium-sized networks including Snap’s Snapchat and Twitter. &lt;...&gt; So far [Apple] is only dabbling in ads and does not report sales figures. But Bloomberg reported recently that Apple’s ad business was already generating sales of $4bn a year, making it about as big an ad platform as Twitter.’Twitter is now a unit of being moderately unsuccessful at advertising."</p>

Imagine if it included more realistic elements like economics and persistent characters. You could decide you have a vendetta against Bob and steal his cheese every time he goes out shopping for groceries. Heck, you could become the cheese kingpin and monopolize access to cheese. Although a more thematic approach would probably have to do with drugs, which doesn&#39;t seem like too far of a bridge to jump considering the game genre."</p>

Most other countries in the Anglosphere have been through a &#34;plain english&#34; language push in both contract &amp; legislation, while the US has stuck to &#34;this language is proven through precedent&#34; more stubbornly than anywhere else. This seems to be particularly prevalent in IP law, although that might be my tech bias showing.I would very much argue against those (even in this thread), that say that the lay-person isn&#39;t the intended audience for lots of contracts, particularly for T&amp;Cs where they are often written by a contracts lawyer, for a contracts lawyer or judge, but should ABSOLUTELY be written for the lay-person to understand.Anyway, I think the legal profession can &amp; should do better."</p>

The loud parts (including explosions and music) are too loud for her, so we have to turn the volume down during those parts, but the dialog is too quiet and mumbly for me to hear, so we turn the volume up during those parts. We now just keep the volume low and turn on subtitles--easy but shitty solution.Sound engineers need to stop needlessly flexing all that dynamic range that modern tools give them, and just produce a watchable movie. Actors need to go do some stage acting and learn how to e n u n c i a t e and project their voices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact that there&#39;s a claimed generational gap here speaks more to the values of the generations re: passive vs active entertainment. I could also ask: &#34;Why do all these 60-Somethings have the TV on as background noise while doing other tasks?&#34;To me it seems closed-caption usage is correlated with actually paying attention to television consumption.People who have their TV on at all hours, as background entertainment to support their lifestyle, tend to not use CC. Why should they? The words literally don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s just an aesthetic.People who actually desire an immersive experience, who deliberately pay attention to the shows they watch, tend to care about CC since it complements the audio &amp; visual nicely. I don&#39;t have any evidence for this but I&#39;d wager that plot synthesis and comprehension of television shows is greatly improved by CC. Or maybe it&#39;s that people who use CC tend to value and perform better at synthesis and comprehension? Regardless of causality, CC seems related to an individual&#39;s desire for more active entertainment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A probably naieve question. If the VPU can be used as the bootstrap loader for the CPU, much as a PDP11 on the door of the Vax 11/780 acted as bootstrap loader for the Vax, can we not simply replace all the complex VPU resident functions with &#39;just run on the CPU&#39; and then resolve the external device bindings in normal CPU code?Maybe I misread it, but it read like the VPU does more than the tiny necessary bootstrap to find an image, and chain load it. It reads like it has to do some timing critical initialisations of subsystems, but I cannot but think a CPU should be able to do this for itself, once it has some run state with a kernel in memory.It&#39;s as if the VPU has to make the other bits of blobby hardware be alive, for the CPU to be able to see them. Most odd.Oftentimes there are magic bits of this to do with ring states, and priviledge to alter ring at runtime. Maybe this is part of the story: the VPU initialises a specific ring state and some outer higher trust ring MUST be pre-initialised for the CPU ring state to be allowed to talk to it: it would violate the ring model, if the CPU did it."</p>

Given it&#39;s the thing used for 3D and stuff, I imagine it&#39;s going to be crazy fast at certain computations, much faster than the ARM is.Untapped potential of all Raspberry Pies out there... maybe the VPU can be (ab)used to do stuff similar to what the Raspberry Pico can do."</p>

I&#39;ve found it&#39;s very handy for caching while developing scripts which query remote resources, and not have to worry about serialization.[0] https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/shelve.htmlObligatory pickle note: one should be aware of pickle security implications and should not open a &#34;Shelf&#34; provided by untrusted sources, or rather should treat opening a shelf (or any pickle deserialization operation for that matter) as running an arbitrary Python script (which cannot be read)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have yet to see a convincing argument, here on HN or elsewhere, about how these companies are taking advantage of workers.Most of us are old enough to have seen these companies spring into existence, so here are the steps:1) 100% of people are employed or unemployed. Uber (for example) doesn&#39;t exist2) uber starts existing, some previously unemployed people and some previously employed people start working for uber3) those people that willingly took those jobs are being taken advantage ofWhat is the principal that justifies 3? People are not agents of free will, and any sub-utopic framework they have to participate in is immoral? Even if that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d like to see the argument that those people who chose and choose to work at uber have worse outcomes than they otherwise would."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ubers real disruption is labor exploitation but not in the way you think. Uber is allowed to get away with the mistreatment of the Drivers because they define them as independent contractors, but how do they do this?An employee of a company is in traditional terms, somebody who acts for the benefit and interests of a larger entity which engages in business to business or customer interaction, in return for earning a reasonable wage and defined employment terms set by the company.An independent contractor is an individual entity, who by setting their own terms and prices, provides a service for other individual entities for the purpose of earning a reasonable income for themselves.What Uber has done, is see all the protections afforded to employees of a company both traditionally and federally, and sidestep them because they call their drivers independent contractors. It is implied that the Driver is setting their own pricing and terms of employment. They may legally technically be doing so, but what they&#39;re really doing is agreeing to the same terms set by Uber and defined by Uber as every other driver, as if they were employees. This allows Uber to really do whatever they want to an &#34;independent contractor&#34; which has agreed to their terms of not setting their own rates, having no transparency, and being totally subject to Ubers conditional compensation agreements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who dropped C++ almost entirely a decade ago because I couldn&#39;t deal with both the immense complexity and the legacy baggage of C++, this is pretty exciting honestly.What I find a bit strange is that he explains that he&#39;s been working on this since 2015 (with &#34;most of the &#39;syntax 2&#39; design work in 2015-16&#34;) and he doesn&#39;t want to give documentation because &#34;that would imply this project is intended for others to use — if it someday becomes ready for that, I&#39;ll post more docs.&#34;Why this reticence to opening the project and have others play with it and, potentially, contribute to it? I can&#39;t imagine a new language becoming successful with this mindset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pros:- Transpiling to C++ means it will work wherever C++ works. On any toolchain. With relatively little effort. It shouldn&#39;t be hard to add CMake and bazel support, for instance. Even mostly dumb makefiles should be workable.- Approaching the community this way could avoid fracturing the community more than it already is.- Targeting specific success metrics (like CVE causes) could provide focus around design and requirements- Seems simpler and easier to learn and teach.Cons:- The pitch assumes C++ modules are implemented, ready to use, and reasonable accessible.- There will be a lot of tooling to reinvent: static analyzers, syntax highlighters, etc.- At least for a while, debugging cpp2 problems will involve juggling multiple parallel realities: cpp2 code, C++ code, and actual program behavior (i.e. compiled binaries).- Doesn&#39;t address other major C++ ecosystem problems like build times, packaging, build systems, etc. cpp2 could make them slightly worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been engineering videogames in C++ for almost 20years working on AAA games and I can tell you that modern C++ is not very appealing to the vast majority of our industry. Modern C++ it&#39;s overcomplicated and from what I can see all the best software engineers I met in my careen write very simple C++98 code, maybe a bit of C++11 but that&#39;s it. They keep it simple. They don&#39;t need a move constructor because they&#39;ve been already clever enough to solve a prolbem from a different angle. Modern C++ is for experienced C++ developers and it&#39;s solving problems that experienced developers know already how to solve without all this extra complexity. And because of that it&#39;s keeping away young developers...
This new C++ syntax is just a gimmick that we don&#39;t need. The C++ community seems it&#39;s feeding itself to create a new standard every couple of years. It&#39;s just disappointing..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Important to note that this 5th Circuit ruling conflicts with the 11th Circuit&#39;s ruling.  And SCOTUS had previously reinstated an injunction against this very same law.And this 5th Circuit opinion has very idiosyncratic reasoning [0, just the first few pages will blow your hair back].  A sample:  &#34;In urging such sweeping relief, the platforms offer a rather odd inversion of the First Amendment. That Amendment, of course, protects every person’s right to &#39;the freedom of speech.&#39; But the platforms argue that buried somewhere in the person’s enumerated right to free speech lies a corporation’s unenumerated right to muzzle speech.&#34;

How the 1st Amendment might protect a corporation&#39;s religious POV but not its exercise of editorial control is a very good question.  I&#39;m not saying this very conservative SCOTUS won&#39;t adopt the 5th Circuit&#39;s reasoning, but it still seems unlikely.  In my view -- much more likely is that they resolve the Circuit split by adopting the 11th Circuit&#39;s view wholeheartedly.[0]: https://techfreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-09-1..."</p>

What if I have a big list of a complaints about a certain politician (use your imagination, there&#39;s more than one politician to complain about), but the &#34;other party&#34; doesn&#39;t follow me, in fact, I have very few followers overall.So I create a bot that spreads my opinions by replying to millions of other Tweets. Anyone who mentions the politician of interest will receive a reply from &#34;me&#34; (my bot) within 2 minutes. Now I will be heard by millions, and my lawyer is ready should I be banned from the entire site.Now imagine many people doing this, what a cesspool, you make a Tweet and the bot flood gates open. You Tweet about your grandchild and 30 seconds later you have 400 replies expressing &#34;political opinions&#34; about shady websites with cheap Viagra. Twitter can&#39;t ban them though. Welcome to truly free speech. You better learn to code if you want to be heard.We&#39;re already at the point where websites can&#39;t control bots.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here we are, deep down in the dystopia of Automatic Content Classification by robots.Far less important of an example, but I was just put in &#34;Facebook jail&#34; for 24 hours for posting a picture of my son at the beach in his bathing suit with no shirt. Y&#39;know, as one does at the beach. I can only assume it&#39;s because my son has long hair and the Convolutional Neural Network or whatever decided he was a girl and therefore I&#39;m a pervert.Sadly it was the &#34;appeal&#34; I submitted that got me blocked. Presumably by a &#34;human&#34;, but who knows.Before I appealed they were simply going to not show the picture. Appealing got me in &#34;trouble.&#34;  That might be even worse than the original misclassification. On top of that, if I was actually a &#34;community standards&#34; violator who posted potential child exploitation imagery, I&#39;m not sure how a 24-hour ban on activity on Facebook is of any use, either? Except I&#39;m terrified to imagine a world where Meta might have called police on me based on the output of a neural network image classification.Others have said but I&#39;ll say it again: This kind of business doesn&#39;t scale ethically. You can&#39;t have billions of people on a bulletin board. It doesn&#39;t work. Moderation is essential to modern communication. But you can&#39;t do moderation automatically or at scale and in a universal way.Very dark patterns emerge the moment you go FAANG scale and toss algorithms tuning for advertising and &#34;engagement&#34; into the mix, and attempt to do so with the help of computers.&#34;Sad&#34; as it is, we will need to &#34;retreat&#34; back into smaller forums and BBSs where communities self-police.Facebook has infiltrated so many aspects of society. Want to interact with the parents from the local school your kids go to? You have to do that on Facebook. Event announcements? Keeping in touch with your distant aunt? Facebook.If something like Facebook is really a universal utility, it will have to be put under public administration; like the post office. But clearly, that isn&#39;t going to happen and would have other problems.I am going to have to find some other way to engage with old friends and family.Frank Herbert had some intuition with his whole &#34;Butlerian Jihad&#34; thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem is that no automatic method we have now will catch context. There is a difference between &#34;Jews were murdered by Germans during war&#34; and &#34;Jews destroyed German economy before the war&#34; that will not be recognized by any machine we have nowadays. The first is true, the second is bullshit, how algorithm can now this?More, even if Facebook employees humans to do moderation still for some contractor from Asia &#34;Jews destroyed German economy before the war&#34; might not be easy to verify. For a contractor maybe Jews did that, who cares, I have 20 seconds to moderate this and move to other post. The same way if I was asked to moderate some historical details about India-Pakistan conflict or other historical facts about Asia, Africa I have no knowledge about at all.I was reading quite a lot recently about war in Angola and still I have doubts which side was &#34;good&#34; and which was &#34;bad&#34;, besides that people who lived there were hurt in the history like almost no other nation.Even worst. Some, especially historical, facts are judged from different perspective. For instance in Poland Napoleon Bonaparte is a mythologized person that brought hope to Polish hearts to get back their homeland [1]. From the point of view of someone from Austria or Italy, well, Napoleon is considered to be far from hero.We don&#39;t have to go back that far in the history. US intervention in Afghanistan or Iraq can be seen differently depending on somebody views.How to moderate all this?[1] Fun fact: not a big surprise that Napoleon didn&#39;t give a crap about Poland, he even refused to give them a proper King at the short time he could (he has chosen some Saxon prince). At the end, when Napoleon lost, remains of Polish military units were sent to Haiti to help France to maintain their colonies. Many Polish soldiers died from tropical illnesses there, many joined Haitians as they saw that those people were fighting for their freedom like Poles were."</p>

The firmware would need some way to do aborts/timeouts and kick a partially complete request back to software too.Is it complex...?   Yes.    But will the compute savings be worth it...?

Whenever I’m reminded that I’m not alone, I get a little bit more self-compassion and that makes me more excited to release my game and helps me appreciate all the progress and hard work to date.I’ve been working on King of Kalimpong [0] on and off since playtesting a one-week prototype of it in 2014. I had no idea how much work a networked physics vehicle/movement shooter game would be. (I should have, I was 8 years into a programming career).Working part-time was critical (for many reasons), but so was learning that progress is a product of discipline, not motivation, and that I needed to learn “infinite endurance” (I think that’s what Chris Hecker called it).Once I adopted the perspective that I was some finite number of 3-4 hour blocks of concentration away from turning a goofy idea into a game that anyone could play, finishing became something that felt inevitable — as long as I kept going.I’ll take the time to write about my experience after I release (which is now months instead of years away) in case any other game developers get anything out of it.

When you&#39;re making the games it&#39;s a joy - the rest of the stuff can be a real grind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making games right after I joined my university. Those were simple flash-like games with simple gameplay and basic UI/UX. Fast forward 10 years; I started a game studio and we’re a team of 50+ but still making really simple games for mobile. Not that we didn’t try making “huge” games but constantly creating new games and publishing them and seeing them succeed is what it takes to keep making games. As an indie developer, you’ll probably make a dozen or more games before people actually play one of your games. It’s a long battle but making many simple games is more important than trying to make a blockbuster in the first try."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thing is, it‘s true in essence, but talking about this stuff without numbers is completely pointless. It is written in a sensationalist way.1. Subsidies for wood pellets were a thing but are phased out in Germany.2. The awareness of some stupid calculations of burning wood come up quite frequently in the German media (the Twitter thread is like 2-3 years late).3. There are no numbers in the thread about the carbon emitted in the process of producing and shipping wood pellets.4. Not all wood burned in Germany is wood from the US.5. Not all stoves in Germany are utterly bad. The tech advanced in recent years.6. The comparison with coal is kinda dumb, because we had different goals a hundred years ago.- I personally think burning wood in housing areas should be banned entirely for health reasons.- I think the general gist of the thread is true: burning wood is at least partially some kind of green washing scheme.- But the reality is more complex than this thread claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, I stopped reading here, because it is complete bull** &#34;Nearly 40% of Europe’s so-called renewable energy is currently obtained by combusting wood, much of it coming from forests in the US.&#34;I live in Poland and my (self built) house uses a wood pellet heat source. 30% of the surface area of my country is used for woodlands. Most of the wood produced is used by manufacturing industry. One of the byproducts made when manufacturing furniture and other things from wood are shavings, wood chips and wood dust. This can be made into many engineered wood products, but a lot of it is purchased by small manufacturers of wood pellets as fuel. Before I chose a heat source for my house I did enough research to know that the pellets I use (and are mostly accessible here) come from sustainable sources.So if there are countries in Europe that import their fuel wood from US it is not &#34;much of it coming from US&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does not trump the absurdity of heavily subsidizing an american EV company in order to buy their cars, then telling users not to charge them during the winter.As an EU-country citizen I am concerned by the dominance of political appearances in all the workings of EU since before the pandemic. Insisting in formerly-popular CO2 deadlines in the face of long-lasting ukraine war is absurd. Phasing out ICE cars too early is absurd. Subsidizing buying EVs throughout europe, even though many countries clearly can&#39;t support the future EV load is absurd. Fining power production through coal is absurd, as is not having a nuclear strategy. Keeping the marginal pricing of wholesale energy during war, is absurd. Begging the dictator of azerbaijan for oil at the same time that they are attacking their neighbor, while also sanctioning russia for doing the same thing, is absurd.Ursula VdL is a bad leader, and Charles Michel (president of the council) has recently publicly called her out for her bad leadership in energy. This EU that we see now is unrecognizable: inward-looking, woefully stuck in its own processes and populist obsessions, preoccupied with appearances (e.g. demanding gas and and even power cuts from countries that are NOT dependent on russia), and complete lack of vision. I am personally thankful to the US for taking initiative in nearly all fronts: arming ukraine, providing LNG to northern europe, coordinating sanctions and even Pelosi showing her support for democracy in the region."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe it is time for regulatory support. I know it is fashionable to mock the EU regulatory efforts in the US, but the EU has a tendency to step in once something reaches proportions where regulation is actually needed. Ridiculously high roaming charges, for example, have been eliminated through regulation.Once you are the dominant provider of something that is nearing life-essential utility status, you should provide support and escalation routes, and you should be accountable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that many of the answers here, which explain what could have been done beforehand to prevent this - are not very helpful to someone who&#39;s already locked out of their account.It&#39;s never gonna be possible to 100% prevent any possibility that could cause loss of access to your 2FA. Some people will always fall through the cracks - whether that&#39;s due to their own negligence, lack of technical understanding or some algorithmic false positive doesn&#39;t really matter imho.The real problem here is, that there&#39;s nothing that can be done to resolve something like that, AFTER it already happened. Not even if you were willing to pay for support to help you.If you got good contacts, are famous, manage to go viral or something, you might be able to actually get help - but as a regular, boring, everyday person, you&#39;re just fucked. The only &#34;advice&#34; you are gonna get is: &#34;you should have done this or that beforehand...&#34; - and the obvious answer to that is: &#34;I would have, had I only known!&#34;The only thing you can do, is post your story on HN and Twitter, and hope someone from Google reads it, and goes out of their way to actually help you - which obviously is AGAINST standard company procedure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This might sound dumb, but if the phone number belongs to someone else now, could you just call/text them and explain the situation and (eventually) ask them to read you the code or something? Admittedly it&#39;d sound suspicious as heck, but if you&#39;re willing to provide sufficient proof of your identity and somehow offer a reward in a safe manner, the person might understand and be willing to help? You&#39;d have to be pretty smooth about it, but it seems worth preparing for and giving it a try.Alternative idea: If you&#39;re really desperate, you could even try to dig up the phone number owner&#39;s address and show up at their door or something and explain it that way. (Note I&#39;m not recommending these per se; I&#39;m just pointing out what&#39;s possible. Obviously be very careful to consider everything before doing such a thing.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Absolutely absurd. I haven&#39;t touched it for 13 years, and just received an email that they will be billing me $31.25 with 6 hours warning. This, of course, is a few hours after an email saying that my &#34;free subscription&#34; will be expiring in a month, not within hours.The kicker is that the billing FAQ 404s, the &#34;account URL&#34; 500s, and there is no apparent way to log in to the account that they are billing me for.At this point the best I can do is hope they don&#39;t have any real PII to try to collect their bullshit bill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great way to ruin the FogBugz brand and reputation: move everyone from free to paid tier without consent, and send out emails with a short notice telling them they will be charged $30/month - when most of these users haven&#39;t heard from/of them in over a decade. The flood of complaints is hilarious.https://twitter.com/search?q=fogbugz&amp;src=typed_query"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their answer:  Dear &lt;user&gt;,

  Thank you for contacting FogBugz Support. I understand that you have received a billing notice and do not want to be charged. You may be wondering why you have received this communication and wish to have your account deleted.

  In the first place, please be rest assured that you will not be charged unless you have added a valid payment method to your account. The notification you have received is due to the recent changes to the FogBugz Base Subscription Model. Please accept our apologies for any misunderstanding this may have caused.

  Additionally, be aware that your subscription will be automatically canceled and scheduled for deletion 30 days after the current billing period unless you add a valid payment method.

  Finally, please be aware that trial accounts that were not active for a period of 9 months are automatically disabled, and will result in an Error 500 if you try to access the URL. These customers may have still received a notification despite not having an active account or a configured payment method.

  Since there is no further action required from our end at this time, we will be marking this ticket as solved. That said, if still you have any other questions or concerns with which we may assist, please let us know, and we will be happy to help as required.

  Thank you.

  Best regards,
  &lt;NAME&gt;
  FogBugz Support Team

I had a hard time logging in to get in contact with them.
My fogbugz link (for which I should pay) returned 500 Internal Server Error, logging in Firefox didn&#39;t work, in Chrome it said that the password in invalid, and I didn&#39;t get a reset e-mail (tried twice), I&#39;ve logged with Google credentials but I got a &#34;This page doesn&#39;t exist&#34; on a central-supportdesk.zendesk.com page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you are a person who will never in your life end up as any kind of person of interest for the government, handing over data in this way could still be quite dangerous.Phones will often contain data that can facilitate theft and fraud if ending up in the wrong hands. If they&#39;re able to copy everything, including private data from all apps that could be quite bad. For example many countries now use apps to login to online banking, with private keys for the login stored in the app. Will that be copied? Will it ever be found out if one of the 3000 government officials with access to this data sold it on darknet markets?Maybe some months after your travel you suddenly wake up one day to find all your money transferred from your bank account to some account in Nigeria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Terrifying for only 2 reasons:1. Any malicious person savvy enough to pull off a crime of interest to the Feds is smart enough to provide a wiped or burner phone to DHS/ICE, and they have to know this. So, what is the point in doing this if not to target law abiding citizens.2. USGOV has a spotty track record of keeping this information secure. A foreign actor is likely to access this info eventually. As one former government official once joked many years ago - concerning Chinese hacking - &#34;Well, its probably more secure in the CCP&#39;s data center, so I wouldn&#39;t worry.&#34;This is the problem when a non-technical generation makes the rules and regs.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The killer feature of Kodi (on most hardware, for example the Raspberry Pi) is that it can switch the output resolution to match the video you are playing. It also bypasses things like ALSA in order to be able to bit-bang audio in supported formats directly to an external receiver. These are basic functions of normal video playback devices like blu-ray players or cable boxes.A Plasma skin can&#39;t do any of this. So while it&#39;s probably very suitable for things like games and photo frames on a big screen, I fear that it is disadvantaged from the start for video and audio."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having watched most of the GamersNexus video, my takeaways were:- Will maintain some stock for RMAs- Made pre-production boards for 4xxx, will not manufacture- 3080 and above are not profitable for EVGA- NVIDIA is not transparent about pricing with board manufacturers, they find out MRSP same time we do- NVIDIA limits MSRP heavily on cards so they can&#39;t do things to sell more profitable higher end cards- It sounds like (this is my takeaway from GN&#39;s description, not their words) EVGA&#39;s CEO is tired of dealing with NVIDIA, wants to refocus on family, and there isn&#39;t a clear person to replace him and hesitant to sell to people who would mistreat employees/cut corners/damage brand.- Will continue selling power supplies- No plan to work with AMD or Intel making boards, CEO sounded dismissive toward it"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EVGA is doing what every iOS developer secretly dreams of doing whenever they have to deal with some new stupid bullshit from Apple. Respect.Also, I&#39;ve always liked EVGA. I&#39;ve bought a few of their cards over the years, and many power supplies, and I&#39;ve never had a bad experience. It seems like they really care about making quality products, which is pretty rare to see nowadays.If they start expanding into new products with the same focus on quality, that&#39;ll be a net gain for the world. Maybe they&#39;ll try making laptops again?Or maybe this is all just an elaborate power move to put pressure on Nvidia and renegotiate their relationship."</p>

A bit sad, they have been a good company to their customers.I don&#39;t blame them though, it sounds like Nvidia is a PITA to deal with, and the recent pains with GPU shortages and mining have likely exacerbated it as well.My best wishes to their employees, hope they all find good work elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s worth repeating: at this point, MFA that is not based on Webauthn (https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn) should be considered dangerously insecure. Uber almost certainly enforces MFA for remote access; I strongly suspect we&#39;ll end up hearing that it was successfully provided during the authentication step (update: screenshots on Twitter appear to confirm this). As we saw in the case of the 0ktapus campaign, a sufficiently-skilled attacker will simply proxy the MFA calls to the real identity provider in real-time, the user none the wiser.Webauthn, however, binds the authenticator to the domain and port, and requires https as the scheme. If a user gets phished, they cannot be compromised: the phisher&#39;s domain will not match and any Webauthn authentication challenge would fail.So if your workplace is letting you authenticate with SMS codes, push notifications to an app, or 6-digit codes generated by an authenticator app/hardware device, you need to start banging on pots and pans up your reporting chain to get your security team the support they need to make Webauthn + FIDO2 hardware tokens or Webauthn + Mac Touch ID happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are people talking about MFA on this thread. Look, as someone whose day job is responding to such incidents, someone targeting Uber and is persistent will get in, MFA or not. Infostealers for Mac are a thing (Uber is a mac heavy shop I hear) and that&#39;s all it takes to steal cookies and tokens post-mfa, or why even bother with that, if you&#39;re running code just make it a reverse shell.The big screw up here is powershell script on a network share. A cheap pentest would have uncovered something like that.Modern security is not perimeter focused where you try to keep the bad guys out. Yes, you should do MFA,firewalls,vpns the whole schtick but(!!) your presumption should always be that threat actors already have a foot-hold in your network. This is very important because it helps you  focus on basic things like scripts and gpos with creds in them but also you treat internal devices the same as internet exposed devices. It&#39;s sort of what the whole &#34;zero trust&#34; thing is about as well. In other words, host/user compromise is a given but lateral movement should be at least as difficult as breaching the perimeter.But my prediction is, just like top commenters here, they will slap MFA on it and of course cleanup scripts with creds and call it fixed until the next compromise. Oh and FYI, MFA on VPNs is a PITA, that&#39;s rarely done for good reason, instead you use device certificates in addition to passwords which is what the recommendation should be not yubikeys or webauthn (vpn!=web??) because VPNs need to reconnect and you can&#39;t have people insert a yubi each time their connection drops. Ideal setup would have 7 day valid (or however long is reasonable for users to disconnect their PC and remain out of office) mutual-auth certs+ocsp getting conditionally reissued new certs to remain connected (compliance stuff like patching, unapporoved software,security alerts for the device). If you think about it, you typically issue users two yubikeys not just one so if the backup gets stolen you have a problem depending on how easy it is to social engineer users or reset their password with a good yubikey but a stolen laptop means certs+password revoked immediately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unconfirmed method of breach: https://twitter.com/hacker_/status/1570582547415068672- Socially engineer an employee to get on their VPN (could have been prevented with webauthn / hardware 2fa)- Once on VPN, scan their intranet and find a network share- Network share has powershell scripts with admin credentials for their PAM vendor, Thycotic- From there can get full access to all systems"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is so much interesting stuff going on in GPU compute that isn&#39;t crypto. I&#39;m really excited about this because there are SO MANY gpus that are now going to be cheaper than sand. There is A LOT that can be made of that and I intend to get mine. I think the crypto boom really covered up what we can really, really do with GPU compute and possibly stifled adoption and innovation but now we&#39;ve got so many just sitting around. Which is super useful as we move more into a world after being able to get things manufactured and shipped world wide in what feels like an instant."</p>

And there&#39;s now effort underway to be able to import Figma files.edit: okay, I&#39;ve gotten signed up with penpot, made rudimentary sketches, it seems solid and promising. I&#39;m now a fan and I think this seals the deal for me, I&#39;m glad that it was an easy decision. And I will give them the benefit of the doubt when it&#39;s not exactly up to par because 1) they seem to be new and characterize themselves as still being in beta and 2) it&#39;s self-hostable OSS and the inherent security of this offering is something I value deeply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since 2012, through the eras of Photoshop, Sketch, InVision, XD, Figma, and whatever else, I&#39;ve been using Antetype: https://www.antetype.comFor me, it&#39;s been a 10x tool since it was always the only piece of software that was designed from the ground up as a UI design tool, rather than being some other kind of app that was pressed into service for UI design. Auto-layout, responsiveness, and flexible components that can be edited per instance without breaking their link to the master component are all features that were present from day one rather than being awkwardly bolted on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a designer but an engineer that reads designs, and Figma really is a game changer.  High quality collaborative designs, great UX, and rather inexpensive to users.Exactly what Adobe would need to stay relevant because they’re usually the opposite on these fronts :-)I can’t see switching being too realistic.$20 billion is a lot of money.  That’s worth more than Cloudflare, Snap, Spotify, and just $3b shy of Zoom’s current market cap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"* I far, far, far prefer Craigslist interface to anything else in that space. It&#39;s clear and focusedIts search engine too - I get things I search for in the area I search for.For me, Kijiji and Facebook marketplace are awful UI, awful distractions, and give me 10,000 &#34;suggested&#34; or &#34;fuzzy searched&#34; things in random order, suppressing things I&#39;m actually looking for. And I&#39;ve completely given up on eBay over last decade.However.* Nothing is on Craigslist anymore in my area (Greater Toronto Area). Until about... 5-6 years ago, I could find comparable number of photography, computer, music &amp; kids stuff on Craigslist and Kijiji. Today, Craigslist is a desert, a void, an oasis of empty search results.So network effect wins, as always :-/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate FB Marketplace.It&#39;s actively hostile to buyers.Like, try to find a &#34;kinda nice&#34; bicycle. You can&#39;t find the bicycle category  (though it does exist as a sub-group of Sporting Goods), you can&#39;t just say &#34;show me bikes&#34; unless you hack the URL, you can search for the word &#34;bicycle&#34; but for some reason people selling a &#34;Specialized Rockhopper&#34; think you know it&#39;s a bicycle so don&#39;t use that word.Oh, and when selling, they just suggest random categories instead of letting you choose from their heirarchy. So you get bicycles in Hobbies. You get them in Sporting Goods. You get them in Bicycles. But... You can&#39;t search for them by type.That&#39;s not even complaining about the lack of attributes, like &#34;type=BMX&#34; or &#34;type=Mountain&#34; or &#34;Size=Large&#34; or &#34;Frame Material=Carbon Fiber&#34;... all of which are in Craigslist and eBay.And! when searching, they actively work to inject ebay-like selling (non-local) into the mix by resetting my distance preferences every time I change the search. &#34;Find bicycles&#34; -&gt; &#34;Find bicycles in 30 miles&#34; -&gt; &#34;Find &#39;Specialized Rockhopper&#39;&#34; -&gt; Why am I getting &#34;Ships To You&#34; results?! Why am I getting non-bicycle results?! Oh. They reset my distance again.^-- BTW they do this because they actually make money when the sale happens through FB. If you just buy it in-person with cash they don&#39;t get a cut. Misaligned incentives, as they say.And! even if I do find the bicycle category, if narrow the category by searching with a word in there, like &#34;Rockhopper&#34; it takes me out of the bicycle category to do the search!G. A. R. B. A. G. E."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with Craigslist isn&#39;t that it looks old, the problem is that they seemingly refuse to modernize anything else about the site. Craigslist is chock full of spam and people abusing the search feature. I&#39;m no anti-spam guru, but surely there is a way to cut down on people submitting the same thumbnail dozens of times using as many keywords as they can so their cellphone screen repair service shows up when looking for just about anything.Craig is no saint, and actively goes after any competition to his site. That, coupled with the complacency or refusal to go after spammers leaves me with a very sour opinion of the platform and Craig himself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read these articles sometimes about crypto games, but they all never seem to describe the actual game, it’s like crypto is the primary concern, and game is secondary, and i’m getting the distinct impression none of these games are any fun and everyone in the space has to avoid mentioning it.I think that the people writing these things only have a very slim grasp of gaming, but they know it would be a good market to capture"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What Went Wrong?It&#39;s in the title of the article. It&#39;s a &#34;Blockchain Game&#34;. That&#39;s what went wrong. It was a flawed concept from its inception. Blockchains are pretty cool from a math/cryptography standpoint, but they really do not provide added value in most areas people try to apply them to.CryptoKitties is a digital trading card game. You get cards, you can &#34;breed&#34; cards together to make new cards, you trade/buy/sell cards. That&#39;s it. Nowhere at any point in this &#34;game&#34; is a blockchain necessary. Nowhere at any point does a blockchain add any value whatsoever. In fact, due to transaction fees, I&#39;d argue the blockchain actively detracts from the game.The idea of an artist signing their work in a cryptographically unique way is not new or revolutionary, and it certainly doesn&#39;t need a blockchain. There&#39;s a reason the general sentiment the art community has towards NFTs is overwhelmingly negative: it&#39;s because they literally actively harm us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I don&#39;t see addressed in this article is that as far as I know, it&#39;s basically impossible to trust the reported price or volume of NFT transactions, because there&#39;s no way to distinguish fake wash trades from real ones.So it&#39;s hard to draw any conclusions about whether the data reflects an actual peak in user activity, or just a peak in scams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great writeup overall. I was happy to see Tyler&#39;s initial outreach before conducting his tests [0]. However, please note that these tests are also being revised shortly after some brief feedback [1]:- The sendfile tests at the end actually didn&#39;t use sendfile, so expect much greater performance there.- All the Caddy tests had metrics enabled, which are known[2] to be quite slow currently. Nginx does not emit metrics in its configuration, so in that sense the tests are a bit uneven. From my own tests, when I remove metrics code, Caddy is 10-20% faster. (We&#39;re working on addressing that [3].)- The tests in this article did not tune reverse proxy buffers, which are 4KB by default. I was able to see moderate performance improvements (depending on the size of payload) by reducing the buffer size to 1KB and 2KB.I want to thank Tyler for his considerate and careful approach, and for all the effort put into this![0]: https://caddy.community/t/seeking-performance-suggestions-fo...[1]: https://twitter.com/mholt6/status/1570442275339239424 (thread)[2]: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/4644[3]: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5042"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like we never see HAProxy in these reverse proxy comparisons. Lots of nginx, Apache, Caddy, Traefik, Envoy, etc.The HAProxy configuration is just as simple as Caddy for a reverse proxy setup. It&#39;s also written in C which is a comparison the author makes between nginx and Caddy. And it seems to be available on every *nix OS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote up a few notes on my Caddy setup here https://muxup.com/2022q3/muxup-implementation-notes#serving-... which may be a useful reference if you have a static site and wanted to tick off a few items likely on your list (brotli, http3, cache-control, more fine-grained control on redirects).I don&#39;t think performance is ever going to matter for my use case, but one thing I think is worth highlighting is the quality of the community and maintainership. In a thread I started asking for feedback on my Caddyfile (https://caddy.community/t/suggestions-for-simplifying-my-cad...), mholt determined I&#39;d found a bug and rapidly fixed it. I followed up with a PR (https://github.com/caddyserver/website/pull/264) for the docs to clarify something related to this bug which was reviewed and merged within 30 minutes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"from the article,&gt;&gt;As much as we love exciting new features, we also want to see people create games on the full spectrum of devices for everyone to enjoy.This is one of the main attitudes of the Godot team I really appreciate a lot. It might be easy for people in more developed nations to upgrade their hardware every few years, but there&#39;s people still playing games running on computers from 2002 and before. I used to know of a player who used to play (an old MMORPG) games on a computer he aimed a table fan at to keep it cool. The whole casing was open, it was kinna funny to look at it and it had hardware he got as a birthday gift more than 10 years ago. He played that old MMORPG because newer games wouldn&#39;t even start on that old thing. But most people who played that MMO were in the same boat, it was one of the very few ones they could run.The requirements for some of the games coming out these days is sometimes so insane a lot of people from around the world are unable to play them. I always found it funny how we had so much developer time wasted on supporting ie6 because a small percentage of people were unable to upgrade their browsers, but when it comes to gaming, all bets were off and you are now expected to spend a few grand a year on upgrading your computer to play newer games. And don&#39;t get me started on the bandwidth costs to play some of the new games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with Godot back in the early 3.x timeframe (3.1? 3.2?) and then fell away and spent some time with Unity. But between some of Unity&#39;s missteps and Godot getting dotnet 6 support it is time to give it another go, plus a bunch of nice changes to gdscript that might make it something I&#39;m okay with using (functions are first class citizens now unlike before where you just passed the name of the function as a string which always felt incredibly gross).Though based on the discord conversation there are still a lot of bumps even in the beta so I would not expect smooth sailing yet, but lets see if it is any good.For anyone interested, the main documentation on their site is still pointing at 3.x. If you want the docs for 4.0 start herehttps://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/index.html"</p>

It&#39;s reminiscent of Microsoft&#39;s anticompetitive behavior in the early 00s. Figma is the better product and Adobe knows it - but instead of using that to light a fire under them and work harder to create a better product, Adobe just used its deep pockets to make the problem go away.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Used to work for a “high risk” payment processor, we inherited tons of accounts that were terminated by Stripe, Square, and PayPal. Here’s one small bit of inside info that may help the newer businesses out there:Most real payment processors (e.g. banks, merchant services companies) “underwrite” a company BEFORE allowing them to process. Underwriting means they look over the business model, financials, etc and make sure the business is an acceptable risk, not doing anything illegal or against their terms, etc. So you’re more likely to be declined initially, but if you’re lit up, you should be good for the future because the underwriters actually saw the deal and approved it.While I haven’t worked for these other companies, a lot of experience seems to show that Stripe, Square and PayPal operate differently: they light up ANYONE, and then only underwrite when the account hits a critical threshold of revenue. So it’s easy to get an account there, but if you scale up, that’s when you’ll be scrutinized and potentially terminated. It’s a very unethical practice because it ends up hitting businesses at the worst possible time, when the termination or suspension causes a huge financial hit.So basically, always have a backup processor and use these web based services at small scale to prove out your model, but NEVER rely on them as your sole payment solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a very similar experience, except it was on our launch day.We hadn&#39;t charged a single live customer yet, but we had done plenty of tests using the Stripe testing environment. So we go live with a huge launch event, and we have customers signing up in droves. When they get to the last step -- payment -- they get an error.Logging in to the dashboard I didn&#39;t see any indication that there was anything wrong with our account. No alerts or notices. We had already gone through the approval process you go through when signing up, and been told we were approved.The thing that surprised me the most was that there was just no indication anywhere that our account would not be able to charge cards. Wouldn&#39;t it make sense for there to be an indicator somewhere that just says &#34;Not ready yet&#34;?Apparently, they had never even begun reviewing/vetting us since the time we signed up for the account months earlier. We reached out to customer support and it took them about two weeks to get us activated. And, similar to OP, they never gave us a shred of information about what was going on. I still don&#39;t know to this day what the issue was.Next time I build something with Stripe I&#39;m going to test it in production before launching, with my own real credit card!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is bad.There are more and more Stripe horror stories like this, and from an outsider perspective it looks awfully like PayPal behaved back in the day (probably still does but I&#39;d never touch it again as a merchant).I have positive experiences with using Stripe in my last startup and we&#39;re currently building Stripe integration on another, which will process about 50% of our revenue (the other payment method being direct wire transfer).There might be just a tiny minority of people that end up treated like this, but with every story, I&#39;m less confident about our move."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Prior to the merge ethereum’s trust was controlled by the organizations with the most money who bought/built massive data centers to mine it.With the merge &amp; staking that abstraction layer has disappeared and it’s still the organizations with the most money who control it.Sure it’s great that non-productive math problems no longer need to be solved &amp; consume so much energy and hardware to make it all work. And it may be an incremental improvement over traditional global finance because there is a much greater ability to publicly scrutinize what goes on.But no one should consider this a fundamental paradigm shift &amp; democratization compare to traditional financial systems controlled by a a very small number of big players. Their influence still can override the mining process that’s supposed to be the final word on transactions.Although I’ll clarify a bit: I’m actually a proponent of having a layer of human judgement that can fix a problem when things go off the rails. The issue is that in crypto this layer is even less accessible to smaller players than in traditional finance. The DAO was able to throw its weight around and get a hard fork, but how many other groups with much less influence have suffered from similar problems and exploits without that same benefit?Yes, even in traditional finance there are some types of irreversible fraud. But for every day transactions, for using money as a daily part of transactions necessary to live your life and not just as a speculative investment, crypto falls far short.If a criminal spies on my credit card # as I make a purchase and uses that to go on a spending spree I can fix it with the credit card company with little cost but a few hours of time and frustration. If my wallet is pick pocketed or I simply lose it by accident I have a similar recourse to mitigate the fallout. Crypto? No. It may, eventually, have some other benefits though that’s yet to be seen. But as a major change &amp; liberation of people from massively powerful banks and governments there seems to be nothing more that shouted rhetoric and wishful thinking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It&#39;s like Finland has suddenly shut off its power gridSo, have we observed global energy usage go down by about one Finland?Shouldn&#39;t that be observable somehow? Shouldn&#39;t there be some power stations reducing their output as a reaction to reduced demand?Anyone know how this would be visible, and on what kind of time frame we expect it to become visible?I&#39;m not claiming it hasn&#39;t happened. I just feel surprised to not see more coverage of that in this article, nor here in the comments. Energy efficiency is largely the point of this major change. Shouldn&#39;t there be graphs of the power grids everywhere showing a big drop? Maybe my expectations are just off on that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Merge is one of the largest technological events in the industry to date.I feel kinda ashamed. I work in the IT industry and I claim to have knowledge about (&#34;good&#34;) software engineering practices, distributed systems,  compilers, algorithms, etc. Nevertheless, I didn&#39;t understand a word of what the article is saying. Could you recommend serious references (preferably books and not random blogs) I could read to catch up with what&#39;s going on with crypto these days? I&#39;m not planning to &#34;buy&#34; crypto; I would like to understand the technicalities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sounds like they have a interesting history behind the creation of Penpot:&gt; Penpot was (effectively) born in a Kaleidos personal innovation week (PIWEEK, aka recurring hackathon) in 2018. Back then we had been recently forced to break one of our sacred rules at the company “only open source tools and platforms are allowed to build technology” due to F1gm4’s overwhelmingly productivity boost for designers at the company. “We are second-class citizens in open source, it’s frustrating and it’s painful!” they cried, and they were right.https://kaleidos.net/ seems like an interesting place to work as well.Gonna be exciting to see where Penpot moves from here. I&#39;m a 100% Figma user who just signed up for Penpot and gonna see if it&#39;s possible to adopt for my own workflows.Particularly interesting for me as a Clojure/Script developer is that Penpot is written in Clojure and ClojureScript, but the average user won&#39;t care about that. But will also be interesting to see if they&#39;ll be able to keep iterating at the same speed as they currently are, and how the language will affect it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the beauty of FOSS. It might be rough at the edges but you can always have access to it and not have to worry about losing your daily driver (talking to you Figma). Every organization  needs to start thinking about this and invest in good FOSS tools for any recent technology to avoid business continuity  risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m excited to see alternatives to Figma, because using it is like an emotional rollercoaster for me. There are times when I&#39;ll open a massive project file with hundreds of frames, each with thousands of graphical nodes. And even then, I can zoom in and out with no friction at all, it&#39;s just buttery smooth. I&#39;ve been a developer for over a decade, and I have no idea at all how they&#39;re able to pull that off. It&#39;s a technical marvel.On the other hand, it&#39;s far from what I would want for a modern design tool. Managing tokens, or anything from the &#34;design system&#34; world, is an absolute headache. Compared to the efficiency of the dev tools I use, it feels like Figma (and every other design tool) is just light years behind.Even when I use a tool that&#39;s built specifically for that purpose, like Supernova, I still feel pretty underwhelmed. I&#39;m not sure exactly what I&#39;m looking for, but I know that the current landscape doesn&#39;t cut it for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Notable highlights for me:&gt; Lockdown Mode is available in iOS 16 and coming soon in iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura.&gt; Web browsing - Certain complex web technologies are blocked, which might cause some websites to load more slowly or not operate correctly. In addition, web fonts might not be displayed, and images might be replaced with a missing image icon.The first sentence I believe is referring to disabling JIT (just in time compilation of Javascript), which is dangerous as it allocates W+X pages which are often used by the final stage of an exploit. Apple did an amazing job already of hardening iOS by severely restricting which applications can use JIT (and this is their justification for why non-Safari browser engines are not allowed on iOS) and even enabling per-thread memory page permissions. Many more details are in this fantastic post from Google&#39;s project Zero: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/09/jitsploitatio...Overall it&#39;s very interesting to see Apple invest so significantly in something that will benefit relatively few users -- not that I&#39;m complaining!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Lockdown Mode is not a configurable option for Mobile Device Management by system administratorsThis is the best news. Otherwise, you can bet your IT department would be throwing that switch on for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For kids over 1 year, some sanity saving notes (I have more than 4 kids, was about to go crazy when I got my second and then learned the things below):- everyone wakes halfway up multiple times each night to see if everything is OK. Make sure they don&#39;t fall asleep with anything that can&#39;t stay with them during the night: music, tv, light, food, drink or another person (you or others).- to teach kids to sleep, make them feel safe about it. What I did was walking in at a fixed schedule, starting at exact 3 minutes between the first night (I used a digital kitchen timer back then, a smartphone later) and increasing by two minutes every night. Surprisingly fast, my kids learn that I didn&#39;t disappear, and he&#39;ll be around even if they don&#39;t cry. Once they realized this they started playing with the toy the were allowed to keep in the bed. But, keep in mind: don&#39;t stop coming back if they are silent. A major part of the idea is that they realize that they don&#39;t have to do anything to make sure we don&#39;t forget them. Oh: and keep a very close ear with them in the beginning so they don&#39;t wake up and think they are alone.I never really could get myself to accept the idea that &#34;they need to cry themselves to sleep&#34; and every thing I tried before this didn&#39;t work on my oldest.This worked on my oldest kid, she started sleeping through the night within a week and also became calmer and I got my sleep back. With the rest of them it took 2-3 days only since I started earlier (shortly after they was a year old).Maybe other methods work too, but this was easy for us and we didn&#39;t have to let the kids cry to sleep or anything else I have seen recommended online that I didn&#39;t like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My partner is a doctor mainly working in early childhood prevention. When she did some recent training on evidence based early childhood care (which is surprisingly rare, most early childhood care is not really evidence based), she learned a couple of things that she said she really would like to have known when we had our children were born.One is that you get told a lot about averages. So commonly parents get told that babies (should) sleep around 12h a day. What nobody talks about is the variance. There are babies who sleep only 8h a day and others who sleep close to 20h. So you end up with parents who thing they need to get their child to sleep, even though the child is absolutely not tired.Also a lot of people talk about not giving children too much impressions/stimulation. Which is also generally false, giving them stimulation will actually make them tired and sleep better, they also learn stuff. Obviously you don&#39;t do that just before or when going to bed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s so much snark here but I love this. I&#39;d take reading papers like this over mommy blogs every day of the week, even if it&#39;s to state the ostensibly obvious.Does anyone have any other interesting child-rearing resources in this style?"</p>

They really wanted to make this a political organization, and were willing to forgo a staggering amount of tax savings - in fact, $17m in tax donating away a $3b asset.  Probably the least effective estate planning from a raw $ perspective in history.Major props to the family for doing this - this is now the definition of &#34;putting your money where your mouth is&#34;, and I hope this model is a success and serves as a template for others to follow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had the opportunity to design my own set of wheels with a friend for my Mustang GT. I put a thread together with photos of the process from start to finish, it was a lot of fun. I don&#39;t have the Mustang anymore, but the wheels are stacked in my garage awaiting a future project. https://www.mustang6g.com/forums/threads/arcane-stellar-–-a-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One day, I believe car design regulations will be amended to allow fully electric braking (ie. no hydraulics, drums, rotors, or pads).   At that point, the motor can be moved into the wheel (unsprung mass = bad, but weight savings from not needing an axle or gearbox will outweigh this).  Suspension and steering design is then far easier, because there is no axle to need to keep straight.Braking redundancy will be achieved by having motors/brakes on all four wheels, and within each motor 3 independant phase coils with independant controllers, such that there are effectively 12 brakes on a car.   Normally the controllers work together for smooth braking, traction control, software differential, etc.  But even after 3+ failures braking performance should still be satisfactory for an emergency stop.Obviously braking energy needs to go somewhere.  In the happy case, it&#39;s regen&#39;ed into a battery.  If the battery can&#39;t accept it, it gets dumped into dump resistors.  If the dump resistors fail, it gets dumped into motor coils (of which there are 12 remember).  Obviously the motor coils will heat up very fast, so this is probably a one-use-only failsafe, like airbags.So the whole system (except the pedal itself) is 12 way redundant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; When crashes do occur an engineer needs to spend time to diagnose how it happened and what caused it. Since Pingora&#39;s inception we’ve served a few hundred trillion requests and have yet to crash due to our service code.&gt; In fact, Pingora crashes are so rare we usually find unrelated issues when we do encounter one. Recently we discovered a kernel bug soon after our service started crashing. We&#39;ve also discovered hardware issues on a few machines, in the past ruling out rare memory bugs caused by our software even after significant debugging was nearly impossible.That&#39;s quite the endorsement of Rust. A lot of people focus on the fact that Rust can&#39;t absolutely guarantee freedom from crashes and memory safety issues. Which I think misses the point that this kind of experience of running high traffic Rust services in production for months almost without a single issue is common in practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For any of the Cloudflare team that frequents HN, curious if you have an eventual plan to open-source Pingora? I recognize it may stay proprietary if you consider it to be a differentiator and competitive advantage, but this blog post almost has a tone of &#34;introducing this new technology!&#34; as if it&#39;s in the cards for the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m mildly blown away to read, &#39;And the NGINX community is not very active, and development tends to be “behind closed doors”.&#39; Is this a reflection of the company, nginx (now owned by F5) going the way of an Oracle-style takeover of WebLogic from another era?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Posted this two years and five months ago, but its still relevant: My nothing to hide argument;Nothing to hide is an incomplete sentence. Nothing to hide from who? surely you want to hide your children from abusers and predators? Don&#39;t you want to hide your banking details from con artists and fraudsters? Your identity from identity thieves.. Your location from burglars, your car keys from car thieves or your blood type from rich mobsters with kidney problems..we don&#39;t know who are any of these things. So we should protect ourselves from all of them, in effect we have everything to hide from someone, and no idea who someone is.edit; let me just add the obvious, that the government and police, Google and Facebook, are made up of many someones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bruce Schneier put it quite succinctly in his article The Eternal Value of Privacy (from 2006):Some clever answers: “If I&#39;m not doing anything wrong, then you have no cause to watch me.” “Because the government gets to define what&#39;s wrong, and they keep changing the definition.” “Because you might do something wrong with my information.” My problem with quips like these – as right as they are – is that they accept the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong.

After downloading a QR reader app, taking a picture with my phone, uploading the picture to the app, then realizing there was too much glare and trying again, they eventually just gave me a beer and put a tally mark on a notepad.Just a few weeks ago I used a QR code to join a WiFi network and it took like 2 seconds (it found the network and entered the password for me).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(I am a black man)I feel like the statement that the layoffs &#34;were carried out through an Anti-Racist/Anti-Oppression lens&#34; puts a target on the backs of the people who you claim to be helping.If you&#39;re affected by layoffs described this way, you then question whether that was because of who you are.That then makes it harder for the minorities you claim to be &#34;helping&#34; to stay in the room anywhere else because of bad will generated by some company that wanted the headlines to include their diversity push.Edit: In summation, do not conflate your layoffs with your &#34;diversity&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This line seems to be referenced a lot in these comments:&gt; Layoffs like this can have a more pronounced impact on marginalized communities, so we were particularly focused on ensuring our layoffs – while a business necessity today – were carried out through an Anti-Racist/Anti-Oppression lens.Sounds like they are taking steps to make sure whoever was chosen for layoffs were not chosen for racist reasons.But so many comments are making the leap to they are targeting white people for layoffs and claiming this layoff is racist against white people.For example this comment:&gt; People have lost their damn minds. This is actual institutionalized racism.and this:&gt; I consider myself very ‘liberal’ per American standards (pro abortion, pro lgbt rights, pro racial diversity and acceptance), and this to me screams of woke culture gone wild. Looks like anything can be weaponised.You can find more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Atari in 1983 went from the leader in video game production to completely imploding. In 1979, four of their best programmers left after demanding equity in the sales and were refused. Their CEO Ray Kassar famously said, &#34;You’re no more important to those projects than the person on the assembly line who put them together. You’re a dime a dozen. You’re not unique.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a company big enough to be in the HN headlines (sorry, have to stay somewhat anonymous) where development virtually stalled for a couple years after a mass exodus event. The CEO went on a rampage and fired some people on the spot for something they weren’t even responsible for, which destroyed the already fragile morale and created a steady exodus of good talent over a couple of years.It didn’t kill the company for several reasons, but primarily because:1) The company had enough momentum, revenue, and cash in the bank that they could go on hiring sprees to replace everyone. The new hires had a lot of churn when they realized what was going on, so they just kept hiring until enough replacements stuck around.2) Many of the employees who didn’t quit saw this as their opportunity to rise through the ranks and fill the voids. They weren’t wrong and it paid off for many of them in the form of rapid promotions and advancement. The CEO became more hands-off as he realized his micromanagement wasn’t helping, so they basically inherited a slightly better situation.After this experience, I don’t really see a developer exodus killing any big company with good momentum and decent cash reserves. As long as a company has cash flow they can spend their way into hiring replacements as long as it takes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a senior engineer is weird when looking retrospectively. I remember being a junior and experiencing what the author is talking about with respect to puzzlingly staring at my seniors when they could answer obscure questions.Now I do it and do the same things they did with me: facilitate my thought and troubleshooting process rather than give me answers. I think the people that are successful in Senior+ engineering are that way because of certain technical and character traits they&#39;ve developed.One is a willingness to be right in the long run. When I was a young engineer I would make my cases hard with data. As a senior engineer I sit back and let the machine mull for a while because I know that&#39;s what the engineering machine will do regardless of how technically right I may be. Another is knowing that right isn&#39;t always right. Sometimes the right answer is technically wrong, or the learnings of wrong need to be made before we collectively can be right. Another is a lot of patience; patience for myself, patience for others. I recently admitted I was behind on work because my power was out for three straight days. Young me would&#39;ve found a coffee shop and worked those days with a single monitor down to the bone. Senior me took my dog to the park.Not everyone makes it to senior, had I not forked my path in certain places I don&#39;t think I would have. My advice, relish your time as non-senior and ask lots of non-technical questions. The technical stuff comes over time and by necessity."</p>

He ended up feeling stupid, but I was trying to be encouraging because his code was pretty good aside from some missing punctuation, which will come with practice. He ended up switching majors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Where I am often hung up in comparison is due to age. I dropped out of college and spent my early 20s learning agriculture and construction. Now I work in software engineering and my current manager is younger than me. Not only is he younger than me, but he&#39;s been able to climb up to an engineering manager in a shorter amount of time than I&#39;ve been working as a SWE. So I feel really lame - wasted so much time early in my life and still seem to be wasting time."</p>
