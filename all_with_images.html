								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two statements here regarding things that have happened:&gt; the Core Team placing themselves unaccountable to anyone but
themselves&gt; we have been unable to enforce the Rust Code of Conduct to the standards the community expects of us and to the standards we hold ourselves toIt&#39;s possible that there were CoC violations that they were not able to moderate, that the actions available to them were limited (e.g., they would have initiated a ban but they were not able to ban a core team member), that a core team member intervened to prevent effective moderation, or that the core team prevented the mod team from being able to access official core team channels in order to moderate.Seems to be a wide variety of possibilities and leaving the nature of the situation ambiguous* will likely make it difficult for a new mod team. I hope the now-former mod team are open and direct with new or potential mod team members about the environment they&#39;re entering.* I do think it&#39;s right for the mod team to not reveal the specifics in public; that would likely provoke targeted harassment and make the situation much worse"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any good way to craft a message like this?If they outlined specific issues then it would invariably devolve into armchair quarterbacking of those issues rather than the the underlying question of what kinds of checks-and-balances should exist for the Core Team -- gossip, accusations, and political discussions are a lot more fun than debating governance structures.On the other hand, if no specific issues are raised then people are frustrated by having only a partial understanding. Because it&#39;s a lot simpler to evaluate an argument if you already know whose side you&#39;re on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have used Rust for years, but I never bothered with looking into the governance structure.How are team members selected? Who has authority to kick someone off a team? How are team leads selected? Who can remove team leads?Is it the core team? If so, who picks the core team?I can&#39;t find anything online, except this very bare-bones WIP stub. [1]This seems to be a glaring and surprising oversight.Especially at this point, with Rust becoming more and more popular, the foundation in place for almost a year, and corporate interest flooding into the project, I would have expected proper procedures to already be in place for quite some time.There certainly seem to be other cracks in the system. See for example &#34;I refuse to let Amazon define Rust&#34; by core team member Steve Klabnik, extensively discussed here on HN.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite photograph of a fingerprint is when the Chaos Computer Club reproduced the German Foreign ministers fingerprint from a photo. So much for military grade security.https://www.dw.com/en/german-defense-minister-von-der-leyens...-The core problems with biometrics are that:1) Not revokable (unlike compromised credentials)2) Not a secret3) Usually trivial to reproduce and spoof (even &#34;liveliness&#34; tests)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fingerprints are usernames, not passwords. Here is an excellent (and timeless) post on this fact:https://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2013/10/fingerprints-are-use..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The huge advantage of biometrics (fingerprints, FaceID, etc.) is the ease with which a user can unlock their phone.  A passcode may be better than a fingerprint, but a fingerprint+longer passcode is better than a shorter passcode (or no passcode at all).Having a 12 character alphanumeric passphrase you enter each time you want to unlock is not something most users want to do.See e.g.: https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/what-kick...Only about 49 per cent of the users were setting a passcode, which meant that the remaining 51 per cent were not benefiting from the data protection mechanism. When Apple dug in to understand the reason, the findings revealed that users unlock their devices a lot - on an average about 80 times a day. And about half of its users simply didn&#39;t want the inconvenience of having to enter their passcode into their device, at times. At that time, in 2012-2013, the default passcode length for iPhone was four digits, which happens to be six today.Apple realised that it needed to come up with a mechanism that&#39;s fast and secure, and doesn&#39;t involve typing in the passcode. That&#39;s when Apple introduced Touch ID, which was easy, fast and secure. The way that biometric authentication worked on Apple platforms was that the user must set a passcode to be able to use the biometrics. And just as Apple thought, there was a much higher adoption of biometric-based TouchID. Apple says over 92 per cent chose to use Touch ID and had therefore set the passcode, which in turn meant users were able to use Apple&#39;s data protection encryption system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another article that may be useful:&gt; Americans do not understand the difference between a road and a street.[...]&gt; The value of a road is in the speed and efficiency that it provides for movement between places. Anything that is done that reduces the speed and efficiency of a road devalues that road. If we want to maximize the value of a road, we eliminate anything that reduces the speed and efficiency of travel.&gt; The value of a street comes from its ability to support land use patterns that create capturable value. The street with the highest value is the one that creates the greatest amount of tax revenue with the least amount of public expense over multiple life cycles. If we want to maximize the value of a street, we design it in such a way that it supports an adjacent development pattern that is financially resilient, architecturally timeless and socially enduring.[...]&gt; In the United States, we’ve built a 45 mile per hour world for ourselves. It is truly the worst of all possible approaches. Our neighborhoods are filled with STROADS (a street/road hybrid) that spread investment out horizontally, making it extremely difficult to capture the amount of value necessary for the public to sustain the transportation systems that serve them.* https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2011/11/21/a-45-mph-worl..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone interested in this topic, I highly recommend this channel&#39;s series. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJp5q-R0lZ0_FCUbeVWK6OGLN...&#39;Not Just Bikes&#39; has a ton of other great videos on the channel about what infrastructure makes a good city and what makes one hostile to residents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this article is making the point veey clearly, but it is a very important point: roads are for long distance connections at speed, streets are for local traffic: reaching houses, shops, people. These stroads try to do both and fail at both because the goals are contradictory; you can&#39;t have high speed traffic with lots of side streets and crossing traffic, bikes and pedestrians. It will be too slow for a road or too dangerous for a street, and probably both.Separate traffic that requires different speeds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The essay &#34;Consider the Lobster&#34; by David Foster Wallace came to my mind. In that essay he describes how extraordinary the nervous system of a lobster is and how mindlessly and cruelly we boil them live. If David were still alive, he would definitely welcome this development. I really miss David. I am awestruck by his other essay &#34;This is Water&#34;. I am amazed at his deep insights into human nature and how well he describes it, kindly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Extracts from the LSE report summary:Recommendations relating to specific commercial practices- Declawing. We have high confidence that declawing (removing one or both of the claws from a crab before returning it back to the water) causes suffering in crabs.- Nicking. We also have high confidence that the practice of nicking (cutting the tendon of a crab’s claw) causes suffering and is a health risk to the animals.- Wholesale and retail. We recommend a ban on the sale of live decapod crustaceans to untrained, non-expert handlers.- Stunning. Current evidence indicates that electrical stunning with appropriate parameters for the species can induce a seizure-like state in relatively large decapods, and that stunning diminishes, without wholly abolishing, the nervous system’s response to boiling water. We interpret this as evidence that electrical stunning is better than nothing.- Slaughter (decapods). We recommend that the following slaughter methods are banned in all cases in which a more humane slaughter method is available, unless preceded by effective electrical stunning: boiling alive, slowly raising the temperature of water, tailing (separation of the abdomen from the thorax, or separation of the head from the thorax), any other form of live dismemberment, and freshwater immersion (osmotic shock). On current evidence, the most reasonable slaughter methods are double spiking (crabs), whole-body splitting (lobsters), and electrocution using a specialist device on a setting that is designed and validated to kill the animal quickly after initially stunning it.- Slaughter (cephalopods). Various different slaughter methods are currently used on fishing vessels in European waters, including clubbing, slicing the brain, reversing the mantle and asphyxiation in a suspended net bag. We are not able to recommend any of these methods as humane. On current evidence, there is no slaughter method for cephalopods that is both humane and commercially viable on a large scale."</p>

If A, B, C, D is how much value you provide in different areas, you should try to maximize ln(A)+ln(B)+ln(C)+ln(D) rather than A+B+C+D. Also see &#34;Law of diminishing returns&#34;, &#34;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&#34;In creative fields nobody knows what they&#39;re doing and most time and money is wasted. It&#39;s often as important to think about what thing to do as doing the thing. You will most likely provide great value to your company/work a few days of the year (the days where you implement some feature your customer really needs or where you fix some potential or ongoing big production problem) and most days you will provide break-even or negative value. Also see &#34;Impostor syndrome&#34;.Always automate manual or boring processes. Do not think too much about ROI calculations, they don&#39;t work because productivity in creative fields is very non-linear. Instant feedback is very important for concentration and morale.If you&#39;re prone to anxiety, saving money and building skills allows you to act without fear of major setbacks. And most of the time it&#39;s better to ask for forgiveness than permission."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, after looking over the docs, here&#39;s my comparison list between Remix (which I haven&#39;t used) and other things that I&#39;ve used.- Forms seem better in Remix. Remix seems focused on progressive enhancement here, rather than fetch. Imagine if Next supported POST endpoints, and the idiomatic way of making your site was to use that instead of API endpoints. I hope that we soon see a Remix-compatible form validation library (e.g. something that takes a zod schema, validates it on the server, and handles client-side validation and state tracking).- The nested routes feature sounds interesting, but the docs for it are completely devoid of actual code, so I have no idea how ergonomic it will feel compared to something like Relay (requires complete buy-in to the ecosystem) or Suspense (extremely ergonomic black magic).- The error boundary feature is a very nice touch and this should definitely be ported over to Next."</p>

Of course it&#39;d be nice if someone had actually read it, for my personal vanity, and all those conversations and opportunities people claim blogging leads to.But it&#39;s not the kind of project it would make sense to drive ads to, or even to niche down and grow an audience around a specific topic, since the whole point is to write whatever &#34;gratifies my intellectual curiosity&#34;. But you can&#39;t really submit this kind of thing to reddit or to forums, they ban &#34;blogspam&#34; for very good reasons. There&#39;s no obvious way to promote it and put it in front of people.Instead of blogging I could try engaging in conversations here and on reddit (and maybe on discord or twitter), and that, at least HN and reddit, works amazingly well for having good discussions (if not for making personal connections).But the biggest problem with engaging in social media is that it quickly becomes extremely unhealthy and addictive (in the way that blogging doesn&#39;t). I want to write, and I want to talk to people, but I don&#39;t want to get addicted to refreshing my profile page to look for upvotes and comment notifications (I do have a big problem with the internet addiction).I&#39;m not sure what the right solution to that would be. Does anyone have good ideas? How do you make actual human connection over the internet and engage in intelligent conversations, without getting your dopamine hijacked and skinnerboxed by the social media algorithms?Maybe there&#39;s a space for a platform that would encourage thoughtful discussion somehow, and limit the immediate rewards that make social media so addictive. But then nobody would use that platform, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first software dev job was in the 90&#39;s writing PHP for a mom and pop ISP that was trying to get into app development. It was originally supposed to be Perl, the job interview was something like:Me: demos CRUD app for keeping track of my record collection, hosted on a free siteOwner: You wrote this?Me: Yeah.Owner: This is in Perl?Me: Yeah.So I got hired. The day I got there, he told me they were going to use PHP instead of Perl. Sure, cool, whatever. He told me that I had to start being productive in the first couple weeks or he would have to let me go, couldn&#39;t afford to keep people that weren&#39;t working out. I was down with that. He had some HTML pages that he had created in a WYSIWYG editor, I think it was Dreamweaver, and I was going to add some PHP scripting to those pages.How hard could that be?So I get to work and open these HTML files and I don&#39;t even remember exactly, I think like the login page HTML was 20 pages of code long, maybe I&#39;m exaggerating, I&#39;ve blocked most of it out of my memory but I seem to remember nested tables inside of nested tables inside of nested tables with spacer GIFs and &amp;nbsp;s all over the place and I remember looking at it and thinking: What. The. Actual. Fuck.But I did it! I managed to get the guy to take a look at what the editor he was using actually created and get him to simplify some things, I fixed a few bugs and was working on features and he came in around noon and told me you know what I said about being productive in the first few weeks? Forget about that, we&#39;re good.The week before I was doing manual labor in a factory. It was like going from the 1800s to the 2000s over a weekend. I made $9 an hour, less than I was making stacking boxes on pallets, but of course totally worth it in the long run. Good times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I miss the good ol’ days. Today we have abstractions on top of abstractions on top of JavaScript, of all thingsIt seems I learnt HTML just between these two eras. After the &amp;nbsp;, 1px spacers and tables, and before the piles of abstractions.People cared about doing well formed XHTML and having those W3C Valid XHTML badges, and also those &#34;install Firefox&#34; buttons.This was short so today everything looks ugly to me, old and new, in different ways.I still use (polyglot) XHTML5 (HTML5 if I don&#39;t control everything being input) and avoid frontend frameworks and web fonts when I get to decide. This is a world where implementing a search bar for people who haven&#39;t discovered CTRL+F yet takes 30 lines of dumb Javascript and filters 200 items in 1 second on a slow computer without any caching trick and that does not require minifiers and bundlers. Which does not actually sound impressive, or shouldn&#39;t anyway. A world where when you disable Javascript, the page is still perfectly readable. A world where a silly mistake in the HTML markup is noticed.To build an actual web application where it does not makes much sense to have the content as a web page, I started liking Svelte but I&#39;ll still at least consider doing things by manipulating the DOM directly before deciding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. That took me back. All those things, every day. And table layouts of course. And let&#39;s not forget slicing images, and slapping those into tables too. If I remember rightly, Photoshop had an &#34;export to slices&#34; thing built in. Amazing. Loved it.And of course one of the biggest issues with today&#39;s web: you can&#39;t just view source and copy paste. You&#39;re in the land of chasing back up CSS files, js libraries, or finding yourself unable to steal an image because it&#39;s not just an image you can right click on any more.Golden times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny I just saw this thread, today I learned that my integrated (not removeable) XPS 15 9570 laptop battery just died just a few months after my warranty expired on my Dell XPS laptop... The Internet is littered with complaints about dell PCs failing after warranty, and how recalls are covered up on them frequently.And my XPS desktop had faulty connections on it&#39;s mother board (That were known by Dell even before I bought it) for the Hard Drive controller that I discovered just after the warranty replacement expired on it... 2 problems that lead to costly repair and buying expensive replacement parts.... I have a 10 year old Dell XPS 16 that still runs (granted only windows7), but I never had any problems with it.... XPS quality has declined greatly since my first one.The standard 1 year warranty isn&#39;t enough for the way Dell computers have become shoddy, I&#39;m deeply disappointed in Dell, and will not be buying any more of them... I don&#39;t have time to build my own, does anyone know a rock solid/powerful brand I can buy instead of Dell? I kind of miss Micron PCs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am reminded of an organization I read about years ago with the tag line &#34;Seeing like a mountain.&#34; It was founded by someone who noticed that excess deer were stripping the mountain of vegetation and they concluded that reintroducing wolves was important for creating a sustainable environment.In the US, deer-vehicle collisions make deer the deadliest animal for people that we have in this country.https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-deadliest-animals-in-...In the US: Deer–vehicle collisions lead to about 200 human deaths and $1.1 billion in property damage every year.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer%E2%80%93vehicle_collisi...Part of my incomplete BS in Environmental Studies was a class in quantifying the economic value of natural resources. I did a case study on wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Area that are currently quietly being threatened by the county rail plan.The US used to pay people to fill in swamps and create &#34;productive&#34; land and then learned that swamps do useful and valuable things of various sorts. We updated the name from swamp to wetlands, overhauled their public image and reversed policy. We now protect and restore such areas.Quantifying the economic value to humans of a natural resource is a good means to convince people it needs protecting and it is in your best interest to protect it. This is not &#34;charity&#34; and shouldn&#39;t be viewed as a sacrifice.We are cutting our own throats when we ruin the world because of fixation on some overly simplified idea that it needs to put money directly into our pockets for humans to care about it. One of the best ways to fight such entrenched ideas is to quantify just how much it costs us to think that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool article. They show that Wolves create a “landscape of fear” which reduces deer engagement with roads. So wolves do what hunters can’t; not just reducing populations but also changing behavior. Kind of creepy, if you are a deer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hitting the deer is just the beginning.We were driving on a semi-wilderness highway when a medium-sized deer staggered up from a deep drainage ditch on the same side of the road, about 50 yards ahead. Managed to slow from 65-70 to 50 mph before hitting the animal, which slid along the highway and into the deep ditch on the other side.The slowdown helped limit the van&#39;s damage to $10,000, but it was undriveable. Even if we somehow removed the hood (bent in two over the unbroken windshield), all the fluid had ran out of the crushed radiator and into the semi-wilderness ditch.Luckily it was a hot July afternoon, and a truck going the opposite way came along in 15 minutes. The driver put the deer out of its misery. Had it been in the winter, after sundown, it might have taken hours just to be found.Happened in the 1990s (no mobiles), so we waited for a vehicle heading toward the nearest little town to find a tow -truck. With the van towed to that town (no repair shop), it was another hour before relatives arrived from the bigger town (that tow-truck had a repair shop).The insurance company paid for the repair, then dropped the policy. I never drove that route after noon again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that most of the performance improvements come from PGO, which is enabled with following environment variables. PGO is not enabled in .NET 6 by default, but will be in .NET 7 IIRC.  set DOTNET_ReadyToRun=0 
  set DOTNET_TieredPGO=1 
  set DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops=1

Here are my own benchmarks from a CPU intensive application without any IO and already optimized for allocations. Application runs a task graph either serially or in parallel.  .NET 5
  --------------------------
  |      Method |     Mean |
  |------------ |---------:|
  | RunParallel | 473.4 us |
  |         Run | 513.5 us |

  .NET 6
  --------------------------
  |      Method |     Mean |
  |------------ |---------:|
  | RunParallel | 452.5 us |
  |         Run | 499.8 us |

  .NET 6 PGO
  --------------------------
  |      Method |     Mean |
  |------------ |---------:|
  | RunParallel | 381.8 us |
  |         Run | 412.2 us |

  .NET 5 - .NET 6     -&gt; ~5%
  .NET 5 - .NET 6 PGO -&gt; ~20%

Here is what I learned from micro-optimizing a .NET application:- Use BenchmarkDotNet[0] for general measurements and Visual Studio profiler tools for detailed inspection. They help a lot.- Memory allocations matter. Using capturing lambdas, LINQ, even foreach on interfaces introduce allocations and slows down the application. You can use ClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer[1] to find these hidden allocations.- Using abstractions with interfaces and casting back to concrete types cause some overhead, though PGO will probably eliminate most of these.- Use LINQ cautiously as its variants are mostly slower than explicit coding. E.g. .Any() vs .Count == 0- Checking Logger.IsEnabled() before calling Logger.Debug() etc. helps a lot. You can even automate this with Fody [2], but it breaks Edit&amp;Continue and possibly .NET Hot Reload too, so it may hinder your productivity.[0] https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet[1] https://github.com/microsoft/RoslynClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer[2] https://github.com/jorisdebock/LoggerIsEnabled.Fody"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the same vein as what Linus is trying to do now at LTT, it would be useful if there was a &#34;programming journalism&#34; lab which builds &#34;test benches&#34; to create canonical benchmarks and verify the claims made on tech blogs (etc.).Eg., highly standardised docker builds, on highly standardised hardware, running popular tasks using popular libraries for each &#34;programming tech&#34; (eg., website, stat modelling, event system, ...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen the posts about all the speedups each new version of .NET gets and I&#39;m just wondering, was .NET just alright in performance before all this? Is that the reason they can get all these speedups? :PI&#39;d be interested in some JVM vs .NET 6 benchmarks too, which platform to chose when.EDIT: I know about the benchmarks and I also feel like sometimes these benchmarks are really optimized in a non-idiomatic way. I would love to know how performance idiomatic Java/.NET code is and if one is to start a new project today why one would choose the JVM over .NET or when someone would chose .NET over JVM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, this study has a few &#34;smells&#34; that makes it dubious:&gt; We collected cross-sectional data between November 2019 and July 2020 from
self-selected respondents recruited via media related to psychedelic use such as podcasts and online psychedelic
research conference presentations.This is already a significant bias in participants.&gt; Mental health was assessed with the questions “Do you currently have any psychological, mental health or
addiction concerns?” Participants who endorsed concerns identified specific mental health and substance use
categories from a drop down menu, and were allowed to select more than one categorySo mental health is not actually accessed medically and simply self-reported.To be clear I lack an informed opinion on microdosing psychedelics, but any study that picks its participant from a community engaging in X to study X but then uses the same community to sample their control group (for lack of a better expression) is questionable.EDIT: Page 6 has a table that compare microdosers/non-microdosers and the latter was actually less likely to self-report *any* mental health or substance use problem by 5%. It&#39;s only when using the DASS-21 subscales that they can draw the conclusion that non-microdosers are more anxious, depressed or stressed. Their microdosers/non-microdosers ratio is also almost 1:1."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This study is non-blinded, non-RCT based on individuals who self-selected through social media, self reporting symptoms through an app.While I&#39;m hopeful that psychedelics may prove to be a treatment for some mental health issues, but this study doesn&#39;t tell us much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I replied something similar elsewhere, but I think the real story here is about using tech to administer large scale studies and what that could mean for future research.A lot of people here are discounting the fact that this study would typically be very hard (or impossible) to administer at such a large scale, especially in such a short amount of time.In my mind, the important questions here are:Are the benefits of massive scale studies worth the trade-offs of self-reporting?What can we do to reduce or eliminate those trade-offs?Imagine the scientific value of having easily created, easily administered, massive studies be easily accessible to any research group. If the research data can be made even a little bit more reliable (direct mobile health-kit measurements for example), that&#39;s hugely valuable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For over 25 years I wondered why social events drained me and what neurological phenomenon the metaphor &#34;energy&#34; stood for (which this article and many others like it don&#39;t seem to bother investigating). I&#39;ve recently come to realize that it&#39;s the extent to which you see other human beings as a threat, which causes your brain to keep its &#34;shields up&#34;, which can feel exhausting. After a observing myself a lot during social interactions, I&#39;ve noticed that I feel drained to the extent I think the people around me can potentially judge me: I feel highly drained during extended family events, class reunions or ceremonies, but I feel perfectly fine amongst a small group of friends who have a don&#39;t-give a-sh*t attitude toward social propriety. I&#39;ve also noticed that alcohol (a disinhibitor) can dramatically reduce the drain. It&#39;s also significantly reduced if I find a table with a few people I like, and get engrossed in a deep discussion and end up forgetting that I&#39;m surrounded by other tables.Perhaps this energy we speak of is the energy the brain expends to continuously compute the requirements of the social contract in members of our species who don&#39;t have it sufficiently hardwired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who typically gets their energy depleted around people, there are certain people that increase my energy. There are also times where I almost need to interact with people on a biological level.Listening to my body is the thing that weirdly, used to take up a lot of energy because I wasn’t used to/ allowed to as a child. So I was constantly making difficult real-time decisions.As an adult, I’ve learned how to listen to my body and crucially adhering to it’s signals. As someone who like to think, perhaps too much, its the best investment I’ve ever made."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Parties also generally drain my energy. But I&#39;ve found out something interesting. If people start playing games at a party (like card games), or if there is a discussion of a topic that really interests me, then my energy is magically replenished. Weird."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You know what Amazon did to me? They delisted my product claiming it was counterfeit. Then they started to directly promote and sell my own inventory.I know it was mine because I contacted the brand to check if Amazon had bought from them. They hadn&#39;t. Also, I was the only one selling this item on Amazon so they couldn&#39;t have stolen from someone else. What&#39;s more, I was the only one importing it to the US. I know because I&#39;m acquainted with the brand owners.When I finally managed to get my stuff out of their warehouses, which took almost a year, they admitted that some of the inventory had been &#34;lost&#34; and compensated me pennies on the dollar.It was a surreal, Kafkaesque, experience that still brings back painful memories. I avoid thinking about it but I hope that one day Amazon will crash, burn, and hopefully never recover."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can tell you a more likely story than &#34;big conspiracy on Amazon&#39;s part&#34;.Amazon has systems in place to say &#34;We cannot ship from X to Y anymore&#34;, but they require manual intervention and maybe those tools don&#39;t get used very much. Until someone finds the right button and presses it, orders are dropping into the warehouse to be fulfilled. Ship this sprocket from Vancouver to Calgary since Calgary&#39;s site has none.But the truck didn&#39;t show up, or maybe it did but now it&#39;s got nowhere to go.Now the dock has one section slowly filling up with packages. It&#39;s been days. Dock doors are a limited resource, and here&#39;s a bunch of them with a mountain of packages blocking them. And the site leadership, well, they have metrics to hit. Just like every other cog in the machine, they will be fired if they don&#39;t make rate. What, you thought it was just the lowly associates who are running with dogs nipping at their heels?What&#39;s a site leader to do? Well, there&#39;s a returns department right here. They&#39;ve got tools that can handle the package being returned, allowing them to restock those items, refund the customers, clear the dock, and make everything go back to normal for the site.Sounds like good &#39;Customer Obsession&#39; to get those orders refunded as quickly as possible.Sellers? Those aren&#39;t customers. Those metrics are not something the leadership needs to worry about, so they won&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, going with Apache 2.0 is/was a mistake.There is a clause in the license which implies that almost everybody who uses GitHub/GitLab/etc. to work on an Apache 2.0 project in the common workflows is in breech of the license.Specifically, the license says that every file with modifications has to include a corresponding notice that the file was changed. Nobody does this in practice.Unfortunately the license is simply badly written.Licenses like the GPL don&#39;t have this problem because they only require that a modified version of the software is clearly marked as such without stating how that marking should be done. So the metadata contained in the Git history should be enough to satisfy those superior licenses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MAMEdev hit this problem a few years back as well. Thankfully, the end result of code that needed to be ripped out and rewritten ended up being pretty small comparative to the whole project. A lot of that came down to there being no corporate interests involved, so no corp VS author arguments-- the worst ones to deal with were contributors who were adamant about keeping the original non-commercial license on their contributions."</p>

I feel like if we could really ingrain those 6 words that it would go a long way to blocking these types of phishing scams.Number one thing I tell folks in my security training is to never respond or click a link on an inbound message. Instead, look up your bank or service provider and make an outbound call (or direct URL navigation) to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s so strange to read this is still happening in US. I live in Europe - 95% of such attacks are prevented by something called Strong Customer Authentication, which anybody  serving or providing access to an account (cards including) must implement. Basically, that&#39;s 2FA implemented in myriad different ways. So, this Zelle thing wouldn&#39;t be possible at all: Zelle would have to ask for a SCA verification from the customer, just to connect/use his/her account in the first place. That would eliminate ground for such scamming messages ever appearing (if the customers knew and were accustomed to SCA).Though to be fair, scamming is still present here, typically involving calling older people and trying to persuade them to reveal bank access codes during a phone call. There two differences with US banks here:
- banks are required never to ask for access credentials over insecure channel (phone/email) (though SMS is also not perfect in this regard);
- banks are required to educate customers that they never ask for such credentials, educate about fraud scenarios, etc. And they do (at least the reputable ones)Seems that the PSD2 regulation (including SCA) are really making payments much safer in Europe when you compare to rest of the world.Also, to admit: I&#39;m a head of financial institution here, quite knowledgeable of the field, both on regulatory and on technical level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fell for this, and I have never fallen for a computer scam in my life, nor even had so much as a virus in the last two decades.However, it is very sophisticated.  They somehow managed to actually get a fraudulent charge on my card.  When I got the spoofed message from &#34;my bank&#34;, the first thing I did was log onto my legitimate account.  Sure enough, there was a charge I did not recognize.The rest was just a series of unfortunate &#34;rookie&#34; mistakes  on my part.  But the person who called me was highly professional, easily could have been a real customer support representative and spoke English perfectly with no accent.They took the max, $5,000.  My bank thankfully refunded it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminded me of a tight-packed binary format we used in the trading systems domain almost 20 years ago. Instead of including metadata/field names in each message, it had a central message dictionary that every client/server would first download a copy from. Messages had only type IDs, followed by binary packed data in the correct field order. Because of microsecond latency requirements, we even avoided the serialization/deserialization process by making the memory format of the message and the wire format one and the same. The message class contained the same buffer that you would send/store. The GetInt(fieldID) method of the class simply points to the right place in the buffer and does a cast to int. Application logs contained these messages, rather than plain text. There was a special reader to read logs. Messages were exchanged over raw TCP. They contained their own application layer sequence number so that streams could resume after disconnection.In that world, lantencies were so low that the response to your order submission would land in your front-end before you&#39;ve had time to lift your finger off the enter key. I now work with web based systems. On days like this, I miss the old ways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s staggering to me that people keep making these &#34;rich&#34; data formats without sum types. At least to me, the &#34;ors&#34; are just as important as the &#34;ands&#34; in domain modeling. Apart from that, while you can always sort of fake it with a bunch of optional fields I believe that you kind of need a native encoding to a tagged union if you want to avoid bloating your messages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “Don’t buy stocks when the P/E ratio is over 20” was a good lesson to learn from the 1970s when interest rates were 7%, the Fed hadn’t yet learned what it’s capable of, and most businesses were cyclical manufacturing companies vs. asset-light digital services. Is it relevant today? At a broad, philosophical level, yes. In practical terms, probably not. In the same sense, buying stocks at all seemed like nothing but speculation in the 1920s because corporate disclosures were so opaque. By the 1970s that had changed, and you could begin to make rational, calculated long-term decisions that put the odds in your favor.The funny thing is that exactly this kind of talk was all the rage leading up to both the 2000 and 2008 crashes. The boom makes it impossible to imagine what the bust will look like, and vice versa. Most people are utterly incapable of seeing 180 degrees through the business cycle. They simply can&#39;t do it and rather extrapolate current conditions to infinity.This is a big part of boom/bust cycles. They are spaced out by just enough to entice a new group of greenhorns who ever more loudly beat the new paradigm drum. Then this new class learns that the business cycle is in fact immortal. But for many, it&#39;s a short-lived lesson.And that part about making &#34;rational, calculated long-term decisions&#34; is amusing. Because it&#39;s during the boom that companies start to engage in accounting shenanigans. The book-cooking will all come out in the next bust, just like it always has. 100x + price-to-earnings multiples will cover a multitude of sins.As Warren Buffet allegedly said, it&#39;s only when the tide goes out that you find out who&#39;s been swimming naked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to assume that experts&#39; advice can only be valued (or not) as an appeal to authority. But that would ignore that experts can also provide _explanations_: &#34;This won&#39;t work because this subsystem would violate the laws of physics&#34; e.g. -- and that explanation might then spur someone to find an equivalent subsystem without that flaw, or perhaps one would find a flaw in the initial reasoning, or whatever.Similarly, seeing a list of past failures may inspire variations that seek to overcome the shortcoming without having to waste time first reproducing the same failure. One can try to learn _why_ it failed and use that to guide future attempts.The advice to be wary of experts reminds me of the advice to avoid criticism while brainstorming, the idea in common being that criticism and negativity supposedly stifles creativity. However, it turns out that criticism _enhances_ the brainstorming process https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/should-we-allo... It seems that criticism from expertise could similarly be a boon to future advances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I found interesting is that the period for reappearance of “failed ideas” is roughly the length of a career. Coincidence or due to any real effect I don’t know. I wrote a little about it here:“Don’t be discouraged by the failure of technology or approaches of the past. If the problem is still important after all this time then it’s a problem worth solving. Don’t avoid unsuccessful solutions. Avoid insignificant problems. Success this time around could be unlocked by advances in any number of unrelated disciplines.”https://blog.eutopian.io/the-next-big-thing-go-back-to-the-f..."</p>

The team size at any of the PC OEMs doing a 386DX design when it was the state of the art would be at least 25 engineers and managers, easily.Congrats to Alexandru for hitting this out of the park."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although this seems to be a 33MHz CPU, the 386DX40 was the first &#34;decent&#34; processor I had access to when growing up so was quite memorable for me.In my teenage years the PCs my brothers and I had access to were two 386DX40s each with 8MB of RAM and several hundred MBs of hard disk space (can&#39;t remember exactly, but pretty sure less than a GB).We really loved Blizzard&#39;s Warcraft II, which despite having a minimum requirement of 486 CPU, was able to run on the 386DX40s, albeit a bit slower than intended.Since we had two PCs we wanted to play together, but only had a parallel cable. I don&#39;t know why it was so hard for us to get hold of a serial cable, but the point is we only had the parallel one and Warcraft II would only be able to run over serial cables, not parallel ones.I eventually worked out a way though. The 386DX40s were actually also capable of running Windows 95 which had a feature where you could &#34;network&#34; two PCs over a parallel cable. I then ran IPX/SPX over that network which allowed us to play Warcraft II over it.The gameplay was pretty slow, but as I recall it was very reliable and we played quite a bit on this setup. Eventually we got a couple of BNC network cards and cables for a much more conventional setup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These things remind me of one of my first jobs as a bench engineer &#39;trying&#39; to fix PCsthe vast majority of problems back then was the power supply and the vast majority of the issues with power supplies was burned out capacitors - easily fixable.for some bizaar reason one memory that also sticks out was the painful compatibility issues of putting seagate hard disks together with conner hard disks (IDE cables) also SCSI was a pita with terminators not working (resistors at the end of the scsi cable).I built my first PC 386SX (I think it was only a 33MHz - complete with a TURBO button!! :o) ) with bits that other engineers had thrown away - literally, outside they had a skip(dumpster)  with 386 motherboards and other stuff they deemed unfixable that I had to keep going through.everyone was scared of opening monitors - using long screw drivers to ground the tube made them (mostly) safe. I also had to fix a b/w (or technically black/ orange) CGA monitor to go with it. i still managed to get windows running on it."</p>

For instance, most laptops have an embedded controller which runs all the time, even when the laptop is powered off, and manages things like battery charging and the power state.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool. I’ve used a number of languages and dabbled in a few frameworks but nothing I’ve used brings me joy like ruby does.I approach programming creatively. I think in large systems and architecture. Ruby allows me to skip worrying about the details. Code blocks abstract away thinking about loops and just focus on data. Just about every array operation I could want is there, waiting for a code block. In other languages, things don’t flow like that.I’ve tried purely function languages and I just can’t wrap my head around them because they abstract too much.I’ve tried python, but I end up having to deal with the mess of importing modules and having to set up loops when all I want to do is map data.Node.js comes so close but anemic standard library and absolute mess of explicit async everywhere just gets in the way. I want to love JavaScript. :(Then there is Rails. Nothing even comes close. The attempts to replicate it in other languages ends up missing part of what makes it so great. I’m sad about the move to mounds of JavaScript. Nothing can match the productivity of simple_form and bootstrap.My entire career has been in Ruby on Rails. I hope improvements to Ruby can keep it relevant. If not, I suppose JavaScript will do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d like to use this to voice my appreciation for Ruby. Its ergonomics, flexibility, elegance and power continue to bring me joy and make me smarter every day.It is incredibly malleable and yet pure. It carries a certain warmth and kindness that permeate its community.It becomes faster every couple of years :)I feel so grateful to work with a language that makes me feel like a wizard and look forward to writing code.The community is so incredibly creative, smart and generous that I feel humbled every day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I don&#39;t get why some people want to move to static types.  Ruby is a dynamic language, that&#39;s the point of it...  Giant orgs can just use Java or something.  We need some languages to stay productive for those of us who work solo or in small groups.  If I wanted static types I&#39;d use Java, Go or something (probably Haskell)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Advent of Code. If you like programming, Advent of Code probably has something for you. It&#39;s a great source of practice problems for learning a new language or style. There&#39;s a &#34;competitive&#34; aspect for people who like programming competitions, and you can even make private leaderboards so you can compete against your friends even if you can&#39;t make it on to the global leaderboard.Last year I was earnestly trying to compete on the global leaderboard, and scored points a few times, ending up 103rd overall (slightly frustrating as the displayed leaderboard only goes down to 100th place!), but it&#39;s too stressful for me to want to do that again, and in my timezone it requires getting awake in time for the puzzles to be released at 5am.This year I&#39;ve been building a homebrew 16-bit CPU from 74xx logic, and have written an operating system and development environment for it, and I plan to do as much as possible of Advent of Code 2021 on my homemade computer.There are 2 big hurdles to this. The first is that my computer is very slow. It takes over a minute to compile a typical program, which makes for a very long edit-compile-test cycle, and I don&#39;t have any hardware multiplication etc., so even integer arithmetic can be quite expensive.The other hurdle is that it only has 64K words of memory, and IIRC some Advent of Code problems in the past have required keeping track of state for dozens of thousands of separate things. In those cases I&#39;d either fail, or come up with a way to use the disk for extra storage. I look forward to trying, regardless.As it happens, just this morning I did kind of a &#34;dry run&#34; on problem 1 from 2016 on my homemade computer, and recorded my attempt, which you can watch if you want: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOizI9qi6FU"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the FAQ:&gt;I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you?&gt;Please don&#39;t. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don&#39;t accept puzzle ideas, and I won&#39;t even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.It&#39;s sad that we live in a world where code snippets sent by others can result in legal issues down the line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The best thing about Advent of Code is how you can adjust it to anyone&#39;s skills and interests - you can do it for time, you can take ages, you can use any language you want or multiple languages, you can get help from other people online, you can go down various CS rabbit holes, you can make more elaborate solutions and/or extensions (some people were doing really cool visualisation of the game of life variations last year) etc.It&#39;s very easy to recommend to it anyone who does any amount of programming at any level, from complete beginners to very experienced.Other people in this thread are talking about learning new languages and I found that a bit distracting. I think I&#39;d rather focus on the puzzles themselves and there&#39;s also something very satisfying about writing a clean and concise solution in a few lines which you can&#39;t always do when you&#39;re picking up a new language. I like using Python for it because I can just translate what I&#39;m thinking to a solution without worrying about the language itself. Also, even if I didn&#39;t mind doing it in a new language, I don&#39;t think that AoC gives you large enough problems that can really explore a new language and all of its features. And you can always mix the languages if there&#39;s a language that&#39;s really suitable for a given problem. You don&#39;t have to stick to the same language for all problems.I really enjoyed last year&#39;s, I&#39;m looking forward to this one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Guix System is an advanced distribution of the GNU operating system. It uses the Linux-libre kernelIt&#39;s worth pointing out that the linux-libre kernel is developed under the FSF doctrine that &#34;binary blobs are bad unless you can&#39;t see them&#34;. This has been taken to its logical extreme here, where this Linux fork actively removes security warnings informing users that they need to update their CPU microcode, because microcode in ROM is fine but dynamically loaded microcode updates are not, in this school of thought.https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2018-04/msg00002...I have no interest in software that uses arbitrary religious dogma (that doesn&#39;t help users&#39; freedom, as those users&#39; CPUs have proprietary microcode whether they know about it or not) to justify censoring critical security vulnerability notifications for users. I regard this as actively evil anti-user behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hello, author here, happy to answer questions and discuss! This is the first in more Guix articles coming from me, as I started when building my newest desktop [0].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a reason neither Guix nor Nix have made an LTS-type repo?A rolling release seems at odds with the stability granted by reproducible builds.Maybe I have a miopic view, but what&#39;s nice with Ubuntu LTS is you know everyone and their mothers has built and tested their packages/libraries/executable against the lib versions provided by Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 or whatever. You also know those libs, at their given versions, will get patched as issues come up. If all your libraries are constantly churning then you have no idea of the quality of the libs you&#39;re linking to (and that lib&#39;s dependencies are also churning in turn). You can pin versions, but there is no guarantee what you&#39;re pinning to will be patched and fixed as issues come up"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello HN!Pony is a messenger without a send button. When you&#39;re finished composing a message, instead of sending it right away, you put it in your outbox. Once a day—in the morning (5:30am), afternoon (12:00pm), or evening (6:30pm)—Pony picks up anything that&#39;s in your outbox and delivers any new messages that may have arrived. You can edit a message until it&#39;s picked up, move it into drafts, or delete it altogether.I built Pony because email makes it hard to keep up lasting correspondences with people. I think the main reason for this is because email is dominated by &#34;transactional&#34; communication—time-critical messages that are tied to some particular interaction: order confirmations, password resets, etc. All of these things tend to bury interpersonal correspondence. The same goes for texting and chat platforms: they may be good for keeping in touch with people and for making plans, but messages come and go quickly and they&#39;re not really spaces designed for more thoughtful correspondence.Pony, on the other hand, encourages thoughtful communication and acts as a barrier to anything time-sensitive. It&#39;s a highly predictable space and unless you&#39;ve received a delivery, you know that when you open the app, nothing will have changed. And although Pony encourages you to take your time and not communicate reflexively, it also sets a &#34;micro-deadline&#34; every day, which creates structure that helps keep the correspondence going.I&#39;ve started a blog, so if you&#39;re interested in reading more: https://www.ponymessenger.com/blog/2021-11-15/humans-are-not....

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The idea/term of &#34;Outbox&#34; really reminds me of email of the old days (in the 90s) where you have a desktop email client (e.g. Eudora, or Internet Mail and News, or even earlier versions of Outlook Express) that don&#39;t do auto-sends, and only connect to your POP3/SMTP servers when you click Send and Receive. This was probably due to internet being on dial-up and being billed by the minutes was common so users limited their internet time (e.g. disconnect from internet if writing a long email response, etc.). I have a lot of nostalgia from those days vs the always-on culture now.I like that you were able to spot this particular usage pattern as something to narrow in on for your product. I don&#39;t know if this would catch on as a trend (for example, like ephemeral messaging did when Snap came out), but I wish you all the best!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This concept for a forum could be interesting.I sometimes write thoughtful replies to HN submissions many hours later, after ruminating, but HN has moved on to the next new thing. (It is a &#34;news&#34; site after all)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This paper jumps the gun. Detecting wash trading by examining distributions over rounded order prices is a strong and dubious claim for which they provide little evidence. The author&#39;s equate wash trading to non-rounded, clustered prices which really just indicates automated trading. Now automated (&#34;bot&#34;) trading is a technology needed for exchanges wash trading sure, but not exclusive evidence of it.Automated trading strategies (e.g., &#34;grid trading&#34;) are really popular and there are many third party bot providers that integrate in multiple exchange APIs. Maybe the unregulated class of exchanges here just has more permissive APIs/automation than the regulated ones. Automated trading is still legitimate trading where a party puts their capital on the line.I agree that the lack of rounding and trade size clusters is a likely approximate indicator of non-human orders. The presence of automated orders does not automatically mean there is fraudulent wash trading by the exchange.The authors also do not cite previous research or evidence of their methodology working for traditional finance. It all makes for weak evidence of actual wash trading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had to go through extensive KYC/AML email conversations and phone calls with bunch of exchanges like Coinbase and others. Got me interested how wash trading could happen, when they were so strict with me, and which exchanges were investigated.These seems to be the exchanges they investigated.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why Uniswap&#39;s data is much more valuable than  centralized exchanges.  On-chain trading permits a degree of transparency and trustworthiness not readily feasible with centralized exchanges.Centralized exchanges are incentivized to doctor their data and lie about their volumes.  The larger the volumes an exchange publishes, even if fake or gamed, the more relevant an exchange appears.  Users must blindly trust whatever data exchanges can manufacture.Uniswap charges a flat fee to every trade for all user.  It&#39;s objective.  There&#39;s no special back room trading rates, there&#39;s no ability to lie about volumes, there&#39;s no bonus for having high frequency bots trading.  If you want objective data, Uniswap (and other on-chain exchanges) are truthful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I experimented with something similar with a Linux distribution&#39;s package binary cache.Using `bup` (deduplicating backup tool using git packfile format) I deduplicated 4 Chromium builds into the size of 1. It could probably pack thousands into the size of a few.Large download/storage requirements for updates are one of NixOS&#39;s few drawbacks, and I think deduplication could solve that pretty much completely.Details: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/89380"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat related (and definitely born out of a very similar use case): https://github.com/mhx/dwarfsI initially built this for having access to 1000+ Perl installations (spanning decades of Perl releases). The compression in this case is not quite as impressive (50 GiB to around 300 MiB), but access times are typically in the millisecond region."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems very much like the Git repository format, with loose objects being collected into compressed pack files - except I think Git has smarter heuristics about which files are likely to compress well together. It would be interesting to see a comparison between this tool and Git used to store the same collection of similar files."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t matter what process is used for coming up with estimates and delivering.Regardless of what you think your process is, somewhere near the top of the leadership pyramid, it all boils down to a customer promise upon which hinges your organization&#39;s reputation.In non-dysfunctional organizations people at all levels can understand and adapt to curveballs that cause deadlines to slip. In such places you make estimates to the best of your ability with limited time and resources and communicate constantly with stakeholders on how things are going.The hard thing is it all requires honesty.Probably the most angry I ever got at work was once when, at the end of a project, I was on one of those bullshit status update conference calls with 20 people on the line. Throughout the project the team was I was on was led to believe that we were constantly behind and the deadline was from the beginning impossible to meet yet magically got pushed out several times to give us &#34;grace-time&#34;. We cut corners like mad-men, amassed insane levels of tech-debt, and all but put a midget in the machine to make it work. What happened on the call? The product management team congratulated the PM for delivering so far ahead of time. I was so angry I couldn&#39;t even talk. Basically, the PM got accolades, the customer got shitty product, and we hated our jobs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An estimate is usually the sum of a bunch of smaller estimates. Those estimates have a probability distribution that is asymmetric. While sometimes they can be quicker than anticipated, the lowest they can go is zero (turns out we don&#39;t need it, cut it) and that kind of thing is relatively less common than a blowout the other way. Those blowouts are uncapped, while zero time is a minimum there&#39;s no maximum. The unknown unknowns are the things that get you. Seems like it will take X but the frobnicator was broken in ways we couldn&#39;t have anticipated so we had to get a different thing and then hack it to make it do what we actually needed etc etc. Each individual item has a low probability of that happening to some extent. When you have a bunch of things in sequence one of them probably will if not more.IIRC each item is described by a poisson distribution. (Have I got that right, mean, long tail). Nobody models estimates as a sequence of dependent, poisson distributed events, that I&#39;ve heard of at least. If you did you might at least get a range on the estimate. Between 2 and 20 days. That would be more accurate. Useful to anyone much? Unclear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago, when I was working at a company, I did a detailed estimate of a large project.I broke it down into components and individual tasks, then put estimated hours against each one, then put it all into a giant spreadsheet, to track planned vs actual times.If I remember rightly, it totalled about three months of elapsed work time.  And it took me over a week to compile the estimate.I also remember that I hit the predicted end date to within two days.But the interesting bit was each individual task was inaccurate - lots were wildly underestimated, balanced by those which were wildly overestimated.  Stuff like things I thought would take a day taking 15 minutes, other things I thought would take an hour taking a week."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article goes farther, saying:&#34;There was no evidence of discrimination against women in male-dominated professions or in mixed-gender professions, but the researchers did find evidence of discrimination against men in female-dominated professions.&#34;Sweden, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a developing conjecture that in order to address the perceived problem of higher male per capita in certain occupations, attracting males into occupations with higher female ratios is as important as incentivizing female participation in high-male occupations.I&#39;m no mathematician but I see it in terms of system numbers: Given a set of occupations with different sex ratios, to change the ratio of any specific occupation the ratios of other occupations must also change.Incentivizing a specific sex population into an occupation may work for a while; they can boost the overall population in that occupation over the occupations the incentivized population would otherwise enter. However, the true outcome is an overpopulation in the incentivized occupation and underpopulation in others. The difference between incentivized and &#34;natural&#34; population size for an occupation becomes headwinds for any person to enter an occupation resulting in reduced incentive efficiency.In a simplistic rational &#34;Homo economicus&#34; world some portion of the male population that would enter the female-incentivized occupation would move to other occupations and the sex ratios would change. If it is true that males are discriminated against in occupations with high female ratios, then this would represent an even higher hurdle than the factors that result in sex ratio variance in occupations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“that, at least in Sweden and the occupations we study, hiring discrimination in entry level jobs is primarily a problem for men in female-dominated occupations,”That&#39;s interesting. I work in a female-dominated occupation (libraries), but, it&#39;s only female dominated at the lower levels. Historically, at least, directors/managers and the upper level folks tended to be men, and those are of course the only jobs that pay very well. So while there&#39;s waaay more female librarians, there&#39;s way more male library directors. I think that&#39;s been slowly changing recently. I don&#39;t see that they look at libraries in this study, nor do they mention managers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have these kinds of feelings a lot.  It is hard to feel useful in this day and age of a ubiquitous globally connected society because for anything you attempt to do you have instant access to the top 0.0001% of the Bell curve who you have no hope of ever beating.I find comfort in that I am not alone, thinking of all the peasants and regular workers across history who didn&#39;t amount to much either, but still mostly fought on and had a good life.  Plenty of examples in immediate family as well.And lastly, I found that there is one thing that one can do that is absolutely unique that nobody can match anywhere in the world, and that is - as corny as this sounds - kids.  It may be a touchy subject or not for everybody.  But raising a human with the best possible effort you can muster is an accomplishment at least one person will remember and value 100000x more vs. any world champion in solving IOI problems or writing clever functional code :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My recommendation: feel your feelings, all the way through.There might be some tendency, when you feel small, to feel bad about feeling small — as though it is further evidence of your worthlessness — and that itself makes you feel worse, and down the spiral you go... Been there (:But if you make space for (or even _welcome_) those feelings, even if you don&#39;t like them, then in my experience you end up at a better place.I only mention this because you seem to be beating yourself up about this (&#34;I feel shallow/dumb&#34;).
You can feel bad and still be a good person; it&#39;s an easy mixup to make.(I am reminded of this funny image: https://i.redd.it/9ubhqov2u9k01.jpg [1])Also, not that this makes your feelings go away, but looking at people who are rich/smart/influential/famous is looking at outliers, and people who likely had a lot of luck in their background, upbringing, genes, education, being-in-the-right-place-at-the-right-time, etc. etc. to achieve their success, on top of their hard work. For every succesful indie video game, there are 1000 people who worked just as hard on theirs but didn&#39;t get a big break. The same is true in all sorts of areas of life, big to small. And just in general, FWIW, I don&#39;t recommend judging your self-worth by comparing to others, whether they&#39;re outliers or not (:But sorry you&#39;re feeling down; *internet hug*.[1] (in case the direct link dies) https://old.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/82lny8/i_wa..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use “cargo … —-locked” to install things using the dependencies from the Cargo.lock file, which includes specific commit hashes for dependencies. Avoids things like the 0.0.1 problem or even replaced crates. Need to be careful to watch for actual security updates, though.I really wish crates.io would have at least launched with a name spacing feature. This wouldn’t solve every spoofing or typosquatting issue, but it would go a long way toward improving the situation.There’s a separate issue of crates.io squatting. One person famously registered hundreds (or thousands? Tens of thousands) of common words as crate names on crates.io and has been squatting them ever since. Those names are effectively unavailable for use but also completely useless because they don’t contain anything.It’s also becoming a huge problem for abandoned crates. New forks have to choose a completely different, less intuitive name because they can’t just namespace their alternative. As old crates get abandoned, this leads to weird situations where the newest, best maintained crate has the least obvious crate name. It takes work to find the good crate some times because the best named crates might just be the oldest, most abandoned ones"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s why I started https://github.com/mimoo/cargo-dephell and https://github.com/diem/whackadep btw, to try to get a sense of the risk in our Rust dependencies. Whackadep runs a a webserver that updates periodically and shows you what&#39;s up with your dependencies. If there&#39;s a new update, the idea is to estimate a sense of urgency (are we lagging behind? Is it a major version change? Is there a RUSTSEC advisory?) and a sense of risk. For example, it&#39;ll tell you if a new dependency version touches a `build.rs` file. I wanted to add more rules, like the ones mentioned in the article, but never had the time to do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; crates.io matches the code on GitHub,There is no tight coupling between GitHub and cargo/crates.io (sure it uses GitHub internally but that is an implementation detail).But not only has it no tight coupling with GitHub it also doesn&#39;t require you to use git, you can use whatever version control you want and at worse you don&#39;t get support for &#34;detect dirty repository&#34;.Similar git tags are fundamentally unreliable as you can always &#34;move&#34; some to any arbitrary commit.So IMHO the problem here is relying on code you didn&#39;t got from github which might not even use git to match a arbitrary tag on something on github which might not even be from the same author (but e.g. a mirror on GitHub from whatever VC the author uses).But uploads to crates.io are immutable and are source code uploads, so you can just review them.In general (independent of cargo) do review the code you use not some code you got form somewhere else which you hope/believe is the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really hope that the hype around web3 from techies and developers translates into it becoming a reincarnation of the &#34;old web&#34;.AKA I don&#39;t see the general public moving away from centralized web2, but I do think it would be nice if developers created a decentralized alternative to Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, etc. which being made by individuals and mostly comprised of other developers, is very similar to old-school message boards.I don&#39;t think this decentralized platform will necessarily involve blockchain, just peer-to-peer interactions. The &#34;web3 movement&#34; could simply be getting more people to join a decentralized network like the Fediverse, and improving said network, so it becomes a common peer-to-peer developer version of Twitter, Youtube, etc. Blockchain makes it easy to pay people for being part of the network, but you could do the exact same thing with stablecoins or Stripe payments.Right now most techies and developers use YouTube and Reddit and Twitter even though they publicly loath and complain about these platforms (ironically on the platforms themselves). Because it&#39;s impossible for a small group to create anything remotely competing with a large centralized platform. But a decentralized platform, just maybe, could attract enough people and produce enough content to not be obscure.Ultimately, I think most of the interest in web3 comes from nostalgia. Old-school developers look at the rise of &#34;Web 1.0&#34; (the original Internet) and &#34;Web 2.0&#34; (Google, Facebook, YouTube). They remember everything being so new and exciting, and recognize how much opportunity they missed. Well, in the past few years the internet hasn&#39;t &#34;really&#34; changed much, supposedly it&#39;s been much more boring. People want more novelty and excitement and opportunity, and they think and hope it&#39;s going to happen again in something they will call &#34;web3&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fundamental power of the internet is its interoperability. It was born out of the ability of different networks to talk to each other using common protocols.The interoperability is what we&#39;ve lost in the Web 2.0 era. Even such quintessential thing as a web API has no well defined standard or protocol, just a very vague concept of REST or RPC.I want Web 3.0 to get interoperability back. We badly need commonly accepted standards and decentralized protocols: for web APIs, for identity management, for message queuing, for web callbacks (webhooks), for online transactions, for semantic web and ontology, etc.Take, for instance, web APIs. It&#39;s barely usable nowadays. Imagine if you had to write a special browser every time you need to connect to a new website. But this is what already happens with APIs. Accessing programmatically any web-service requires custom coding an API. Insane!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mostly agree with the OP. web3 &#34;feels&#34; like trendy possible next gen plumbing that something (don&#39;t know what yet) will be built on much later. So all these kids are busy building things in it and experimenting and I think that&#39;s awesome. All of this is mildly interesting...but...Web2 isn&#39;t going anywhere. It&#39;s not about some ephemeral future of web3, but more about stuff most people care about works in web2. Which is mainly, stream a flick, buy a pair of pants, watch football, order food. Web3 really doesn&#39;t influence any of those basic needs. And social networks? web3+Facebook would be EVEN WORSE. Hard pass.Tokenizing humanity is _not_ the way to go."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of negativity in the comments here, and many of them have merit. However, the thing that is interesting to me about OpenAI, AI21, Cohere, and all the other LLM providers is that they are broadly useful, and often helpful. Perhaps they don&#39;t live up to the marketing hype, but they are still interesting.For example, I used to have a biology blog, and I&#39;ve been thinking of starting it back up again. I&#39;ve been using OpenAI and Mantium (full disclosure, I work at Mantium) to generate the bones of a blog post so that I have something to start with. Coming up with ideas for my biology blog posts was almost 50% of the work.If you&#39;re interested in judging the quality for yourself, I have a biology blog post generator here: https://f0c1c1e0-f6b6-46bc-81a1-eff096222913-i.share.mantium...and a music blog post generator here: https://8aaf220e-4aff-4d4e-ae61-90f08011c9ac-i.share.mantium...(they were both &#34;created today&#34; because I moved them from our staging environment)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s very good that OpenAI is relenting and opening up the API; however the Content Guidelines are still too onerous such that even if you can think of a good use case it will be a liability at best even if your app gets approval.At this point (1.5 years later), if you&#39;re looking to make a sustainable business on AI text generation, you may want to experiment working with large-but-not-as-large models like GPT-J-6B; it&#39;ll be much cheaper too in the long run."</p>

Great idea. I&#39;d love to see some innovation with the old school design ethos too; maybe there are even better ways of displaying controls? Or maybe a new way to think about controls that weren&#39;t around back then."</p>

It&#39;s the most interesting programming content I&#39;ve ever watched - and I feel like he&#39;s honestly taught me a lot about programming![1] https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey everyone! I&#39;m the organizer for Handmade Seattle. It was a pleasure hosting SerenityOS, as Andreas is an inspiration to us.If I may plug, note we are 100% indie and upload presentations for free. We have a newsletter [0] but since HN loves RSS we have that setup as well [1].[0] https://media.handmade-seattle.com/subscribe[1] https://media.handmade-seattle.com/rss"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone&#39;s got 2c on bitcoin but here&#39;s mine: I don&#39;t consider the price of crypto when looking to see progress / success.Could you explain to somebody why Bitcoin is successful without mentioning that the price goes up, by talking only about the technology, product, and adoption? What if that person was unimpressed by Bitcoin 5 years ago, could you explain what changed in the last 5 years (again, not mentioning change in price) to change their opinion of bitcoin?AFAICT the main changes in Bitcoin in the past 5 years have been some incremental evolution of the technology that I&#39;m not aware of changing the fundamental usage of the product in any way (SegWit, LN, and most recently Taproot).A note on blockchain proliferation: The author considers it a bad sign that there&#39;s an explosion in new blockchains. While I also consider it a bad sign for Bitcoin, I think it&#39;s a good thing for the ecosystem. My hope is that some day we&#39;ll have ubiquitous inter-chain protocols so, rather than obsessively hyping the coin/chain we&#39;re invested in, we can move all our digital assets and contracts to whatever blockchain offers the best technology, the best performance, and the lowest fees. This will allow for increased competition and evolution in the blockchain space. You can see the beginnings of this movement in some places, but it has a long way to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting, the original article is one giant Appeal to Consequences fallacy.  The arguments are structured like &#34;If Bitcoin succeeds, X will happen, and X is bad, therefore Bitcoin will fail&#34; or alternatively &#34;Bitcoin undoes policy Y, policy Y was a good thing, therefore Bitcoin is bad and will fail.&#34;  And then the epilogue here finally acknowledges that yup, all the bad stuff did happen, and yet Bitcoin still succeeded, and the future will probably involve more bad stuff but that&#39;s the way it goes.I feel like one marker of maturity is understanding that not everything true is going to be good, and not everything that we want is something we&#39;re going to get.  So many timely debates take the form of an Appeal to Consequences fallacy.  &#34;Hyperinflation would be bad for everyone, therefore the government will not allow hyperinflation to happen&#34; - ignoring that the government may not have the mechanisms to stop it once it begins.  &#34;If it&#39;s too late to do anything about global warming, we&#39;re all fucked anyway, so let&#39;s proceed on the assumption that it&#39;s not too late&#34; - ignoring that &#34;we&#39;re all fucked anyway&#34; may mean many different things and some of them might be significantly more pleasant than others.  &#34;America is a great country, so it can&#39;t possibly collapse&#34;, ignoring that many once-great countries have collapsed before.I found my predictions got significantly more accurate, though significantly less comforting, when I realized that good doesn&#39;t always win out in the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"«it’s now obvious that use of bitcoin (and related blockchains) for payments is almost entirely scams and illegal stuff»It is neither obvious, nor is there any data that suggests that is the case for Bitcoin. I suspect people who hold this opinion form it passively while reading the occasional flashy news headlines &#34;Drug lord used Bitcoin!&#34; and don&#39;t actually do any research. After all, news reporters write about what drives readership, and &#34;Grocery merchant used Bitcoin&#34; just doesn&#39;t quite get the same engagement.There are very few research papers that conclude a large percentage of Bitcoin&#39;s transaction is tied to illegal activity, for example [1] claims 46%. However they are fatally flawed: they fail to consider the amplifying effect of mixers/tumblers that, by design, create thousands of automated mixing transactions per original transaction. So 1 illegal transaction will look like 1000 transactions in their analysis... facepalm[1] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3102645"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, author here! Glad folks are enjoying this.A few notes:- I post a _lot_ about tldraw on Twitter. If you&#39;re curious about how this came together, or want to follow along as we ship new features, check out my timeline (https://twitter.com/steveruizok).- The whole tldraw project is MIT licensed and open source (https://github.com/tldraw). And it&#39;s still in development! If you&#39;d like to contribute, join the Discord channel (https://discord.gg/SBBEVCA4PG) or drop by the repo (https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw).- The multiplayer is using a pre-release version of Liveblocks (https://liveblocks.io/)—and honestly isn&#39;t using it in a very clever way—and so can have some desync issues. Consider this part of the app an early beta.- We also ship a Visual Studio Code extension that lets you use tldraw inside of VS Code! (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tldraw-o...)A little more about the project itself:The tldraw project has a few different layers.At the bottom, there is a renderer named @tldraw/core (https://github.com/tldraw/core) that is essentially a &#34;put React components on a canvas UI&#34; engine. You give it a data model along with a set of utilities to interpret that data model. Simple but very fast, very flexible, and packed with helpers for building these kinds of apps. It&#39;s already being used for some pretty ambitious projects apart from tldraw itself.The main library, @tldraw/tldraw (https://github.com/tldraw/core), exports the whole tldraw &#34;app&#34; as a React component named &lt;Tldraw/&gt;. This component can be embedded in any React project. It can be controlled either by props or by its own API (ie `app.selectAll().duplicate()`).The website is a very thin Next.js app that embeds the &lt;Tldraw/&gt; component.There are also a few other libraries: @tldraw/vec for the vector math and @tldraw/intersect for intersections. If you like to work on these kinds of projects, definitely bookmark those libraries! They contain a lot of useful code.As for its development, I&#39;ve taken off a few months between jobs to work on this full time. Until now, the site has been accessible only to my Github sponsors, but it&#39;s now free and open to everyone. If If you&#39;d like to support the project&#39;s continued development, you can sponsor me here: https://github.com/sponsors/steveruizok.I&#39;ll answer questions here but if you want to contact me directly, my DMs are open @steveruizok."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Created by Steve Ruiz, his timeline is full of little interesting thoughts played out in the development of this, a fascinating insight into the minutiae that users take for granted but that make the difference: https://twitter.com/steveruizok"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;New Project&#34; asks if you want to &#34;Save your current project&#34; and the options are &#34;Yes&#34; and &#34;Cancel&#34;.I would expect Cancel to cancel the new project rather than losing the current work, and would expect a &#34;No&#34; option instead to mean lose the current project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now switch to Linux too.The more we invest together, the easier it becomes. German states can help Spanish states, and Finnish schools, Danish universities, and French businesses, etc. - collaboratively investing so that everyone benefits and Europe can build its own Tech industry and have some independence from the US.This is absolutely critical to move away from the dominance of &#34;Big Tech&#34; to FOSS solutions that independent, small co-operatives can maintain together."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the main &#34;drawback&#34; of LibreOffice is that it is not widely used. If you receive a docx document and it formats funny, or vice versa (common on LibreOffice and not entirely their fault), it&#39;s on you for using weird software, or penny-pinching on a MS Office license.If it becomes common, people just accept the minor incompatibility and move on. It will also get better as funds and attention flow to these projects.As far as I&#39;m concerned, LibreOffice lacks no features I would remotely consider using.It&#39;s like when Windows was the sole mainstream OS, it wasn&#39;t an excuse &#34;oh but I&#39;m on Mac and can&#39;t run this&#34;. Now Macs are mainstream, and Linux is not, it&#39;s still in a &#34;weird nerdy&#34; corner. But not so if it just gets more widely used (it&#39;s happening, just slowly)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the kind of story that would have been cheered on on Slashdot twenty years ago.  But here we are in 2021 and a major organization having the temerity to not pay the Microsoft tax is newsworthy.  This is not what a free market looks like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We tried our hardest back in the early 2000&#39;s to make this stick. I cofounded a startup building servers, clients, and SDK&#39;s. Maybe the world is finally ready for it now. The issue we ran into was customers/consumers just didn&#39;t care about federated systems. And various implementations had all sorts of quirks making interoperability between domains and clients difficult, at best. There are just SO MANY THINGS you have to do to make good messenger software that lining up all the pieces with open standards proved impossible in the ~8 years I was working on it. Again, maybe it&#39;s better now, but I&#39;m skeptical, probably jaded. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s little known that XMPP is a big hit with military and police organizations.  (e.g. the Baltimore police department has XMPP-based chat and feeds the messages into Lotus Notes)Vendors in that market heavily use extension mechanisms.  For instance commanders of infantry units might fill out forms every day about what kind of contacts they had with the enemy and get them sent to a central location."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Every exploit listed for my router (tplink Archer A7) has no &#34;affected version&#34; listed nor indications if it has been patched, but clicking through to the CVEs indicates all have been remediated. As near as I can tell this website is just scraping CVEs, poorly, in order to sell their security services (which consist, at least in part, of an email reminder to rotate your router password...seriously?)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of these routers have DD-WRT, OpenWRT, FreshTomato or maybe pfsense support. Since the manufacturers long ago abandoned security updates and feature upgrades an open source firmware will vastly improve the security and the devices functionality.Not all routers can run one of these firmwares but many can and I wouldn&#39;t choose a device that didn&#39;t in the future. Its relatively easy to setup a basic secure home router using a Raspberry pi 4 and USB Ethernet and then attach one to a hub and the other to the modem and you have a 1 gbit/s capable routing device that can do SQM and remove bufferbloat and not a lot of consumer routers can remotely achieve that level of performance.It is more hassle than the manufacturers firmware, but its also a surprisingly good way to extend a routers usable life and functionality as well. VPNs, Virtual LAN, File and web servers or just better QoS you can do just about anything you might want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I already have little hope for consumer networking equipment, this just seems like a big old list of scraped CVE&#39;s.One has to remember that the majority of the development ends up being by the SoC vendor, usually a horribly out of date fork of OpenWrt with weird looking proprietary kernel modules to support wifi, accelerated nat, etc.Quite a few of the older devices lack some pretty basic mitigations as well; ASLR, Position Independent Executables, Stack Canaries, etc. Either they get forgotten or they&#39;re off because of they can&#39;t be bothered getting the drivers up to scratch. (Assuming they haven&#39;t just been handed a binary)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"  [0] Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &#34;I know, I&#39;ll use regular expressions.&#34; Now they have two problems.

I love regular expressions and figuring out the syntax to solve problems I encounter where I can use regex. Such as searching code for calls with specific named params that may be in different order across the code base. But I always have this quote in the back of my mind if I&#39;m thinking about using regex in code, especially areas that get hit a lot.[0] https://blog.codinghorror.com/regular-expressions-now-you-ha..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect regex for being a widespread DSL that makes certain things very declarative.My problem with it (other than all the different flavors—that’s just history’s fault) is that you don’t tend to get integrated help/tool support for them.  They are often just plain strings—how is e.g. Intellij supposed to spot them reliably and help you?It’s too bad if we have to copy and paste regex strings into websites in order to figure out what they do.The number one most useful tool support in my book would just be to highlight metacharacters.  Are parens a metacharacter in the dialect that I am using now?  Is `+` significant?A bigger ask would be more verbose regular expression declarations and compilers that can translate to and from them.  It’s nice if you can use comments in a regex dialect, but comments should be treated like they are treated in code writ large; don’t use them if you can make the code “self-describing”.  Imagine a more verbose declaration language where you can make local aliases, for example `let ident = [a-z][a-z1-9_]*`."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classic in marriage counseling. Many fights occur not because of what the other person has said or done, but because what your own brain has added to their behavior. Often, you see what you are most afraid of. Or what you used to experience in childhood. To “see” that your partner here and now is actually completely different takes a lot of energy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related but also not: One of the most interesting aspects about a &#34;shroom&#34; trip is the incredible ability to visualize. Visualizing is something that we all think we can do normally, but if you really try to picture something in your head -- specific faces, the design of a bicycle, the layout of a room -- it&#39;s quickly evident that we are actually terrible at it (it&#39;s hard to reverse information from that neural network). Even if you&#39;re drawing it&#39;s often an iterative process where each line drives the next.Maybe other people are better at it, but when self-interrogating and inspecting one&#39;s own vision, it just completely falls apart. https://www.booooooom.com/2016/05/09/bicycles-built-based-on...Normally.I can only speak to personal experience, but under the influence of psilocybin I find that closing my eyes and visualizing complex environments and machines -- of literally inspecting and walking through gearing systems, for instance, and rationalizing their operation -- with complex lighting, etc, leaves me just in awe at the mind&#39;s capacity. It literally feels like looking into another  universe, the construction of the reality simply too complex to be imagined and visualized.I&#39;ve actually felt my head to ensure I&#39;m not overheating, contemplating the process like the mind was a GPU."</p>

In fact, when the friction is so low, the customer is likely to start the subscription back.I say this as someone who worked in customer service automation. The worst customer satisfaction score with lowest rate of re-subscription is from companies that make it hell to unsubscribe.I&#39;ve seen customers send messages like &#34;Cancel and refund immediately!&#34; Since our response was ai driven, we cancel and refund no questions asked in less then a minute (we do fraud check in the background). Many times you get a response back from the customer apologizing for their tone and praising the product. Some of them restart the subscription a cycle or two later.When you make it hard to cancel, you lose customers on the long term. Make it easy, in fact make it friendly.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; including an option that’s “at least as easy” as the one to subscribeWeirdly enough this sounds like a loophole.I can already see some companies trying to bullshit their way through an investigation: &#34;Oh sure, we don&#39;t provide online cancellation, because our way to cancel is even easier than online:&#34; *presents a way to cancel that is in practice more difficult than online*.I think either mandating that cancelling must be possible using the same workflow as subscription or more clearly defining what &#34;easy&#34; means would be important."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Same thing with The Guardian. Subscribed online and was then told I can’t cancel via email and have to endure a pushy sales call if I want to cancel. Similar experience with The Economist except it was via live chat instead.These experiences honestly make me want to never subscribe to a newspaper again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Based on all the dumbfounded and cynical replies, I don&#39;t think people understand why this is happening.Anybody saying this is a response to recent anti-trust headlines doesn&#39;t understand how a company the size of Apple works. When an announcement like this is made, it means this program has been in the works for YEARS.My guess, this is all part of Apple&#39;s slow shift towards a recurring revenue services model, and a better integration of customer &amp; business incentives.It used to be, the worst thing that could happen to Apple was the customer stops upgrading their phone.But now, when the revenue growth is coming from services instead of hardware, it doesn&#39;t pay to piss off customers by making them buy a new phone a year early because the battery died.The worst thing that can happen now under this new business model is the customer leaves the ecosystem or buys less services because they aren&#39;t happy with the hardware.Hence why you&#39;re seeing Apple do things they never would have before. Capitulating on the MacBook Pro and rolling back on the Touch Bar, opening up to more repairability, etc. etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for the tangent, but I&#39;m sad to see even Apple is now pumping out terrible Alegria corporate art.In 10 years people are going to look back on all this terrible art and wonder what the hell every tech company was thinking.There&#39;s even a subreddit dedicated to hating the Alegria trend: https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckalegriaart/top/?t=all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What?!I was completely blindsided by this. I do regular laptop and smartphone repairs for friends and family and getting original parts often is difficult or even impossible. There are many scammers around that will sell &#34;original OEM&#34; i.e. cheap knock-off trash.Ebay is OK-ish for second hand parts but sometimes you are just out of luck.I&#39;m pretty excited about this, to say the least."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is this even worth it to MS?Do they really expect people who go through the effort of installing a third party browser and setting it as default to switch back to Edge because of the grand experience they had with it when Windows opened some help article in it?How much money do they make of the 0.000001% of users who do the above?How much money do they lose because of the reputation damage and increased regulator attention because of it?I cannot think of any scenario where, money wise, this is a net positive for MS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft’s reasoning is that features like search is an end to end experience. That’s odd to me — it just opens a web page. Is there anything special about it being in Edge that we don’t notice?I mean, obviously it’s BS, but are there PMs who actually think it’s better for the user to override the default browser for things like this? A side note: one frustrating aspect of this problem is that my browser extensions are never installed in Edge. So things like password autofill in a lot of the MS auth flows (which appear to be web-based, as far as I can tell) just don’t work"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My daughter has this as an school assignment, with some implication that it is some sort of a contest, and we managed to grow quite a few of similar quality to the seed crystals on the site in 4 days, which was the original (poorly thought IMO) deadline. 
The trouble is that no one else was able or cared to do it so fast, so the deadline has been slipping for a couple weeks now, with our best crystals going to school and back a few times, getting scratches and broken bits instead of nicely growing undisturbed. 
A bit discouraging. I&#39;m now remembering how frustrating was for me to take school related things too seriously and discover you cared more than your teachers when I was her age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an organic chemist, growing crystals was of paramount importance for certain structure determinations using X-ray crystallography (to answer &#34;did I really prepare what I think I prepared?&#34;)With sensitive compounds, sometimes you can&#39;t just let things evaporate. Also as the article states, weather conditions might mess you up.
IMO the coolest trick we had to solve this was osmosis of an anti-solvent into a saturated solution.A small sealed container with a saturated solution of your compound/salt is punctured, and put in a bigger sealed container containing a worse but miscible solvent for the compound under study. Slow diffusion into the inner container causes very reproducible crystal growth, as long as you can control the temperature."</p>

It might or might not be an RCT; it says stuff like “Patients were self-allocated to the treatment groups; the first 3 days of the week for the intervention arm while the other 3 days for symptomatic treatment”. Were they self-allocated in the sense that they got to choose? Doesn’t that mean it’s not random? Aren’t there seven days in a week?

Can you imagine if writing and journalism of this calibre was commonplace among practising &#34;journalists&#34;?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of an amazing implosion all at once on Twitter. The OBS Project accused Streamlabs of this after another streaming company, Lightstream, noted that Streamlabs had copy-and-pasted a marketing page from their product to use for Streamlabs&#39; product, down to word-for-word copies of the &#34;user&#34; recommendations.https://twitter.com/Lightstream/status/1460709404609757185And, also in that thread, El Gato -- makers of the hardware Stream Deck -- chimed in with a wry &#34;know that feel,&#34; showing that &#34;Streamlabs Stream Deck&#34; was, let&#39;s say, strongly reminiscent of their product.https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1460722403261046789"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know, I&#39;ll admit that this is ignorance on my end, but I honestly thought that Streamlabs was the owner of OBS, in that OBS was just an internal project that they open sourced.Clearly I&#39;m wrong but I doubt I&#39;m the only person who thought that.  Seems like they&#39;re being douchebags if they&#39;re just taking the offensive and filing predatory trademarks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this is true, the detail that sticks out to me is that before the legal filings StreamLabs thought to reach out about using the name. If StreamLabs thought the names were similar enough that they reached out about using the name, that proves that even from their own former perspective, they&#39;re using a mark that was already recognized in the industry and similar enough to their own mark - surely consumers could have the same perspective (many in the comments here were already confused). They also can&#39;t claim ignorance. Why should they expect trademark law to now protect the name for them?The same thing apparently happened with Meta: http://meta.company/."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beware if you load this on a mobile device with metered data!This animation is implemented by loading a large number of ~200KB PNG files, each 800x800px, such as this one [1] and then drawing them into a &lt;canvas&gt; as you scroll.Having scrolled through the entirety of the animations, Firefox reports that it transferred about 220MB of PNGs on top of the 3.4MB of JS and an inexplicable 202KB of CSS.Maybe I do not understand some key requirement. Shouldn&#39;t it be possible to encode a high quality video file, embed it with &lt;video&gt;, and control it from JS, and still come out with a much smaller file size?  Perhaps there&#39;s just a requirement I&#39;m missing but that&#39;s an eye watering amount of data being served by Cloudfront to every visitor, and Cloudfront isn&#39;t exactly the cheapest.[1] https://d11poao410tx6l.cloudfront.net/616f05008e9fa70027fff3...edit: I got nerd sniped and downloaded all the frames. Considering only the largest animation (da2783d9-383d-43ec-8778-9b52f984c35a):  - 230 PNG frames: 51MB
  - WebM (VP9, alpha, lossless): 6.7MB (-86.7%)
  - WebM (VP9, alpha, crf15): 2.3MB (-95.5%)

Instead if I use all the frames in one big video:  - 1087 PNG frames: 271MB
  - WebM (VP9, alpha, lossless): 39.0MB (-85.6%)
  - WebM (VP9, alpha, crf15): 12.0MB (-95.6%)

I used ffmpeg 4.4.1 with the following commands:  ffmpeg -i &#39;frames/%6d.png&#39; -c:v libvpx-vp9 -lossless 1 lossless.webm
  ffmpeg -i &#39;frames/%6d.png&#39; -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 15 crf15.webm

To my eye, crf15 is very very good quality, but I included lossless encoding so there can be no quibble about quality differences :)And yes I know Safari can&#39;t do VP9 but there&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t also encode a HEVC and AV1 version and list multiple &lt;source&gt; elements and let the browser decide which format it prefersedit to the edit: It seems that smoothly scrubbing through a &lt;video&gt; element is more tricky than I originally knew.  Still, a lot of mileage could be gained by encoding the individual frames as AVIF or WebP and using them in supported browsers"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At my last job, I found our code review process was terribly slow and set about analyzing it and coming up with solutions.  I found a lot of developers were blocked on reviews.  They either task switched (expensive) or babysat their review (expensive).  Even though we were using Phab, few did stacked commits because of how unfamiliar the tools were which made them feel brittle.Improving the stacked workflow is one part of the equation but I&#39;d recommend being careful of letting that mask other problemsI identified a series of busy-waits including:- Post, wait, CI failure, fix, post- Post: wait for reviewer, ping reviewer, wait, find feedback was posted, fix, postSome of the root causes included:- Developers weren&#39;t being pinged when the ball was in their court (as author or reviewer)- Well, some notifications happened, but review groups were so noisy no one looked- The shared responsibility of review groups is everyone assumed someone else would look.- The tools we were using made it hard to identify active conversationsMy ideal solution:- Auto-assign reviewers from a review group, allowing shared responsibility of the code base while keeping individual accountability of reviews- Review tools that ping the person the review is blocked on when they are ready to act- Review tools that give a reminder after a set period of time- Azure DevOps&#39; tracking of conversation state with filtering (and toggling between original code and the &#34;fixed&#34; version)- Auto-merge-on-green-checks (including reviewer sign off)With this, responses are timely without people polling the service, letting machines micro-manage the process rather than humans."</p>

Work is getting &#34;blocked&#34; in code review.Devising a coping mechanism for developers so that they can increase the inbound flow to an already overloaded system is not actually a solution.The real solution to this rather common problem is to introduce a culture where &#34;done&#34; means &#34;shipped&#34; and not &#34;I created a bunch of PRs for my team mates to read and while they all do that Im gonna create some more&#34; and to use tech where you can to increase the flow the SDLC pipeline can handle.This involves things like moving as much &#34;code review&#34; into the compiler/linter as you can, do a little more design/consensus building upfront, streamline all acceptance testing and deployment steps to their bare essentials etc...https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/"</p>

I&#39;m happy to see someone trying to improve the code review situation on GitHub. When I did use GitHub at the startups I worked at, we were never fully satisfied with the code review experience.I hope they surface &#34;Phabricator versions&#34; as first-class objects. I never liked it how GitHub just clobbers the history left behind from force-pushes from to branch."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back, not too long ago, I started working on a new contract assignment at a medium size aerospace manufacturer.I show up and check in with IT department. The system administrator shows me to my desk, and hands me a post it note with my password.  Well pass phrase is more like it.  It was something like “sliding down the tall building”.I was quite impressed that they encouraged the use of long pass phrases instead of short cryptic passwords that are hard to remember (think “correct horse battery staple”).  This place really is serious about security, I thought.I thanked the system admin and causally said “I’ll be sure to change this to an equally secure pass phrase”.“Oh no,” he said, “we don’t allow people to change their passwords here. You see, we need to be able to log into anyone’s computer if they go on vacation or are out of the office, so we keep an Excel worksheet with everyone’s username and password. So please don’t change your password.”He turns and walks away, and I just sit there stunned, wondering if this was some kind of practical joke.Sadly he was completely serious.  I kept the password they gave me for the 3 months I was there, as I was asked to do, knowing that at any time someone could log in as me and do something illegal or unethical. It really did give me a bit of anxiety."</p>

My wife is Spanish and whenever I have to interact with Spanish bureaucracy it&#39;s like night and day. (This is partially to do with the inherited culture in each bureaucracy - we needed a certified translation of our marriage certificate, and the translator told us that the consulate had put the wrong email address on their website for her. She spent so long trying to get them to update it on their website that eventually she gave in and created the incorrect email address so she could pick up the emails that people were sending)."</p>

This is what has allowed an MVP to be successful, not the kludgy &#34;product&#34;.Sure, this product still needed to be built for people to be willing to continue to work together, but businesses of the sort have survived for years on spreadsheets and similar &#34;implementations&#34;.Some of these constraints do not hold on the internet, but you still need to catch the attention of the right folk to get that word-of-mouth moving (which is why we see so many &#34;Show HN&#34; posts here: there&#39;re plenty of people here who can do that for others)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okay folks! Jumping in to thank everyone for reading my story. I really didn&#39;t expect it to resonate with so many and I am so happy (and slightly terrified) that it did. Wow!Main reason I wrote it was to keep reminding myself that resources, and especially time, are limited. As a developer, it&#39;s easy to spend all your time on your pet project and think it&#39;s free and there&#39;s no harm. I fall for that all the time. But it&#39;s never free and yes, there is actual harm. Think of all the other projects you never launched. All the moments with loved ones you never had.Using creativity instead of all your time is just like using an elegant algorithm* instead of brute-forcing it.Notes:* I am a (primarily) front-end developer, don&#39;t know a single algorithm** Thanks @jeremylevy for sharing my story here, I would never dare to"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like this story but I must say it leaves me with more questions than answers. How did he get restaurants to sign on and trust him enough to prepare food for 1 month without payout? Assuming &#34;based on existing relationships&#34; I have to wonder his former employer didn&#39;t care about taking his rolodex and directly poaching customers? What about couriers? How did they handle &#34;no couriers available&#34; or a spike in demand? If someone places a delivery order and it turns out there&#39;s no one to deliver it in the next hour, that&#39;s a problem. What about disputes, refunds, missing items, &#34;this isn&#39;t what I ordered&#34; etc.? The all-cash nature of the business makes clear this was not a US based business where that would likely have been a non-starter.Very cool story but it&#39;s hard for me to really understand it without knowing how the business actually worked and made money. I assume it was a very different market from USA and so economics are very different (cheaper labor, less regulation etc.). Would love to know the name of the business to see the outcome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Did anyone else read this article and feel like it is a lot of words to say very little? I feel like the core of the article can be summarized into this:Air transport is still more expensive than shipping. But the magnitude is less than it used to be. This is because shipping is seeing bottlenecks and surcharges to handle the bottlenecks. Therefore it makes the more expensive air transport ok to use especially with time sensitive holiday purchases coming up.If that sounds right, almost all that comes from the last few sentences in the article."</p>

The route it took to get to Portland, Oregon, was Shanghai to Zhenzhou (where it spent a week), on to South Korea, then Anchorage, then a weekend in Louisville, Kentucky. How this makes any sense in terms of efficiency is totally beyond me.As a side note, I&#39;m mildly paranoid about new Apple devices spending a week held up in Chinese customs. Is the CCP throttling exports, or installing backdoors?"</p>

I made this project over 3 years ago and I didn’t even know about hacker rank at that time. This project was made because I was seeking a contract job and they asked me to create a leaderboard in react which i did with no code copying whatsoever. I implemented it in react hooks which wasn’t natively built into react so I used preact which had the newest feature set. If anything did hackerrank use my work to seed their tests? I see that as the likelihood. Also it could be because I used the text copy from the contracting job that asked me to create a leaderboard in the readme. In truth it could be either but this has become yet another pitch fork into a very difficult time where I have no job or money to do anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hackerrank also records videos and takes random screenshots of you when you are taking a tests.Unfortunately recruiters don’t inform about this in advance so that one could know about the privacy policy. When you are taking the test you’ve to give those permissions.I think those images can be seen by literally anyone at recruiting company (and then I guess at Hackerrank as well).edit: Context https://www.hackerrank.com/products/free-trial-search"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my issues with OKRs is the oft-repeated line that the goals should be so audacious that you should only expect to achieve about 70% of them.If you&#39;re following this advice, you are either purposefully choosing goals that you do not know how to achieve, which is a problem, or purposefully choosing goals whose achievement relies on way too many externalities over which you have little control, which is a problem.I&#39;m not saying external factors shouldn&#39;t be considered, or that we should only set goals that are within comfortable reach.Rather, I&#39;m saying the uncertainty should be accounted for differently. It should be baked into our goals, not treated as if it only matters at the OKR level.Imagine if you were to plan a sprint, and your story points did not factor in uncertainty at all. Then, you committed to a sprint size that also did not take into account uncertainty. But your stakeholders agreed that a 30% sprint failure rate was acceptable.Now imagine baking in uncertainty into your estimates and then committing to a sprint size you can realistically hit. Add stretch goals if you want. Doesn&#39;t that seem more sensible?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think of Steven Covey&#39;s &#34;Begin with the End in Mind&#34;.There really are some metrics that are strategic.  But when your manager is asked to have 20 OKRs just because your manager has to have 20 OKRs and then you get asked to have 20 OKRs that is a distraction.(In terms of strategy there might be one thing or three things you REALLY need to do.)At one place I worked I was expected to create OKRs for my own personal and professional development and I felt offended by it because it was out of phase with my own needs.Today I do a lot for personal and professional development and it is highly strategic,  it&#39;s motivated by being better at what I do for work but also about getting the social opportunities I want and where I think technology is going over the next ten years.Because it is strategic I am continuously finding that a project I started a year ago has given me exactly the resource I need right now for a situation I had no idea I&#39;d be in.Like hell I need to fill out a form in some artificial format for my boss about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NVIDIA, Intel and AMD sit on the ISO C++ and ISO Fortran standard committees. They voted GPU support into the C++ 2017 and Fortran 2018 ISO standards. While NVIDIA implemented this YEARS ago, almost 5 years after these ISO standards were voted in, Intel and AMD have not even announced a plan for implementing GPU support for ISO standard languages on their GPUs.Instead, Intel and AMD strategy is pushing applications to &#34;rewrite CUDA with HIP/OneAPI&#34;, which are not real standards and are no more portable than CUDA. The people claiming that they are &#34;open&#34;, probably also think that OpenACC is an open standard, even though it mostly only runs on NVIDIA GPUs.If you care about portable GPU code, unfortunately, NVIDIA is the only vendor that actually delivers.You can take your standard conforming C++ code _today_, not a single line of CUDA, OpenMP, OpenACC, etc. and the nvidia compiler compiles it and runs it on GPUs and multi-core CPUs. You can also take your normal Python NumPy code and run it on NVIDIA GPUs &#34;as is&#34; without changes.It doesn&#39;t get any more portable than that.I don&#39;t understand how there are so many people in these threads that apparently care about portability happy about AMD and Intel rewriting open source applications in their proprietary vendor-specific technologies, instead of angry about them pushing their proprietary technologies, instead of implementing GPU support for ISO standard languages, just like NVIDIA does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s good that AMD is providing support for some of their customers since OpenCL is being removed in 3.0. I hope that this is just the start of far greater investment into their software ecosystem. It was understandable that AMD invested less in drivers and support software when they were almost bankrupt but that excuse is drying up. There are rumors that future AMD GPU architectures will be quite good and it would be a shame for that advantage to be wasted by a lack of software support."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glad to hear it. We&#39;re going on 10 years since Blender notionally got OpenCL support, I bought an AMD GPU on that basis, found out that the &#34;OpenCL support&#34; was so thoroughly dismal that it was slower than my CPU, sold my AMD card, ate the ebay fees, bought an NVidia card, ate the green tax, and got on with my work.I had to repeat that lesson a few years later with deep learning code before it stuck.Hopefully this time is different. I&#39;m cautiously optimistic... but I&#39;ll let someone else be the guinea pig."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK, for starters, ECC has to become standard.Then the rate of ECC errors has to be monitored. If something is trying a rowhammer attack, it&#39;s going to cause unwanted bit flips which the ECC will correct. Normally, the ECC error rate is very low. Under attack, it should go up. So an attack should be noticeable.  You might get some false alarms, but that just means it&#39;s time to replace memory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article:
&gt; We demonstrate that it is possible to trigger Rowhammer bit flips on all DRAM devices today despite deployed mitigations on commodity off-the-shelf systems with little effort.The fact that user space code can cause bit flips in your RAM is a hardware bug. I&#39;d love to see this code in memory testers like memtest86 so I could send the RAM back if it ever caught a problem like this.I guess it shows just how close to the edge of not working our modern computing environment is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eventually, it will be obvious that running shared workloads on a single piece of physical hardware has fundamentally unremediatable security implications. This slow recognition is deeply perpendicular with how the current landscape of x86 chips are both manufactured and priced, as well as how cloud providers have structured billions of dollars in DC investment; in other words, they&#39;ll down-play it. This will be a massive opportunity for ARM &amp; SoC manufacturers in the coming years, as its far better positioned to offer, for example, a single rack appliance with 64 individual 2-core mini-computers at a price-point competitive with a 128 core x86 rack, as one computer.Computing moves in cycles:- 2000s: gigahertz race on each core- 2010s: increase core counts, multicore everything- 2020s: back to core-efficiency and increasing per-core performance. M1 is already leading this charge, but is obviously a mismatch for a DC environment.AMD and Intel need to adjust, or face extinction. Its not just about pushing ultra-high per-core performance (they&#39;re both good at this); its about pushing for more efficiency, so per-blade density in a DC can be pushed higher in the face of more, smaller individual computers. If they don&#39;t evolve, AWS will for them [1].[1] https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The streams are back up.Yet, this thread quickly devolved into a discussion about the grand conspiracy to censor instead of the repeated failure of automated tools and the ease at which they&#39;re abused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think at this point we can just expect this stuff.The ridiculousness of it, though.  The rekieta law stream (which is fantastic, btw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7YXd2M5E-8) has anywhere from 4-12 active lawyers giving commentary and context to everything that is happening.This is exactly the type of thing we dreamed about when we were first creating the internet.However: often times these smaller independent journalists and commenters go against the reality that media companies want you to believe you live in.  Thus: they get censored.  Rekieta lost almost 40,000 people who were getting live commentary from a diverse (idealogically) set of lawyers, and now must to places where these companies can assert more narrative control.It&#39;s sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It doesn&#39;t fit the narrative that they and the entire mainstream media are so desperate to perpetuate.  Allowing the plebs to see unbiased content and judge for themselves terrifies them. Same thing with removing the downvote count.

Though I don&#39;t use Xerox (my scanner is Epson Perfection V39), I never considered the possibility that a scan of a document can result in altered numbers.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I live in Christchurch, NZ, and so I see a variety of long distance travellers in the swamplands and estuaries, including bar-tailed godwits at the end of Southshore spit https://newsline.ccc.govt.nz/news/story/draft-godwits-arriva...A huge amount of housing and infrastructure here wouldn’t be allowed now, because when it was built it would have disrupted rare birds (or perhaps that is why the birds are now rare).It does make one feel more aware of how the world is connected when you realise that migratory birds need to survive stopovers in other countries like China.The birds also need to survive in New Zealand, where just a few signs and some social convention prevents dogs from attacking nesting sites (edit: or people disturbing them), and it would be hard to lock down the area since many people would strongly assert their rights to go there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"According to Wikipedia a godwit weighs ~0.5kg and it flew 7000 miles. If my calculations are right we are looking at 1.5kwh of energy and 0.2 wh per mile?Even if we assume that the bird is almost all fat and fat can store ~3500kcal per pound, the maximum stored energy is 4kwh. That gives us 0.8wh per mile. So we can safely say that the bird spent [1.5-4kwh] to do this trip.Teslas that are very efficient are in the order of 200 wh per mile.What the heck we have a lot of work to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I immediately smelled bullshit in the headline because surely they don&#39;t mean non-stop in the literal sense. An animal has to eat! But no, I was wrong, these birds fly 8+ days in a row without sleep or food (or a complete mental breakdown, presumably). Though I do find it odd the article doesn&#39;t discuss the food and sleep issue more."</p>

A network tool I&#39;ve always wanted is one that automates the investigation you have to do manually if you are experienceing &#34;internet issues&#34;. I mean, the check list is quite straightforward but still a pretty manual process, stuff like:
- Do I have the expected IP?
- Is there large packet loss or latency issues hinting at connectivity issues?
- Can I ping the local gateway?
- Can I ping to outside network?
- Is my nearest DNS responding?
- Is another, remote DNS responding?
- What does Downdetector or similar say about the service I&#39;m trying?It would be nice with a one click tool that just went through this in order and gave a diagnosis."</p>

It was 2x my current salary and it was too hard to turn it down when the money was right there in front of me.I had sincere moral issues with the company but I convinced myself their worst days were likely behind them, that they were committed to doing the work to to fix their reputation. The last 2 years have only gotten worse and it’s very clear the leadership has no interest in making meaningful changes to address social harm caused by the platform. I legit don’t like telling people what I do for a living when I meet someone new at a bar for fear they ask where I work.Couple this with a culture that has masterminded a set of carrots and sticks that gets people to push themselves very hard all of the time, I’m completely burnt out. My GF pretty much told me she can’t handle living with someone so stressed out all the time.I don’t have another job lined up but I’m not too worried. I’m excited for a reset. I’m taking through the end of the year to cool off and prep for interviews. I think it’s imperative at my next job that I at least somewhat believe in the product. I’ve learned that money isn’t enough to keep me going in the face of giving 0 fucks about the company mission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have much data points to share. But I&#39;ve been seeing responses to people working FB have been horrible since for a while now.It has been a common trend that when someone I know posts a job position in FB, nobody replies to it. At least not publicly (publicly means replying to tweet, replying to slack message in a well knit/known group of people). Even if they are replying personally and privately, that in itself shows a problem.When I see someone working in FB, I can&#39;t deny that I am judging them. At this point, there is no reason to give a benefit of the doubt to how bad FB is to people, democracy and humanity in general. Sure, you can argue with technical meritocracy of some tech they produce. But how long can you sell yourself that excuse really when on the other side, adverse effects are mounting up?As nerdy and smart as tech workers are, we are still in need of validation from others right? There definitely should be some effect on people being perceived as a bad person for working for a bad company even if it is paying a ton. FAANG engineers should be more than equipped to look elsewhere because of it."</p>

They’re in a position where engineering resources desperately need to be closing gaps, not creating huge new ones.There seems to be a prioritization problem at the very least.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an anecdotal example that may be relevant, I wanted to upgrade to Monterey and my Mac Mini said there wasn&#39;t enough room.Hooked up a Western Digital external drive that I had used on previous Macs and launched Time Machine. And that&#39;s when it started. Time Machine presented what seemed like a stack of Finder windows in the middle, a timeline with hash marks on the right-side and the only button highlighted was the &#34;Cancel&#34;.No menu, no other actionable buttons, no right-click menu. Nothing. So after hitting various key combos and mouse buttons, I decided that my 30+ minutes trying to use Apple&#39;s built-in backup software to backup a few folders was better spent finding 3rd party software.And that was another user experience fail in my opinion for Apple and any &#34;total quality&#34; experience.And that&#39;s not even talking about Safari or XCode or Pages or Numbers or iBooks not syncing and so many others."</p>

And this was for Windows 10 which I hear is a mild version of a mess that Windows 11 is.I was instantly reminded why I appreciate Apple software more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Who is going to do it?&#34; is always my first question whenever I am asked to estimate a piece of work. PMs/EMs are usually taken aback by the response, as if we are all supposed to pretend that all dev &#34;resources&#34; are equal. Yet reality doesn&#39;t fit into neat planning spreadsheets or burndown graphs, so often gets ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a security engineer but have been a business leader from time to time.  Business leaders often need to plan around dates- eg ”should we spend $50k announcing at conference Y in month Z, or should we wait until month A?”  “Our competition just launched; will we be able to launch this quarter (the board wants to know, and we have to report material financial impact items quarterly or face SEC fines)?”Every team I have ever worked with hates planning; every team hates their methodology and thinks it’s stupid and inaccurate and why are those pinhead business people insisting on a date; it’ll be done when it’s done.One of the primary jobs of managers at all levels is to plan and then execute in accordance with the plan.  Some managers are good at it, many aren’t- the world is populated with people nearer the center than the ends of the bell curve.So show me a methodology that mere mortals can implement successfully.  If all you can do is complain and point out unicorn 500x engineers (yeah try hiring for that characteristic, good luck), then I don’t want to hear it.  But if you have a practical idea on how to “solve” planning, then you have my full attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cathartic to read, but I also despair at getting the people who need to hear it to take it seriously.&gt; But many people want the world to be simpleThis is the source of so much insanity in the world, not just with regard to allocating labor. Details matter, but people who plan &#34;timelines&#34; desperately don&#39;t want to hear it. They can go through whole careers without being forced out of the cozy illusion that the world is simple. It&#39;s hard to get a man to believe something when his salary depends on it not being true, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the movie The War Lover, Steve McQueen (well, the actual pilot) pilots a B17 bomber &#34;cutting the grass&#34;, i.e. flying low with the gear up. The stunt was to be done with models because it was too dangerous.My dad was in the AF at the time, and was assigned to the movie as a consultant on AF trivia. He convinced them that the stunt could be done safely, and explained how to do it.And so it was done. My dad got in trouble, because if the B17 had crashed doing the stunt, the AF would have looked bad. But it didn&#39;t crash, and the stunt was a big deal to the movie crowds, so he was forgiven.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGGynxYbA48It&#39;s still freakin&#39; impressive today.His other contribution to the movie was the mission briefing wall maps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most fascinating non-CGI effect from Terminator 2 is a cut scene which can be seen in the director&#39;s cut, where they use Linda Hamilton twin sister in a surprising way: to fake a &#34;mirror&#34; scene where Sarah is operating on the Terminator&#39;s head.They are in front of a mirror. They wanted to actually use Arnie in the reflection to show his face; they wanted a dummy for the head closest to the camera, to show the surgery inside the head. So they used a window in the wall instead of a mirror! Linda Hamilton and her twin sister are mimicking each other&#39;s movements to make it seem it&#39;s a mirror image.(The other use of Linda&#39;s twin sister, the scene where the T-1000 fakes being Sarah, is better known)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As more data comes out about Google, Apple, Amazon, one simple underlying thing becomes clear: a single company cannot be trusted to operate a marketplace while also being a participant.Apple&#39;s App Store insider knowledge lets them discover popular apps, then boot them off the platform when they decide to compete. Amazon sees what products are successful and profitable, then makes knock-offs which they promote over the originals. And now, reading into this, Google is manipulating their ad markets using inside knowledge.It&#39;s all very profitable.If we cannot trust large companies to not abuse this kind of power, then they should be prevented by law from playing both sides. This may result in the breakup of some very large companies, akin to the 1934 Air Mail Act that broke up Boeing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The lawsuit also highlights Google&#39;s use of a secret program dubbed &#34;Project Bernanke&#34; in 2013 that used bidding data to give its own ad-buying an advantage.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read this and couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that it&#39;s a fantasy tale because it mentions the mystical Unity support engineer who actually fixes bugs - the one I haven&#39;t been able to get a hold on for the past 5 years, despite having critical bugs escalated by support... But then I noticed this is from 2016, so before they started kicking out experienced people to polish their profit margin for the IPO.Still an amazing debugging story, though :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When another thread pushes a socket to be processed by the socket polling thread, the socket polling thread calls select() on that function. Since select() is a blocking call, when another socket is pushed to the socket polling thread queue it has to somehow interrupt select() so the new socket gets processed ASAP. How does one interrupt select() function? Apparently, we used QueueUserAPC() to execute asynchronous procedure while select() was blocked… and threw an exception out of it!Not taking anything away from the great debugging, but that is just incredibly bad design and reeks of bugs from a mile away. System calls block for a reason. If you can&#39;t handle the blocking, how about a non-blocking architecture? But in this case, the engineer thought &#34;hey, I don&#39;t want to block on my precious main thread, so let&#39;s just give this blocking thing to another thread, that&#39;ll surely solve it!&#34;. Except it doesn&#39;t when you use that same thread as a worker to execute all other thread&#39;s blocking crap ... but then write the queue push() function to be blocking as well!Keep it simple folks. Bad design always breeds more bad design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: &#34;Surprisingly, setting up kernel debugging is extremely easy on Windows.&#34;Microsoft (at least used to) take developers very seriously. The OS actually plays along when you&#39;re trying to debug things, and Windows error reporting actually sends you data that you can work with.Say what you want about their business practices, but I&#39;d deal with Microsoft&#39;s developer support over Apple&#39;s anytime.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had my Vizio TV (P55-F1, 2019 model; a mid range model) for about 2.5 years now. Image/sound quality is great. But the annoyances and overall mediocrity of the OS and its updates [0] made me just disconnect the TV from the internet and fully switch over to using an Apple TV for all consumption rather than using the native Vizio OS.[0]: The OS is terrible and the remote randomly stops working sometimes. Sometimes the TV would take tens of seconds to turn on, but then other times it was near instant.Every single update since I&#39;ve gotten the TV seems to make the TV even slower/more laggy. There was even an update about two years back where the Youtube app&#39;s volume was inexplicably an order of magnitude lower than every other input&#39;s volume (e.g. a volume of 100/100 on the Youtube app ended up being equivalent to a volume of 10/100 for all other apps/inputs). It took Vizio 1-3 months to fix it.Unblockable ads on the home screen and genuinely multi-hundred millisecond response times on the app launcher infuriated me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is likely incorrect.The $57.3 million is for the &#34;Platform+&#34; division. It includes profit from homescreen ads, selling of buttons on remotes, and cuts of streaming revenue. It&#39;s likely that only a small fraction of the division&#39;s $83 million in revenue comes from tracking and then selling viewing habits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On a similar theme, I remember reading a story about a server that would crash mysteriously every couple of weeks. They eventually worked out that this happened whenever there was a new moon or a full moon, and the resulting high tide caused a battleship moored in a nearby harbour to rise just high enough that its powerful radar would interfere with the server."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;When did this start?  A
few days ago, you said, but did anything change in your systems at that time?&#34;&gt; &#34;Well, the consultant came in and patched our server and rebooted it.&gt; Having established that--unbelievably--the problem as reported was true,
and repeatableAs far as problems go, this is an easy one to solve. Accurate description of the problem. Accurate reporting of what changed. Problem is consistently repeatable.Compared to a problem that doesn’t reliably reproduce and for which the person reporting it claims nothing changed, this one is child’s play.But it’s still amusing to read every time.I had something similar occur in the early 2000s on a patch release of Solaris 2.6 (I think) where the sleep call was broken and would always return almost instantly. This caused all sorts of weird behaviors on the running system.I also recall the first time I ran into an issue with MTU on a dedicated frame relay link we had to admin our web farm in the late nineties. One day a developer reported they could login to our bastion but when they ran “ls -l” in a big enough directory their ssh connection would hang. It turned out the connection would hang whenever a packet was generated near the MTU and we eventually tracked it down to an issue with the frame relay connection. We played with MTUs until we found out what worked. It then took a while to convince our provider what was going on but they eventually replaced a line card on the far end of the connection which allowed us to re-raise the MTU to 1500.Another fun problem I had was an email to SMS gateway I wrote for myself that worked by posting to a Verizon web form. I developed it on a Mac (probably 2002 or so) where it worked fine but when I deployed it to my Linux box on my same home network, the script couldn’t connect to Verizon’s site. It turned out the Linux box was a setting a flag on the TCP connection (ECN I think) that was tripping up Verizon’s web firewall. The work-around was disabling ECN on the Linux box."</p>

I did a random selection of the first 200 problems on my own about a decade ago but ran out of steam as the problems got harder.Recently, however, I introduced it at work as a way of encouraging the team I manage to work collaboratively. We have a fortnightly catch up where we talk through solutions, pick new problems (we have a script that randomly picks an easy, medium and hard problem, which has become an exciting ritual), and then we have an initial discussion about each of the new problems.It&#39;s a good way to foster group work. It&#39;s also a great way to introduce people to using version control and pull-requests in a non-scary way!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; When people buy access to a service via a subscription in an iOS app, they are essentially Apple’s customers. For privacy reasons Apple does not provide much information about them to the apps or businesses that run the apps. That means it’s hard to do customer service, address issues, or solve any problems.&gt; “The user experience is much worse,” a marketing executive from one company told me. “When you buy with the developer, they have a relationship with you ... when you buy from Apple: sorry, you’re Apple’s customer, not ours, and if you have a problem with a subscription … we can’t really help them.”Now interview a real user of subscriptions instead of a brand marketing executive and ask them if the user experience is worse.PS. Even when not confronted with such a piece, remember that Forbes is no longer the business journalism folks may have grown up with.  For the past decade, it’s a blogging platform for independent contributors:&gt; Each contributor flies solo with his own blog. He is responsible for conceiving and creating the content, ensuring its accuracy and building an engaged, loyal readership.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lovely corporate ethics. I posted this in our company slack room as an example of how not to act for bizdevGoogle benefits too much from this sort of arrangement to have any incentive to stop it, even though these are unauthorized advertisements that are specifically against Google&#39;s AdWords TOS (side note, I wonder if there is a legal avenue to follow when a vendor doesn&#39;t follow their own TOS? An interesting thought...).This is also a recurring issue with all of Google&#39;s advertising revenue -- malicious behavior such as fraudulent clicks, unauthorized ads, etc., are a decent portion of the revenue stream, and Google is financially incentivized to keep these sorts of abuse going until the ruse is up and the accuracy of their system is called into question publicly in a way that scares away advertisers, but with NDAs and corporate secrecy, it is far too easy to keep things unbalanced, and keep abuse like this in the dark.Business models like this demonstrate just how dire the need for regulation is in some areas of the tech world, particularly among FANG."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That Apple would do this is interesting, but more interesting to me is Google&#39;s position, and obligation, here. There was a throw-away line in the article about Google &#34;not doing anything about it&#34;. What could or should Google do about it? Has Google mediated between competitive ad-buyers in the past? I am not sympathetic to goog in general but it seems like that line puts them in a no-win situation: either they err for not doing anything, or they err for doing something (but not the right thing). Indeed, in this case it would seem the corrective action would better come from Apple than from Google. (Also note this whole play feels like Apple trying to get creative with ways to productively bleed off ridiculously huge capital reserves in a low risk way. It would be ironic for Apple if this blows up into a big thing, but somehow I really doubt it will. )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The beginning of this article is a fairy tale that ignores what used to be one of the biggest drivers of revenue for banks: overdraft fees. Maybe the HN crowd has never been in a situation where they were auto-billed into a negative balance, which then caused an overdraft fee that then further drove their balance into negative territory, but this was a weekly/monthly fiasco for millions of Americans.I was once in a meeting with one of the senior executives at JPMorgan, where the guy smugly told me he felt they were “doing a service for the community” by charging people overdraft fees. After leaving the meeting, my very senior colleague said, “I had to hold myself back from throwing that guy out of his window.”These sorts of articles — half PR, half history lesson — tend to leave out these sorts of politically inconvenient but important bits of history. It’s so much work to unpack the bias..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Typically, the apps offer their users a choice: payouts at the speed of banking, for free, or payouts at the speed of the Internet, for a small convenience fee. Cash App charges 1.5% with a minimum of a quarter.This is just another way the financial system (including fintech startups) preys on the poor. If you are well off, you wouldn&#39;t want to pay any convenience fee for the privilege of receiving money from a business a few days earlier. In fact, you can think of it as interest: from first principles if someone delays a payment to you, theoretically they should pay more because of interest; now if you opt for waiting 3 days and saving the 1.5% convenience fee, you would effectively earn an interest of 1/(1-0.015)-1 = 1.5% in 3 days. That&#39;s not even an annualized figure. If annualized it would be 1.5%/3*365=122% implied annual interest rate. No one in their right mind who does not have cash flow issues would opt for receiving debit card payments with such a fee.&gt; Many report that it transforms the nature of their interaction with the underlying application; delivery driving for casual drivers becomes something that you can burst up to fill an immediate cash need or mentally allocate against a particular desired expenditure (e.g. “Drive for 3 hours to afford a night out starting immediately after you log off.”)If your cash flow is not an issue and have credit, this is how you would handle it: let&#39;s drive for 3 hours, receive the full payment amount in a few days instead of immediately, and put all the charges from the night out on a credit card, whose bill will become due in a month or two, with no interest. But the poor doesn&#39;t have a bank account or a credit card, so they suffer. They pay more in fees. That&#39;s the injustice of the system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Here&#39;s why I like SSH signatures:&gt;* It&#39;s not PGP.The most important reason people use the OpenPGP message format is because it is a well accepted standard. Sure the cryptography is not new and fun but it is secure. If you sign something with OpenPGP then you can be sure that those signatures are verifiable on any platform by anyone. The OpenPGP standard has provisions to ensure that the signatures are from a particular entity. This proposal suggests that Github could be treated as a trusted third party. If that is the case then you don&#39;t need signatures at all.Obligatory &#34;The PGP Problem&#34; rebuttal:* https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan:tpp"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; GitHub acts as a trusted third party here, and you have to trust them not to lie about people&#39;s public keys, so it may not be appropriate for all use cases. But relying on a trusted third party with a professional security team like GitHub seems like a way better default than PGP&#39;s Web of Trust, which was nigh impossible to use.Hopefully that&#39;s a false dichotomy and the entire Free Software community doesn&#39;t end up reliant on Microsoft to host all our keys for us.  The article goes on to mention key transparency, though, which does seem like the right solution.I note that rekor (the transparency log implementation used by sigstore) already supports signing with SSH keys[0], so this TechRepublic article about it[1] from March (which lists only &#34;GPG, x509 and Minisign&#34;) is already out of date.[0] https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/blob/main/types.md#ssh[1] https://www.techrepublic.com/article/a-new-linux-foundation-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding PGP&#39;s &#39;Web of Trust&#39;, I thought the purpose of this was to validate the link between the key and the owner of that key.  This is not what you get from retrieving a public key from github... that only gives you the link between that key and a github account.  But what does that give you?From what I understand, it gives you nothing for anything that is signed and that does not have a direct link to a github account.  Obviously, if someone releases software on that github account and I find a signed release of that software, I can validate that it really was signed by the official source of that software on github. For anything that does not have that direct link, it really does not give you anything.I&#39;ve never used PGP, but I thought the web of trust was used to validate metadata on the key and that this can be used to validate that a key really belongs to the person that you think it belongs to.  I saw it more like how you have SSL certificates with different degrees of validation and where you must deliver more proof of your identity if you want to receive a certification with a higher degree of validation.I&#39;m all for using SSH keys for signing, but I still would like to have something like PGP&#39;s web of trust for those keys."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  We have been made aware of &#34;scary&#34; emails sent in the last few hours that purport to come from the FBI/DHS. While the emails are indeed being sent from infrastructure that is owned by the FBI/DHS (the LEEP portal), our research shows that these emails *are* fake.

https://twitter.com/spamhaus/status/1459450061696417792"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The email domain where the messages originate is from some sort of federated identity management system that was created in 2010 (here is a proposal deck [0] with technical details). Found this program simply by searching Google for the sending domain.Based on the guide for using this system [1] (see step 15) looks like this specific email address is the one that sends automated confirmation emails upon registration. Perhaps someone was able to inject a message instead of the regular canned text through some sort of reflection attack? This explains why replies to the message result in a canned response. The system also now appears to be temporarily down. So it’s getting some sort of attention (internally taken down (most likely) or maybe denial of service from the abuse).The Reddit thread suggests the recipients’ emails are likely ARIN IP range contacts. Those are very available from tools like this [2] so nothing interesting with that, but the real question is WHY someone would do this at all? This was clearly given some thought (on who to send this to who would actually take the time to verify the headers) but given the sloppiness of everything else, is this just a script kiddie flex? Whoever it is pissed off the FBI and gained absolutely nothing.[0] https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/docu...[1] https://www.justice.gov/tribal/page/file/1260671/download[2] http://itools.com/tool/arin-whois-domain-search"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of people commenting that the text of the email seems amateurish. Perhaps it’s exactly as it should be, but you don’t understand its purpose. Maybe they wanted this to be discussed on netsec forums everywhere, so that Google searches for “Vinny Troia” always lead back to discussion about this email, framing him as a cyber criminal and outranking legitimate posts about or by him - an online identity assassination. They needed the email to set off some alarm bells so that it would pique enough interest to be widely discussed. They appear to have widely targeted the email addresses of system admins. I’m fairly certain this was their intention.Also, does it strike anyone else as odd that the account that posted this to HN was created hours ago, for the sole purpose of starting this thread?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Portuguese here)
Portuguese Parliament and Government publish law every day and afterhours[1], as a citizen I have to keep up with this. MPs believe they are doing a great job by producing more Law, instead of checking if what is in place is accountable. A common behaviour is when a &#34;crime&#34; case is well covered by the media, the first thing is said &#34;we need to change the Law&#34;, trying to dodge blame.I have been working remote for 17 years, and the teams I worked in, work asynchronously. It is fine to text, slack, discord and email after hours, people don&#39;t expect to get answers immediately, they will reply according to their schedule or contract.One case is that employers have to compensate employees for electricity and utilities for working remote, in my case that is a cost of €10.58, I save much more for not commuting, financially and psychologically.[1] https://dre.pt/dre/home"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we open up a broader discussion about Portugal&#39;s culture of work? On one hand this sends a message that Portugal cares about work/life balance for everyday citizens. On the other my general impression of Portugal&#39;s economy is that it&#39;s one of the weaker members of the EU. High debt, not a huge driver of innovation, wealth, etc. These are all just loosely held beliefs kicking around in my head. I&#39;m not attached to any of them or sure that they are even accurate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I DM my staff on slack “after hours” [1] all the time, and set the expectation that they should respond when appropriate at their discretion. That could (and often does) mean the next business day or even later. Or it could mean ASAP; they’re adults, and have the judgement to make the correct call.[1] Obviously, this policy is not targeted at staff in different time zones, which makes their remedy meaningless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading this really drove home to me just how amusing some of the twists and turns of music tech development are. In contemporary modular synth formats, you now have modules that use similar FM tone chips, but are controlled by potentiometers and analog control voltage inputs (for instance, https://busycircuits.com/alm011/). I could see how someone could conclude that this destroys the reproducibility advantages of digital FM synthesis, while preserving the cheesiness of FM sounds. From another perspective, you can freely explore the enormous landscape of sound produced by FM synthesis, without diving into the deep end of DX7 programming. Instead of generating sysex dumps on the fly to dynamically change the sounds produced by the synth, you just feed whatever control voltage you can come up with into the inputs of a module and bask in the insanity that comes out (for instance—https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-YEbg040ww definitely not everyone’s cup of tea).Edit: but if you want to explore the landscape of FM tones generated by these chips without spending all of your money on a modular setup, generating sysex messages will of course take you where you want to go: https://fo.am/activities/midimutant/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is maybe a little outside the scope of your article, but I&#39;ve read about the DX7&#39;s log2 based sine wavetables in the past, and it makes sense from a math standpoint (log2(x) + log2(y) = log2(x*y)). However, I find it confusing when I go to try to replicate it. My understanding is that these are NOT floating point numbers. In which case the output would be in the 8bit range of (0-257) or -127 to +127 if we&#39;re using signed values.So assuming I want to represent a signal value of 127 (i.e. sin(t) = 127) using base 2 logs, I punch this into my calculator and i get log2(127) = 6.9886.
But that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to be stored in the signal LUT since it&#39;s a floating point number.I think I&#39;m probably missing something obvious, but any clarification would be amazing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I agree with the author in principle, I think there is an implicit criteria they ignore, which is the intuitive correctness from the perspective of the user.Imagine a user chooses &#34;Sort by rating&#34;, and they subsequently observe an item with an average 4.5 ranking above a score of 5.0 because it has a higher Wilson score. Some portion of users will think &#34;Ah, yes, this makes sense because the 4.5 rating is based on many more reviews, therefore its Wilson score is higher.&#34; and the vast, vast majority of users will think &#34;What the heck? This site is rigging the system! How come this one is ranked higher than that one?&#34; and erode confidence in the rankings.In fact, these kinds of black-box rankings* frequently land sites like Yelp into trouble, because it is natural to assume that the company has a finger on the scale so to speak when it is in their financial interests to do so. In particular, entries with a higher Wilson score are likely to be more expensive because their ostensibly-superior quality commands (or depends upon) their higher cost, exacerbating this effect due to perceived-higher margins.So the next logical step is to present the Wilson score directly, but this merely shifts the confusion elsewhere -- the user may find an item they&#39;re interested in buying, find it has one 5-star review, and yet its Wilson score is &lt;&lt; 5, producing at least the same perception and possibly a worse one.Instead, providing the statistically-sound score but de-emphasizing or hiding it, such as by making it accessible in the DOM but not visible, allows for the creation of alternative sorting mechanisms via e.g. browser extensions for the statistically-minded, without sacrificing the intuition of the top-line score.* I assume that most companies would choose not to explain the statistical foundations of their ranking algorithm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article inspired me so much that I based my shitty undergrad senior thesis on it. My idea was to predict the trend of the ratings by using I think a trailing weighted average, weighted to the most recent window. It managed to generate more &#34;predictive&#34; ratings of the following 6 months based on the Amazon dataset I used, but I doubt it would have held up to much scrutiny. I learned a ton though!Edit: Link to paper, which looks like it actually attempts to use a linear prediction algorithm. https://github.com/rkuykendall/rkuykendall.com/blob/e65147f6..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using this at work for the last year or so to great success.For example, we have an internal phishing simulation/assessment program, and want to track metrics like improvement and general uncertainty. Since implementing this about a year ago, we&#39;ve been able to make great improvements such as:* for a given person, identify the wilson lower bound that they would not get phished if they were targeted* for the employee population as a whole, determine the 95% uncertainty on whether a sample employee would get phished if targetedIt lets us make much more intelligent inferences about things, much more accurate risk assessments, and also lets us improve the program pretty significantly (e.g. your probability of being targeted being weighted by a combination of your wilson lower bound and your wilson uncertainty).There are SO MANY opportunities to improve things by using this method. Obviously it isn&#39;t applicable everywhere, but I&#39;d suggest you look at any metrics you have that use an average and just take a moment to ask yourself if a Wilson bound would be more appropriate, or might enable you to make marked improvements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience with learning math is that the first months are all about backtracking. You have to fill all your holes.It&#39;s basically one big graph of concepts.The tricky part is, most beginners simply don&#39;t know how to navigate that graph.They see complex numbers with their exponentials and cos/sin forms and shut down.They can learn all these concepts no problem, but finding what they need to learn defeats them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the foreward&gt; These  de­finitions, which are not at all simple for the  
&gt; beginner,  came  to  be  used  in  the wrong  context.  
&gt; Textbooks  presented them  before  any explanation  was 
&gt; given of  the  theory and its applications, there­
&gt; by  complicating  an  understanding  of things  that  
&gt; were  intuitively  clear.hear hear!This problem is like most of the Wikipedia pages that I come across on &#39;complex&#39; topics of not just maths but anything remotely intersting technically. I just give up in the end. Life is too short to be bothered with some editor&#39;s &#39;dick measuring&#39; competition about how clever they."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with self-hosted search engine is that they make you _very_ unique: you’re the only client of the ”backend“ engine with that (static and non-NATed) IP. Furthermore, you’re now one of the small group of people with ”hosting“ IPs. Using self-hosted SearX may make you easier to track, not harder.Using SearX hosted by someone else is marginally better, but now you have to trust the owner of the server, which is probably not what you want for privacy-centered search engine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that if you’re building a framework with the intent of using Linux avoid the “vpro” variant of the Intel wireless adapter:https://community.frame.work/t/using-the-ax210-with-linux-on...Last I checked with every recommended config tweak you still lose ~3% battery per hour of suspend, which really adds up and is extremely annoying.We’ve been asking framework to include a notice referencing this issue when configuring but as of the last time I checked they haven’t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://frame.work/blog/linux-on-the-framework-laptop :“ There has been immense interest in this configuration, with it outselling pre-configured systems with Windows 10 by a wide margin.”There is a market. And it is currently under-served."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m typing this on my Framework now and I have to say it really is a special device. The prevailing culture of treating technology as disposable is something I personally don&#39;t vibe with - I always keep all of my tech and have collected machines over the years that most people would probably consider obsolete and uninteresting (there&#39;s an Amiga 1000 and iMac G3 currently in my field of view). Having a fully open machine that I can customize, upgrade and repair for the foreseeable future is just so cool and makes me feel like this is my personal computer in the truest sense of the word!A few takeaways from using it for around a month now:1. This is the most &#34;premium&#34; feeling non-Apple laptop I&#39;ve ever owned. Most of the laptops I&#39;ve ever daily driven are Macs or Thinkpads so take that for what it&#39;s worth, but I think most people will be happy with the fit and finish of this device.2. The swappable port system is actually a lot more useful than I expected. I initially thought it would be something I set up once and didn&#39;t bother with again for a while but there are a lot of random moments where it comes in handy. I&#39;m kind of a messy, hyper person that periodically reorganizes my desk and I like to move between different workspaces when I need a different setting to feel creative. Being able to move my HDMI or USB-C ports around for better cable management is so nice and yeah I could use an external hub but I&#39;ve always found those to be annoying on-the-go and just &#34;feels bad man&#34;. Also I don&#39;t use Micro SD cards as much as other people but there are times when I do and being able to swap that in is really kewl.3. Linux support is amazing but there are still a few hiccups. I use Arch Linux and everything works perfectly except for one minor inconvenience with Bluetooth: on a soft restart, the Bluetooth is disabled and I have to do a hard restart to restore it (can be mitigated by a kernel downgrade and should be fixed in a future update). It&#39;s not a deal breaker for me as I usually just close my laptop and put it to sleep, but just know that it&#39;s like running Linux on most other computers - you&#39;re going to have a much better time if you&#39;re fluent in tinkering and configuring your OS.4. The 3:2 display is awesome for programming and content creation, and I don&#39;t know why more devices don&#39;t adopt it. My only criticism is that it&#39;s not a touch screen but with how modular this laptop is it&#39;s only a matter of time before that becomes an option."</p>
