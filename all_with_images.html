One of the submissions on top was &#34;Ask PG: What are your thoughts on current YC News community?&#34;You&#39;d think the comments were made last year, not in 2008:&gt; I discovered HN in spring and Reddit to and I have found the quality of HN going down in the last month&gt; Personally I find nearly all the mass-media submissions to be a dilution, no matter how techie or startup they sound.Although I relate the most to the PG&#39;s comment:&gt; There are always a few highly ranked stories that make me think &#34;how could anyone vote that up?&#34; but on average they&#39;re pretty interesting. There&#39;s no other site I prefer.I&#39;m curious about this one too:&gt; If you must have a resume or portfolio, you should most definitely add your HN username and link to it.Did anyone do it?https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2008-08-08https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=270991"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started reading HN around 2008 but created my account on October 22, 2009 when I made my first of two submissions to YC (didn&#39;t succeed in either). I just looked at my submission upvote history and its pretty much a history of my interests and time wasted in the past 12 years. Wow, time does fly!I&#39;ve upvoted 14,129 submissions, here&#39;s the first three:14129. Oct 22, 2009: The “Interview” with Y Combinator That’s Not,  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=92372214128. Feb 24, 2010: Isaac Asimov - The Relativity of Wrong (1989) , https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=114796814127. Marc 10, 2010: Putting Google to the Test in Translation, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1180926The Asimov entry has my first HN comment ever, with 19 upvotes! How happy I must have been at the time. The crazy thing is that it took me 5 months to upvote three submissions, now I do more than that in my morning round! I must have been more discerning at the time.When I had slightly more than 10,000 links I thought of starting a blog called &#34;The March of the 10,000&#34;, to write about selected bookmarks from my upload list; never got around doing it. I must have been busy accumulating more HN bookmarks :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Disclaimer: I&#39;m a franco-Canadian of mixed European descent.)This article doesn&#39;t give China a great image, sure. I can think of a million criticisms to levy against China.However, I feel like a lot of the comments aren&#39;t just criticizing China, they seem to be outright anti-China.I wonder if, in the grand scheme of things, Americans/Westerners might be feeling threatened by the shift in power. I wonder if Americans/Westerners are capable of appreciating the things that China gets right, or does right. I wonder if Americans/Westerners are capable of acknowledging the things that their countries get wrong, or do wrong. I wonder if we here in the West are as fair and balanced as we tend to think.This isn&#39;t merely an academic question, I think it goes to the core of the state of mind that is required to view situations objectively (regardless of whether we might be right or wrong in any specific context).In this case, I&#39;m totally on Wikimedia&#39;s side.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a neat article, but it does have some errors.One subtle point that the post gets wrong:&gt; So where does that come from? The answer is that Python stores everything inside dictionaries associated with each local scope. Which means that every piece of code has its own defined “local scope” which is accessed using locals() inside that code, that contains the values corresponding to each variable name.The dictionary returned by `locals()` is not literally a function&#39;s local namespace, it&#39;s a copy of that namespace. The actual local namespace is an array that is part of the frame object; in this way, references to local variables may happen much more quickly than would be the case if it had to look each variable up in a dictionary every time.One consequence of this is that you can&#39;t mutate the dict returned by `locals()` in order to change the value of a function-local variable.Another, less-subtle error in the post is this:&gt; int is another widely-used, fundamental primitive data type. It’s also the lowest common denominator of 2 other data types: , float and complex. complex is a supertype of float, which, in turn, is a supertype of int.&gt; What this means is that all ints are valid as a float as well as a complex, but not the other way around. Similarly, all floats are also valid as a complex.Oh, no no no. Python integers are arbitrary-precision integers. Floats are IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point values, and as such only support full integer precision up to 2^53. The int type can represent values beyond that range which the float type cannot.And while it is true that the complex type is just two floats stuck together, I would very much not call it a supertype. It performs distinct operations.&gt; Accessing an attribute with obj.x calls the __getattr__ method underneath. Similarly setting a new attribute and deleting an attribute calls __setattr__ and __detattr__ respectively.Attribute lookup in Python is way more complex than this. It&#39;s an enormous tar pit, too much so to detail in this comment, but __getattr__ is most often not involved, and the `object` type doesn&#39;t even have a __getattr__ method."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cute fact about __debug__: it is one of the only ways to get compile-time conditionals in Python. Performing a comparison with `if __debug__:` will output byte code for the ensuing statement if and only if the interpreter is in debug mode - notably, in `-O` mode, it will not even generate a load of __debug__ and a conditional jump, and acts as if the statement didn’t exist at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to this, I highly recommend just reading the codebase. I haven&#39;t written C since college and it&#39;s remarkably readable.I once tried to catalogue all the stdlib operations which release the GIL, meaning if you use only those (well, only those &#34;heavy&#34; bits, you can still use other small blocking glue bits), you can do &#34;real&#34; multithreading.It was a fun exercise!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How do we neuter the power of Twitter mobs? Seems like they can bully and intimidate any organization from universities to corporations to GitHub projects to kowtow to their demands. Their demands are usually to fire, boycott, or boot people with opinions that run afoul of the mob.Not a healthy precedent to set. We will regret this later if we continue down this path."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually it&#39;s not different. University lecturers have been protested or cancelled for decades for reasons unrelated to their topic, usually due to political beliefs or corporate interests that clashed with students&#39; ideals. &#34;Cancel culture&#34; is specifically about &#34;personal&#34; societal reforms, which is what makes it different than the older complaints about general politics.Back in the day it was &#34;edgy&#34; to protest or cancel a speaker due to their support of the Vietnam war. People were just as angry (or more so!) at Vietnam protesters as people are today about &#34;cancel culture&#34; protesters, and vice versa. At the time, it was those young freaks with the long hair who were clearly nuts and extremists and going to erode the country&#39;s moral decency. Counter-culture folk in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s were a tiny but vocal minority of young people who were largely put down for their radical views about war and the environment. It&#39;s only in hindsight that protesting the Vietnam war seems socially acceptable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; John Carlson LectureAs a disclaimer I am against any censorship of academia and think that even Charles Murray should be allowed to speak at a university (assuming he is invited by an academic department or student group) and that the university should never have veto power.However, I think the example in the Atlantic is actually more mild than past cases: the John Carlson Lecture is a general audience talk that the university holds to boost its public image.It’s not an academic talk discussing new research or a political perspective, but rather summarizes ideas for the public. If MIT wants to decide who should give such talks I don’t care.In contrast, if a department or student group wants to invite a specific speaker for a specialized talk about politics, science, math, then the university censoring such discourse is what is truly dangerous.In this light, the cancellation of Milo Yiannopoulos who was invited by the College Republican club is much worse. Even though personally I do not think Yiannopoulos is anything but a provocateur, if someone (group/department) wants to invite him the university should not block him from speaking."</p>

Whatever effort the US spent to slander and discredit Assange does nothing to stop people inspired by him, or motivated by US foreign policy in countries that do not enjoy its favour.  The US seems completely oblivious to the fact that whatever happens to Assange the journalist, it simply isnt enough to curtail the overwhelming cacophony of demand for free and open journalism across the internet.Just let the guy go and focus the money, time, and effort on preventing this in the future.  nearly every major news outlet and journalist all see Assange as a journalist, not a hacker.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cannot comment on the long term effect of blue light, but at the very least i experience very significant discomfort when turning off any piece of software that makes the screen a more warm color (for example, f.lux on Windows https://justgetflux.com/ and something like Redshift https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Redshift on *nix), to the point where it makes me avert my gaze.Due to me working primarily as a developer, i don&#39;t always need good color accuracy, so my current settings of screen color warmth are the following:  Day: 4300K
  Sunset: 3000K
  Night: 2550K

In addition to that, i have a few smart lightbulbs that change to a more red color as the night approaches and gently dim more and more when i don&#39;t need to do any reading and just have to walk around the house. Subjectively, i&#39;d say that it&#39;s better for me being able to fall asleep and experience a bit less eye strain (though admittedly, using a computer late into the night is never a good idea).Perhaps the discomfort is just because of eyes having a hard time adjusting to noticeably different lighting conditions, but maybe there&#39;s more to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Headline is incorrect regarding danger to sleep.The study cited[1] regarding sleep only compares regular iPhone usage and iPhone usage with night mode, and found no benefit from the night mode.This is a weak result, since even with night light modes screens still emit a fair amount of blue and green light.[1]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S23527..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall that a paper published by Oxford in a journal related to gerontology claimed that blue light accelerated aging of the retina. If I understand correctly, this article doesn&#39;t counter that claim outright, it just didn&#39;t find that risk with the low intensity of blue light coming from a typical monitor.Tangentially related, that same Oxford paper (sorry I don&#39;t have a link and no longer have access to the paper) did however claim that light generated by red LEDs with sufficient intensity to leave a significant persistence effect after 3 minutes of exposure can reverse aging and damage in subjects over 40 years old although the sample size was just a few dozen people IIRC. It does so because somehow the retina&#39;s mitochondrial function is improved by light in the 650nm to 1000nm range.Continuing on this tangent, I am 50 and have been exposing my eyes to red light for 3 minutes a day for many months and feel like my night vision has been restored. If I wake up in the middle of the night I used to see gray noise and now I can see darker black with better contrast. But I may be kidding myself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all, I work on the VS Code team. This came up the other day in stand up and the initial plan was to deprecate and eventually remove the old setting. Several of us pushed back and said while we may deprecate the setting in favor of something else, the old setting should always be respected due to the sensitivity around telemetry.If there&#39;s any confusion around this messaging it&#39;s because this discussion literally happened 2 days ago. I&#39;ll reopen https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134660 to make sure we clear up confusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft has really been pushing the telemetry lately. Edge phones home far more than any other browser. Windows itself has no way to fully disable data collection (only the option to send &#34;basic&#34; or &#34;full&#34; data, including which websites you visit--oof). If you use Pro and you are enough of a power user to feel comfortable editing registry settings, that&#39;s what is now required to turn telemetry off, and even then it&#39;s hard to know you did it correctly. And this type of tracking is pervasive across the entire Microsoft ecosystem, including within Xbox, Minecraft, Teams, and now VSCode. It&#39;s disappointing to say the least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s worked on multiple power-user GUIs professionally, telemetry can be genuinely useful for improving the product. You can discover features that are never used and should be removed so attention can be focused elsewhere, and others that are used frequently and deserve more attention, and others that users may frequently have trouble with and should be fixed or improved.I&#39;m not saying this justifies dark patterns, and I have no firsthand knowledge of whether Microsoft is exclusively using this data for legitimate purposes. If it were me I&#39;d enable it by default but make it clear and easy to disable for those who care. That said: I don&#39;t think the knee-jerk assumption that this is a wholly evil thing is justified."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;re looking at going even deeper into SSH tunneling and port redirection, I recently made The Cyber Plumber&#39;s Handbook free: https://github.com/opsdisk/the_cyber_plumbers_handbookI made it free to the HN community a few years back [1].  There is a paid interactive lab portion (details in the repo) if you are looking for hands-on experience.Book OverviewThis book is packed with practical and real world examples of SSH tunneling and port redirection in multiple realistic scenarios. It walks you through the basics of SSH tunneling (both local and remote port forwards), SOCKS proxies, port redirection, and how to utilize them with other tools like proxychains, nmap, Metasploit, and web browsers.Advanced topics included SSHing through 4 jump boxes, throwing exploits through SSH tunnels, scanning assets using proxychains and Metasploit&#39;s Meterpreter, browsing the Internet through a SOCKS proxy, utilizing proxychains and nmap to scan targets, and leveraging Metasploit&#39;s Meterpreter portfwd command.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19946941"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can also change/add them after the ssh session has started.This uses the escape mechanism. For help on that, hit return, type &#34;~?&#34; and hit return again.From there you will see that &#34;~#&#34; will list them. And &#34;~C&#34; takes you to a line-oriented command prompt where you can add them.For example, type return &#34;~C&#34;, then at the prompt type &#34;-L1234:localhost:22&#34;. Then in another window, type &#34;telnet localhost 1234&#34;. Then back in the ssh window, type return &#34;~#&#34; and you will see the tunnel being used.Another trick: if you don&#39;t need a shell and only want to forward ports, run &#34;ssh -N&#34; instead of &#34;ssh&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have read far too many ssh tunneling articles and all of them either forget about the bind address or just pretend that the only host that can be tunneled is localhost.The fact is that ssh tunnels are bound to an interface on one side and the other can be any (reachable) host:port.  So if example.com:1234 isn’t reachable from your host network, you can do a local port forward to example.com:1234 from an intermediary host that can reach example.com:1234"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IMHO this is a sensible decision, one that reflects the clear underlying intention of the statute. Article 5(1) of the Directive says:&gt; [certain acts] shall not require authorization by the rightholder where they are necessary for the use of the computer program by the lawful acquirer in accordance with its intended purpose, including for error correction.Essentially, they have ruled that other Articles in the Directive do not supersede this Article, and that reverse engineering to correct an error can be necessary.This court, the CJEU, has good form on sensible decisions regarding computing. For example, SAS vs World Programming (C‑406/10) allowed reverse engineering for interoperability. That case, also, was the court upholding the clear intention of the statute. Moreover there was UsedSoft vs Oracle (C-128/11), allowing the resale of software licences, including the right to download the software where necessary, upon purchasing a second hand licence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really not sure why software is treated differently from eg. hardware.Am I allowed to modify my washing machine, if i want to eg. use it for sous-vide? Sure. I might lose my warranty, I might not be able to resell it as a washing machine without disclosing the not-up-to-electrical-code work, but I&#39;m pretty sure the manufacturer can not sue me for modifying it and/or posting an instructional video of how to do it.Buying software and treating it as a &#34;borrowing&#34; is something that has to be stopped."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see how the ruling helps.1. The copyright holder can include a dummy clause in the contract that prohibits decompilation, except if there is a written permission from the copyright holder, or in cases where existing local laws permit it. This is sufficient to turn down the part of the law that applies only where there is no such clause.2. The copyright holder can always claim that decompilation is never necessary for the user to have the errors in the program corrected, or to achieve interoperability. &#34;Indeed, all the user had to do is to pay $1000000000 for UltraPremium support&#34;.P.S. I am not a lawyer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My take on this is that Ireland is now willing to come into compliance because post-Brexit, they now have a monopoly on &#34;urban core that could sustain an HQ for multinationals in a natively-English-speaking country in the EU.&#34;In other words, they relied on tax advantages as a differentiator for companies to choose Dublin over London for their EU HQ.  But now, what would you choose if not Dublin?  Obviously Paris and Berlin are candidates but if you&#39;re a straightforward multinational, or certainly a company that is actually based/headquartered in the US, you&#39;re going to experience a lot less of a shock in a natively-English-speaking country.So it seems to be that Dublin wins now, tax advantage or no tax advantage.  Which likely makes drawing the ire of other countries for being a &#34;haven&#34; less worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With Hollywood Accounting[1], you make taxable profits transform into untaxable expenses that you pay to yourself for services you rendered to yourself, and Ireland has been a common destination for this sort of money to flow.  Hollywood accounting can take several forms. In one form,
  a subsidiary is formed to perform a given activity and the
  parent entity will extract money out of the film&#39;s revenue
  in the form of charges for certain &#34;services&#34;. For example,
  a film studio has a distribution arm as a sub-entity, which
  will then charge the studio a &#34;distribution fee&#34; — essentially,
  the studio charging itself a sum it has total control over and
  hence control the profitability report of a project.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accountingEssentially, Apple USA makes billions selling iPhones in the USA, then pays those billions to Apple Ireland for the right to put little Apple logos on iPhones. Likewise, Google USA pays billions in US ad sales profits to Google Ireland for the right to use Google tech for Google search.When the Irish loophole closes I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll think up another &#34;One Weird Trick&#34; to make taxable profits mystically transmute into untaxable expenses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been baffled as to how this is seen as a multi-national issue.  The US could always implement unilateral minimum VAT and profit[3] taxes on corporations forcing them to effectively pay whatever proportion the US demands to continue doing business in the world&#39;s largest consumer market.  Just because you&#39;re only paying 3%[1] profit[3] tax in Bermuda doesn&#39;t mean you can necessarily skate around the remaining 12% when doing business in the US - the US could just pocket that additional 12% if nobody else wanted it.  Implement a policy like that and the competitive tax advantage of havens disappears overnight and all this BS disappears.We[2] have tax loopholes because we want to continue to have tax loopholes.1. BS example I&#39;m unfamiliar with the actual numbers.2. Where &#34;We&#34; is lawmakers or maybe society as a whole as weighted by political power.3. Edited: s/revenue/profit/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Facebook is an abomination which ate up the entire Web in some 3rd-world countries. For many no access to Facebook means loosing connection to everything including services essential for their offline life. Even in a very developed EU country I already happen to face cases when something is only available via Facebook because some companies don&#39;t bother having their own websites/emails/phones (often on purpose - to improve their Facebook rank).This is a very serious problem - hyper-centalization in hands of one corporation which can fail you intentionally or not. Facebook is becoming sort of the Chinese system (AFAIK standard WWW is almost nonexistent in China, they mostly use apps within social networks which are easier for the government to control) for the whole world.Looking more broadly it&#39;s another layer of the malicious trend to wrap the things in more and more layers.First we had native desktop apps (which always could communicate data to network servers). Then we have wrapped the apps in the browser (which essentially is an OS on an OS) but we had our pages on independent servers. Then we invented &#34;social networks&#34; and are putting everything in there.We could just improve desktop apps tech (including discoverability, delivery, interoperability, portability and UI design flexibility) but we chose the browsers. We could stop here, use the standard WWW and improve experience of using RSS/Atom/RDF/XMPP/etc but we gave up our pages/subscriptions/contacts to Facebook."</p>

The leak is so massive and so many entities were hacked that only a nation state could have pulled it off. And given who was and who wasn&#39;t implicated in this and given which news orgs received these papers, it&#39;s pretty obvious that CIA or NSA or some other part of the US IC community was behind these leaks.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Software is becoming less and less of a tech industry and more and more commoditized. Very little innovation in the past 5-10 years. Very few successful companies during that time have come about by having incredibly innovative and novel technology - almost all are simply using run of the mill, commoditized technology to solve business problems that they have large domain knowledge of. Given this, it makes total sense that having detailed esoteric technical knowledge is no longer the path to success in 2021, and ultimately, hacker news has always been predominately about one thing - how to get rich. The best methods have simply shifted over the last 15 years from being a tech genius to being technically-proficient domain knowledge expert"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If the bee is placed under federal protection, farmers or developers who harm the insects could face up to $13,000 in fines each time one is killed, Live Science reports.Note that the article identifies systemic causes (use of neonicotinoids, habitat loss) as causes, and correlational evidence (&#34;States with the most significant dip in bee numbers have the largest increase in the use of pesticides like neonicotinoids, insecticides, and fungicides&#34;), but the enforcement mechanism they mention is centered around individual actors after specific killed insects where it&#39;s presumed that attribution is clear. Does this make any kind of sense?1. Would we know when bees are killed? The evidence that we know how to gather, so far as I can tell, is mostly counting live bees, not finding dead ones. Are there examples of small, highly mobile insects with ESA protection where we&#39;re actively seeking out and finding dead individuals?2. Is it typically possible to attribute bee deaths to single actors? If a bumblebee is found at location X, we might guess that it would have ranged over an area with radius r around that (but we&#39;re not sure what its actual territory would have been) which includes N properties, N_d of which have been developed and N_p of which use pesticides, who is responsible?3. And if the best scientific understanding is about broad practices (habitat destruction, pesticide use, ...) am I correct in my belief that we don&#39;t have any real mechanism of holding a class of individuals (e.g. Maine farmers who used neonicotinoids during a given time period) responsible for an impact to a bee population (e.g. it&#39;s estimated by experts to decline 5% in a given year) in the absence of a specific pile of dead bees?With this, as with a number of other large issues, I think we need new concepts around group responsibility. We have a concept of class action lawsuits, where a large group identified by a criteria (e.g. people whose data was exposed by Equifax) can be plaintiffs, because individuals meeting that criteria can elect (or not) to be represented in that group. We do _not_ have a concept of a large group of people identified by a criteria (farms using particular pesticides, developers of properties in the urban-wildland interface) being held responsible for harms that proceed from that criteria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Maine, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, Idaho, North Dakota, Wyoming, and OregonAre the eight states from the title. Though it seems New York should be included since it says &#34;The bumblebee species have declined by 99 percent in New York.&#34;Also noteworthy&gt; In the Midwest and Southeast, population numbers have dropped by more than 50 percent.To nobodies surprise, the culprit is pesticides. Interestingly the west&#39;s bumblee population isn&#39;t listed as being in trouble."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We think with our weak technologies and chemistries that we can play God.However, it is so far from the truth - in an attempt to create more vegetation we have decreased a critical component needed to help said vegetation grow.Technology should be used carefully when in the environment of the unknown. Trials and observations should be conducted in limited capacity with a long window of study. Only then can we know of the consequences for our actions of disrupting naturally evolved and perfected equilibriums - be it that of the Earth or man’s immune system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I paid money to cross the Pacific Ocean on a Maersk line, 300 meter cargo ship (us_en here). Many people asked me if I worked to be on board, and the answer was &#34;no&#34;, Maersk did not allow it.  The officers were mostly East Germans who needed a job, while the strictly segregated, &#34;A-Bs&#34; were almost all Pacific Islanders of some kind. The conditions were clean and professional, but I got the feeling soon that this was not a desirable job. The officers would spend at least 60 days on duty, often more.. without a vacation day, but had a weekly day &#34;off&#34; or two, except the Captain who is technically working at all times.I enjoyed the travel and had a good voyage, with many small things to say about it at another time. As I learn about &#34;business&#34; and the world, I understand more about labor abuses, even with &#34;respectable&#34; companies. And, your outrage does nothing, because people who mistreat others professionally are quite used to the complaining, including yours. I am not at all surprised at this article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ocean is a different place in so many ways.My cousin is a Merchant Marine Engineer. Some big ships can&#39;t leave port without one, yet they are in short supply. So he&#39;s paid a lot per voyage. Two or three multi-week voyages and he&#39;d done working for the year.Early on in his career, an officer would request his passport. To make things go faster in port, all the passports could be presented at once for quicker clearing of customs etc.Of course he learned immediately, this meant he could not leave the ship in foreign port. And the officer sandbagged when he requested his passport back. The result was, he was essentially held captive for several months aboard ship, several times longer than he was contracted for. And the ship could count on having an Engineer for every leg of the journey.Now he knows better, keeps his passport on his person at all times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like many here, I can attribute where I am in life today largely to TI calculator programming. I made many friends on Cemetech with whom I still keep in touch, including a few named in this article.I racked up thousands of posts on the Cemetech and United TI forums and spent countless hours hanging out in the game Blockland which was also popular among those folks in the mid 2000s.To me, one of the most impressive folks in this list is calc84maniac, who joined the scene a year or two after me, but quickly surpassed me in skill, becoming a z80 ASM whiz at the age of ~13 or so, whereas some of the other (very talented) folks were at least STEM university students.I know a few people in this article such as SirCmpwn are on HN, too, so hopefully they chime in this thread.Some of the most memorable things about programming in BASIC on these calculators were the absurd constraints. Your whole program was limited to a few kilobytes. You only had 27 floating point variables, a few lists of floats with a maximum length of 999, no real functions or stack or anything, etc. You’d shave bytes by taking advantage of syntactical quirks that the interpreter happened to accept, like not closing parentheses at the end of a line.I don’t have much of value to add other than expressing some serious nostalgia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since we&#39;re swapping TI calculator stories...In 8th grade Geometry class circa 2007, I had an awesome teacher and loved the subject. I found an extra TI-83+ laying around the house from my brothers. I found a guide online and started building simple programs.A few weeks later, there was a quiz. I asked the teacher if it was permissible to use calculator programs on the quiz. He thought a moment and said it was fine as long as I wrote them myself.So I wrote a very simple program that probably did little more than guide which formula to use in a basic decision tree.It was the hardest quiz of the year, it was just difficult content. My class has 1 A, 1 B, 1 C, and about 23 F&#39;s. I was the B.After that, graphing calculators weren&#39;t allowed.Mad respect for Mr. Gass. He had two Apple IIe&#39;s and had programmed Wheel of Fortune and Jeopard! for review days ahead of tests. He had a couple TV&#39;s around the classroom so everyone could see the game well, and would turn on Bill Cosby during some working sessions because at the time, he was a well respected man.Mrs. Gass was also a math teacher. Some students who had both teachers made shirts which advertised &#34;I passed Gass twice&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ohh, TI stories! Here we go!&#34;Hey, distantaidenn, I wanna talk to you after class.&#34; These were the words of my then high school math teacher. I wasn&#39;t worried, I was a good student. Little did I know, this would shape my career for the next 20 years. When after class came, my teacher handed me a brand spanking new TI-83. &#34;We&#39;re gonna be using these in class from now on. Take this home for the weekend, learn how to use it, and teach the rest of the class.&#34; I held in my excitement, and took the device, along with its 1-inch thick manual.I pored over the manual. Before I knew it, I had mathematical functions dancing across the screen. All of our current math equations set up to accept variables and spit out answers. I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but I was &#34;programming.&#34; I began to dabble in TI-Basic -- I had no idea what it was, but apparently, it was the language this giant calculator used, and I&#39;d have to learn that language to make this machine do my bidding. So I learned it. The next year in school, I signed up for an elective Programming class, and lo and behold, it was in Basic -- I thought to myself, this looks familiar, I know this! I finally made the connection that I had been &#34;programming&#34; the whole time. From then I was hooked.Fast forward to university, I gained a degree that was as far from programming as possible, but I always had my scripts. I was the guy that could talk to computers. I was at home on the command line. And I knew enough html and JS to make a shitty web page, if necessary.And here I am now, still engineering and managing, and making (I&#39;d like to think) not so shitty products for a living."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been thinking about the difference between human users and computational agents. There is a widespread pattern of enforcing that only human users may interact with a service, not computational agents. Running a user-installed extension is one example; additional examples are CAPTCHAs, account verification by phone number, or services which refuse to provide API access such as banks.Sometimes the reason is to protect users (e.g. banks), sometimes to protect the service from abuse. But often the reason is to ensure value can be extracted from users (e.g. serving ad impressions) or the power that can be exerted over users. Regardless, I believe this comes down to power: computer scientists understand that acting through a computational agent is fundamentally more powerful than acting directly as a human user. Computational agents can operate at scale, they provide virtualization (e.g. throwaway identities), and thereby conserve the ultimate scarce resource: our attention. Many systems seem to have computational power asymmetry as their fundamental principle: as little human contact on the system&#39;s side as possible; as much human contact on the user&#39;s side as possible.If there&#39;s any path ahead that avoids a totalitarian nightmare resulting from asymptotic concentration of power, it depends on cultivating a more widespread understanding of computational power and developing new social norms and policies. As a CS educator, this is one of my top priorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I manually unfollowed almost every friend and every page I followed a couple years ago. My feed is now a very limited selection of gaming and media posts that I  enjoy immensely. No politics at all and almost nothing in my feed from actual individuals that I know. I ended up enjoying Facebook again, even if in a very different way.It was a tedious process and a tool like this could help a lot of people find their own value in the platform by getting a fresh start. Sadly, FB has no interest in that and would rather corral us in ways as to maximize their own benefit, not ours."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “if they ask about time off in the first interview then they are never going to be there!”The fact that this attitude is common scares me when I&#39;m doing interviews.Time off is incredibly important to me.  What&#39;s the use of making a great income if you can&#39;t get the time off to enjoy it?The culture about the use of PTO varies wildly between companies.  A friend of mine worked somewhere that supposedly gave 20 days PTO per year, but trying to actually use more than a single day at a time was always met with denials, and even if you did take a Friday off, you were expected to work 10 hours/day the other 4 days of that week to make up for it.So yeah, when I&#39;m interviewing, I want to know how much time people are taking off, but I don&#39;t want the interviewer to think I&#39;m lazy and will be trying to avoid work as much as possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 10x programmer is a silly myth. The idea that someone can produce in 1 day what another competent, hard working, similarly experienced programmer can produce in 2 weeks is silly.You know, 10x is an optimistic number here. Some programmers will do in 1 day what you wont achieve in a life time. And not understanding that makes you a bad programmer by my book simply because this is the foundation of the job.So let me give one advice: you are not producing code, you are engineering code. Some will find solutions that the others will not find. Thats where the 10x programmer thing come from. The guy who wrote bittorrent said something like the following: &#34;I&#39;ve written bittorrent in a way you would never have thought about&#34;.You think John Carmack was the only one trying to make 3d games when Doom came out? Thousands of programmers where trying to. Does that make him a 10x programmer in your opinion? Or more like a 1000x?"</p>

Something I have never associated with a moth before.Secondly, I found it pretty cool to see how their flight wasn&#39;t as controlled as I had thought of. It looked like a bit of a mess on take off. Again, just disarmed me from the moths I&#39;ve grown to despise flying around the house.Very cool to see them from a different perspective."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"LOL !&#34;The chief financial officer is Giancarlo Devasini, a former plastic surgeon from Italy who was once described on Tether’s website as the founder of a successful electronics business.The only reference to him that turned up in a search of Italian newspapers showed he was once fined for selling counterfeit Microsoft software.Elsewhere on the website, there’s a letter from an accounting firm stating that Tether has the reserves to back its coins, along with a pie chart showing that about $30 billion of its dollar holdings are invested in commercial paper—short-term loans to corporations. That would make Tether the seventh-largest holder of such debt, right up there with Charles Schwab and Vanguard Group.To fact-check this claim, a few colleagues and I canvassed Wall Street traders to see if any had seen Tether buying anything. No one had. “It’s a small market with a lot of people who know each other,” said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer of global money markets at Federated Hermes, an asset management company in Pittsburgh. “If there
 were a new entrant, it would be usually very obvious.”&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-my..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand how Tether has survived this long. Bitfinex and Tether sure look transparently like a fraud, all the way back to the &#34;no really we have $1 in the bank for every Tether but you can&#39;t audit us&#34; days. And yet it continues to occupy its role as the underpinning of most cryptocurrency markets. Why hasn&#39;t it blown up yet? My best guess is that it&#39;s useful to everyone taking in money from new retail investors. Also there&#39;s no clear financial incentive for blowing it up; there&#39;s no way to easily short Tether, for instance.This article talks about the way Tether is loaning out what reserves they have. The Economist looked at this phenomenon and found Tether has a 383-to-1 leverage. That&#39;s going to be a complete disaster the moment there&#39;s a major blip in the economy. Say, a major Chinese real estate company going broke. Or interest rates in the West finally going up and causing a market correction. Maybe that&#39;s what will blow it up.The good news is the Economist also thinks the inevitable cryptocurrency disaster will be bad but won&#39;t destroy world economies. &#34; its holders would lose hundreds of billions of dollars but that the fallout would be manageable.&#34; I sure hope that happens before this tower of unregulated investments gets so big that when it falls over it crushes the real economy.But don&#39;t worry folks, this is all good for Bitcoin.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/08/07/why-regulators-..."</p>

Who owns the copyright? Microsoft or the maintainers?edit: From the github &#34;apology&#34;:&gt; Projects might not fully understand what joining the .NET Foundation means. We share a checklist with project maintainers on project changes they accept as part of becoming part of the .NET Foundation. That’s obviously not sufficient. We will post a new document that describes what you can expect when your project joins the .NET Foundation. This will include changes (observable or legal) and new benefits. It will also include changes that could occur later.....ok? That seems scary, coming from Microsoft"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone here old enough to remember when SourceForge was The Place(tm) to stick OSS code and then how it fell from grace?I’m curious in what ways the MicroSoft take over of GitHub is and is not starting to feel like that.For me, one is just the difference in scale. GitHub is vast in both content as well as tooling compared to SourceForge at it’s highest points. And a commercial entity orders of magnitude smaller than MicroSoft took over SF. The rate of descent into Not Good(tm) territory also seems slower and more ponderous.But while the magnitudes differ, the vectors look similar. Not exactly the same, because history rhymes with itself before it repeats itself.Curious what other similarities and dissimilarities other old timers see."</p>

If you go to our Fremont factory it&#39;s jammed.&#34;But, he added, &#34;It&#39;s tough for people to afford houses, and people have to come in from far away....There&#39;s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area.&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/tesla-moves-headqu..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When CEOs move, they often move their headquarters closer to where they live. Somehow Tesla managed to survive all the problems of California until shortly after Musk moved to Texas. Folks talking about the advantages and disadvantages of California vs Texas may be overthinking this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" Whenever I read news like this I can never figure out what moving a company&#39;s headquarters actually means. Musk has already been living in Texas for a while. Tesla already has sizable operations there (both offices and factories). The company is registered in Delaware, so legally this change means nothing. They aren&#39;t going to fire employees in California or force them to move (in fact Musk said that they will continue to expand their Bay Area staff). They will continue to pay (or not pay) taxes exactly the same as before. So, besides a press release what is the change exactly?It&#39;s also funny that Tesla still can&#39;t sell their cars directly to customers in Texas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The aspect of this case that stands out to me is that copyright is claimed in clothing and fashions:  &#34;counterfeit retailers that sell knock-off dresses using the plaintiffs&#39; copyrighted images&#34;, a claim traditionally well outside copyright, and at best quite grey.  Copyright covers works of original authorship but not either ideas or functional aspects of design.See the strong-IP case from the Copyright Alliance, who can at best muster an &#34;it depends&#34;:There are some mixed messages out there about whether fashion designs are eligible for copyright protection. Some experts would say “no,” others would say “yes,” and they’re both right it depends.https://copyrightalliance.org/education/qa-headlines/copyrig...In the US, such protections are still only at the &#34;being considered&#34; stage as best I can tell:The major amendment, of course, would be the extension of design protection to fashion designs, by amending § 1301(a) to provide that “A fashion design is subject to protection under this chapter” and by amending § 1302(b) to include “an article of apparel” in the definition of “useful articles” subject to protection.https://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat072706.htmlAs the Copyright office&#39;s discussion notes, there are non-expressive protections in the specific case of ship hull designs (also in chip masks).  But fashion itself has remained largely a copyright-free zone.The proposed language did not enter into US law as evideced at Cornell&#39;s USC server:https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1301Cloudflare has secured this round without challenging the copyrightability of the alleged infinged works themselves, but probably also has that arrow in their quivver should they need to invoke it.   The court&#39;s decision here is actually a broader protection for Cloudflare (it would apply against any infringement claim), though it doesn&#39;t invalidate the plaintiff&#39;s IMO questionable fashion-based copyright claims."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I find Backblaze B2 more compelling.... Ok, after writing that, I realized that I should probably look up R2&#39;s offering first. And then my jaw hit the floor at &#34;free egress bandwidth&#34;.Free egress bandwidth? Yes please.I will instantly convert.Then I was worried about price per GB. $0.015/GB is incredibly competitive.Good lord, where do I get early access to this thing? I&#39;d transition all our infra today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO, the best feature Cloudflare added to R2 was the automatic migration. This makes sense for a CDN to offer, but if R2 works, this makes it pretty simple to migrate.&#34;After specifying an existing storage bucket, R2 will serve requests for objects from the existing bucket,&#34;I&#39;ve Beene evaluating R2, but this migration path makes it dead simple to use. I just point my code to read/write from/to R2 instead of S3, and I&#39;ll get egress fees from AWS during the migration, but then that&#39;s it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article touches on the one major unanswered question I have about R2:  CloudFlare&#39;s CDN ToS make it clear CF is meant to host websites and APIs, not content downloads [1].  Does R2 have similar ToS?  It&#39;s reasonable that CF doesn&#39;t want R2 customers that use 500MB of paid storage and 500TB of free bandwidth, so what is acceptable use?[1] The Services are offered primarily as a platform to cache and serve web pages and websites.

Bearing in mind that some people&#39;s names are actually rude.I worked on the application form processing for the Nectar card launch in the UK back in the early 2000&#39;s, and we had several cases. Luckily we had human data-entry clerks in the loop, so all we had to do was flag when a name contained anything on the &#34;Scunthorpe list&#34; and get a human to look at it. Even then it wasn&#39;t perfect and a few slipped through. One of the early PR messes of the launch was someone getting a Nectar card issued with a rude name, and of course they immediately went to the press with it [0]I&#39;m interested to see they still haven&#39;t solved this [1][0] I never saw the journalistic interest in this: this guy said his name was &lt;rude name&gt;, and then signed the form to say everything on the form was true. Why is anyone surprised or interested that we accepted his name was what he said it was and gave him a card in that name?[1] https://metro.co.uk/2015/02/20/woman-refused-sainsburys-nect..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of the guy that streamed a talking banana on Twitch, where viewers could make it say things. People submitted variations of the n-word and got him banned, and after trying to filter out all character combinations he could think of he wrote a phonetic filter. That apparently worked much better than trying to think of every permutation of characters that sounds like bad words.https://youtu.be/bJ5ppf0po3k?t=715"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had to do this for a link shortening system (to make sure random base64 didn&#39;t contain profanity). It was a pretty fun problem. Not just the implementation, but doing the math to make sure it didn&#39;t make our shortened links easily enumerable. The implementation wasn&#39;t too bad, but we set up logging initially to spit out any random strings it decided to block. I demo&#39;d this in front of the whole company and live tailed the logs and the first one that popped up during the demo was a big ole F bomb. It made for an excellent demo."</p>

If I owned a store, and some guy kept coming and showing customers how to not spend any money in my store, I&#39;d kick that guy out of my store.I very strongly dislike facebook and can&#39;t wait to watch it die, so I know comparing it to a store is a poor comparison. But at the end of the day, fb is a business, and if someone is using fb to try and hurt their business, they have the right to terminate that guy&#39;s accounts.EDITMy point here is not that we shouldn&#39;t point out bad things facebook does simply because it&#39;s &#34;just business&#34;. I agree that the &#34;they&#39;re a business&#34; argument is just a deflection that derails the conversation into some weird business practice discussion, instead of all the bad things fb does.My point is more that we should try to frame these things so that the headline isn&#39;t &#34;facebook banned me&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At Kami (kamiapp.com) we had to make a similar transition last year - we&#39;d seen usage grow over 20x in a 6-month period on our classroom product due to the pandemic, and we were storing all our content in a single-primary Postgres database. We had plenty of headroom before but we were suddenly running out of write capacity, even after scaling vertically up to ~150 vcpu. Our workload is super write heavy so scaling out replicas wouldn&#39;t have helped much at all, and I was spending a lot of time manually vacuuming in our daily off-peak as we were burning transaction ids at an astonishing rate, ~800 million per day.I looked at a bunch of options but ultimately managing a sharded database seemed like too much overhead for our small (but expanding!) dev team - so we decided to move our heavily loaded tables to CockroachDB instead, as since it&#39;s mostly Postgres compatible our transition would be easier, and it would be much easier to manage as it automatically balances load and heals. We&#39;re running cockroach on GKE and it&#39;s a really nice fit for running on kubernetes.Ended up working well for us - we still have our smaller tables on PG but we want to move it all to Cockroach over time. There were some teething issues as we learnt what to monitor on it (read amplification is the big one here, though pebble has helped a lot vs the previous rocksdb), and it does need a lot of hardware at high scale (we&#39;re running 50 16-vcpu nodes for it) but overall I&#39;m happy with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great read and primer for anyone looking to shard and know they need scale. Having helped a ton of people shard their data, my advice still remains don&#39;t do it until you know you have to. The old Citus data blog is a great resource for some guidance around best practices and how to&#39;s even if not using Citus.That said some of the things you can do from day 1 make things way easier when the time comes later. Workspace ID/Tenant ID/Customer ID, having your data grouped that way makes it very shardable and saves you a lot of work later on in the case you didn&#39;t have that in your data model.I&#39;m not sure I buy that Citus/Vitess are magic, both are reasonably clear how they work and you can dig into it. At the same time I&#39;d weigh the downsides of Citus (can&#39;t speak to Vitess) in that the online rebalancer isn&#39;t open source so at that point it&#39;s a proprietary product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Notion seems like an interesting data storage problem. The vast majority of the data is in the `block` entity, which are organized into a sort of nested set, written/updated individually (user edits one at a time) but read in ranged chunks (a doc).Off hand this seems like an almost worst case for PG. Since the updates to blocks could contain large data (causing them to be moved often) and there is one big table; it seems likely that the blocks for a single notion document will end up being non-continuous on disk and thus require a lot of IO/memory trashing to read them back out. PG doesn&#39;t have a way to tell it how to organize data on disk so there is no good way around this (CLUSTER doesn&#39;t count, it&#39;s unusable in most use cases).Arm chair engineering of course - but my first thought would be to find another storage system for blocks that better fits the use case and leave the rest in PG. This does introduce other problems, but it just feels like storing data like this in PG is a bad fit. Maybe storing an entire doc&#39;s worth of block entities in a jsonb column would avoid a lot of this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We did this with FreeBSD several years ago at Netflix. We used to run heavily modified -stable kernels.  Our tree was ahead of FreeBSD-current in a lot of ways (TCP, ktls, VM) but way behind in other ways.  Every year or two we&#39;d rebase to a new -stable version, and that would be months of work. Often, there would be some bug introduced upstream many months prior that took weeks to track down because there was just so much to bisect through.  Because our tree was based on -stable, pushing changes upstream often involved porting them to a substantially different codebase in -current, and being unable to test the ported code at scale in production.Since we&#39;ve moved to tracking -current, we rebase every few weeks.  We catch any newly introduced bugs from upstream almost immediately, since there are only a few weeks of changes, not a few years, to sort through.  Its far easier to contribute code upstream.  In fact, we do most development upstream and wait until the next rebase to pick our changes up (or cherry pick them if it is something urgent).All in all, life is much, much, much better on the bleeding edge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You could have editorialized this title to:Rebasing a Linux Kernel Branch that’s Two Years Old and 9k Commits Deep…but you would have had thousands of us running to the bathroom to revisit our last meal.What a Herculean effort by these two engineers.  When your role is to track down fellow employees from completely different teams and crack the, er, carrot to get them to update their patch from two years ago, you can get very tired very quickly.I’m sure the hardware driver modules are fairly self contained but things like the userspace QoS patch could be pretty hairy.  The kind of thing where, for upstream, you’d spend 90% of your time landing a framework just to even be able to implement your feature with the final 10% patch.Oof.  Bravo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this part of the google monrepo? Not that it matters, but I wondered how far monrepo went, inside the tent.I hate to be a pessimist, and I may be simply ignorant of some realities, but it FEELS like this is setting an impossibly high goal. I think there will turn out to be something significant in 9000 variances, which cannot simply be uplifted into mainstream, and which turn out to be hard to maintain as a continual rebase into the emerging mainstream.I agree that 40 sounds low, but probably is a good indication it can work. 1% is within view, if they maintained pace so even on a 1% if the rebase cost can be handled, they can converge but that assumes there isn&#39;t a showbuster in the 9000."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I want implemented.. Chrome/Firefox whatever... is that instead of unloading and reloading when I go back to the tab I want it to export basically an HTML file and when I click back to that tab, I want it to reload the HTML file instead with some notification/marker that it is a &#34;cached&#34; version. There are times where I&#39;ll leave a tab in the background that I don&#39;t want refreshed but when it gets unloaded, poof, I lose the original data from that page.I know about Chrome and its ability to prevent discards, but I want this to be the default or at least a toggle option.

cancellation of the process, you thought.- Then, you&#39;ll implement blacklist just to avoid any interaction with facebook, something similar to: https://pastebin.com/FAV2f9eA and try to repeat the flow again.- Then another 2+ years later situation will repeat again.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got rid of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp about 4 years ago. Facebook and Instagram was easy, but people who have WhatsApp really think you’re weird for not having it.Deleting WhatsApp, while annoying for me personally, has resulted in many people I know joining Signal or Telegram — the network effect can be broken by being belligerent.If you don’t want to have a conversation about why you deleted WhatsApp, simply say it’s a moral issue, nobody wants to know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the time tech companies have their fans and detractors. In virtually any discussion about tech companies, you’ll find people for the company in question, and others against, Apple and Google are great examples.I find it interesting that I don’t think I’ve ever come across any discussion about Facebook (and I read a lot of them) where anyone is defending them. Either people are strongly against the company, or at most they admit grudgingly that they do use Facebook services because everyone else they know uses it.The only people I ever hear championing Facebook are Zuckerberg and other top management.I don’t have a Facebook account, so possibly all the positive discussion is on Facebook itself and I’m not seeing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a pretty thorough and high profile hack on a major tech company - this isn&#39;t something I&#39;d expect from an Amazon owned property. The hack (allegedly, I haven&#39;t downloaded it) includes* Entire git histories* Internal/Private AWS SDKs* Encrypted Password dumps and payout reportsIt&#39;s so comprehensive I&#39;m very curious into how an attacker got that level of access. I can&#39;t think of another, large, corporate web 2.0 startup who&#39;s gotten owned in a similar fashion. Could the same attack work on Amazon? YouTube?It&#39;s also strange that someone who has this level of access to what is presumably a multi-billion dollar company decided to just leak the data? Maybe they did try to ransom it, but I&#39;d imagine someone with this kind of access inside Twitch must have had some creative way of making money."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I raised over 400k for Andrew&#39;s POTUS run and devoted a year of my life to running his official Reddit (104k subs at peak), then joined a SuperPAC to further his positions after the run.The campaign team was full of fools who squandered almost every good turn received, most campaign workers were paid less than minimum wage, and Andrew eventually stole the pac&#39;s name and branding - Humanity Forward - put everyone out of a job, and then did basically nothing with the organization.I&#39;ve given so much time to this person it&#39;s insane.  He&#39;s not trustworthy, he&#39;s a horrible manager of people, and he never pays off on what he promises.  Just dip your toes into YangGang social media and see how his former fans act now, or the stories of abuse within the campaigns that Andrew hardly acknowledged.Inspiring message, but I&#39;ve been close enough to the sausage factory to know it&#39;s fluff.Beware.  If you are interested in this endevour do the best you can to build your own power base, do no rely on Andrew&#39;s circle to help you in any way other than a retweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s missing here, IMO, is a party. Who&#39;s with him? Do you have defectors from the 2 parties? Independents or popular figures joining up? Candidates being stood?A political party is not a manifesto, it&#39;s an organisation.I actually think there&#39;s room for a party to start gaining ground in the US. There are so many elected offices that  the surface area is huge. Great for &#34;guerilla tactics.&#34; IE, earning easy victories by picking the battle..Maybe your pick a thousand low key positions, and work on them. Standing a thousand candidates with success, even if the offices are minor, makes you a full fledged party by default.Uncompetitive regional strongholds, are another opportunity. You could split the large party&#39;s vote and earn immediate relevance. You could even split the small party&#39;s vote and try to steal 2nd place. That might make you one half of a dichotomy the next time. You could run candidates in republican or democratic primaries. The primary electoral system is diverse, so you can choose to do this where it has a chance.So, where&#39;s the party? Who&#39;s running? Where/what? Who else is involved?A political manifesto is OK, I guess. A party manifesto... that would be a lot more interesting. What are you planning to do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The top line, &#34;Not Left. Not Right. Forward.&#34; kind of reminds me of Macron&#39;s &#34;En Marche&#34; (&#34;Let&#39;s Go&#34;) that took over France in a storm, taking over the presidency AND the parliament only one year after its foundation, with very few previously known political figures in its ranks.The whole thing looked like doing management rather than politics, and offered an alternative to fed-up voters who didn&#39;t dare turn to the usual far-right and far-left &#34;protest votes&#34;.Headed with a nimble tactical vision, the formula was extremely efficient... for one mandate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This took about a year and a half – a little over a year coding in between experiments and training.It&#39;s a chess engine with a primary neural network just like AlphaZero or Leela Chess Zero&#39;s, but it adds on a secondary &#34;commentary decoder&#34; network based on Transformer architecture to comment on positions and moves. All of the code and data for training and search is from scratch, although it does use Stockfish code to generate legal moves and manage chess positions.You can watch it play on Lichess here: https://lichess.org/@/PlayChessCoach/tv or challenge it here: https://lichess.org/?user=PlayChessCoach#friend, and see its commentary in spectator chat. It only plays one game at a time, so you may need to wait a little bit. It&#39;s fairly strong (~3450 rating, roughly on par with Stockfish 12 or SlowChess Blitz 2.7), but you can set up a position when challenging it so that it&#39;s missing a couple pawns or a piece (Variant: From Position).I ended up writing much more about it than I expected.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really think that action changes attitude faster than attitude changes action. Learning this the hard way in my 40s, it&#39;s been really life changing for me. Particularly when you&#39;re depressed, demotivated, find yourself procrastinating, etc.You can try this yourself -- the next time you&#39;re feeling demotivated, start with the smallest amount of tiny measurable action. If you can&#39;t get out of bed, move your fingers, shake your head, work your way up to standing up, walking, leaving your house, and very slowly building momentum.If you&#39;re procrastinating about work, start with opening up a terminal, launch your editor, write one tiny snippet of code that just compiles, add another snippet, build momentum.You&#39;ll find yourself making excuses, telling yourself that none of this matters, or that you&#39;re too tired, or that you&#39;re not in the mood. Accept the thoughts and push through the actions.Very quickly, as the dopamine hits from these tiny successes arrive, you&#39;ll find your attitude changing, and this turns into a feedback loop where you end up performing more actions, further improving your mood and attitude."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alternative take: in the hiring process education is often used as a proxy for motivation, when actually it only proves that once upon a time someone was motivated long enough to get educated, but it doesn&#39;t actually say anything about their present state in terms of motivation.A &#39;Do-er&#39; is at least at present motivated, and educating them will get them to the desired combination of education+motivation in the present, even if that education is going to be by necessity a very narrow one (typically: job specific).Being hungry for money and creature comforts also tends to be conflated with being motivated (&#39;ambitious&#39;), but it doesn&#39;t really align well because once financial success (for some very modest success) is attained the motivation will vanish. That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, but it tends to confuse people who were not aware of the driving power being the outwardly visible motivation.The movie &#39;Rush&#39; has a nice bit about that, James Hunt just wants to be WDC, once. He doesn&#39;t care about anything past that point because it will give him what he wants. But until he&#39;s got it he will be super motivated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think he&#39;s likely to trigger a lot of ire with this tweet.  However, given what I know about his history, I think I know where this is coming from.  Carmack himself did not finish school and was motivated early on to get involved in the profession of writing software despite lacking official credentials which entitled him to do so.  I have a similar story and can relate.  Therefore, I think what he&#39;s getting at is that it&#39;s important to just get started on something without waiting until you think you&#39;re &#34;allowed&#34; to.  This quality of being a &#34;doer&#34; can stand out in colleagues.  But of course there are many sides to the story.  I don&#39;t think he meant to discount the others.Update: I want to add that I think I recall being aware of figures like Carmack in my teenage years.  Knowing of people like him, who were making lives for themselves by actively pursuing their interests, is I think a huge part of why I got involved in software early on in high school.  It was a way for weird kids like me to have a sense of self-worth and accomplishment even if we were getting bad grades in more traditional subjects like &#34;World History&#34; or &#34;Social Studies&#34; on account of just not fitting in.  And it was also at a time (in the 90s) when the economy highly valued such people going into the dot com bubble.  So this tweet doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.  I think the historical context I&#39;ve given here probably describes Carmack&#39;s life as well and is really relevant in understanding his statement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m having a hard time reconciling all this right now.  On the one hand, from the outside, I can see the actions that Facebook takes and they seem awfully guilty of what they are accused of.  But on the other hand, I personally know and have previously worked with some of the people who work on trust and safety, specifically for kids.  Good people who have kids of their own and who care about protecting people, especially children.The best I can come up with is that Facebook is so big that the &#34;evil&#34; is an emergent property of all the different things that are happening.  It&#39;s so big no one can comprehend the big picture of it all, so while the individuals involved have good intentions with what they are working on, the sum total of all employees&#39; intentions ends up broken.So maybe Zuck is telling the truth here, that they are trying to fix all this.  But no one can see the forrest from the trees.I can&#39;t reconcile it any other way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now that today&#39;s testimony is over, I wanted to reflect on the public debate we&#39;re in. I&#39;m sure many of you have found the recent coverage hard to read because it just doesn&#39;t reflect the company we know.Yeah, we know you don&#39;t know, because you&#39;re looking at it from on top of a mountain of 100 billion dollars, Mark. There isn&#39;t a single damned thing that can change your picture of it being the absolute greatest thing ever.&gt; We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health.What you care about, and what you say you care about, are nothing compared to your actions.&gt; It&#39;s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives.We don&#39;t know your motives, other than the obvious ones. We know your actions.&gt; At the most basic level, I think most of us just don&#39;t recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted.That&#39;s because you live in a big dumb bubble where chat apps are somehow world-changing innovations and creepy stalker behavior is completely fine to you. You are out of touch and people are screaming it at you. You think you are entitled to encroach on everyone&#39;s private lives, intermediate on every interaction and mine it for vulnerabilities to auction off to advertisers. Your entire model of the world is broken, Mark. No wonder nothing makes sense.Stopped reading after this point. I&#39;m sick of billionaires with megaphones blaring their virtues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And if social media were as responsible for polarizing society as some people claim, then why are we seeing polarization increase in the US while it stays flat or declines in many countries with just as heavy use of social media around the world?That&#39;s a point I&#39;ve made myself before, and I think there is some truth to it. Social media can&#39;t explain the high and increasing degree of US political polarisation, because other countries (including other English-speaking countries) consume social media about as much and yet have less polarisation, and don&#39;t show the same degree of increase in it either. The real explanation must lie in other aspects of US culture, or the US political system"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In a Ponzi scheme, a fraudulent perpetrator takes your money (and the money of many others), gives some of that to early dropouts but takes the rest for himself. Ponzi schemers profit from lying to you where your money goes.With a decentralized digital asset there is no sole person or company that profits from just lying to you about where your Dollar goes in exchange for digitals. Sure, miners and exchanges make profits based on fees when Bitcoin is created or sold, respectively — but they are only being rewarded for their legitimate efforts required to maintain and sell a digital currency. They do not pretend making your money work for you by some magical scheme.This whole confusion stems from a rather vague understanding of what the subjective theory of value means: Goods and services provided by humans have no intrinsic value but become precious simply there being demand by other humans. Gold can become worthless if nobody wants or needs it anymore. A stupid trading card may cost thousands of dollars costing pennies to make but is sought after by enough collectors. Edit: Yes, Bitcoins are just numbers stored in a computer memory around the world but so is software. And software ain’t cheap.While Bitcoin‘s value might be grossly overestimated due to rampant speculation but even then, these speculators are no victims in an investment fraud but they truly believe that Bitcoin will become much more useful in the future. They may be wrong but, currently, nobody knows. Only the future will show.Edit: Typos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the &#34;Common Objections&#34; relate to the REASONS people choose to own Bitcoin and how those cases make it a Ponzi.There are many different reasons to own Bitcoin, however the author seems to only view it through the lens of someone living in a wealthy and developed country with financial stability.The properties of it being difficult/impossible to confiscate and its privacy make it valuable in oppressive regimes. A refugee could store their wealth in Bitcoin, leave their country, settle somewhere else, and access their Bitcoin without the risk of it being confiscated during the journey, because they can simply memorise the seed phrase (24 words).It&#39;s predictable issuance schedule also makes it valuable in countries suffering from high inflation or hyper-inflation.This is a good article to rethink the use cases of Bitcoin: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/check-your-financial-pri...Alex Gladstein works for the Human Rights Foundation and does lots of good work in Bitcoin advocacy. His other articles are worth checking out.And the data backs this up. Some of the biggest growth in Bitcoin users around the world have been in places around Africa and Vietnam who are subject to some of the situations mentioned above.Do you think these people see Bitcoin as a &#34;Ponzi&#34;? Do you think they care if such a definition doesn&#39;t change the properties they find useful/valuable?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Nevertheless, investing in gold at the current price seems unwise, since its price is many times its &#34;natural&#34; price as commodity and so it is more likely to go down than up.This is a misconception and a fundamental misunderstanding of gold&#39;s primary utility for thousands of years.While it is true that gold&#39;s price reflects a significant premium beyond the &#34;natural&#34; market price, this has been the case for millennia. Since ancient times, most demand for gold has not been for industrial uses or jewelry, but rather as a store of a value. This results in gold having a &#34;monetary premium&#34;.It&#39;s also worth mentioning that it is no coincidence that humans happened to chose gold as money. Among all chemical elements, gold has a favorable combination of chemical properties and rarity in the earth&#39;s crust that make it a suitable choice for storing value over long periods of time. In fact, nearly all gold mined in human history is still around today. We&#39;ve been hoarding it since the time of the pharaohs.I&#39;m sympathetic to crypto skepticism, but I&#39;m afraid many people are missing the forest for the trees. I&#39;m curious for those that still truly believe Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme or a bubble - at what price point and time would you start to consider that you may be tragically wrong?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of people are choosing to ignore that a lot of companies have done things in the past that were not illegal at the time of action. However, those actions were later decided to be made illegal because the behavior was deemed to be antithetical to our values.For example, Standard Oil did not break any laws in its ruthless consolidation of the nascent oil industry.  In fact, it exploited the law to allow it to grow into the monstrosity that it eventually became.  In response, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 which subsequently prevented the actions that Standard Oil had used to consolidate the market.There should be no question, that what FB is doing here, while not illegal, is highly dubious ethically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t personally use FB and don’t have a very favorable view of their products.I would, however, like to see the same level scrutiny applied to the general American media, especially the news media. FB has come in and started eating their lunch. There’s a deeper problem here, and it feels more like the powers that he want to take down FB.I’m not denying any allegation made against FB, but why is it that Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, and Hollywood get a pass when they’ve been damaging America for much longer than FB has existed?If the government sees a problem and wants to get involved - great.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is silly but sort of relevant.During college junior year (1993) as a physics major I took a class in digital electronics (which included 68000 assembler programming). We had a lab contest to create the fastest sorting routine for a set of random unique numbers between x and y.I won the contest by setting to 0 a y-x register range of memory and then inserting each number into the range based on the number itself (&#34;27&#34; into register 27, &#34;18&#34; into register 18, etc.). Then I printed out all non-zero numbers in the range.The other 20 or so students did versions of bubble-sorting and called my solution a cheat. The professor defended my victory as I had not broken any of the rules of the contest..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"High level description of why it sorts:The inner loop takes an array and an index i in the array, and rearranges the array to put the largest value at index i. This is done in such a way that if the sub-array up to but not including i is sorted, then afterwords the sort will be extended such that the sub-array up to and including i will be sorted.The outer loop says, just call in to the inner loop with i from 1 to n. This will result in a sorted array, because the initial array of a single element is trivially sorted, and then we&#39;ll have by the sort-extension property of the inner loop that the progressively larger sub-arrays of 2, 3, ... up to N elements become sorted.You can see that the inner loop has the sort extension property by thinking about two cases.Case 1: If the i-th element is already larger than all previous elements, it won&#39;t touch any of the elements before i, and will only potentially make the i-th element bigger, thus clearly extending the sort though the i-th element.Case 2: If the i-th element is smaller than one of the previous elements, it won&#39;t touch any elements until reaching that smaller element; then it will start a series of swaps until it reaches index i, at which point the the original value of the i-th elment is left inserted in sorted position into the sub-array up to and including i. So at this moment we have the sort extension property. From there, it may increase the value of the i-th element and change later elements, but of both those will preserve the sub-array sort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"[Edit: I took a quick glance at the paper and got carried away; the rest of this comment is about a different algorithm apparently known as &#34;exchange sort&#34;, and an interesting property of it. The algorithm in the paper is actually different, and indeed more surprising.]Hey! That&#39;s my sorting algorithm! (Well, I&#39;m sure it has been independently discovered many times, but one of those times was by me before I had learned of O(n log n) sorting; I used it many times including in the INOI 2004 programming contest, about which I asked the following question ten years ago in 2011 on math.SE about this algorithm and Catalan numbers, a truly surprising property that is not mentioned in this paper: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/36022/how-do-the-ca...&gt; For situations where a quadratic-time sorting algorithm is fast enough, I usually use the following:    //Given array a[1], ... a[n]
    for i = 1 to n:
        for j = i+1 to n:
            if a[i] &gt; a[j]:
                swap(a[i],a[j])

&gt; It looks like bubble sort, but is closer to selection sort. It is easy to see why it works: in each iteration of the outer loop, `a[i]` is set to be the smallest element of `a[i…n]`.----Also: A few years ago I emailed Prof. Richard Stanley of Enumerative Combinatorics fame asking whether it was related to any of the hundreds of problems in his Catalan Numbers list, and he said he didn&#39;t know a direct connection at the time (so maybe it&#39;s an addition to his list?):&gt; &gt; permutations equal to the product of all their inversions (in lexicographic order) [multiplying on the left]&gt; Example: The permutation 1423 has two inversions (24) and (34), and the product (34)(24) is the same as 1423.&gt; Non-example: The permutation 3412 has four inversions (13), (14), (23) and (24), and the product (24)(23)(14)(13) is 4321 which is not the same as 3412.&gt; Among the permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4}, there are 14 examples (and 10 non-examples).And 14 is C_4, the fourth Catalan number."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find it weird for a whistleblower to be so &#34;lib&#34;, as the kids say. She said she &#39;loves&#39; Facebook, and wants to fix it, not harm it.I don&#39;t want Facebook fixed and I do want Facebook harmed. I don&#39;t want the government to meddle with what types of things people can say online, I want them to ban the business model of stalking people online and selling intimate details of their lives. If the problem is Facebook choosing profits over public good, then cut off the profits. This is obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to imagine there are a bunch of Facebook Homefeed engineers out there who ran dozens experiments, tuning this-and-that, and found the ones that boosted revenue, and user engagement by X%. No one thought too deeply at _why_ some experiments were successful. Perhaps it was chalked up as &#34;our new ML model is matching users to content they care about more efficiently&#34;. Then they shipped it, and everyone celebrated their success.My theory is that experiment dashboards, data visualizations, and &#34;metrics&#34; allow employees to almost fully disassociate from their product, and the end users. Engineers at large companies don&#39;t need to use, or even be familiar with the products they spend all day building. Yes, leadership and small pockets (researchers) can see the full picture. Everyone else stays willfully in the dark, doesn&#39;t look too closely, and clocks out at 5 happy because their dashboards look good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me this is a fake story being promoted as a way to further a political narrative.Nothing the whistleblower has revealed is shocking or previously unknown.  Yes facebook tweaks an algorithm on your news feed to drive engagement and make money.Yes facebook allows some content that some would consider not to align with mainstream US narratives.My two cents this is an attempt to force facebook to kowtow to the US and follow googles lead in stopping “unapproved” discourse on topics dealing with covid among others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on tax software and have seen these kind of efforts. Noble, yes. Short lived, yes.It’s relatively easy to make a free 1040 file. The real problem comes from all. The. Edge. Cases.1) do you support xyz state?
2) what if I lived in multiple states?
3) what if i…And on and on.And it’s not just one and done. Every year IRS and states are changing their shit so you have to go thru and make all kind of updates and verifications every year.It takes an army to build and maintain.  Generally not the kind of thing for open source (unless they’re paid).  But then what’s the point?  One may say it’s more transparent, but TurboTax etc are transparent with their formulas - you can check every box they fill in for you.I think the only thing that can really disrupt this dynamic are “free” commercial software (like credit karma now cash app), or government provided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real problem here is that Intuit and other companies lobby millions to maintain their status quo. The right thing to do would be to put every single dollar spent on these corporations into a government program that develops this kind of software or even does the taxes for you (this already exists in many countries in the EU.) Instead, in the US, you pay for Turbotax, they make a profit out if it, and then they use part of the money to lobby and keep the tax code and system rigged for their own benefit. I don&#39;t know if open source software is the solution here -- and as far as I know, the tax forms change every year, so it will be forever playing catch-up -- but it seems to be missing the point entirely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep being perplexed by how the Americans do stuff. I am Dutch and my government makes it (relatively) easy to do taxes. We got a website we can go to; it&#39;s filled by the government and we just need to verify that it is filled correctly and then click submit. Some people can make adjustments where needed and if needed. You can also let an accountant do it for you but that is optional; but useful if you have had a turbulent year that makes takes more difficult (like selling and buying a new house). 
When they did not use a website (a few years back) they offered a downloadable application that was available under Windows, MacOS and Linux (GTK). It worked fine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The NVMe hardware in the M1 is quite peculiar: it breaks the spec in multiple ways, requiring patches to the core NVMe support in Linux, and it also is exposed as a platform device instead of PCIe. In addition, it is managed by an ASC, the “ANS”, which needs to be brought up before NVMe can work, and that also relies on a companion “SART” driver, which is like a minimal IOMMU.Stuff like this makes me wonder: why does Apple do this?  If I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, I can assume that these changes are done for performance, cost, power-saving, or maybe even security reasons.  Otherwise it just seems like Apple does these things in order to make it harder for other OSes to run on their hardware.  Which is certainly their prerogative, but it just makes me think less of them.On the other hand, this is really cool:&gt; However, Apple is unique in putting emphasis in keeping hardware interfaces compatible across SoC generations – the UART hardware in the M1 dates back to the original iPhone! This means we are in a unique position to be able to try writing drivers that will not only work for the M1, but may work –unchanged– on future chips as well.... but cynically (or perhaps just realistically), I can easily believe that this isn&#39;t done for reasons of openness, but because this makes maintenance of macOS itself easier for Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Asahi Linux progress reports rank up there with Dolphin[1] progress reports for being excellent examples of technical writing as well as simply reminding me why I fell in love with computers in the first place.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if Alyssa (or other devs that took a deeper look at the DCP) have any idea why the builtin HDMI port of the Mac Mini would not send DDC messages to the connected monitor.I’ve been struggling with this in Lunar (https://lunar.fyi) for a long time and while I tried my best by comparing ioreg dumps and looking at the DCP driver in IDA, I couldn’t find any obvious logic would block this communication voluntarily.I should mention that on M1, the DDC messages are sent to the monitor by calling IOAVServiceWriteI2C on the DCPAVServiceProxy of the monitor as seen here: https://gist.github.com/alin23/b476a02a8cd298436848e28476aed...I’m thinking that this logic might either exist in the DCP firmware which is not accessible from userspace, or it might just be a side effect of some out of spec behavior that the HDMI port might have."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s technically not a conflict of interest, as long as the revenue streams roll through different offices or partners. /sOr as McKinsey puts it&gt; &#34;across more than a decade of service to the FDA, we have been fully transparent that we serve pharmaceutical and medical device companies. McKinsey’s work with the FDA helped improve the agency’s effectiveness through organizational, resourcing, business process, operational, digital, and technology improvements. To achieve its mission, the government regularly seeks support from additional experts who understand both the government’s mission and the industries’ practices. We take seriously our commitment to avoid conflicts and to serve the best interests of the FDA.&#34;In practice, just another example of questionable behaviour from McKinsey"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet McKinsey also never told the Department of Transportation that it was working for both the DoT and major car manufacturers.Executives senior enough to approve hiring McKinsey to study something, whether they&#39;re F500 CEOs or government agency heads, know full well that the top consulting firms are all advising their competitors, counterparties, and regulators/regulatees. The facts reported in this article would indeed be scandalous if they included evidence that the FDA team at McK was tipping the pharma teams on private FDA plans or discussions, but that is not the case. If anything, this case is merely illustrative of why major consulting firms have borderline-paranoid cultural norms around never discussing client work outside of the respective client team, even (and especially) to one&#39;s own colleagues at the firm who are not staffed on said team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I see McKinsey on someone&#39;s resume, it&#39;s a huge red flag. Similar to &#34;Head of marketing for children&#39;s sales at Phillip Morris&#34;. Sure, all companies do some bad things, but the complete lack of ethics required to succeed at McKinsey is next-level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reddit r/Sysadmin user that claims to be on the &#34;Recovery Team&#34; for this ongoing issue:&gt;As many of you know, DNS for FB services has been affected and this is likely a symptom of the actual issue, and that&#39;s that BGP peering with Facebook peering routers has gone down, very likely due to a configuration change that went into effect shortly before the outages happened (started roughly 1540 UTC).
There are people now trying to gain access to the peering routers to implement fixes, but the people with physical access is separate from the people with knowledge of how to actually authenticate to the systems and people who know what to actually do, so there is now a logistical challenge with getting all that knowledge unified.
Part of this is also due to lower staffing in data centers due to pandemic measures.User is providing live updates of the incident here:https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/q181fv/looks_like..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s been 20+ years since I had reason to know the internals of BGP, but I still carry a slight nervousness whenever I think about it.In many ways, it&#39;s beautiful in that it allows Autonomous Systems to come together and independently make the Internet.However, I always felt it was brittle in that it relied every AS to have edge routers aware of the entire AS routing map, and so when those routers went down hard, when they came back up they were blank and needed to learn the Internet again. I noted back then that on some routers a single spoofed UDP packet to a router getting a table from its peers could cause it to stop doing that and start again. In a time when those updates could take hours... well... that kept me awake at night sometimes.Propagation of routes was global and error prone. Even today, you can see on the spy glass websites rogue AS routers advertising crazy routes either by accident or on purpose as a hostile act (to try and get traffic for a target network through itself).There are tens of thousands of engineers globally nursing and managing this stuff to keep the whole thing going.Like I said, it&#39;s been a while since I last looked closely, and I imagine multiple improvements have been made in this space since that time, but if there was ever a protocol that needs a long, cold hard look for a replacement, it&#39;s quite possibly BGP.It&#39;s also the one - and only - non-crypto situation where if somebody asked me if a blockchain could be really very useful, I&#39;d say &#34;probably, yeah&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great write-up, but one thing I don&#39;t understand is why the effect of withdrawing the BGP prefixes was instantaneous (if I understand that correctly), but it&#39;s taking hours (so far) to re-announce the prefixes.  Why would it take so long to flip the switch back the other way?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How can you explain yesterday&#39;s outage (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) to your parents?You are feeling hungry and went to food court. The food court (open area) has a lot of options. You sit down in front of Domino&#39;s (Facebook), since you want to eat garlic bread. Now, you can&#39;t order from the counter directly. The waiter will come to your seat and ask for the order. You ordered garlic bread from the waiter, but the guy at Domino&#39;s counter went missing. Your order was not reaching to the chef in kitchen as Domino&#39;s counter guy was not present.This explains why Domino&#39;s (Facebook) ecosystem was down, but what about other vendors? They had nothing to do with Facebook.To understand this, we need to go back to our food court again. Now, there are a lot of hungry people sitting outside Domino. Since they were not getting answer from one waiter as why their food is not on their table, they started disturbing all the waiters. Due to this, majority of the waiters were trying to figure out where the Domino&#39;s counter guy went and other food joints (read websites) were not able to fulfil their own orders.So although only Domino&#39;s was down, it appeared as if whole Food Court (Internet) was facing issues.Counter Guy at Domino&#39;s - Facebook Nameservers
Waiters - DNS Servers (Cloudflare, Google, Akamai)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few hours later another programmer came up with the prototype of a much faster terminal renderer, proving that for an experienced programmer a terminal renderer is a fun weekend project and far away from being a multiyear long research undertaking.I have no idea if this is the case here, and I suspect it might not be, but pretty much every time I&#39;ve seen a developer complain that something is slow and then &#39;prove&#39; that it can be faster by making a proof-of-concept the only reason theirs is faster is because it doesn&#39;t implement the important-but-slow bits and it ignores most of the edge cases. You shouldn&#39;t automatically assume something is actually bad just because someone shows a better proof-of-concept &#39;alternative&#39;. They may have just ignored half the stuff it needs to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case this isn&#39;t clear, RefTerm is:1. Faster in every case tested2. More fully-featured, including i18n3. Easier to read and maintain (see for yourself)4. Shorter5. Using existing libs, aka interops well...So none of these typical hand-wavy dismissals apply:1. &#34;Is it really faster for edge cases&#34;2. &#34;He probably didn&#39;t implement certain features like Arabic and Chinese&#34;3. &#34;Businesses just wants enough&#34;4. &#34;Businesses just wants enough&#34;5. &#34;It probably makes some closed-world assumption&#34;The performance of RefTerm didn&#39;t come from some big tradeoff; it came from using the right perspective and keeping things simple.Sure, past a certain complexity threshold, you&#39;d have to work for extra perf, but from my observations, folks who immediately jump to the wrong implicit conclusion that &#34;good perf must have required compromises&#34; got conditioned to think this way because the software they work on are already (often unnecessarily) complex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yup, this. Something I&#39;ve been ranting about[0] for a while: there is no technical progression ladder. The Senior-&gt;Principal-&gt; ... path seems to be a faux-management track, with all the managerial responsibilities and little of the authority. Software is shitty in big part because it&#39;s mostly written by juniors, as almost anyone who has any clue moves over (or gets pushed over) to managerial or faux-managerial roles.I&#39;ve been thinking about a more charitable interpretation of this recently. Another thing I rant about[1] is that tools we use for programming are not expressive enough. It takes too much work to say simple things, the coding feedback loop is ridiculously long. So how this connects? In a way, junior programmers can be seen as a Mechanical Turk version of a Sufficiently Smart Compiler - it lets the more experienced people skip some of the tedium with the tooling and deal with higher-level concepts, which get translated to actual code by an army of juniors and interns. Except, this doesn&#39;t work that well - the coding feedback loop is even slower.--[0] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27417462[1] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28568053"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am pretty sure I read something similar before. Probably from Benedict Evans or somewhere else.I think the most important issue from these email isn&#39;t the lack of Alternative App Store, IAP, or 70/30 split. It is that Apple Execs has Zero understanding of how other business works especially with respect to Internet or Software Services. They continue to think Netflix as a physical product ( As they often like to compare Physical Software distribution before App Store ) that is being continuously sold with recurring revenue like staples or other commodities.Not to mention Netflix knew Apple were doing AppleTV+. Directly competing with them. I love how Apple complains about testing IAP as not OK as in we deserve our 15%.So Reed made the decision to stop IAP. And reading all the emails from Apple execs, Eddy Cue often seems to be the culprit.Steve From D5&gt;You know, because Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana, we weren’t so good at partnering with people. And, you know, acatually, the funny thing is, Microsoft’s one of the few companies we were able to partner with that actually worked for both companies. And we weren’t so good at that, where Bill and Microsoft were really good at it because they didn’t make the whole thing in the early days and they learned how to partner with people really well.And I think if Apple could have had a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well. And I don’t think Apple learned that until, you know, a few decades later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tech companies that reach monopoly scale (like Apple, Facebook, Amazon) should have to disclose all their agreements and honor a &#34;Most Favored Nation&#34; clause giving all companies the same pricing and access as the best negotiated agreement with any one company.  This is the most reasonable way I can think of without breaking them up to prevent them picking winners and losers as new opportunities emerge.  If you have a better plan I&#39;d be glad to hear it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here are not the special deals, saurik commented he cut special deals in the Cydia store occasionally the last time this topic came up. The problem is that there is no alternative to Apple when it comes to publishing software and content on the iPhone and that makes these kind of deals unfair."</p>

We find that even when minimally configured and the handset is idle both iOS and Google Android share data with Apple/Google on average every 4.5 mins. The phone IMEI, hardware serial number, SIM serial number and IMSI, handset phone number etc are shared with Apple and Google. Both iOS and Google Android transmit telemetry, despite the user explicitly opting out of this. When a SIM is inserted both iOS and Google Android send details to Apple/Google. iOS sends the MAC addresses of nearby devices, e.g. other handsets and the home gateway, to Apple together with their GPS location. Users have no opt out from this and currently there are few, if any, realistic options for preventing this data sharing.That is the extent of the data sharing unless the user allows more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One network mitigation for Apple devices (e.g iPads) without a cellular baseband is to have a router block all connections to 17.0.0.0/8, except a once a week check for OS and app updates. This assumes no use of iCloud, which would siphon much more data than described in this article.  It&#39;s also necessary to disable Siri on-device search (e.g. &#34;Learn from this app&#34;) and Spotlight indexing of in-app content (per-app setting for &#34;Show app in Search&#34;), including E2E encrypted messengers like Signal and Wire.For phones, the only mitigation is a lifestyle change to switch from always-reachable to scheduled availability windows or the always-async workflows of pre-mobile computing.  A faraday bag can deny realtime telemetry, even if it&#39;s cached for relay when connectivity returns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s time to have a big talk about transparency.Some of the people who defend the ultra-rich are also the ones who claim to be in favour of free markets. A small bit of economic orthodoxy is that for free markets to work, parties need to be informed (and externalities priced in, but that&#39;s another story). This is not just in terms of &#34;this is the price of bananas&#34; but also in terms of knowing eg what various salaries are, which businesses are profitable, etc.How can we have free markets when we don&#39;t even know who owns what?As for taxation, there needs to be an overhaul. Things need to be simpler, and I say this as someone who has used international tax advisors. There&#39;s no reason the tax guy&#39;s diagram of your business should be more complicated than your own diagram. Moving profits to other countries shouldn&#39;t be possible, or rather, it should be more fixed by the nature of the business than by the desires of the CFO. We simply hear too much about &#34;selling IP rights&#34; to subsidiaries and similar schemes that are clearly meant to lower tax rather than increase revenue. Granted some things will be legitimate, but it&#39;s important that some vague concept of fairness is adhered to. This again goes back to transparency. We invented corporations to help improve society, so we ought to know what kinds of things people are doing with them.Edit:Perhaps the way to see it is, if you say &#34;we make money by selling coffees in the UK&#34; you would expect that entity to report a tax structure that contains a bunch of coffee and UK related entries. Reporting to investors ought to mirror reporting to the taxman."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I see here is tax evasion. But done in a roundabout legal loopholish kind of way.1. Establish profitable company in your home country.2. Establish 2nd company in a tax haven country.3. Give 2nd company some kind of ownership, and then pay rental fees, licensing fees, or simply set up a high interest loan that the 2nd company loaned the first.4. Once you set up a way to make it look like you owe the 2nd company tons of money, now your 1st company no longer is &#34;profitable&#34; and actually in debt losing money, which means it doesn&#39;t need to pay taxes on the massive profit it&#39;s making.While I believe it&#39;s legal it hinges on bad ethical practice. But many large companies do this, such as cruise ships and I think Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing with all of these is that the rich people are probably just as surprised as you are to show up in these leaks in most cases.When you get barely rich, like single digit millions, the banks will start to offer you &#34;family office&#34; services.  They basically just take care of everything for you.  You send them all your money and all your debts (even your phone bills and stuff), and they promise to make sure there is more at the end of the year than the start.  They invest for you, they do accounting and file taxes for you.  You give them limited power of attorney so you don&#39;t even see the tax forms.If you ask how it all works, they tell you it&#39;s really complicated and you should just focus on doing whatever it is that made you rich and let them worry about managing the money for you.  Sometimes they do ethical stuff, sometimes not, depending on which bank and which consultant you hire.I&#39;m not excusing the people who are here, just explaining how some people who you thought were good people end up in these leaks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m more than willing to believe there&#39;s insider trading, but the data presented at the beginning is not convincing.&gt; Of the 496 trades [Filler has] made since 2014 in Alabama’s ServisFirst Bancshares Inc., where he sits on the board of directors, and Century Bancorp Inc. of Massachusetts, where he’s the largest shareholder, 372 of them, or 75%, have shown a profit three months later.&gt; Besides Filler, other TipRanks stars include Steve Mihaylo, the CEO of telephone services company Crexendo Inc., where he owns a $60 million stake. Mihaylo has turned a three-month profit on 83% of his trades over the past five years even as Crexendo’s shares have seesawed.We&#39;ve also had an unprecedented bull market over the past 10 years. If you pick any random stock at any time and hold it for three months, what are the odds that it will be worth more?The article compares the returns to the S&amp;P500, but that is the net performance of those 500 stocks. You&#39;d have to compare it to the base rate of picking a random stock to see if it&#39;s actually remarkable.Maybe the S&amp;P 500 performed lower because 75% of the stocks in it went up and 25% went down. But that means that if you randomly pick one stock, you&#39;d have a 75% chance of it being one of the ones that went up, and you&#39;d outperform the S&amp;P500. (Well, not quite, maybe it could go up, but not as much as the S&amp;P500 as a whole. But still, most of the stocks that go up, would have to go up more than the average of the whole index in order to compensate for the ones that go down)Later in the article, when they mention that insiders tend to reliably sell stock ahead of bad news, that seems much more damning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Remember, you can trade stocks without trading stocks.What do I mean? Mark Cuban sold a collar on his Yahoo stock through Goldman for $[I forget] billion dollars. That was an off-market trade in which someone bought his entire block off of him. In today’s world, with tons of low interest (as in, single/double-digit basis points) loans and other fun weird contraptions, you have a lot more options to trade without trading.I have no grand reveal here, but there’s probably an entire “dark dataset” regarding that activity that is missing from this conversation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Eh, kinda. Calling something a &#34;best practice&#34; is basically an appeal to authority. It means, &#34;this is the right way to do things, for reasons I don&#39;t have time to explain.&#34; There are times when that&#39;s appropriate.But really, &#34;best&#34; and &#34;right&#34; are highly situational. Any rule of thumb, even the most basic and uncontroversial, has a situation where it doesn&#39;t apply. I was part of a discussion on a mailing list years ago, where somebody got flamed harshly when he mentioned using a global variable. He then explained that he was working on an embedded control system for cars and all the variables in that system were global. The team was well aware of the pitfalls of global state and used a combination of documentation, static analysis, custom tooling and elaborate testing to mitigate them. It was a considered design choice that made it possible to develop high-performance, hard-realtime software that could run on very limited hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest issue I saw with &#34;best practices&#34; in my career is the failure to take into account who it claiming it to be a best practice, and in what context. I saw too many junior developers read a rando blog article, then get a non-technical / semi-technical manager excited about something that made their life easier, even though it was by no means a good practice for the context at hand. Or alternatively, believe some vendor carte blanche when they tell you their product somehow follows a best practice.The overarching problem is that yes, there is software engineering going on in the world, but most organizations are not willing to do engineering. I don&#39;t blame the technical staff - they often have good intentions - but rather the typical business is not willing to pay the cost in time or money to do long-lasting engineering practices. This is one of the things not enough of us think about in our career choices - am I going to a place that practices fire drills or engineering?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How can Software Engineers call themselves engineers when there’s no rules, governing bodies, or anything to stipulate what true Software Engineering is?We call ourselves software developers in Canada.According to Canadian engineering[1]:
The &#34;practice of engineering&#34; means any act of planning, designing, composing, evaluating, advising, reporting, directing or supervising, or managing any of the foregoing, that requires the application of engineering principles, and that concerns the safeguarding of life, health, property, economic interests, the public welfare, or the environment.To be considered a work of engineering, then, that a piece of software (or a software-intensive system) must meet two conditions:1. The development of the software has required “the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.”2. There is a reasonable expectation that failure or inappropriate functioning of the system would result in harm to life, health, property, economic interests, the public welfare, or the environment[1] - https://engineerscanada.ca/news-and-events/news/when-softwar..."</p>

Many have commented on this, and one of his colleagues, Haro von Buttlar, collected stories told by Houtermans and privately published them in a book with more than 40 pages. One story purports to explain the contributions of seven of the twentieth century&#39;s most exceptional scientists, Theodore von Kármán, George de Hevesy, Michael Polanyi, Leó Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, John von Neumann, and Edward Teller, all Hungarians. According to Houtermans, they are Martians, who are afraid that their accents will give them away, so they masquerade as Hungarians, i.e., people unable to speak any language but Hungarian without an accent.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Houtermans#Personal"</p>

I realize it&#39;s hard to quantify this but just eyeballing it, for a group of 10 people who got famous before age 50, born that far back, to have four members break 90 seems unusual - including wartime or other disease-related deaths.The fact that IQ tests can predict longevity is interesting.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC30556/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothian_birth-cohort_studiesJohn von Neumann=54,

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hungarian perspective here:I believe there are a couple of factors at play here.First of all, most (perhaps all) of those people are Hungarian Jews, and Jewish people (imho) are both very intelligent and their culture values education a lot. Hungary had a very large Jewish population at the time, so no wonder we produced so many great scientists!Second is the Hungarian language. Ede Teller specifically said his scientific achievements are thanks to the Hungarian language, and without it he could only be a high school teacher. I can find a few sources if you want, and the ones I know about might not be accurate, but for example Cardinal Giuseppe Mezzofanti, who spoke 58 languages   himself, said of our language: “Do you know which language, because of its constructive ability and the harmony of its rhythm, comes before all the others? The Hungarian! It seems as if the Hungarians themselves do not know the treasure of their language…”.Third Hungary at that point was a rather developed country, unlike now. Budapest metro opened after the London one, as the worlds&#39; second.Edit: Fourth, not related to the previous 3 as not unique to Hungary, but there were probably &#34;network effects&#34; at play. Science does not happen in a vacuum, as Paul Erdos said for him maths is a social activity (as witnessed by his vagabond tendency to move in with his peers and work on problems while living at their house). So probably having all these great minds in related fields was a kind of a feedback loop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My father put together a (vacuum tube) Heathkit tape recorder in the late 1950s and made recordings of my great grandparents (on both sides) in 1959 and 1960.  They talked about their lives growing up, how they met, and some of the hardships they endured.  They were probably 35-40 years younger than the gentleman in the video, but they also described a time before automobiles, electricity, radio, and telephones were commonplace.I converted those recordings to MP3 about 15 years ago.It&#39;s amazing how far we&#39;ve come in such a short time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I would see anywhere from 10 to 20, hardly ever less than 10, sailing vessels down the (Hudson) river. Now I don&#39;t see more than one in three months.Very few steamboats. Everyone went to New York then, if they wanted to go in the new style why, they take a steamboat. If they want to go cheap they go on one our river sloops.&#34;One of the most incredible things to note here is that this was around the time planes were being invented, the first commercial airplane trip was just made few years earlier, and this a fairly rural interview of an elder so it&#39;s sane to think this person has never even seen an airplane."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Along similar lines, nobody &#34;really knows&#34; how Google search works. Sure, you have some experts who can talk about how parts of the algorithm work, you have the underlying bones of page rank, you even have SEO experts who can get you reasonably close to the top search results.But is there a single individual on earth who knows all the ins and outs of all the minutiae of every single aspect of Google search - from search result algorithm to ingestion to crawling to artificial intelligence? Not a chance.You don&#39;t even have to get as complicated as Google search - any reasonably complex software system with hundreds of engineers working on it will be beyond the comprehension of any human being - fully understanding that is (which also entails knowing exactly all the edge cases, all the bugs, all the unexpected results possible, etc.)How does the economy work? Nobody knows - but that doesn&#39;t mean nothing intelligent can be said about it, or that the Fed can&#39;t make reasonable decisions on imperfect information - just like any other incredibly complex system that humans struggle to understand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried this and it doesn&#39;t work. Turns out my MacBook was throttling to 30% due to overheating. This happens more frequently if you drive the GPU with an external monitor. Unfortunately the OS does nothing to notify you of overheating and throttling, which is an insanely stupid oversight by apple.  I only found out because I noticed that the computer ran fine while running the AC, so I installed an app through Brew called &#34;Hot&#34; which tells you temperature and throttling percentage, and confirmed that this was indeed problem.This happens when the room is over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, even when the CPU is at 3% utilization. Can&#39;t find root cause, or if this is even considered abnormal, but the laptop is defective in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also recently discovered that something like 12% of CPU on my 2020 macbook air is used whenever I&#39;m in a room with anything greater than perfect silence, by &#39;coreaudiod&#39;, because it apparently is constantly listening to the microphone built in near the keyboard and spending cpu cycles trying to filter out background noise. Apparently running the signal desktop app in the background is enough to keep coreaudiod constantly wasting battery. Because signal is open and has been granted permissions for microphone and speakers, even if no call session is open?https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=macos+c...meanwhile, &#34;Slack Helper&#34; is reporting 15% cpu usage just sitting there doing nothing. Imagine the cumulative kilowatt-hours wasted globally by all the CPU cycles spent by slack just to exist as basically a glorified IRC app.If you really want to see slack waste CPU and battery, leave a channel open that somebody has pasted a high FPS animated GIF into, in the slack window in the background. Easily 35% usage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Might be similar to the last time this came up (i&#39;m looking for it now, edit: found it[0]) where the developer worked with a sizable development-for-hire firm that were themselves associated with many other dev accounts, some of which ended up being suspended for ToS violations (possibly by this firm, possibly by the customer without the firm&#39;s knowledge). The anti-ban-evasion technology Google runs then effectively poisoned this firm&#39;s Play developer profile so that anyone working with them would be suspended for the potential ban evasion, eventually.Note that, for this specific case, it might not be a firm but one of the developers themselves that has a poisoned account thanks to past dealings that violated ToS. I imagine the system only banning by associate if the $25 developer account itself ever uploads an app so that it doesn&#39;t ban associated Google accounts for non-play-developer purposes.0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19124324 (comment explaining https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19124463 )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Mesa 3D - driver library that provides open source driver (mostly copy of AMD-VLK)Wrong, wrong, very wrong. No copy here. Mesa&#39;s RADV was developed completely independently from AMD, in fact it predates the public release of AMDVLK. It&#39;s also possibly the best Vulkan implementation out there. Valve invested heavily in the ACO compiler backend, so it compiles shaders both very well and very quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Parallelism with the computing units in GPU permeates the entire computing model.  For the longest time I don&#39;t get how partial derivative instructions like dFdx/dFdy/ddx/ddy work.  None of the doc helps.  These instructions take in a number and return its partial derivative, just a generic number, nothing to do with graphic, geometry or function.  The number could have been the dollar amount of a mortgage and its partial derivative is returned.It turns out these functions tied to how the GPU architecture runs the computing units in parallel.  The computing units are arranged to run in parallel in a geometric grid according to the input data model.  The computing units run the same program in LOCK STEP in parallel (well at least in lock step upon arriving at the dFdx/dFdy instructions).  They also know their neighbors in the grid.  When a computing unit encounters a dFdx instruction, it reaches across and grabs its neighbors&#39; input value to their dFdx instructions.  All the neighbors arrive at dFdx at the same time with their input value ready.  With the neighbors&#39; numbers and its own number as the mid point, it can compute the partial derivative using gradient slope."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many people are seeing all these different vendor specific CPUs as a win. I&#39;m a bit more skeptical, but perhaps that it unwarranted.But Apple, Google, and Amazon are now creating their own ARM CPUs for their own products. So most of FAANG, all if you count the ones with consumer products.The first version of these CPUs will be very ARM compatible, as they are trying to drive adoption to of their silicon. Once there get a leg up they will start adding patented operation to their stuff. And then we&#39;ll end up with a fragmented CPU field driven by corporate greed.And because they are not OEMing this hardware, they really have no incentive to be cooperative with the others. Similar to older gaming console that had custom and experimental architectures.However it is obvious why this is all happening. And that is Intel and Qualcomm inhibited growth and squeezed too much profit from the market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question I have around Google&#39;s CPU ambitions is what their end game is.I understand Apple&#39;s end game. They sold lots of iPhones and wanted to in-house the chips for that. Makes sense. Once they had that working well (and Intel was falling behind on their chips), they decided to put in-house chips in their macOS computers. Makes sense.AWS rents more CPU time than anyone out there. Makes sense for them to want to develop some custom chips for their stuff.What&#39;s Google&#39;s end game? They don&#39;t actually sell a lot of chips. I&#39;d understand them wanting to create a server chip, but they seem to be targeting phones and laptops. Is Google looking to become a major player in Android hardware? I like the Pixel phones, but they&#39;re a very small part of the market. Chromebooks are usually built by companies like HP and Acer, not Google directly.The article says that Google&#39;s Pixel sold 7M units in 2019 (their highest year) and they&#39;re looking for 50% more than that (so 10.5M) for the Pixel 6. In 2019, Apple shipped 215M iPhones (over 30x the Pixel). Is Google looking to make the Pixel a much larger part of the Android ecosystem? Are they looking to compete directly with HP, Acer, and others in the Chromebook market?I guess I wonder what the end-goal is here. Maybe the premium on Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon chips is so high that they&#39;d rather make their own. Maybe they want to become the primary hardware vendor in the Android ecosystem - or at least a much larger one. But Google never seems to push its own hardware aggressively so it&#39;s a bit curious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope so. I had a Google Pixelbook, and with the Linux container support (aka Crostini) it was an ideal developer laptop, especially as the Linux support improved over time. I was worried they were going to drop it as the Pixel Slate is much more of a consumer device.Would love to see another Pixelbook with great performance and stability for Linux apps."</p>

You can implement a useful CRDT for simple applications in under 100 lines if all you care about are standard database objects - like maps, sets and values. List CRDTs are where they get complicated, but most applications aren’t collaborative text editors.The promise of CRDTs is that unlike most conflict resolution systems, you can layer over a crdt library and basically ignore all the implantation details. Applications should (can) mostly ignore how a CRDT works when building up the stack.The biggest roadblock to their use is that they’re poorly understood. Well, that and implementation maturity. Automerge-rs merged a PR the other day which brought a 5 minute benchmark run down to 2 seconds. But by bit we’re getting there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its a good article but it should be noted that this very much is a web-centric view of Offline First and its challenges. When I say web-centric, I mean as opposed to offline-first on a mobile app.Native apps dont deal with the same issues around storage, and are actually _much_ more performant overall. If you haven&#39;t done an offline-first app, I highly recommend it. The experience is magical. You can fly around your app at the speed of the users touch. Content is magically loaded as soon as its clicked on. Its amazing as a user.As for similarities, conflict resolution is a universal problem and is either the most difficult or second most difficult problem [1] to solve. What makes this more difficult is that there is no one-size-fits-all for this. You need to have a deep, nuanced understanding of your system and what makes sense for your use case in terms of resolution strategies. Then you need to implement them, which is not easy especially if your backend is bog-standard REST on a classic SQL datastore.I&#39;ve enjoyed reading the past 2 rxdb articles on this (the one mentioned here as well as the one from a couple days ago [2]). Its great to have more content on this publicly available, when I was getting into offline-first I only had a couple options.[1] - At the end of the day, offline-first is a whole bunch of caching, and so you end up needing to deep dive into cache invalidation strategies which we all know is a hairy problem.[2] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28690427"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on offline-first apps (CouchDB/PouchDB + Cordova/Capacitor and published via App/Play Store) in the last years and can definitely relate. But some points to add:- The 7 days IDB limitation does not apply for apps that are published through the stores- Conflicts can happen, but depending on your design they might not matter in practise. „Implement a proper conflict resulution strategy“ has been on my „todo: maybe“ list for over 3 years now but was never important enough.- Data migration is not needed as long as schema changes are additive (new doc fields, new doc types). Design carefully early on, keep track of „abandoned“ properties and you&#39;ll rarely need a difficult migration.- Depending on the performance of your customers&#39; phones and the amount of data your app is processing, it (JS -&gt; ... -&gt; IDB and back) might not be fast enough. I had to add caching layers for some use cases. But at some point, you probably want a proper state management library anyways which should include caching nearly for free.- You can (and should!) still consider most of your data relational. There is even a relational-pouch plugin. But I&#39;m strongly missing foreign key constraints and better DB-level data validation than CouchDB&#39;s design docs provide."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before Python became ML&#39;s darling, there was Lush: Lisp Universal SHell by none other than Yann LeCun and Leon Bottouk[1], and I thought my Lisp knowledge was going to finally pay off ;) I&#39;ve since moved on to J and APL. SBCL is amazing and aside from calling C directly, it is still very fast. Python is slow without its specialized libraries from the C-world, but SBCL produces short, readable code that is pretty efficient. There ECL[2] for an embedded Lisp, or uLisp[32] for really small processors like the ESP chips.[1]  http://lush.sourceforge.net/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I write Clojure for food, and Common Lisp for fun. One reason for the latter is CL&#39;s speed -- awhile back I compared a bit of (non-optimized) Clojure code I wrote for a blog post with a rough equivalent in CL, and was stunned that the Common Lisp code ran about 10x faster.  This made me curious as to how fast it could be made if I really tried, and was able to get nearly 30x more[1] by optimizing it.Clojure is definitely fast enough for everything I&#39;ve done professionally for six years.  But Common Lisp, while having plenty of rough edges, intrigues on the basis of performance alone.  (This is on SBCL -- I have yet to play with a commercial implementation.)[1] http://johnj.com/from-elegance-to-speed.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I miss my common lisp days, and I think rust being able to export C ABIs makes it a really great companion language for CL. I also think common lisp (or really, any fast lisp) is a really great tool for game development. The fact that you can redefine a program as it&#39;s running really helps iterate without having to set up your state over and over. Pair that with a fast, low-level language that can handle a lot of the lower level stuff (been trying to find time to look at Bevy on rust), and you have a killer combo.The main reason I stopped using lisp was because of the community. There were some amazing people that helped out with a lot of the stuff I was building, but not a critical mass of them and things just kind of stagnated. Then it seemed like for every project I poured my soul into, someone would write a one-off copy of it &#34;just because&#34; instead of contributing. It&#39;s definitely a culture of lone-wolf programmers.CL is a decent language with some really good implementations, and everywhere I go I miss the macros. I definitely want to pick it up again sometime, but probably will just let the async stuff I used to work on rest in peace."</p>

No spam accompanies this result.Alternatively if I type &#39;hacker&#39;, I shall be shown the three windows I currently have open, along with the 7 bookmarks, that match that string.Otherwise it&#39;s a handy shortcut to launch any application I know is installed on the local host.I believe it&#39;s consistently been providing this service for more than twenty years.Compare ctrl-escape on Microsoft Windows, which should offer much the same experience.Often while using Microsoft Windows I am trying to find a way back to a fleeting pop-up that graced a corner of my screen before I could fully read or act upon it.  This invariably fails to provide a sensible result.  For example, type &#39;update&#39; if you wish to search for, but certainly not find, the source of the various noisy &#39;Windows Update&#39; notifications.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Supervisory managers brandishing Agile + endless meetingsPersonally for me - this led to burnout and I have quit last two jobs that used Agile faster than I have the 2 before that didn&#39;t use Agile. Agile is very clearly being misused to turn developers into factory line workers whose productivity can be measured by number of commits, reviews and docs they put out every two weeks. And the meetings it takes to do Sprint planning, stand-ups, reviews, demos, retros are really killing any possibility of developers having a flow of uninterrupted time to do what they need to.And the burnout article linked in the OP makes a great point about inputs to development teams not being measured. At some places developers are left to spec out stories and others have Architects / Tech Leads do it - in either case that in itself is a large chunk of work that takes up huge amount of time that no one is rewarded for in any way!Mostly though keeping the churn going is what gets really tiring - do most orgs have work that a) needs to be done every two weeks and b) can be done in two weeks perpetually? The pressure leads to manufacturing bite sized requirements that can be demoed in two weeks - the real impact of that work is almost always never evaluated. Combine this pressure with time crunch that prevents people from spending quality time together to ponder bigger, high impact problems and collaborate on solving those within the meeting heavy Agile process and you are never going to get anything meaningful done.This is not to say Agile itself is bad - it takes effort and skill to use it effectively but managers seem to be taking the easy way out to create a factory line kind of setup where random requirements keep getting thrown and every two weeks you are supposed to roll out _a_ solution. The trouble is software / IT is not at all like rolling cars out on a factory line so it all falls apart.Edit: By Agile I meant Scrum really."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reads to me as yet another screed by someone who has never worked outside the tech industry. Software Engineering is IMO the best, most privileged job available in the US, and I suspect in much of the world. Life-long tech workers have no idea how much worse conditions are even for “knowledge workers” in other fields.Case in point, when we get a tired of the office grind we can publish a manifesto that slams tons of people we’ve worked with in the past (with no fear of consequences from those burned bridges), move to a resort wherever we want, and still expect to either make great pay with benefits while fully remote, or realistically start our own business with a great chance of success (and can easily raise funding to defray the risk if we want to).I’m grateful to work in software. It’s a wonderful thing that we have so much privilege. And so of course, at a time when the world has been quite stirred up and most of our lives affected, it’s great to see many engineers have the freedom to change jobs to fit their lives better, and that they’re exercising that freedom.But could we observe and write about all that without the anger and entitlement? For anyone who has worked in other fields, or even less in-demand jobs in tech, it just comes across as whiny and out of touch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree this is a phenomenon right now, but I feel that article is vastly overcomplicating it, and not necessarily accurately.I&#39;d suggest simply:- software engineers are hugely in demand- software engineers have worked out they can work well remotely, and often prefer it for a combination of productivity and work/life balance reasons- software engineers are voting with their feet and finding work that suits their needs - and many firms are losing talent accordingly due to not meeting the needs of those staff"</p>

If this is not a mistake that means they managed to deliver the video from the hurricane to the internet in less than 24 hours.Why is this impressive?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;We will be depositing funds into your account equal to the value of the currency improperly removed from your account at the time of the incident. Some customers have already been reimbursed -- we will ensure all customers affected receive the full value of what you lost. You should see this reflected in your account no later than today.&#34;I sympathize with the &#34;Not your keys, not your coins&#34; crowd, but you have to admit that you are far more likely to be compensated in the event of an attack if you are using a large exchange. Not guaranteed, of course, but Coinbase has an image to maintain.I also believe, personally, that a large exchange has much better security than anything I could muster with a hot wallet. Yes, I know I can airgap a cold wallet but I like the ability to quickly sell some amount of crypto at market rates without having to transfer from a paper wallet. I also worry about physical security since my home has been burglarized before. Therefore, I keep my coins on exchanges and follow good practices with 2FA across my accounts (no SMS for any) and have withdrawal delays / whitelisting active."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this reflects very favorably on Coinbase. They&#39;re making everyone whole, and gosh - the attackers had the user&#39;s usernames, passwords and phone numbers. Hard not to be sympathetic to Coinbase in that scenario. How are they supposed to know those aren&#39;t the real users? Consider that if they are going to identify those cases as fraudulent actors, then they could easily lock-out legitimate users as well.I&#39;ll guess the users had the same usernames and passwords that they&#39;ve used for a hundred other sites, and one of those got breached at some point.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting read. This seems to be implemented as a Bluetooth LE app running on the ultra-low power “always on processor” used for a variety of features, like “wake-up on motion.”Much like an Tile or AirTag is implemented. No comment on what this is capable in the future.. but for now this shows power usage / signal strength / proximity of other “actually on” devices are a limitations of this feature.What’s impressive is the mesh network effect of all these iPhones / iDevices to locate a “lost” device. I’ll be thankful if I manage to use this to retrieve a lost phone. I’ll be pretty shocked if I’m “spied on” with this style of device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In some way this feature reminded me of Android&#39;s song detection functionality which is also on by default and is constantly listening in the background [1].So now tech companies normalized that:- the mic is always on.- the phone is always on, even when it&#39;s off. (thanks to AOP)- devices are always online even when they are offline.(thanks to company-operated p2p networks like Find My or Sidewalk)What could possibly go wrong?https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7535326?hl=en"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is wrong about AOP being on while the phone is off. AOP is on while the phone is in standby. It powers down when you shut down the phone. Its job is to save battery by doing things like the Hey Siri and sensors processing without powering up the main cores at all. It does not stay on when the system is shut down.The part about the Bluetooth chipset staying on is correct. Think about it, why would they need the AOP when the Bluetooth chipset can run that applet autonomously and send the beacons?Nothing is listening to your mics while the phone is off. The stuff that runs while the phone is off is rather limited. Mostly things related to the NFC chipset, to support payment and transport applications while the battery is dead (which is a requirement of some of those systems) and, as we just saw, Bluetooth LE features."</p>

Is looks like most of these were initially listed in the 80s, not too long after Endangered Species Act passed.Is there some sort of time limit before they officially declare something extinct?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Almost more surprising is that this was removed:&gt; When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.In favor of this:&gt; Participants should speak and act with good intentions, but understand that intent and impact are not equivalent.Also changed yesterday:&gt; Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.became:&gt; Behaviour which can be considered harassment against protected classes will not be tolerated.The updated CoC is here: https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/blob/master/en/con...This is very weird because fundamentally it stems from a failure of the moderators. If someone makes a sexist joke you don&#39;t just let them because you&#39;re &#34;assuming good intentions&#34;, that clause means that you tell them it&#39;s not appropriate here, and if they apologize you assume they are sincere, and if they don&#39;t you swiftly boot them. But there is no substitute for good moderation, shifting words around won&#39;t help much.Aside: Open source discussion opening with &#34;My rationale for these changes are documented on Twitter: [link]&#34; also seems somewhat crazy. And I love Twitter, it just seems very odd to link to a thread of tweets instead of restating your case in the proper medium."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish we responded to situations more proportionally.In this case, someone made a joke about women not liking to reveal their true age as they get older. It&#39;s a boring cliched joke. Something I&#39;ve heard too many times in my life (and, most often from women). Is it sexist? I can see the argument. Is it professional to make such a joke on a ruby mailing list? I don&#39;t know, perhaps not.Does it warrant responses like &#34;Knock that bullshit off.&#34; or &#34;you made an ass of yourself&#34;... I don&#39;t know. Seems a little ironic to use unprofessional language in this situation. Maybe even worse than the joke itself? I don&#39;t know.Then, folks take the discussion to github and twitter (and, eventually reddit and hn). Presenting only their verdict: &#34;A newer member made a sexist joke, and was called out on it as being inappropriate.&#34; No links to the joke. No evidence that the joke is sexist. This makes it so much easier to imagine something really bad. No, we just get a verdict and we should all rise up against this sexism (which absolutely is bad, of course). Let&#39;s get our pitchforks. This amplifies one side of the argument and shuts down any useful conversation. Worse, it&#39;s used to rush through a CoC change without allowing any thoughtful discussion.Is this reaction proportional to the original joke? Is the reaction itself exemplar of how we would like to conduct ourselves?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I realize CoCs were introduced to make certain supposedly marginalized groups more at home at conferences.  But my personal experience/feeling is the complete reverse.  I am a member of a minority as a person with a disability.  In all the years I was interacting with the community, I haven&#39;t had a single issue with someone I couldn&#39;t handle myself.  I never felt uneasy interacting with others.  But the day I saw the first CoC being used in a community I was interacting with, I started to feel uneasy.  I cant really say why, but I feel I dont want to interact with groups which need rules like these.  I also stopped going to conferences.  Gosh, I am even glad I didnt go to the DebConf where they invited Linus only to realize later that they are very unhappy with his speaking style.  I would have felt too much shame for being a part of such a group of hyprocrits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best thing about this is that AMP links totally break “open this page in the website’s native app” links, which I encounter frequently, presumably because the browser is on an AMP proxy domain and thus the iOS native app URL listener doesn’t work. It’s absolutely shocking that such a core flow is completely broken by default when you’re coming from Google search results.This app fixes this problem!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author of this app made a post on Reddit a few days ago.https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/pvvi83/googles_amp_p...The program is opensource.https://github.com/christianselig/Amplosion"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d pay a good deal of money to have early 2010 style Google back.Mainly:- No AMP- If I quote a string, you better be goddamn sure it’s present on the pages that you show me.- One ad per query. These days the organic results are after the page fold. This is unacceptable for something that’s supposed to be a search engine.—-The second one gets little attention but it’s infuriating to me. 
I mean, I’m explicitly telling the engine what I want. If it’s not including it in the results, I might as well not even be here typing. Just show me whatever it thinks I want based on everything it knows about me. And no, unfortunately verbatim doesn’t always help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t a great specific example (it&#39;s &#34;just&#34; a meme and not even a particularly culturally significant one in the grand scheme of things), but in general this is why projects like youtube-dl are important.It might not be glamorous, and it might be a little stupid, but damnit this is our culture, for better or worse! And we should preserve it.Private companies seem to be the only ones with the resources to store all the video content we produce, and they&#39;re also exactly the wrong ones to be hosting our collective shared culture for posterity.It&#39;s a shame a torrenting-based youtube wouldn&#39;t really work for various reasons, both legal and social.So, short of that, at least being able to download stuff important to us as individuals is an important right to preserve.My personal stake in this fight is a video of &#34;Scotland the Brave&#34; that I used to listen to a lot, which featured an older Scottish gentleman standing in the beautiful highlands, loudly and proudly calling down through the glen.It got randomly copyright-removed recently and I&#39;ve been unable to find it elsewhere. I don&#39;t even know who the person in the video was."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is truly wrong. Far from censorship, this is a field test of memory-holing. Deleting a part of the history of the Internet (yes, this silly little nonsense video is now part of Modern Culture) is a Rubicon I&#39;m shocked YouTube has the temerity to cross. I can&#39;t wait to see what more conventional history they&#39;ll delete.For now, note the conscious blowing-off, on YouTube&#39;s part, of all the re-uploads. Will they also get got? If not, why not?I-- I can&#39;t believe they&#39;ve done this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Inkscape is fantastic. It, Blender and Krita has completely freed me from paying subscription fees for creative tools. I used to be an Adobe Suite (PS, AI, AE, PP) user, but I&#39;ve yet to encounter a situation where I&#39;ve felt limited by not having access to those &#34;premium&#34; applications any more.There are issues of course - memory leaks and odd GUI handling on Windows in particular - but I&#39;ve had the same sort of issues with Adobe products as well.A really awesome thing about Inkscape for me is how it uses standard SVG as its default file format. It makes a lot of sense and makes the raw artwork highly exportable and flexible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love this program. Few times per year I need a vector tool. After some toying with proprietary vector tools (Illustrator), I learned Inkscape (as it was readily available in my Linux envs).I never looked back. It does the job. I never have to look for cracked software in order to open my old files or use my acquired skills.It just works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Inkscape, but really the performance in mac is completely insufficient, each action takes at least 1 second to load.Probably is not their fault or main target OS, but is so hard to find a free or open source alternative with the same functionality for mac."</p>
