								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After the Affordable Care Act went into effect I signed our company up for our state&#39;s marketplace. While browsing our plan options, I noticed the url used a scheme like marketplace.org/employers/341/plans.aspx. Of course, I tried changing the number in the url to 342 to see what happened. To my astonishment, it loaded up the next company&#39;s plans, including a list of employee names, ages, plan cost, and SSNs.After I shopped a few other companies to see how our plans compared, I notified the marketplace operator via the only link on the website for customer service. Within about an hour, someone from their IT department rang me on the phone and started grilling me about how many other plans I browsed, and insisted that I clear my cache and browsing history, and notified me that they would be watching to make sure nobody at our IP address didn&#39;t access any other plans while the issue was being fixed.I was pretty surprised at his response, and assumed they would be more grateful for exposing a pretty basic flaw, but I guess a natural human tendency in these situations is to try to externalize the blame. Perhaps it&#39;s more difficult to hold yourself accountable than it is to assume that others who&#39;ve found your shoddy work are malicious actors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quote from the St Louis Post Dispatch article is even more groan-worthy:&#34;In the letter to teachers, Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven said “an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.”I guess webpages are kinda like encryption for idiots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article, it sounds like nothing even remotely questionable was done by the reporter who found the flaw:&gt; &#34;According to the Post-Dispatch, one of its reporters discovered the flaw in a web application allowing the public to search teacher certifications and credentials. No private information was publicly visible, but teacher Social Security numbers were contained in HTML source code of the pages.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Often overlooked things when discussing esbuild here:1. It&#39;s not just a faster replacement for a single %tool_name% in your build chain: for the vast majority of cases, it&#39;s the whole &#34;chain&#34; in a single cli command if you&#39;re doing it right.That is, you don&#39;t just stick it inside, say, webpack as a faster replacement for babel (although you can). No, you look carefully through your webpack configs and its myriad of plugins, ask yourself whether you really need to inline css in jsx in png while simultaneously optimizing it for IE 4.0, realize you don&#39;t, through out the whole thing, and use esbuild instead.I have two 50K+ LOC projects using esbuild, and I would use it even if it was slower than webpack/babel/tsc simply not to worry about the build chain breaking due to an update to some obscure dependency or plugin.2. It is fast because it&#39;s written from scratch to do a set of particular things and do it fast, not just because it&#39;s Go and parallelized.If you look at the commit log you will notice a lot of performance tweaks. If you look into the issues, you will find a lot of requests for additional features rejected, often due to possible negative performance impact.3. The most impressive part about esbuild development is not just that it&#39;s one guy writing it: it is the level of support and documentation he manages to provide alongside.The release notes alone are a good course into nitty-gritty details of the web ecosystem: all the addressed edge cases are explained in detail. To top it all off--all opened issues, no matter how uninformed they seem, find a courteous response."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Work on esbuild started at the start of 2020. It is primarily authored and maintained by Evan Wallace, who, in addition to making this tremendous contribution to the JavaScript ecosystem, is the CTO and co-founder of Figma. Incredible output."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bun [1] is a JS bundler based on esbuild’s source, but written in Zig. And it is about 3x faster than esbuild. I think its author Jarred is on HN as well.Probably worth a submission on its own but I am just waiting till it is fully open source.Edit: ( Deleted those Stats, since it may not be a fair comparison and it was probably not meant to be a fair benchmark in the first place. The details are still in the linked tweets. I do not know the author or am I in anyway affiliate with Bun. )I am also wondering how much of those optimisation could be used on ESbuild. Since Rails 7 and Phoenix 1.6 will be using esbuild and not Webpack.[1] https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1390084458724741121"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll admit that I was wrong about GitLab.  I had the chance to invest in them way back in the day, and passed.  My thought at the time was that no open source company had ever been super successful except RedHat, which was more of an outlier than a pattern.  And my other thought was that they are competing against GitHub, which was extremely popular and well funded.I honestly didn&#39;t think they stood a chance.I&#39;m happy to have been proven wrong.  Congrats to the whole team on their successful exit!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work at Uber&#39;s Amsterdam office at a time where the remote nature of the office (from SF HQ) was a struggle for some teams because of strong dependencies on teams located at SF HQ.Sid came to the office and talked to us about some strategies Gitlab used for remote work, timezone differences etc.Not only the talk was very helpful, Sid was an incredibly clear communicator, calm and humble. He really seemed to be a great leader and someone it must be nice working with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Syncthing works brilliantly! The web UI is excellent, warns you when you&#39;re about to do something ill-advised, and stuff like QR codes makes adding clients and folders fairly easy. The separation between folders and devices is handled well. You can easily have half a dozen shared folders between several computers with any mix-and-match combination including which one is &#39;authoritative&#39; and so on.I used to use it on Android to keep my &#39;camera roll&#39; synced to my desktop. I preferred setting the ignore file to exclude android&#39;s thumbnails directory, but otherwise it worked great. I&#39;d take a photo with my phone and almost before I could open the shortcut on the desktop, boom, the photo was there, since the android client detects changes in the filesystem.I also used it to sync my password database, and a cross-platform notebook app&#39;s database. Worked flawlessly for all of them.Ditto for a folder shared between my MacOS laptop and Windows desktop.Lots of controls, especially in the forked android client. Don&#39;t want the sync client to run on any network other than your home network? Done. Don&#39;t want your syncthing clients to try and do NAT transversal / discovery outside whatever network it&#39;s on? No problem.The biggest bummer is that there&#39;s no iOS client. Had to switch to Nextcloud, which so far has been working OK, but the number of people that have problems with the iOS client is quite high (problems such as syncs being so slow it takes days to sync a camera roll), and it&#39;s generally sluggish and doesn&#39;t work in the background (yes, I know, Apple&#39;s fault.) However, Nextcloud does allow me to sync contacts and calendars (I think. I haven&#39;t tried to set it up yet.)One warning: Sycnthing really does not like it when you delete the dotfile folder inside the shared folder(s). Don&#39;t do that :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have switched from Nextcloud to Syncthing. The former was a resource hog that was eating up too much everything on my modest VPS.I share the files on my local network at home between phone, laptop and desktop. My only issues so far:- I need to manually start Syncthing on the devices, whereas Nextcloud was always running on boot. Not sure if I should start it every time, especially on the Android phone which cannot sync while away from home. I do not want to empty the battery while outside of my LAN, + the persistent notification &#34;Syncthing is running&#34; is annoying.- I need to power up at least the laptop or desktop to backup my phone data. One solution that I will try is to install a headless Syncthing instance on my NAS. This way the phone can always sync to the NAS every time, and then laptop/desktop can sync from NAS when needed.The joys of peer2peer! At least, I am sure that my moderately sensitive files are not leaving my local network to be stored on my VPS, which can be hacked someday.I also need to figure out how to install Wireguard on my router to allow to access my NAS from my phone while on a trip, but that&#39;s another story."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a funny story about this plugin.The team I was working on was developing a new product with the word &#39;cloud&#39; in the name.  We were deploying database changes to facilitate the new product.  This was a long time ago, and the organization still deployed things by hand, so there was no tooling for us to automate the deployment.  Part of the deployment process involved pasting some SQL to create the tables and populate the initial data into a JIRA ticket for an administrator to run in production.Said administrator was a fan of the cloud-to-butt plugin, and dutifully copied and pasted the SQL that they saw, like we instructed.  When our code failed, an inspection of the production database revealed the culprit.  Fortunately, &#39;cloud&#39; and &#39;butt&#39; are close to each other, alphabetically, so we didn&#39;t need to search very long.We never let that admin live that down."</p>

No sorting is needed and it seems that for more practical puzzles this gives smaller state. All move operations are still easy to implement."</p>

A colleague tells you this e.g. monitor is perfect for your line of work so you get it and find it also good. No fuss, nothing nerve wracking, no time wasted. Compared with reading through dozens of reviews that even when authentic raise good points that are maybe entirely irrelevant to you.I try to buy stuff in shops now. It&#39;s more expensive only if my time spent on reading reviews is free. And these days it&#39;s not even more expensive to buy in real shops anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a rule, I always check the four, three, and two star reviews since they have the least propensity for a scammer to create and waste time.  1 and 5 star reviews usually are an inane mix of &#34;They&#39;re TERRIBLE&#34; or &#34;FANTASTIC&#34; with no additional information, whereas the 2,3, and 4 star reviews will normally go into specifics that warranted the stars being removed.  Not only that, but they are normally much fewer in number meaning that a sufficiently popular location with real reviewers will have enough 2, 3, and 4 star reviews to give me a relatively transparent view of the good and the bad that I can read quickly.  Mixed into this analysis is to scan for made points rather than worry about the star rating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a small side project (a Google Docs plugin) that makes a trickle of money. One of my competitors launched one day and somehow they had 10 5-star reviews already, but the gSuite marketplace said they had only 3 users. One of those users had the same name as the author, but wrote their review as if they&#39;d just stumbled upon it that day. Another literally had the name &#34;Fiverr User&#34; on their Google account next to their review.I think this has become so common that many people assume it&#39;s a necessity of doing business. Maybe it is. Since I don&#39;t depend on my project to survive, I choose not to do these things, or even to give discounts to incentivize reviews. Many platforms don&#39;t care at all, and don&#39;t even try to combat fake reviews.EDIT: Another thing worth mentioning: the natural review rate for these plugins is really low. Maybe half a percent of users leave any kind of review, at least in my experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Germany Amazon pressured third-party sellers to use their fulfillment/warehousing service, which would reveal to them where those sellers source their goods from. They then just went to those sources and offered them a better deal, cutting out the third-party seller. So basically third-party sellers are doing free market research for Amazon: They take on the entrepreneurial risk and if they&#39;re successful Amazon will know exactly how many goods they sell to which customers and from who they get those goods. They can then use that information in their own product strategy and simply take over the business of their most profitable sellers. Really clever strategy IMHO, albeit not very fair."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The grocery stores I visit do the same in the Netherlands, maybe even worse, especially the biggest one here, Albert Hein (Ahold), is very skilled at it. They copy the most popular products, sell them slightly cheaper, similar designs as the most popular brand, then go on and display their products at eye height and move the big brands down. Yet every court case against them they&#39;ve won. And the sentiment is far less negative about them than Amazon. They have a similar significant market share (35% of grocery market) as Amazon here. Maybe in the end, it&#39;s slightly more ethical since their strategy is mostly at the cost of the big corporates (Unilever) who can handle and fight them and not the smaller companies; and arguably, the consumer wins in the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this shocking to anyone? I don&#39;t mean to sound cynical but I thought we already knew this. It is fairly obvious if you search anything and the first product is a Amazon Basic product that they are toying with the results. There is no way a Amazon Basic product is the #1 in every category there is one. Just search &#34;batteries&#34; in Amazon Canada, Duracell has 30k reviews and 5/5, the only reason it is &#34;above&#34; Amazon Basic is because they pay (sponsored). A regular search shows two Amazon Basic listings (AA and AAA) both have less rating (4.8/5 versus 5/5) and reviews then the Duracell equivalents. Quiet clearly rigged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"APT&#39;s progress bar does have issues though. When you shrink the terminal when the progress bar is visible, you&#39;re going to have gibberish in the terminal. That&#39;s because the terminal commands to move the cursor by lines work on visual lines, not semantic lines, so they aren&#39;t invariant under the operation of resizing the terminal window. That&#39;s a really rough area of Linux terminals: when you resize a window, the terminal is going to rewrap the lines according to semantic lines (based on line feed characters), so it&#39;s clear that all major terminals understand this distinction, but the terminal API doesn&#39;t give applications access to moving by semantic lines, so we&#39;re left with bugs like these.I think PowerShell has the concept of progress reporting specially recognized? That sounds like a good idea. It could be used to render a GUI progress bar and leave the pipeline alone, for the objects. That&#39;s just my vague idea, since I didn&#39;t spend much time with PowerShell."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s good to know the underlying low-level terminal commands that make this work like this article explains. But I guess most people will use a terminal abstraction library that has a higher level API to move the cursor, clean the screen etc.Terminals are complex beasts and they can do powerful things. If you&#39;re interested in this, I can recommend reading the source code for Tmux, JLine3 and some other libraries shell formatting or TUI libraries."</p>

Those of us between midnight and noon are on the &#34;front&#34; side of the planet at the earth moves around the sun.  That is why most are seen in the early morning.  They are still there during daylight but we are less likely to see them.  After noon we are moving onto the &#34;lee&#34; side, the back side of the planet that gets less meteors.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Technically, when someone does a Google search for “Williams Sonoma Cast Iron Skillet,” they probably would have clicked on one of the first 10 organic results, EVERY ONE OF WHICH leads to their website. But, y’know what ol’ Billy Ma’s performance marketers couldn’t then do: prove their value to their bosses.&gt; [picture of that search term and williams sonoma ads with shopping links]The main problem here is that if Williams Sonoma was not advertising on that search term, Lodge and Food52 etc etc would, and then those companies would be above the Williams Sonoma organic placements.The spend is necessary in a defensive way because Google creates a bidding war even for the hyper relevant.edit: I just checked and if you search &#34;williams sonoma skillet&#34;, if WS was not paying for [green] then the very first &#34;result&#34; (ad) would be Food52 [red] https://imgur.com/a/9Nnxs6hI just tried &#34;airbnb paris&#34; and the first result is, somewhat predictably, an ad that is not airbnb. But the second one is also an ad, this time from airbnb. So they clearly didn&#39;t keep their spend dialed down to zero, and are aware of the need to advertise on their own keyword."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many holes in these arguments that you could drive a truck through it. Which is so infuriating, because a big part of my professional career consisted of watching all of Rand&#39;s SEO videos and really appreciating them. I really thought he was a genius. But then over the past few years, he started sharing more general views on entrepreneurship, and those takeaways just didn&#39;t really make much sense. Basically, his own VC-funded company turned into a shit show and suddenly he started advocating against VC in general (as opposed to taking an honest look at the mistakes that his company made). So in the past few years, I tried to reconcile in my head: how can a genius make such imperfect conclusions? My initial takeaway was that he&#39;s blinded by his own mistakes and shifting the blame, which seems perfectly reasonable and understandable. Frankly, I would probably feel and act the same way.But after reading this article, it finally dawned on me. He makes imperfect conclusions in everything he touches, it&#39;s just that in some fields those conclusions can be more easily proved to be wrong than in others. SEO is the perfect field where a polished presenter can get away with imperfect conclusions for years - trust me, I know, I made a living for years in this field, and I am very familiar with the nature of this work. Most of the time, you have no idea what the black box really does, and instead you&#39;re just trying to guess what might have happened. Most importantly, there are many ways to skin a cat in SEO, and just because your approach is net positive doesn&#39;t mean that you truly are delivering the global maximum (or that the net positive gain was ROI positive). In short, it&#39;s impossible to know who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong, and Rand&#39;s videos convinced me that he&#39;s right, but I am no longer sure. I just rewatched one of them, and can easily see how his conclusions are just... opinions.While we may or may never find out if his SEO opinions were the global maximum, we can quantifiably demonstrate that his opinions on content marketing are not solid. This whole essay he wrote can be replaced with &#34;hey performance marketers, don&#39;t trust the platform numbers and instead do your incrementality studies.&#34; Platforms like Facebook will give you those for free if you reach a certain spend level, and you can also get them from 3rd party providers like measured.com. In other words, if you&#39;re a performance marketer and you&#39;re not conducting incrementality studies, then you&#39;re very early in your career and are not following the best practices. Simple as that - no need to extrapolate from there and reach all sorts of additional conclusions (which is obviously a pattern in Rand&#39;s behavior) - calling into question a perfectly investable marketing channel, conflating the needs of a public company with everyone else&#39;s needs, using words like scam, etc.I am really disappointed to have to write this, but you would have been better off not reading this article. If Rand is really advocating that the majority of entrepreneurs should follow his advice and focus on PR instead of performance marketing, then perhaps an honest thing to ask would be - how is that working out for his own company? AFAIK, SparkToro is nowhere close to replicating the growth of his previous company, which is honestly disappointing for someone with such a huge reach and name recognition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at one company several years ago and made two big changes to digital advertising:#1 - Eliminated all paid search other than some limited branded search terms and shifted all the money to affiliates who were way better at making profits on the keywords we were competing on#2 - Eliminated all display advertising after running numerous experiments showing it provided almost not incremental conversions, even though the platforms happily took credit for them.Those two things drove our blended CAC down substantially and by building better affiliate relationships, sales actually increased.The lesson here is that you need to try a lot of things out and you should be continuously questioning what you&#39;re doing and running specific experiments to gut check effectiveness of any ad platform that is slapping cookies on wide groups of users and claiming conversions.My suspicion is that this is near impossible at any large organization, even one as new as Airbnb. I can just imagine someone walking into a team of 20+ performance marketers and suggesting they need to experiment to determine if any of it is remotely effective. COVID forced them into this but it&#39;s something that they should have already been doing.I also suspect that the top line focus/obsession of most VC-backed companies make this type of exercise seem almost counterintuitive. Don&#39;t mess with or question the momentum."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The idea of implementing a CPU core inside an FPGA is not new, of course.Indeed. I took a computer engineering class in undergrad. The capstone project was implementing from scratch a multi-pipeline RISC CPU (including the ALU and a very basic L1 cache) in Verilog that we flashed to FPGAs that we then programmed to play checkers using hand-compiled C. The FPGA was easier to flash and debug than the Spartan-6 mentioned in TFA but was significantly more expensive as well.It was a brutal class, but it totally demystified computers and the whole industry in a way that made me feel like I really could understand the &#34;whole&#34; stack.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best cold starts are those which aren&#39;t noticed by the user. For my blog search (which runs on Lambda), I found a nice way of achieving that [1]: as soon as a user puts the focus to the input field for the search text, this will already submit a &#34;ping&#34; request to Lambda. Then, when they submit the actual query itself, they will hit the already running Lambda most of the times.And, as others said, assigning more RAM to your Lambda than it actually may need itself, will also help with cold start times, as this increases the assigned CPU shares, too.[1] https://www.morling.dev/blog/how-i-built-a-serverless-search..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience with cold starts in Azure Functions Serverless is pretty awful. Like most other Azure services, their affordable consumer grade offerings are designed from the ground up not to be good enough for &#34;serious&#34; use.Cold start times compared to Lambda are worse, and in addition, we would get random 404s which do not appear in any logs; inspecting these 404s indicated they were emitted by nginx, leading me to believe that the ultimate container endpoint was killed for whatever reason but that fact didn&#39;t make it back to the router, which attempted and failed to reach the function.Of course the cold start and 404 are mitigated if you pay for the premium serverless or just host their middleware on their own App Service plans (basically VMs)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my last job we built an entire API on top of serverless. One of the things we had to figure out was this cold start time. If a user were to hit an endpoint for the first time, it would take 2x as long as it normally would at first. To combat this we wrote a &#34;runWarm&#34; function that kept the API alive at all times.Sure kind of defeats the purpose of serverless but hey, enterprise software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s good to see Balena getting some attention - it&#39;s a really nice way of deploying containerised software to embedded devices, and managing them in the field. I&#39;ve been using the free tier for managing a couple of rpis I have round the house in a reproducible way.It&#39;s basically a whole platform built around docker-compose, so you write a compose file for your different applications and then can deploy it to any embedded Linux computer running the Balena OS. Balena manage all the complicated stuff around rolling out updates, keeping the OS up to date, logging etc, and give some nice debug tooling. The other nice thing about the platform is that it&#39;s almost all open source - so if Balena the organisation goes bust or changes strategy, Balena the IoT management service could be self hosted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Working in IT/tech for school district is the worst. My experience from many years ago - around 2002, I think:1. First day on the job, email to boss: &#34;Hey, the computer lab at Springfield High has a ton of known security flaws that are begging to be exploited.&#34;2. Reply, 1 week later: &#34;Sorry, we don&#39;t have any money for that. Just keep everything up-and-running.&#34;3. 3 weeks later the computer lab at Springfield High got &#34;hacked&#34;. All the computers displayed a popup window that said, &#34;Miss Krabappel is a dyke!&#34; (sorry for the offensive language)4. Next day, email from boss: &#34;The computer lab at Springfield High was hacked! Figure out how to fix this and make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again!&#34;5. A few days later Miss Krabappel filed to sue the school district. The local newspaper picked up the story.6. Email from boss, in full panic mode: &#34;I need you to figure out who hacked the computer lab at Springfield High so we can report him to the police!&#34;7. A week later an independent consulting firm was brought in to help identify the person behind the &#34;hack&#34;. I heard they were paid $50K and found nothing. However, the kid got ratted out when he told all his friends. (It wasn&#39;t Bart Simpson! ;) )8. Several weeks later: meeting to discuss working with a consulting firm that&#39;s gonna fix all the security issues because the current staff (me and my team) lacks the skills.9. About 6 months later, I quit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds of me my school leaving prank. I rewrote the whole internet on my school&#39;s computers. Google&#39;s logo became &#34;Leavers &#39;08&#34;, Facebook became &#34;Hatebook&#34; and was red, YouTube only played videos of cats, amongst other things.These were the days when nothing had SSL, so you could just intercept and rewrite traffic!My only requirement was: do no actual damageIt was implemented as a Debian live CD that you could drop into any school computer. It would boot up, then Ettercap would MITM the whole network by spoofing the router. It routed all HTTP traffic via Squid and a custom ICAP server that did the actual rewriting. If you removed the live CDs, the network just went back to normal within a couple of minutes.Routing the whole school&#39;s network through one old Pentium machine wouldn&#39;t work though, so I figured out a way of doing distributed load balancing: it would do the ARP spoofing slowly and randomly. So, as you added more machines, it would just magically balance between them.It worked great for about an hour then whole network mysteriously stopped working for the rest of the day. I left all the live CDs in the computers as a calling card.Sorry, school network admins."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Three things are remarkable about this, and make it a happy story.First, that the pranksters were so egregiously responsible in the way they went about it. They avoided disrupting any actual educational activities; it was meant to be harmless fun, not vandalism. No harm came to anything here.Second, that they documented their findings to the administration as part of the action, including recommendations for improvements.Third, the administration took this as exactly that: a harmless prank by smart, ethical kids who ALSO did them a favor by pointing out the vulnerabilities. If the admin had a panicked fit about this, they could have made it an ugly situation.My educational experience was populated far more by &#34;freak out and yell&#34; types than this school district, which was a shame."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dropping by to express healthy interest in this project.Rancher have a pretty good track record so far:  - the Rancher platform itself (https://rancher.com/) is a really powerful and user friendly way to manage container clusters of all sorts, giving you a self-hosted dashboard for both your cloud and on prem clusters, for a variety of Kubernetes distributions; you can even manage the available drivers and also create deployments graphically
  - the K3s distribution (https://k3s.io/) is in my eyes one of the best ways to run Kubernetes yourself, both in development environments and production ones. I benchmarked K3s alongside Docker Swarm as a part of my Master&#39;s thesis and it was surprising to see that its overhead was actually very close to that of Docker Swarm (a more lightweight orchestrator that&#39;s included with Docker and uses the Docker Compose format), only exceeding it by a few hundred MB with similar deployments being active, making K3s passable for small nodes

As for this particular project, it&#39;s very positive to see that it supports all of the big OSes, even though the 0.6.0 version tag would still advise caution for a while, even though it can definitely be considered as a replacement for Docker Desktop.Admittedly, it&#39;s also nice to see that Docker and the ecosystem around it is still supported and is alive and kicking, since for many projects out there it&#39;s a perfectly serviceable stack with tools that a lot of people will be familiar with, as opposed to having to migrate to podman, while it&#39;s still becoming more and more stable, yet isn&#39;t quite there yet. Now, that may be a controversial take, and Docker Inc also have their fair share of challenges, about which there was a very nice writeup here: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3632142/how-docker-broke-i..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me say it; I love to see it. There&#39;s just something that strikes me as harmfully greedy about the idea of &#34;Docker, a gajillion dollar company.&#34;  There&#39;s just no way that THAT kind of service could be tweaked to return that much to stakeholders without seriously screwing up the experience for people who need it to just work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was amazed by the news at first, but seeing it again, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a direct replacement of Docker Desktop. It makes use of K3s under the hood, which is lighter than a full-blown Kubernetes, but still quite heavy. My nearly empty K3s cluster is consistently consuming ~10% CPU time on my local machine. This is not acceptable to me, so a proper replacement of Docker Desktop should be more lightweight."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so happy powerful type systems are more popular now. TypeScript bringing a great type system to a language as popular as JS is fantastic. Rust is also a great way to get a great type system while staying in a systems programming and procedural environment. Hell, even python type annotations support union types.I never knew the depth of type systems until the last year when I took a type theory course and a compiler course taught by a man who loved his types. So much power - I can&#39;t wait to see the future of type systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s another. Instead of returning Sometype|undefined from a function which may or may not have a value to return (such as searchCustomer), return Sometype|null.That forces the function to return a value that&#39;s explicitly intended rather than defaulting from a missed out if-else codepath. This is useful since JS is often imperative style code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, this is just laser fusion. One pulse of power. That&#39;s not a power source, even potentially. It&#39;s a lab-sized H-bomb experiment. This isn&#39;t one of the magnetic containment systems achieving ignition and sustaining the reaction. Now that would be an achievement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meta-question about fusion energy -something I don&#39;t understand about the movement. I spent a few years as CTO of a company providing heat-to-electricity plants. We financed and built them off high-heat plants like natural gas turbines. The &#34;fuel&#34; was heat going up the stack - so it was essentially free. We still couldn&#39;t compete with conventional electricity plants, even with a $30/tonne price on carbon in Canada.Geothermal energy is the same: sustainable, long-life electricity with no &#34;fuel&#34; costs, but it costs 2-3x as much to build a geothermal plant (in most areas, depends on geology) as e.g. a natural gas turbine powered plant, so the overall cost of electricity is much higher and you can&#39;t get financing.How is fusion different? The fuel will be free and unlimited, but the &#34;levelized cost of electricity&#34;, dominated by the capital cost of the plant, will still be much higher than other sources of electricity. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a world -- even one where the onerous regulations go away and a  market price on carbon is available -- where the LCOE of fusion power is less than that from natural gas, or even close."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Fusion ignition is the point at which a nuclear fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining. This occurs when the energy being given off by the fusion reactions heats the fuel mass more rapidly than various loss mechanisms cool it.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_ignition"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is discussing the media and government being intentionally vague or even misinformative because they don&#39;t trust the public, but it backfires and causes more distrust. The flip side that wasn&#39;t discussed is the belittling and censoring of voices that were skeptical of the narratives, which engendered even more distrust. Their strategy of information control backfired, and they doubled down. Now we&#39;ve got a huge swath of US citizens that will never take the vaccine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How about the biggest dishonesty - lack of admission that not everyone is at the same risk and that lockdowns have significant irreversible costs for low risk individuals and for society? Young children are not getting critical development years back. Healthy 20 somethings only have limited time to date, party and have fun before being saddled with adult responsibilities forever. Most of shattered local businesses are not coming back. While pandemic was not the only reason for BLM and Jan 6 riots, all the young men not being kept busy and receiving stimulus checks to support unproductive activities was certainly a contributing factor - and the fallout permanently damaged trust we have in each other. What of all the deaths of despair - suicides and drug overdoses? Mixed cancer diagnoses because people were scared to go to see doctor? Plummeting birth rates?All of this adds up to the fact that optimum precautions for an obese 70 year old guy is not a same as for a healthy 19 year old woman, and individuals should have a role in deciding what&#39;s right for them. While vast majority should take a vaccine, there may be a small group for whom it&#39;s a reasonable choice to hold off. Say you are a 19 year old healthy make and your risk from serious vaccine side effects is largest while your risk from COVID-19 is smallest. Plus, you already recovered from COVID during the time Delta variant was common. Are you really bonkers for making a decision either way?Above all, society must not sacrifice its young for those of us who had a chance to live for quite a bit already."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is completely right in that the government at least in the US attempting to downplay, mislead or &#39;avoid panic&#39; absolutely destroyed any credibility and is still suffering from it. Most people are not stupid, if provided with all available information as well as clear statements regarding the reliability of that information and just a clear message saying &#34;hey this is new and we have no idea, we are making our best guess&#34; people will make decent choices. Unfortunately the US decided to torpedo its credibility, and all sides decided to turn it into a political issue which a pandemic should very much not be. All politics all the time and the US is now crippling itself. In the absence of real honest leadership people turned to the loudest voices of the media. Once the people distrust the government and think they are lying its very hard to appeal to their logic again. I am very much not a fan of Bush II but he did it right after 9/11. What he did after though is a topic for another day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A distinction needs to be made clear here with regards to the data being transmitted to Google by LineageOS in this study.In the cited paper (https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Doug.Leith/Android_privacy_report.pd...), the device used to test LineageOS was a Google Pixel 2 running LineageOS 17.1 which also included an installation of OpenGapps 10.0 nano.It&#39;s not the OS that is transmitting the data over to Google, but rather OpenGapps (ie. Google Play). OpenGapps is software that can be optionally installed after the initial installation of LineageOS (but before first boot). A user can still use LineageOS without OpenGapps, though they just won&#39;t have the benefits (and drawbacks) that come with it (such as being able to use apps that require GSF). The user can instead opt for an app manager like F-droid or possibly Aurora Store.In addition, there exists an alternative to OpenGapps called MicroG. This is like Google Play but allows users the option to anonymize themselves. One can find custom LineageOS builds that include MicroG from the MicroG website (as the members of the LineageOS project do not advocate for its use, instead giving preference to OpenGapps). Keep in mind, however, that there are fewer devices supported by those builds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use GraphineOS and LineageOS without Google Play Services. They are great and are suitable replacements for Apple and Google.- Osmand(FOSS) for maps (supports being fully offline!)- Signal and Discord for messaging (Discord is sandboxed)- Newpipe(FOSS) for Youtube- F-droid(FOSS) for my FOSS appstore- APKmirror for the few non-free apps I need- Libretorrent(FOSS) and VLC(FOSS) for watching movies- Firefox(FOSS) and Vanadium(FOSS) for browser- K9 Mail(FOSS) for email- Infinity(FOSS) for Reddit- Secur(FOSS) for 2FA- Taskkeeper(FOSS) for remindersAlmost everything you need is in the F-droid FOSS app repository. It all works, and it works well. You can buy a used Pixel 3a for around $80 on Ebay and have a better experience in every category than iOS, hardware and software.The only limitation is push notifications, which isn&#39;t a problem because FOSS apps like Signal bundle their own notification system that does not use Google Play Services. Discord however, does not get push notifications (which I wouldn&#39;t want anyway)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Android takes snapshots (screenshots) of apps as soon as you switch to another app. When you view the app list, it already has the last view of each app.But the Xiaomi/MIUI Android sends over those screenshots back to the company is new information."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great and points to how solar in some cases already can facilitate continuous operation without the need for refueling of planes, boats, cars, you name it. Expect this to grow as battery and solar cell tech develops further.My favorites atm are the yachts that are capable of sailing just about anywhere in the world without a drop of fuel. The price is prohibitive, but considering that you might not need a house anymore it is actually getting close to possible for a reasonably senior tech employee.[full disclosure: no affiliation]https://www.azura-marine.com/aquanima-45/https://www.silent-yachts.com/silent60/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can understand if a product has limitations, or odd edge cases, but Microsoft MFA is purposefully designed to be user-hostile.Some examples that came up recently in &#34;not corner case&#34; scenarios:1) For tenant-to-tenant guest access, each user must re-register MFA for each tenant they&#39;ve been invited to. So if you already have the Authenticator app installed and configured, it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;ll prompt you to create a new entry each time. I have dozens already and clocking up.2) When logging in to Azure, Microsoft has purposefully added &#34;dark patterns&#34; to hide options related to other, non-Microsoft-Authenticator technologies. They&#39;re available, but they&#39;re always tiny, tiny links squirrelled away so that you&#39;re inexorably lead towards using the Authenticator app. Someone at Redmond really wanted their KPIs met at Yubikey&#39;s expense.3) If you get a new iPhone, unlike everything else on the phone, the Authenticator app will not transfer your MFA registrations. Apple IOS will securely transfer your accounts, passwords, etc... but Authenticator is special. You need to first configure a consumer account(!) to back up your enterprise MFA settings, and then restore them manually. At which point... none of them will work, and you get partial instructions that you can&#39;t follow. If you&#39;ve wiped your old phone (e.g.: trade-in or repair), you are now locked out.All of the above were designed, architected, and developed on purpose. None of these are oversights, bugs, or missing features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything about Microsoft cloud and its ecosystem is broken. I recently signed up for onedrive (microsoft business basic, actually), and I didn&#39;t even know which domain to navigate to. They have a gazillion different URLs, and each of them is different from the other. Here&#39;s a (partial!) list:azure.com onedrive.live.com admin.microsoft.com microsoftonline.com office.com office365.com onedrive.com onmicrosoft.com sharepoint.com windowsazure.comEach one of those portals take you to SOME view of your account with a gazillion settings. Many of them are repeated, and changing it on one portal doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect in others. For example, I enabled 2FA somewhere (and it worked), but going to admin.microsoft.com showed 2FA disabled.Even payments, which every other website seems to have figured out, is broken. There was a recent change in regulations in India for subscriptions on credit cards that allow the customer to control the period of subscription, enabling/disabling, etc. Microsoft of course, hasn&#39;t implemented the changes (despite the regulations being notified in August 2019), and because of that, transactions are being declined.So can I go and make that payment online? Well, no. Your subscription shows up as &#34;expired&#34; because it couldn&#39;t charge your account, and the only option it gives is for you to &#34;reactivate&#34; the account. Great, so I&#39;ll just reactivate. But no, it doesn&#39;t allow you to pay when you reactivate - it&#39;s going to try and charge your credit card again, itself, as a subscription, sometime. And of course, that&#39;s going to fail again. Loop!Addendum:So somehow, with the help of Microsoft support, I manage to sign-up for another subscription with the same licenses for the same cost, and they disable the old one. Great. So this time, it tries to charge my card, fails, but then allows me to &#34;settle&#34; the &#34;overdue&#34; amount manually. I do that, and my account is &#34;active&#34; again!Do they send me a mail saying they&#39;ve received the amount? Nope. Does my Microsoft account billing page show that I&#39;ve made any payment to Microsoft? Nope. The only indication that I&#39;ve made a payment is that my account is active with an expiration date in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So this freaked me out! A week ago I went passwordless with my Microsoft account; which required setting up Microsoft Authenticator. While I was there, I re-evaluated my entire MFA setup:* I had already setup Authy OTP codes, which I was actively using. So I left that alone.* I had already setup an external email. So I left that alone.* I setup Microsoft Authenticator for the first time.* I added a pair of FIDO U2F YubiKeys.* I generated and backed up an account recovery code.* I REMOVED my cell phone number because SMS is not secure.* I did NOT look at my aliases because I wasn&#39;t aware that was even a thing. It&#39;s not part of the Security Dashboard.Here&#39;s what worked: I&#39;ve been able to sign in with Microsoft Authenticator on my phone, the YubiKeys on supported browsers, and receive codes at my external email if neither of aforementioned devices are available. I have noticed that, even though the Authy OTP code is still listed on my Security Dashboard, I can&#39;t trigger a prompt for that code. This isn&#39;t a huge deal, since both Authy and Microsoft Authenticator are on my phone.In reaction to your post, I went and checked out my aliases. My phone number was NOT in there. The only alias I have is my primary Microsoft email. I don&#39;t know if my phone number ever was in there. Perhaps it was, and when I deleted my number from the Security Dashboard it also deleted from the aliases? I don&#39;t know. I do know that there is no phone number listed under my Account Info or Security Dashboard.Thanks for this post. It reminds me just how vested we are on certain accounts; accounts that can disappear in an instant. I hope you get your issues resolved!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks neat. Once upon a time -- back in the 80s -- there was a utility called &#39;learn&#39; that was a Unix command line tutorial. After each lesson, you could do these exercises where you were dropped into a fake shell, replete with fake directories and that, and had to get things into a certain expected state. They were typical business-related tasks, nothing cool and dungeon-y, but I learned my basic Unix commands that way. It&#39;s good to see learning tools like this re-emerge."</p>

People are critical of what it doesn&#39;t do, I&#39;m in awe of what it does do.You&#39;re going to have little two man shops in Africa and Asia cranking these out and changing agriculture in their part of the world.This demonstrates the power of open source.  These engineers are to be commended."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man I remember reading about this in 2011 or so. I&#39;m glad they&#39;re still doing well. It&#39;s an interesting project at the intersection of philanthropic eco-hippies and mechanical engineers which doesn&#39;t seem very common to me.Of course, being older and wiser now I&#39;m less excited about the fantasy of using my brains and grit to rebuild society after the coming apocalypse. And if you are a villager of some description trying to use machinery to improve your prospects you&#39;re probably better off buying something old and used, or cheap and Chinese. Over the last 10 years the number of (mostly Chinese) companies making okay-quality cheap industrial equipment of all types has grown massively, and I&#39;ve seen this equipment being used more and more in the developing world. Cheap is relative, of course, and many places do not make it easy to buy anything due to payment infrastructure, shipping, and customs costs.So on the one hand it&#39;s a bit silly for some guy in Missouri to even consider designing his own bakery oven when you can get them on Alibaba for $500. On the other, it&#39;s very cool and interesting, there&#39;s a lot to learn from the attempt, and there&#39;s a lot of actually useful designs already for certain situations. I wonder how much success they&#39;ve had getting this information out to people who it could actually help?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"i work on heavy equipment such as tractors, diesel trucks and excavators in the USA.  this is an excellent start, but its a long way from a tractor.some of the pitfalls that need to be addressed:&#34;Modular Power Unit&#34; is undefined.  can i run it on white gas? diesel? kerosene? what is the engine displacement? air cooled or liquid? If we mean to say this tractor is all-electric, keep in mind most small farms arent equipped to charge anything more advanced than a cordless drill or flashlight.Cab frame has no safety glass or panels, so the operator enjoys every rock and every tree branch :(.  a shade canopy is a nice add as well.no lights.  this is a nonstarter for every farmer that wakes up at 4 am.quick hoses are nice, but I cant find a PTO knuckle so its restricted to things like lifting and towing (and maybe ripping).  this is okay, but for an un-weatherized vehicle ill need to use barn real-estate to store, its certainly lacking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sheer simplicity of this idea - a 1-bit grid, which you can interact with in real-time - echoes that of Pico-8 [1], a fantasy console with strict limits such that you&#39;re not overwhelmed with ideas, but instead given bounds to play with. Its limits keep it realistic: you can do immensely wondrous things with the console, but its graphic and music style are limited, and as such it provides much more of an incentive to make a game - it&#39;s far less overwhelming, and you can concentrate on fun. But also, it offers a challenge! As you begin to hit the limits, you come up with clever tricks to save space, and because the computer isn&#39;t blisteringly fast, you&#39;re pushing yourself as much as you are the computer.[1]: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.phpBut this checkbox playground would be, in my eyes, an even better virtual console - reduced to the bare minimum of what you could make into a game that can be enjoyed. Provide a nice interface such that the user only has to write the game code, provide events to hook into - start(), frame() and click(x, y) - and this would be an immensely satisfying console to immediately get to work on, as rather than worry about graphics and audio, you&#39;re free to get right into making it fun....also, it&#39;d be an excellent framework for teaching kids how to code! :D"</p>

Maybe we can all aim a little lower (or higher depending on how you see it) now.Thank you Jorg.Our condolences to your loved ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First of all, compassion and condolences for Schilling’s family.Second of all, I had a very recent positive interaction with him.  I recently was in contact with Mr. Schilling to report a bug in CDR tools.  Even though he was (looking back) dying, he was very prompt in replying to me and discussing the bug with me over email.  However, even though I gave him a fix, he was unable to apply it, probably because of his poor health.Thirdly, there is a really serious bug in CDR tools: It will start creating bad timestamps in 2028.  That’s not a typo: 2028 (not 2038).  Because of how ISO 9660 filesystems store timestamps (8-bit number, 0 is 1900), on 2038 (1900 + 128), unless the 8-bit number is explicitly made an unsigned number (assumed with other ISO 9660 implementations), there will be issues with timestamps. [1]A full bug report, complete with a bugfix is here: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=990468A fork of cdrtools with this bug fixed is on GitHub: https://github.com/samboy/iso9660Again, prayers for Schilling’s family, and he was very professional in his interactions with me, even in his final days.[1] The issue is with how Schilling’s CDR tools calculates timezones; the time zone becomes an invalid number starting in 2028."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know as well as anybody that he was a man with strong opinions and a willingness to share them, but he also had a willingness to laugh at himself and his work.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I quit Amazon 3 weeks ago after nearly a decade. Work from home was one of the biggest reasons.In my view, the personality traits that are conducive to promotion up the Amazon leadership ladder are strongly aligned with loving work-from-office. Most people L10 and higher not only don&#39;t understand the desire for permanent work from home, I think maybe they cannot understand it. It&#39;s just too foreign to many of them.The first announcement was &#34;We can&#39;t wait to be back in the office, and we know you can&#39;t either&#34;. Senior engineers started quitting. Then it was &#34;Okay, okay, you can work from home 2-3 days per week, but only with your L10&#39;s approval&#34;. The exodus continued.Now it&#39;s &#34;Fine, you can work from home with your L8&#39;s approval, but you better be ready to show up on 24 hour notice if we say so!&#34;. The biggest benefit of work from home is not needing to commute, and lower cost of living by leaving the HCOL cities.They don&#39;t get it. Other companies do. And anyone who has spent 5 or more years working for Amazon is well-trained enough to get a better paying job with a company that understands the cultural shift that just happened to the developer world.Edit: I know not all developers are anti-office. But for those of us who are, working for people who don&#39;t understand us, who make policies based on what works best for them, is a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Seattle and thus a notable percentage of my social circle works at Amazon.The folks I know who work there were almost entirely all prepared to quit if the company forced their initial &#34;everyone back in the office&#34; requirement, especially in this current job market.It feels rare to see Amazon ever make a change to such a publicly stated policy like this, I can only imagine that the groundswell of feedback from employees was quite startling in how much of a problem their retention would be with such a hard rule."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone on the inside: the title is mostly BS.They are pushing the decision from the L10+ level to the L7/L8 level. But we all know behind the scenes, L7/L8 will be pushed to behave a certain way. If it was truly their choice, those with a strict policy would bleed engineers to the directors with more lax policies, Amazon would not accidentally create a free market within their own company.This is a deflection of blame, and nothing else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Comment from the Southwest Pilots Union...&gt;SWA has claimed that the immediate causes of this weekend’s meltdown were staffing at Jacksonville Center and weather in the southeast U.S., but what was a minor temporary event for other carriers devastated Southwest Airlines because our operation has become brittle and subject to massive failures under the slightest pressure. Our operation and our frontline employees have endured continuous and unending disruptions since the first time our airline made headlines in early June due to widespread IT failures. Our Pilots are tired and frustrated because our operation is running on empty due to a lack of support from the Company.https://www.swapa.org/news/2021/swa-in-the-news/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is currently a major outage at a major part of the infrastructure of our nation, and nobody believes anybody about why.The airline is saying it&#39;s something to do with weather, but somehow they&#39;re the only airline effected.Everybody online seems to the think it&#39;s some sort of labor strike, but the union denies this and nobody can find anywhere where people are planning this.And yet thousands of people are stuck in airports all over the country right now.It just seems like something is going on, and that everybody is lying about it.  Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever really seen anything like this, and it genuinely freaks me out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing stories like this makes me wonder if we&#39;ll ever see a company actually go bust based purely on the instability of its decades-old, duct-taped architecture.I have a relative who works for a large credit card processor running on mainframe systems and I hear over and over again that they&#39;re all retiring and unable to fill the newly opened roles. This problem is compounded by the fact that their offshore contracting firms are cutting back on providing COBOL resources because there&#39;s a lot more money in supplying java/.net/etc. devs. The work culture there sounds so unsustainable and yet they&#39;re one of the largest payment processors in the country. If they were have widespread stability issues like this, things could get interesting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Each time I teach neural nets to an engineer, there&#39;s only a 50% chance they can write down the chain rule. Colah&#39;s blog on backprop used to be my favorite resource to leave them with (https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop).The explanation of the calculus in this tool is equally fantastic. And the art is very cute.There are many ways to skin a cat, of course, but this is as good a tutorial as I&#39;ve seen for getting you through backprop as fast as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think it is a good idea to describe neural networks as a large graph of neurons interacting with each other. It is not really helpful to understand what is going on inside.It is more useful to understand them as a series of transforms that bend and fold the input space, in order to place pairs of similar items close to each other. I would like to see people trying to illustrate that instead.It also has the benefit of making the connection with linear algebra much easier to understand."</p>

It&#39;s written with fairly decent though not always portable Common Lisp, just like most Common Lisp books of the era.It can be read here, in mobi or zipped HTML format: https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/releases/tag/1.1Or here, in PDF: https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/releases/tag/v1.0For a native web copy, abuse Safari Online&#39;s free trial. It&#39;s what I assume everyone else does when they want to read a niche technical book that O&#39;Reilly put out but doesn&#39;t print another run of.Depending on the day, the book ranges anywhere from $2 to $60 on Amazon, used, if you want a hard copy.(Edited to fix the very butchered title that I wrote in error initially.)"</p>

Wow, time does fly!I&#39;ve upvoted 14,129 submissions, here&#39;s the first three:14129. Oct 22, 2009: The “Interview” with Y Combinator That’s Not,  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=92372214128.

Marc 10, 2010: Putting Google to the Test in Translation, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1180926The Asimov entry has my first HN comment ever, with 19 upvotes! How happy I must have been at the time. The crazy thing is that it took me 5 months to upvote three submissions, now I do more than that in my morning round! I must have been more discerning at the time.When I had slightly more than 10,000 links I thought of starting a blog called &#34;The March of the 10,000&#34;, to write about selected bookmarks from my upload list; never got around doing it. I must have been busy accumulating more HN bookmarks :-)"</p>

I can think of a million criticisms to levy against China.However, I feel like a lot of the comments aren&#39;t just criticizing China, they seem to be outright anti-China.I wonder if, in the grand scheme of things, Americans/Westerners might be feeling threatened by the shift in power. I wonder if Americans/Westerners are capable of appreciating the things that China gets right, or does right. I wonder if Americans/Westerners are capable of acknowledging the things that their countries get wrong, or do wrong. I wonder if we here in the West are as fair and balanced as we tend to think.This isn&#39;t merely an academic question, I think it goes to the core of the state of mind that is required to view situations objectively (regardless of whether we might be right or wrong in any specific context).In this case, I&#39;m totally on Wikimedia&#39;s side.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a neat article, but it does have some errors.One subtle point that the post gets wrong:&gt; So where does that come from? The answer is that Python stores everything inside dictionaries associated with each local scope. Which means that every piece of code has its own defined “local scope” which is accessed using locals() inside that code, that contains the values corresponding to each variable name.The dictionary returned by `locals()` is not literally a function&#39;s local namespace, it&#39;s a copy of that namespace. The actual local namespace is an array that is part of the frame object; in this way, references to local variables may happen much more quickly than would be the case if it had to look each variable up in a dictionary every time.One consequence of this is that you can&#39;t mutate the dict returned by `locals()` in order to change the value of a function-local variable.Another, less-subtle error in the post is this:&gt; int is another widely-used, fundamental primitive data type. It’s also the lowest common denominator of 2 other data types: , float and complex. complex is a supertype of float, which, in turn, is a supertype of int.&gt; What this means is that all ints are valid as a float as well as a complex, but not the other way around. Similarly, all floats are also valid as a complex.Oh, no no no. Python integers are arbitrary-precision integers. Floats are IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point values, and as such only support full integer precision up to 2^53. The int type can represent values beyond that range which the float type cannot.And while it is true that the complex type is just two floats stuck together, I would very much not call it a supertype. It performs distinct operations.&gt; Accessing an attribute with obj.x calls the __getattr__ method underneath. Similarly setting a new attribute and deleting an attribute calls __setattr__ and __detattr__ respectively.Attribute lookup in Python is way more complex than this. It&#39;s an enormous tar pit, too much so to detail in this comment, but __getattr__ is most often not involved, and the `object` type doesn&#39;t even have a __getattr__ method."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cute fact about __debug__: it is one of the only ways to get compile-time conditionals in Python. Performing a comparison with `if __debug__:` will output byte code for the ensuing statement if and only if the interpreter is in debug mode - notably, in `-O` mode, it will not even generate a load of __debug__ and a conditional jump, and acts as if the statement didn’t exist at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to this, I highly recommend just reading the codebase. I haven&#39;t written C since college and it&#39;s remarkably readable.I once tried to catalogue all the stdlib operations which release the GIL, meaning if you use only those (well, only those &#34;heavy&#34; bits, you can still use other small blocking glue bits), you can do &#34;real&#34; multithreading.It was a fun exercise!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How do we neuter the power of Twitter mobs? Seems like they can bully and intimidate any organization from universities to corporations to GitHub projects to kowtow to their demands. Their demands are usually to fire, boycott, or boot people with opinions that run afoul of the mob.Not a healthy precedent to set. We will regret this later if we continue down this path."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually it&#39;s not different. University lecturers have been protested or cancelled for decades for reasons unrelated to their topic, usually due to political beliefs or corporate interests that clashed with students&#39; ideals. &#34;Cancel culture&#34; is specifically about &#34;personal&#34; societal reforms, which is what makes it different than the older complaints about general politics.Back in the day it was &#34;edgy&#34; to protest or cancel a speaker due to their support of the Vietnam war. People were just as angry (or more so!) at Vietnam protesters as people are today about &#34;cancel culture&#34; protesters, and vice versa. At the time, it was those young freaks with the long hair who were clearly nuts and extremists and going to erode the country&#39;s moral decency. Counter-culture folk in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s were a tiny but vocal minority of young people who were largely put down for their radical views about war and the environment. It&#39;s only in hindsight that protesting the Vietnam war seems socially acceptable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; John Carlson LectureAs a disclaimer I am against any censorship of academia and think that even Charles Murray should be allowed to speak at a university (assuming he is invited by an academic department or student group) and that the university should never have veto power.However, I think the example in the Atlantic is actually more mild than past cases: the John Carlson Lecture is a general audience talk that the university holds to boost its public image.It’s not an academic talk discussing new research or a political perspective, but rather summarizes ideas for the public. If MIT wants to decide who should give such talks I don’t care.In contrast, if a department or student group wants to invite a specific speaker for a specialized talk about politics, science, math, then the university censoring such discourse is what is truly dangerous.In this light, the cancellation of Milo Yiannopoulos who was invited by the College Republican club is much worse. Even though personally I do not think Yiannopoulos is anything but a provocateur, if someone (group/department) wants to invite him the university should not block him from speaking."</p>

Whatever effort the US spent to slander and discredit Assange does nothing to stop people inspired by him, or motivated by US foreign policy in countries that do not enjoy its favour.  The US seems completely oblivious to the fact that whatever happens to Assange the journalist, it simply isnt enough to curtail the overwhelming cacophony of demand for free and open journalism across the internet.Just let the guy go and focus the money, time, and effort on preventing this in the future.  nearly every major news outlet and journalist all see Assange as a journalist, not a hacker.

You shouldn&#39;t trust any of those blindly, but definitely read through the code; I&#39;m particularly interested in coming up with a list of services and scheduled tasks that can be safely disabled without impacting any of the applications and services I&#39;m using (I want Windows Update, OneDrive, Office, Defender, Store and store apps, MS Account login and Xbox Gaming for example, which most tools want to disable)."</p>

And the user&#39;s password had a digit in it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cannot comment on the long term effect of blue light, but at the very least i experience very significant discomfort when turning off any piece of software that makes the screen a more warm color (for example, f.lux on Windows https://justgetflux.com/ and something like Redshift https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Redshift on *nix), to the point where it makes me avert my gaze.Due to me working primarily as a developer, i don&#39;t always need good color accuracy, so my current settings of screen color warmth are the following:  Day: 4300K
  Sunset: 3000K
  Night: 2550K

In addition to that, i have a few smart lightbulbs that change to a more red color as the night approaches and gently dim more and more when i don&#39;t need to do any reading and just have to walk around the house. Subjectively, i&#39;d say that it&#39;s better for me being able to fall asleep and experience a bit less eye strain (though admittedly, using a computer late into the night is never a good idea).Perhaps the discomfort is just because of eyes having a hard time adjusting to noticeably different lighting conditions, but maybe there&#39;s more to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall that a paper published by Oxford in a journal related to gerontology claimed that blue light accelerated aging of the retina. If I understand correctly, this article doesn&#39;t counter that claim outright, it just didn&#39;t find that risk with the low intensity of blue light coming from a typical monitor.Tangentially related, that same Oxford paper (sorry I don&#39;t have a link and no longer have access to the paper) did however claim that light generated by red LEDs with sufficient intensity to leave a significant persistence effect after 3 minutes of exposure can reverse aging and damage in subjects over 40 years old although the sample size was just a few dozen people IIRC. It does so because somehow the retina&#39;s mitochondrial function is improved by light in the 650nm to 1000nm range.Continuing on this tangent, I am 50 and have been exposing my eyes to red light for 3 minutes a day for many months and feel like my night vision has been restored. If I wake up in the middle of the night I used to see gray noise and now I can see darker black with better contrast. But I may be kidding myself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Headline is incorrect regarding danger to sleep.The study cited[1] regarding sleep only compares regular iPhone usage and iPhone usage with night mode, and found no benefit from the night mode.This is a weak result, since even with night light modes screens still emit a fair amount of blue and green light.[1]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S23527..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all, I work on the VS Code team. This came up the other day in stand up and the initial plan was to deprecate and eventually remove the old setting. Several of us pushed back and said while we may deprecate the setting in favor of something else, the old setting should always be respected due to the sensitivity around telemetry.If there&#39;s any confusion around this messaging it&#39;s because this discussion literally happened 2 days ago. I&#39;ll reopen https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134660 to make sure we clear up confusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft has really been pushing the telemetry lately. Edge phones home far more than any other browser. Windows itself has no way to fully disable data collection (only the option to send &#34;basic&#34; or &#34;full&#34; data, including which websites you visit--oof). If you use Pro and you are enough of a power user to feel comfortable editing registry settings, that&#39;s what is now required to turn telemetry off, and even then it&#39;s hard to know you did it correctly. And this type of tracking is pervasive across the entire Microsoft ecosystem, including within Xbox, Minecraft, Teams, and now VSCode. It&#39;s disappointing to say the least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s worked on multiple power-user GUIs professionally, telemetry can be genuinely useful for improving the product. You can discover features that are never used and should be removed so attention can be focused elsewhere, and others that are used frequently and deserve more attention, and others that users may frequently have trouble with and should be fixed or improved.I&#39;m not saying this justifies dark patterns, and I have no firsthand knowledge of whether Microsoft is exclusively using this data for legitimate purposes. If it were me I&#39;d enable it by default but make it clear and easy to disable for those who care. That said: I don&#39;t think the knee-jerk assumption that this is a wholly evil thing is justified."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;re looking at going even deeper into SSH tunneling and port redirection, I recently made The Cyber Plumber&#39;s Handbook free: https://github.com/opsdisk/the_cyber_plumbers_handbookI made it free to the HN community a few years back [1].  There is a paid interactive lab portion (details in the repo) if you are looking for hands-on experience.Book OverviewThis book is packed with practical and real world examples of SSH tunneling and port redirection in multiple realistic scenarios. It walks you through the basics of SSH tunneling (both local and remote port forwards), SOCKS proxies, port redirection, and how to utilize them with other tools like proxychains, nmap, Metasploit, and web browsers.Advanced topics included SSHing through 4 jump boxes, throwing exploits through SSH tunnels, scanning assets using proxychains and Metasploit&#39;s Meterpreter, browsing the Internet through a SOCKS proxy, utilizing proxychains and nmap to scan targets, and leveraging Metasploit&#39;s Meterpreter portfwd command.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19946941"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can also change/add them after the ssh session has started.This uses the escape mechanism. For help on that, hit return, type &#34;~?&#34; and hit return again.From there you will see that &#34;~#&#34; will list them. And &#34;~C&#34; takes you to a line-oriented command prompt where you can add them.For example, type return &#34;~C&#34;, then at the prompt type &#34;-L1234:localhost:22&#34;. Then in another window, type &#34;telnet localhost 1234&#34;. Then back in the ssh window, type return &#34;~#&#34; and you will see the tunnel being used.Another trick: if you don&#39;t need a shell and only want to forward ports, run &#34;ssh -N&#34; instead of &#34;ssh&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have read far too many ssh tunneling articles and all of them either forget about the bind address or just pretend that the only host that can be tunneled is localhost.The fact is that ssh tunnels are bound to an interface on one side and the other can be any (reachable) host:port.  So if example.com:1234 isn’t reachable from your host network, you can do a local port forward to example.com:1234 from an intermediary host that can reach example.com:1234"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IMHO this is a sensible decision, one that reflects the clear underlying intention of the statute. Article 5(1) of the Directive says:&gt; [certain acts] shall not require authorization by the rightholder where they are necessary for the use of the computer program by the lawful acquirer in accordance with its intended purpose, including for error correction.Essentially, they have ruled that other Articles in the Directive do not supersede this Article, and that reverse engineering to correct an error can be necessary.This court, the CJEU, has good form on sensible decisions regarding computing. For example, SAS vs World Programming (C‑406/10) allowed reverse engineering for interoperability. That case, also, was the court upholding the clear intention of the statute. Moreover there was UsedSoft vs Oracle (C-128/11), allowing the resale of software licences, including the right to download the software where necessary, upon purchasing a second hand licence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My take on this is that Ireland is now willing to come into compliance because post-Brexit, they now have a monopoly on &#34;urban core that could sustain an HQ for multinationals in a natively-English-speaking country in the EU.&#34;In other words, they relied on tax advantages as a differentiator for companies to choose Dublin over London for their EU HQ.  But now, what would you choose if not Dublin?  Obviously Paris and Berlin are candidates but if you&#39;re a straightforward multinational, or certainly a company that is actually based/headquartered in the US, you&#39;re going to experience a lot less of a shock in a natively-English-speaking country.So it seems to be that Dublin wins now, tax advantage or no tax advantage.  Which likely makes drawing the ire of other countries for being a &#34;haven&#34; less worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With Hollywood Accounting[1], you make taxable profits transform into untaxable expenses that you pay to yourself for services you rendered to yourself, and Ireland has been a common destination for this sort of money to flow.  Hollywood accounting can take several forms. In one form,
  a subsidiary is formed to perform a given activity and the
  parent entity will extract money out of the film&#39;s revenue
  in the form of charges for certain &#34;services&#34;. For example,
  a film studio has a distribution arm as a sub-entity, which
  will then charge the studio a &#34;distribution fee&#34; — essentially,
  the studio charging itself a sum it has total control over and
  hence control the profitability report of a project.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accountingEssentially, Apple USA makes billions selling iPhones in the USA, then pays those billions to Apple Ireland for the right to put little Apple logos on iPhones. Likewise, Google USA pays billions in US ad sales profits to Google Ireland for the right to use Google tech for Google search.When the Irish loophole closes I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll think up another &#34;One Weird Trick&#34; to make taxable profits mystically transmute into untaxable expenses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been baffled as to how this is seen as a multi-national issue.  The US could always implement unilateral minimum VAT and profit[3] taxes on corporations forcing them to effectively pay whatever proportion the US demands to continue doing business in the world&#39;s largest consumer market.  Just because you&#39;re only paying 3%[1] profit[3] tax in Bermuda doesn&#39;t mean you can necessarily skate around the remaining 12% when doing business in the US - the US could just pocket that additional 12% if nobody else wanted it.  Implement a policy like that and the competitive tax advantage of havens disappears overnight and all this BS disappears.We[2] have tax loopholes because we want to continue to have tax loopholes.1. BS example I&#39;m unfamiliar with the actual numbers.2. Where &#34;We&#34; is lawmakers or maybe society as a whole as weighted by political power.3. Edited: s/revenue/profit/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Facebook is an abomination which ate up the entire Web in some 3rd-world countries. For many no access to Facebook means loosing connection to everything including services essential for their offline life. Even in a very developed EU country I already happen to face cases when something is only available via Facebook because some companies don&#39;t bother having their own websites/emails/phones (often on purpose - to improve their Facebook rank).This is a very serious problem - hyper-centalization in hands of one corporation which can fail you intentionally or not. Facebook is becoming sort of the Chinese system (AFAIK standard WWW is almost nonexistent in China, they mostly use apps within social networks which are easier for the government to control) for the whole world.Looking more broadly it&#39;s another layer of the malicious trend to wrap the things in more and more layers.First we had native desktop apps (which always could communicate data to network servers). Then we have wrapped the apps in the browser (which essentially is an OS on an OS) but we had our pages on independent servers. Then we invented &#34;social networks&#34; and are putting everything in there.We could just improve desktop apps tech (including discoverability, delivery, interoperability, portability and UI design flexibility) but we chose the browsers. We could stop here, use the standard WWW and improve experience of using RSS/Atom/RDF/XMPP/etc but we gave up our pages/subscriptions/contacts to Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We saw an increase in traffic in all of our portfolio&#39;s mobile games so instead of &#34;News sites saw more traffic because of Facebook was down&#34; it was &#34;People did something else than browse Facebook while Facebook was down&#34;."</p>

It&#39;s not Hong Kong.It&#39;s South Dakota. [1]Former hedge fund manager and financial book author Patrick Boyle explains what these Pandora Papers mean in a video [2].There are rumors and speculations that both the Panama and Pandora Papers leaks were released by the CIA. The leak is so massive and so many entities were hacked that only a nation state could have pulled it off. And given who was and who wasn&#39;t implicated in this and given which news orgs received these papers, it&#39;s pretty obvious that CIA or NSA or some other part of the US IC community was behind these leaks. And none of the media companies are asking the question of who is behind these leaks for a very good reason.Just imagine if Wikileaks had released something like this... all these news orgs would immediately blame it on &#34;russians&#34; and claim it&#39;s all fake.[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/heres-how-states-like-south-...[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INRs9rnciyI"</p>

They published everything they had from previous leaks as far as I know. See herehttps://offshoreleaks.icij.org/The current data leak is a bunch of unprocessed files and emails that would be irresponsible to leak as it could contain private information such as passport scans of no public utility. They said they are in the process of cleaning that data to later make it available."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve said it before, but I&#39;ll throw it in here too -Apple is going to lose this fight in basically every market except the US.It&#39;s very clear that their behavior is rent-seeking.  If their product (the app store) is genuinely better for users &amp; companies - it should be able to out compete other products (alternative app stores) on the platform.Instead they arbitrarily prohibit any competition what-so-ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to point out that if you want to release an app, be it for fun or otherwise, it’s going to cost you 100$ per year to have Apple list it in the app store.One hundred dollars per year for the privilege of them judging your app and maybe even get it rejected.They made tinkering around so ridiculously unattractive, because every app needs a business model (unless you are okay with eating the 100$ every year).There need to be other stores or distribution methods.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I missed this thread completely, but these perceptions have basically been around as long as HN has. I don&#39;t believe the community is less technical than it used to be; if anything, the opposite, actually.If you or anyone wants to see more posts of type X, the best thing to do is to find interesting links of type X and submit them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Software is becoming less and less of a tech industry and more and more commoditized. Very little innovation in the past 5-10 years. Very few successful companies during that time have come about by having incredibly innovative and novel technology - almost all are simply using run of the mill, commoditized technology to solve business problems that they have large domain knowledge of. Given this, it makes total sense that having detailed esoteric technical knowledge is no longer the path to success in 2021, and ultimately, hacker news has always been predominately about one thing - how to get rich. The best methods have simply shifted over the last 15 years from being a tech genius to being technically-proficient domain knowledge expert"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps this goes against most commenters here, but I find HN to be an appropriate mix of both that has not changed much with time. Reading that link of Hacker News from 15 years ago feels little different from what it is today. This contrasts dramatically with the Reddit of 10-15 years ago vs what it is like today.Discussion here is also still very high quality. I find it remarkable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If the bee is placed under federal protection, farmers or developers who harm the insects could face up to $13,000 in fines each time one is killed, Live Science reports.Note that the article identifies systemic causes (use of neonicotinoids, habitat loss) as causes, and correlational evidence (&#34;States with the most significant dip in bee numbers have the largest increase in the use of pesticides like neonicotinoids, insecticides, and fungicides&#34;), but the enforcement mechanism they mention is centered around individual actors after specific killed insects where it&#39;s presumed that attribution is clear. Does this make any kind of sense?1. Would we know when bees are killed? The evidence that we know how to gather, so far as I can tell, is mostly counting live bees, not finding dead ones. Are there examples of small, highly mobile insects with ESA protection where we&#39;re actively seeking out and finding dead individuals?2. Is it typically possible to attribute bee deaths to single actors? If a bumblebee is found at location X, we might guess that it would have ranged over an area with radius r around that (but we&#39;re not sure what its actual territory would have been) which includes N properties, N_d of which have been developed and N_p of which use pesticides, who is responsible?3. And if the best scientific understanding is about broad practices (habitat destruction, pesticide use, ...) am I correct in my belief that we don&#39;t have any real mechanism of holding a class of individuals (e.g. Maine farmers who used neonicotinoids during a given time period) responsible for an impact to a bee population (e.g. it&#39;s estimated by experts to decline 5% in a given year) in the absence of a specific pile of dead bees?With this, as with a number of other large issues, I think we need new concepts around group responsibility. We have a concept of class action lawsuits, where a large group identified by a criteria (e.g. people whose data was exposed by Equifax) can be plaintiffs, because individuals meeting that criteria can elect (or not) to be represented in that group. We do _not_ have a concept of a large group of people identified by a criteria (farms using particular pesticides, developers of properties in the urban-wildland interface) being held responsible for harms that proceed from that criteria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Maine, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, Idaho, North Dakota, Wyoming, and OregonAre the eight states from the title. Though it seems New York should be included since it says &#34;The bumblebee species have declined by 99 percent in New York.&#34;Also noteworthy&gt; In the Midwest and Southeast, population numbers have dropped by more than 50 percent.To nobodies surprise, the culprit is pesticides. Interestingly the west&#39;s bumblee population isn&#39;t listed as being in trouble."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We think with our weak technologies and chemistries that we can play God.However, it is so far from the truth - in an attempt to create more vegetation we have decreased a critical component needed to help said vegetation grow.Technology should be used carefully when in the environment of the unknown. Trials and observations should be conducted in limited capacity with a long window of study. Only then can we know of the consequences for our actions of disrupting naturally evolved and perfected equilibriums - be it that of the Earth or man’s immune system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I paid money to cross the Pacific Ocean on a Maersk line, 300 meter cargo ship (us_en here). Many people asked me if I worked to be on board, and the answer was &#34;no&#34;, Maersk did not allow it.  The officers were mostly East Germans who needed a job, while the strictly segregated, &#34;A-Bs&#34; were almost all Pacific Islanders of some kind. The conditions were clean and professional, but I got the feeling soon that this was not a desirable job. The officers would spend at least 60 days on duty, often more.. without a vacation day, but had a weekly day &#34;off&#34; or two, except the Captain who is technically working at all times.I enjoyed the travel and had a good voyage, with many small things to say about it at another time. As I learn about &#34;business&#34; and the world, I understand more about labor abuses, even with &#34;respectable&#34; companies. And, your outrage does nothing, because people who mistreat others professionally are quite used to the complaining, including yours. I am not at all surprised at this article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ocean is a different place in so many ways.My cousin is a Merchant Marine Engineer. Some big ships can&#39;t leave port without one, yet they are in short supply. So he&#39;s paid a lot per voyage. Two or three multi-week voyages and he&#39;d done working for the year.Early on in his career, an officer would request his passport. To make things go faster in port, all the passports could be presented at once for quicker clearing of customs etc.Of course he learned immediately, this meant he could not leave the ship in foreign port. And the officer sandbagged when he requested his passport back. The result was, he was essentially held captive for several months aboard ship, several times longer than he was contracted for. And the ship could count on having an Engineer for every leg of the journey.Now he knows better, keeps his passport on his person at all times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like many here, I can attribute where I am in life today largely to TI calculator programming. I made many friends on Cemetech with whom I still keep in touch, including a few named in this article.I racked up thousands of posts on the Cemetech and United TI forums and spent countless hours hanging out in the game Blockland which was also popular among those folks in the mid 2000s.To me, one of the most impressive folks in this list is calc84maniac, who joined the scene a year or two after me, but quickly surpassed me in skill, becoming a z80 ASM whiz at the age of ~13 or so, whereas some of the other (very talented) folks were at least STEM university students.I know a few people in this article such as SirCmpwn are on HN, too, so hopefully they chime in this thread.Some of the most memorable things about programming in BASIC on these calculators were the absurd constraints. Your whole program was limited to a few kilobytes. You only had 27 floating point variables, a few lists of floats with a maximum length of 999, no real functions or stack or anything, etc. You’d shave bytes by taking advantage of syntactical quirks that the interpreter happened to accept, like not closing parentheses at the end of a line.I don’t have much of value to add other than expressing some serious nostalgia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since we&#39;re swapping TI calculator stories...In 8th grade Geometry class circa 2007, I had an awesome teacher and loved the subject. I found an extra TI-83+ laying around the house from my brothers. I found a guide online and started building simple programs.A few weeks later, there was a quiz. I asked the teacher if it was permissible to use calculator programs on the quiz. He thought a moment and said it was fine as long as I wrote them myself.So I wrote a very simple program that probably did little more than guide which formula to use in a basic decision tree.It was the hardest quiz of the year, it was just difficult content. My class has 1 A, 1 B, 1 C, and about 23 F&#39;s. I was the B.After that, graphing calculators weren&#39;t allowed.Mad respect for Mr. Gass. He had two Apple IIe&#39;s and had programmed Wheel of Fortune and Jeopard! for review days ahead of tests. He had a couple TV&#39;s around the classroom so everyone could see the game well, and would turn on Bill Cosby during some working sessions because at the time, he was a well respected man.Mrs. Gass was also a math teacher. Some students who had both teachers made shirts which advertised &#34;I passed Gass twice&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ohh, TI stories! Here we go!&#34;Hey, distantaidenn, I wanna talk to you after class.&#34; These were the words of my then high school math teacher. I wasn&#39;t worried, I was a good student. Little did I know, this would shape my career for the next 20 years. When after class came, my teacher handed me a brand spanking new TI-83. &#34;We&#39;re gonna be using these in class from now on. Take this home for the weekend, learn how to use it, and teach the rest of the class.&#34; I held in my excitement, and took the device, along with its 1-inch thick manual.I pored over the manual. Before I knew it, I had mathematical functions dancing across the screen. All of our current math equations set up to accept variables and spit out answers. I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but I was &#34;programming.&#34; I began to dabble in TI-Basic -- I had no idea what it was, but apparently, it was the language this giant calculator used, and I&#39;d have to learn that language to make this machine do my bidding. So I learned it. The next year in school, I signed up for an elective Programming class, and lo and behold, it was in Basic -- I thought to myself, this looks familiar, I know this! I finally made the connection that I had been &#34;programming&#34; the whole time. From then I was hooked.Fast forward to university, I gained a degree that was as far from programming as possible, but I always had my scripts. I was the guy that could talk to computers. I was at home on the command line. And I knew enough html and JS to make a shitty web page, if necessary.And here I am now, still engineering and managing, and making (I&#39;d like to think) not so shitty products for a living."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been thinking about the difference between human users and computational agents. There is a widespread pattern of enforcing that only human users may interact with a service, not computational agents. Running a user-installed extension is one example; additional examples are CAPTCHAs, account verification by phone number, or services which refuse to provide API access such as banks.Sometimes the reason is to protect users (e.g. banks), sometimes to protect the service from abuse. But often the reason is to ensure value can be extracted from users (e.g. serving ad impressions) or the power that can be exerted over users. Regardless, I believe this comes down to power: computer scientists understand that acting through a computational agent is fundamentally more powerful than acting directly as a human user. Computational agents can operate at scale, they provide virtualization (e.g. throwaway identities), and thereby conserve the ultimate scarce resource: our attention. Many systems seem to have computational power asymmetry as their fundamental principle: as little human contact on the system&#39;s side as possible; as much human contact on the user&#39;s side as possible.If there&#39;s any path ahead that avoids a totalitarian nightmare resulting from asymptotic concentration of power, it depends on cultivating a more widespread understanding of computational power and developing new social norms and policies. As a CS educator, this is one of my top priorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I manually unfollowed almost every friend and every page I followed a couple years ago. My feed is now a very limited selection of gaming and media posts that I  enjoy immensely. No politics at all and almost nothing in my feed from actual individuals that I know. I ended up enjoying Facebook again, even if in a very different way.It was a tedious process and a tool like this could help a lot of people find their own value in the platform by getting a fresh start. Sadly, FB has no interest in that and would rather corral us in ways as to maximize their own benefit, not ours."</p>

Incredibly, it doesn&#39;t matter how educated the developer, they still seem to have to learn this lesson themselves, over and over, until it sinks in..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “if they ask about time off in the first interview then they are never going to be there!”The fact that this attitude is common scares me when I&#39;m doing interviews.Time off is incredibly important to me.  What&#39;s the use of making a great income if you can&#39;t get the time off to enjoy it?The culture about the use of PTO varies wildly between companies.  A friend of mine worked somewhere that supposedly gave 20 days PTO per year, but trying to actually use more than a single day at a time was always met with denials, and even if you did take a Friday off, you were expected to work 10 hours/day the other 4 days of that week to make up for it.So yeah, when I&#39;m interviewing, I want to know how much time people are taking off, but I don&#39;t want the interviewer to think I&#39;m lazy and will be trying to avoid work as much as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 10x programmer is a silly myth. The idea that someone can produce in 1 day what another competent, hard working, similarly experienced programmer can produce in 2 weeks is silly.You know, 10x is an optimistic number here. Some programmers will do in 1 day what you wont achieve in a life time. And not understanding that makes you a bad programmer by my book simply because this is the foundation of the job.So let me give one advice: you are not producing code, you are engineering code. Some will find solutions that the others will not find. Thats where the 10x programmer thing come from. The guy who wrote bittorrent said something like the following: &#34;I&#39;ve written bittorrent in a way you would never have thought about&#34;.You think John Carmack was the only one trying to make 3d games when Doom came out? Thousands of programmers where trying to. Does that make him a 10x programmer in your opinion? Or more like a 1000x?"</p>

Something I have never associated with a moth before.Secondly, I found it pretty cool to see how their flight wasn&#39;t as controlled as I had thought of. It looked like a bit of a mess on take off. Again, just disarmed me from the moths I&#39;ve grown to despise flying around the house.Very cool to see them from a different perspective."</p>

Just a slow motion video, no nonsense.Most slow motion videos on youtube has a section on the setup, the  backyard of the producer, the equipment etc. Just give me a slow motion video without all the interruptions.[1]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQL25_hoQ1k"</p>

Bugs are a real weakness for me.I don&#39;t get put off by blood at all. I can handle (and in fact enjoy) gore in movies, horror movies, etc. But man, I don&#39;t know what it is with insects. Their tiny spindly legs, weird beady eyes, the wings, their hair, their antennae. Can&#39;t stand looking at it.Fascinating creatures, but boy do they mess with my mind like nothing else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"LOL !&#34;The chief financial officer is Giancarlo Devasini, a former plastic surgeon from Italy who was once described on Tether’s website as the founder of a successful electronics business.The only reference to him that turned up in a search of Italian newspapers showed he was once fined for selling counterfeit Microsoft software.Elsewhere on the website, there’s a letter from an accounting firm stating that Tether has the reserves to back its coins, along with a pie chart showing that about $30 billion of its dollar holdings are invested in commercial paper—short-term loans to corporations. That would make Tether the seventh-largest holder of such debt, right up there with Charles Schwab and Vanguard Group.To fact-check this claim, a few colleagues and I canvassed Wall Street traders to see if any had seen Tether buying anything. No one had. “It’s a small market with a lot of people who know each other,” said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer of global money markets at Federated Hermes, an asset management company in Pittsburgh. “If there
 were a new entrant, it would be usually very obvious.”&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-my..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand how Tether has survived this long. Bitfinex and Tether sure look transparently like a fraud, all the way back to the &#34;no really we have $1 in the bank for every Tether but you can&#39;t audit us&#34; days. And yet it continues to occupy its role as the underpinning of most cryptocurrency markets. Why hasn&#39;t it blown up yet? My best guess is that it&#39;s useful to everyone taking in money from new retail investors. Also there&#39;s no clear financial incentive for blowing it up; there&#39;s no way to easily short Tether, for instance.This article talks about the way Tether is loaning out what reserves they have. The Economist looked at this phenomenon and found Tether has a 383-to-1 leverage. That&#39;s going to be a complete disaster the moment there&#39;s a major blip in the economy. Say, a major Chinese real estate company going broke. Or interest rates in the West finally going up and causing a market correction. Maybe that&#39;s what will blow it up.The good news is the Economist also thinks the inevitable cryptocurrency disaster will be bad but won&#39;t destroy world economies. &#34; its holders would lose hundreds of billions of dollars but that the fallout would be manageable.&#34; I sure hope that happens before this tower of unregulated investments gets so big that when it falls over it crushes the real economy.But don&#39;t worry folks, this is all good for Bitcoin.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/08/07/why-regulators-..."</p>

Or what is the relationship between the projects and Microsoft/.NET Foundation?Reading the &#34;apology&#34; on github, it seems that .NET Foundation/Microsoft thinks those projects are essentially theirs, and they are free to put them under their enterprise account to &#34;simplify billing&#34;https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/39But reading this article, and the one below, the maintainers think otherwise?https://www.glennwatson.net/posts/dnf-problems-solutionsThere are also some notes about copyright that I don&#39;t understand. Who owns the copyright? Microsoft or the maintainers?edit: From the github &#34;apology&#34;:&gt; Projects might not fully understand what joining the .NET Foundation means. We share a checklist with project maintainers on project changes they accept as part of becoming part of the .NET Foundation. That’s obviously not sufficient. We will post a new document that describes what you can expect when your project joins the .NET Foundation. This will include changes (observable or legal) and new benefits. It will also include changes that could occur later.....ok? That seems scary, coming from Microsoft"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone here old enough to remember when SourceForge was The Place(tm) to stick OSS code and then how it fell from grace?I’m curious in what ways the MicroSoft take over of GitHub is and is not starting to feel like that.For me, one is just the difference in scale. GitHub is vast in both content as well as tooling compared to SourceForge at it’s highest points. And a commercial entity orders of magnitude smaller than MicroSoft took over SF. The rate of descent into Not Good(tm) territory also seems slower and more ponderous.But while the magnitudes differ, the vectors look similar. Not exactly the same, because history rhymes with itself before it repeats itself.Curious what other similarities and dissimilarities other old timers see."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">" Whenever I read news like this I can never figure out what moving a company&#39;s headquarters actually means. Musk has already been living in Texas for a while. Tesla already has sizable operations there (both offices and factories). The company is registered in Delaware, so legally this change means nothing. They aren&#39;t going to fire employees in California or force them to move (in fact Musk said that they will continue to expand their Bay Area staff). They will continue to pay (or not pay) taxes exactly the same as before. So, besides a press release what is the change exactly?It&#39;s also funny that Tesla still can&#39;t sell their cars directly to customers in Texas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The aspect of this case that stands out to me is that copyright is claimed in clothing and fashions:  &#34;counterfeit retailers that sell knock-off dresses using the plaintiffs&#39; copyrighted images&#34;, a claim traditionally well outside copyright, and at best quite grey.  Copyright covers works of original authorship but not either ideas or functional aspects of design.See the strong-IP case from the Copyright Alliance, who can at best muster an &#34;it depends&#34;:There are some mixed messages out there about whether fashion designs are eligible for copyright protection. Some experts would say “no,” others would say “yes,” and they’re both right it depends.https://copyrightalliance.org/education/qa-headlines/copyrig...In the US, such protections are still only at the &#34;being considered&#34; stage as best I can tell:The major amendment, of course, would be the extension of design protection to fashion designs, by amending § 1301(a) to provide that “A fashion design is subject to protection under this chapter” and by amending § 1302(b) to include “an article of apparel” in the definition of “useful articles” subject to protection.https://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat072706.htmlAs the Copyright office&#39;s discussion notes, there are non-expressive protections in the specific case of ship hull designs (also in chip masks).  But fashion itself has remained largely a copyright-free zone.The proposed language did not enter into US law as evideced at Cornell&#39;s USC server:https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1301Cloudflare has secured this round without challenging the copyrightability of the alleged infinged works themselves, but probably also has that arrow in their quivver should they need to invoke it.   The court&#39;s decision here is actually a broader protection for Cloudflare (it would apply against any infringement claim), though it doesn&#39;t invalidate the plaintiff&#39;s IMO questionable fashion-based copyright claims."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I find Backblaze B2 more compelling.... Ok, after writing that, I realized that I should probably look up R2&#39;s offering first. And then my jaw hit the floor at &#34;free egress bandwidth&#34;.Free egress bandwidth? Yes please.I will instantly convert.Then I was worried about price per GB. $0.015/GB is incredibly competitive.Good lord, where do I get early access to this thing? I&#39;d transition all our infra today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO, the best feature Cloudflare added to R2 was the automatic migration. This makes sense for a CDN to offer, but if R2 works, this makes it pretty simple to migrate.&#34;After specifying an existing storage bucket, R2 will serve requests for objects from the existing bucket,&#34;I&#39;ve Beene evaluating R2, but this migration path makes it dead simple to use. I just point my code to read/write from/to R2 instead of S3, and I&#39;ll get egress fees from AWS during the migration, but then that&#39;s it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article touches on the one major unanswered question I have about R2:  CloudFlare&#39;s CDN ToS make it clear CF is meant to host websites and APIs, not content downloads [1].  Does R2 have similar ToS?  It&#39;s reasonable that CF doesn&#39;t want R2 customers that use 500MB of paid storage and 500TB of free bandwidth, so what is acceptable use?[1] The Services are offered primarily as a platform to cache and serve web pages and websites.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We used to call this the &#34;Scunthorpe problem&#34; - how do you filter for obviously rude names while still allowing people to have their actual names? Bearing in mind that some people&#39;s names are actually rude.I worked on the application form processing for the Nectar card launch in the UK back in the early 2000&#39;s, and we had several cases. Luckily we had human data-entry clerks in the loop, so all we had to do was flag when a name contained anything on the &#34;Scunthorpe list&#34; and get a human to look at it. Even then it wasn&#39;t perfect and a few slipped through. One of the early PR messes of the launch was someone getting a Nectar card issued with a rude name, and of course they immediately went to the press with it [0]I&#39;m interested to see they still haven&#39;t solved this [1][0] I never saw the journalistic interest in this: this guy said his name was &lt;rude name&gt;, and then signed the form to say everything on the form was true. Why is anyone surprised or interested that we accepted his name was what he said it was and gave him a card in that name?[1] https://metro.co.uk/2015/02/20/woman-refused-sainsburys-nect..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of the guy that streamed a talking banana on Twitch, where viewers could make it say things. People submitted variations of the n-word and got him banned, and after trying to filter out all character combinations he could think of he wrote a phonetic filter. That apparently worked much better than trying to think of every permutation of characters that sounds like bad words.https://youtu.be/bJ5ppf0po3k?t=715"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had to do this for a link shortening system (to make sure random base64 didn&#39;t contain profanity). It was a pretty fun problem. Not just the implementation, but doing the math to make sure it didn&#39;t make our shortened links easily enumerable. The implementation wasn&#39;t too bad, but we set up logging initially to spit out any random strings it decided to block. I demo&#39;d this in front of the whole company and live tailed the logs and the first one that popped up during the demo was a big ole F bomb. It made for an excellent demo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As much as I loathe the &#34;facebook is a private company that can do whatever they want&#34; argument, I have to admit it applies here. If I owned a store, and some guy kept coming and showing customers how to not spend any money in my store, I&#39;d kick that guy out of my store.I very strongly dislike facebook and can&#39;t wait to watch it die, so I know comparing it to a store is a poor comparison. But at the end of the day, fb is a business, and if someone is using fb to try and hurt their business, they have the right to terminate that guy&#39;s accounts.EDITMy point here is not that we shouldn&#39;t point out bad things facebook does simply because it&#39;s &#34;just business&#34;. I agree that the &#34;they&#39;re a business&#34; argument is just a deflection that derails the conversation into some weird business practice discussion, instead of all the bad things fb does.My point is more that we should try to frame these things so that the headline isn&#39;t &#34;facebook banned me&#34;. They ban people all the time and not that many people seem to care, and in this case, of course they banned this guy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At Kami (kamiapp.com) we had to make a similar transition last year - we&#39;d seen usage grow over 20x in a 6-month period on our classroom product due to the pandemic, and we were storing all our content in a single-primary Postgres database. We had plenty of headroom before but we were suddenly running out of write capacity, even after scaling vertically up to ~150 vcpu. Our workload is super write heavy so scaling out replicas wouldn&#39;t have helped much at all, and I was spending a lot of time manually vacuuming in our daily off-peak as we were burning transaction ids at an astonishing rate, ~800 million per day.I looked at a bunch of options but ultimately managing a sharded database seemed like too much overhead for our small (but expanding!) dev team - so we decided to move our heavily loaded tables to CockroachDB instead, as since it&#39;s mostly Postgres compatible our transition would be easier, and it would be much easier to manage as it automatically balances load and heals. We&#39;re running cockroach on GKE and it&#39;s a really nice fit for running on kubernetes.Ended up working well for us - we still have our smaller tables on PG but we want to move it all to Cockroach over time. There were some teething issues as we learnt what to monitor on it (read amplification is the big one here, though pebble has helped a lot vs the previous rocksdb), and it does need a lot of hardware at high scale (we&#39;re running 50 16-vcpu nodes for it) but overall I&#39;m happy with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great read and primer for anyone looking to shard and know they need scale. Having helped a ton of people shard their data, my advice still remains don&#39;t do it until you know you have to. The old Citus data blog is a great resource for some guidance around best practices and how to&#39;s even if not using Citus.That said some of the things you can do from day 1 make things way easier when the time comes later. Workspace ID/Tenant ID/Customer ID, having your data grouped that way makes it very shardable and saves you a lot of work later on in the case you didn&#39;t have that in your data model.I&#39;m not sure I buy that Citus/Vitess are magic, both are reasonably clear how they work and you can dig into it. At the same time I&#39;d weigh the downsides of Citus (can&#39;t speak to Vitess) in that the online rebalancer isn&#39;t open source so at that point it&#39;s a proprietary product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Notion seems like an interesting data storage problem. The vast majority of the data is in the `block` entity, which are organized into a sort of nested set, written/updated individually (user edits one at a time) but read in ranged chunks (a doc).Off hand this seems like an almost worst case for PG. Since the updates to blocks could contain large data (causing them to be moved often) and there is one big table; it seems likely that the blocks for a single notion document will end up being non-continuous on disk and thus require a lot of IO/memory trashing to read them back out. PG doesn&#39;t have a way to tell it how to organize data on disk so there is no good way around this (CLUSTER doesn&#39;t count, it&#39;s unusable in most use cases).Arm chair engineering of course - but my first thought would be to find another storage system for blocks that better fits the use case and leave the rest in PG. This does introduce other problems, but it just feels like storing data like this in PG is a bad fit. Maybe storing an entire doc&#39;s worth of block entities in a jsonb column would avoid a lot of this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We did this with FreeBSD several years ago at Netflix. We used to run heavily modified -stable kernels.  Our tree was ahead of FreeBSD-current in a lot of ways (TCP, ktls, VM) but way behind in other ways.  Every year or two we&#39;d rebase to a new -stable version, and that would be months of work. Often, there would be some bug introduced upstream many months prior that took weeks to track down because there was just so much to bisect through.  Because our tree was based on -stable, pushing changes upstream often involved porting them to a substantially different codebase in -current, and being unable to test the ported code at scale in production.Since we&#39;ve moved to tracking -current, we rebase every few weeks.  We catch any newly introduced bugs from upstream almost immediately, since there are only a few weeks of changes, not a few years, to sort through.  Its far easier to contribute code upstream.  In fact, we do most development upstream and wait until the next rebase to pick our changes up (or cherry pick them if it is something urgent).All in all, life is much, much, much better on the bleeding edge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You could have editorialized this title to:Rebasing a Linux Kernel Branch that’s Two Years Old and 9k Commits Deep…but you would have had thousands of us running to the bathroom to revisit our last meal.What a Herculean effort by these two engineers.  When your role is to track down fellow employees from completely different teams and crack the, er, carrot to get them to update their patch from two years ago, you can get very tired very quickly.I’m sure the hardware driver modules are fairly self contained but things like the userspace QoS patch could be pretty hairy.  The kind of thing where, for upstream, you’d spend 90% of your time landing a framework just to even be able to implement your feature with the final 10% patch.Oof.  Bravo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this part of the google monrepo? Not that it matters, but I wondered how far monrepo went, inside the tent.I hate to be a pessimist, and I may be simply ignorant of some realities, but it FEELS like this is setting an impossibly high goal. I think there will turn out to be something significant in 9000 variances, which cannot simply be uplifted into mainstream, and which turn out to be hard to maintain as a continual rebase into the emerging mainstream.I agree that 40 sounds low, but probably is a good indication it can work. 1% is within view, if they maintained pace so even on a 1% if the rebase cost can be handled, they can converge but that assumes there isn&#39;t a showbuster in the 9000."</p>

There are times where I&#39;ll leave a tab in the background that I don&#39;t want refreshed but when it gets unloaded, poof, I lose the original data from that page.I know about Chrome and its ability to prevent discards, but I want this to be the default or at least a toggle option.

I saw a lot of interesting things during my time, but I can&#39;t recall seeing a payment database next to a source code repo.Did their s3 bucket get popped or something?Even if their github enterprise got popped, that doesn&#39;t explain that streamer payouts down to the dollar were leaked. &#34;Oh yeah, I commit all my stripe data into github.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is somewhat hilarious. Just 5 days ago I was complaining about Twitch’s new &#34;Only verified users&#34; setting which requires me to give them my phone number. One of the reasons I said I’ll not do that was &#34;hacks, leaks&#34;. And now this. Sure, I’ll give you my phone number to add TOTP (Why even?) after I’ve just been shown how secure that data is."</p>

And the profile&#39;s state would be like nothing changes. Nothing. Completely.- You&#39;ll contact Support. Seriously? They&#39;ll ignore you.- Maybe some interaction with 3rd-party websites triggered 
cancellation of the process, you thought.- Then, you&#39;ll implement blacklist just to avoid any interaction with facebook, something similar to: https://pastebin.com/FAV2f9eA and try to repeat the flow again.- Then another 2+ years later situation will repeat again. Deja-vu. And again. And again.There&#39;s no way to delete facebook profile if facebook didn&#39;t really care about its users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got rid of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp about 4 years ago. Facebook and Instagram was easy, but people who have WhatsApp really think you’re weird for not having it.Deleting WhatsApp, while annoying for me personally, has resulted in many people I know joining Signal or Telegram — the network effect can be broken by being belligerent.If you don’t want to have a conversation about why you deleted WhatsApp, simply say it’s a moral issue, nobody wants to know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the time tech companies have their fans and detractors. In virtually any discussion about tech companies, you’ll find people for the company in question, and others against, Apple and Google are great examples.I find it interesting that I don’t think I’ve ever come across any discussion about Facebook (and I read a lot of them) where anyone is defending them. Either people are strongly against the company, or at most they admit grudgingly that they do use Facebook services because everyone else they know uses it.The only people I ever hear championing Facebook are Zuckerberg and other top management.I don’t have a Facebook account, so possibly all the positive discussion is on Facebook itself and I’m not seeing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a pretty thorough and high profile hack on a major tech company - this isn&#39;t something I&#39;d expect from an Amazon owned property. The hack (allegedly, I haven&#39;t downloaded it) includes* Entire git histories* Internal/Private AWS SDKs* Encrypted Password dumps and payout reportsIt&#39;s so comprehensive I&#39;m very curious into how an attacker got that level of access. I can&#39;t think of another, large, corporate web 2.0 startup who&#39;s gotten owned in a similar fashion. Could the same attack work on Amazon? YouTube?It&#39;s also strange that someone who has this level of access to what is presumably a multi-billion dollar company decided to just leak the data? Maybe they did try to ransom it, but I&#39;d imagine someone with this kind of access inside Twitch must have had some creative way of making money."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I raised over 400k for Andrew&#39;s POTUS run and devoted a year of my life to running his official Reddit (104k subs at peak), then joined a SuperPAC to further his positions after the run.The campaign team was full of fools who squandered almost every good turn received, most campaign workers were paid less than minimum wage, and Andrew eventually stole the pac&#39;s name and branding - Humanity Forward - put everyone out of a job, and then did basically nothing with the organization.I&#39;ve given so much time to this person it&#39;s insane.  He&#39;s not trustworthy, he&#39;s a horrible manager of people, and he never pays off on what he promises.  Just dip your toes into YangGang social media and see how his former fans act now, or the stories of abuse within the campaigns that Andrew hardly acknowledged.Inspiring message, but I&#39;ve been close enough to the sausage factory to know it&#39;s fluff.Beware.  If you are interested in this endevour do the best you can to build your own power base, do no rely on Andrew&#39;s circle to help you in any way other than a retweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s missing here, IMO, is a party. Who&#39;s with him? Do you have defectors from the 2 parties? Independents or popular figures joining up? Candidates being stood?A political party is not a manifesto, it&#39;s an organisation.I actually think there&#39;s room for a party to start gaining ground in the US. There are so many elected offices that  the surface area is huge. Great for &#34;guerilla tactics.&#34; IE, earning easy victories by picking the battle..Maybe your pick a thousand low key positions, and work on them. Standing a thousand candidates with success, even if the offices are minor, makes you a full fledged party by default.Uncompetitive regional strongholds, are another opportunity. You could split the large party&#39;s vote and earn immediate relevance. You could even split the small party&#39;s vote and try to steal 2nd place. That might make you one half of a dichotomy the next time. You could run candidates in republican or democratic primaries. The primary electoral system is diverse, so you can choose to do this where it has a chance.So, where&#39;s the party? Who&#39;s running? Where/what? Who else is involved?A political manifesto is OK, I guess. A party manifesto... that would be a lot more interesting. What are you planning to do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The top line, &#34;Not Left. Not Right. Forward.&#34; kind of reminds me of Macron&#39;s &#34;En Marche&#34; (&#34;Let&#39;s Go&#34;) that took over France in a storm, taking over the presidency AND the parliament only one year after its foundation, with very few previously known political figures in its ranks.The whole thing looked like doing management rather than politics, and offered an alternative to fed-up voters who didn&#39;t dare turn to the usual far-right and far-left &#34;protest votes&#34;.Headed with a nimble tactical vision, the formula was extremely efficient... for one mandate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This took about a year and a half – a little over a year coding in between experiments and training.It&#39;s a chess engine with a primary neural network just like AlphaZero or Leela Chess Zero&#39;s, but it adds on a secondary &#34;commentary decoder&#34; network based on Transformer architecture to comment on positions and moves. All of the code and data for training and search is from scratch, although it does use Stockfish code to generate legal moves and manage chess positions.You can watch it play on Lichess here: https://lichess.org/@/PlayChessCoach/tv or challenge it here: https://lichess.org/?user=PlayChessCoach#friend, and see its commentary in spectator chat. It only plays one game at a time, so you may need to wait a little bit. It&#39;s fairly strong (~3450 rating, roughly on par with Stockfish 12 or SlowChess Blitz 2.7), but you can set up a position when challenging it so that it&#39;s missing a couple pawns or a piece (Variant: From Position).I ended up writing much more about it than I expected.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really think that action changes attitude faster than attitude changes action. Learning this the hard way in my 40s, it&#39;s been really life changing for me. Particularly when you&#39;re depressed, demotivated, find yourself procrastinating, etc.You can try this yourself -- the next time you&#39;re feeling demotivated, start with the smallest amount of tiny measurable action. If you can&#39;t get out of bed, move your fingers, shake your head, work your way up to standing up, walking, leaving your house, and very slowly building momentum.If you&#39;re procrastinating about work, start with opening up a terminal, launch your editor, write one tiny snippet of code that just compiles, add another snippet, build momentum.You&#39;ll find yourself making excuses, telling yourself that none of this matters, or that you&#39;re too tired, or that you&#39;re not in the mood. Accept the thoughts and push through the actions.Very quickly, as the dopamine hits from these tiny successes arrive, you&#39;ll find your attitude changing, and this turns into a feedback loop where you end up performing more actions, further improving your mood and attitude."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alternative take: in the hiring process education is often used as a proxy for motivation, when actually it only proves that once upon a time someone was motivated long enough to get educated, but it doesn&#39;t actually say anything about their present state in terms of motivation.A &#39;Do-er&#39; is at least at present motivated, and educating them will get them to the desired combination of education+motivation in the present, even if that education is going to be by necessity a very narrow one (typically: job specific).Being hungry for money and creature comforts also tends to be conflated with being motivated (&#39;ambitious&#39;), but it doesn&#39;t really align well because once financial success (for some very modest success) is attained the motivation will vanish. That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, but it tends to confuse people who were not aware of the driving power being the outwardly visible motivation.The movie &#39;Rush&#39; has a nice bit about that, James Hunt just wants to be WDC, once. He doesn&#39;t care about anything past that point because it will give him what he wants. But until he&#39;s got it he will be super motivated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think he&#39;s likely to trigger a lot of ire with this tweet.  However, given what I know about his history, I think I know where this is coming from.  Carmack himself did not finish school and was motivated early on to get involved in the profession of writing software despite lacking official credentials which entitled him to do so.  I have a similar story and can relate.  Therefore, I think what he&#39;s getting at is that it&#39;s important to just get started on something without waiting until you think you&#39;re &#34;allowed&#34; to.  This quality of being a &#34;doer&#34; can stand out in colleagues.  But of course there are many sides to the story.  I don&#39;t think he meant to discount the others.Update: I want to add that I think I recall being aware of figures like Carmack in my teenage years.  Knowing of people like him, who were making lives for themselves by actively pursuing their interests, is I think a huge part of why I got involved in software early on in high school.  It was a way for weird kids like me to have a sense of self-worth and accomplishment even if we were getting bad grades in more traditional subjects like &#34;World History&#34; or &#34;Social Studies&#34; on account of just not fitting in.  And it was also at a time (in the 90s) when the economy highly valued such people going into the dot com bubble.  So this tweet doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.  I think the historical context I&#39;ve given here probably describes Carmack&#39;s life as well and is really relevant in understanding his statement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m having a hard time reconciling all this right now.  On the one hand, from the outside, I can see the actions that Facebook takes and they seem awfully guilty of what they are accused of.  But on the other hand, I personally know and have previously worked with some of the people who work on trust and safety, specifically for kids.  Good people who have kids of their own and who care about protecting people, especially children.The best I can come up with is that Facebook is so big that the &#34;evil&#34; is an emergent property of all the different things that are happening.  It&#39;s so big no one can comprehend the big picture of it all, so while the individuals involved have good intentions with what they are working on, the sum total of all employees&#39; intentions ends up broken.So maybe Zuck is telling the truth here, that they are trying to fix all this.

There isn&#39;t a single damned thing that can change your picture of it being the absolute greatest thing ever.&gt; We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health.What you care about, and what you say you care about, are nothing compared to your actions.&gt; It&#39;s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives.We don&#39;t know your motives, other than the obvious ones. We know your actions.&gt; At the most basic level, I think most of us just don&#39;t recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted.That&#39;s because you live in a big dumb bubble where chat apps are somehow world-changing innovations and creepy stalker behavior is completely fine to you. You are out of touch and people are screaming it at you. You think you are entitled to encroach on everyone&#39;s private lives, intermediate on every interaction and mine it for vulnerabilities to auction off to advertisers. Your entire model of the world is broken, Mark. No wonder nothing makes sense.Stopped reading after this point. I&#39;m sick of billionaires with megaphones blaring their virtues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And if social media were as responsible for polarizing society as some people claim, then why are we seeing polarization increase in the US while it stays flat or declines in many countries with just as heavy use of social media around the world?That&#39;s a point I&#39;ve made myself before, and I think there is some truth to it. Social media can&#39;t explain the high and increasing degree of US political polarisation, because other countries (including other English-speaking countries) consume social media about as much and yet have less polarisation, and don&#39;t show the same degree of increase in it either. The real explanation must lie in other aspects of US culture, or the US political system"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In a Ponzi scheme, a fraudulent perpetrator takes your money (and the money of many others), gives some of that to early dropouts but takes the rest for himself. Ponzi schemers profit from lying to you where your money goes.With a decentralized digital asset there is no sole person or company that profits from just lying to you about where your Dollar goes in exchange for digitals. Sure, miners and exchanges make profits based on fees when Bitcoin is created or sold, respectively — but they are only being rewarded for their legitimate efforts required to maintain and sell a digital currency. They do not pretend making your money work for you by some magical scheme.This whole confusion stems from a rather vague understanding of what the subjective theory of value means: Goods and services provided by humans have no intrinsic value but become precious simply there being demand by other humans. Gold can become worthless if nobody wants or needs it anymore. A stupid trading card may cost thousands of dollars costing pennies to make but is sought after by enough collectors. Edit: Yes, Bitcoins are just numbers stored in a computer memory around the world but so is software. And software ain’t cheap.While Bitcoin‘s value might be grossly overestimated due to rampant speculation but even then, these speculators are no victims in an investment fraud but they truly believe that Bitcoin will become much more useful in the future. They may be wrong but, currently, nobody knows. Only the future will show.Edit: Typos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the &#34;Common Objections&#34; relate to the REASONS people choose to own Bitcoin and how those cases make it a Ponzi.There are many different reasons to own Bitcoin, however the author seems to only view it through the lens of someone living in a wealthy and developed country with financial stability.The properties of it being difficult/impossible to confiscate and its privacy make it valuable in oppressive regimes. A refugee could store their wealth in Bitcoin, leave their country, settle somewhere else, and access their Bitcoin without the risk of it being confiscated during the journey, because they can simply memorise the seed phrase (24 words).It&#39;s predictable issuance schedule also makes it valuable in countries suffering from high inflation or hyper-inflation.This is a good article to rethink the use cases of Bitcoin: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/check-your-financial-pri...Alex Gladstein works for the Human Rights Foundation and does lots of good work in Bitcoin advocacy. His other articles are worth checking out.And the data backs this up. Some of the biggest growth in Bitcoin users around the world have been in places around Africa and Vietnam who are subject to some of the situations mentioned above.Do you think these people see Bitcoin as a &#34;Ponzi&#34;? Do you think they care if such a definition doesn&#39;t change the properties they find useful/valuable?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Nevertheless, investing in gold at the current price seems unwise, since its price is many times its &#34;natural&#34; price as commodity and so it is more likely to go down than up.This is a misconception and a fundamental misunderstanding of gold&#39;s primary utility for thousands of years.While it is true that gold&#39;s price reflects a significant premium beyond the &#34;natural&#34; market price, this has been the case for millennia. Since ancient times, most demand for gold has not been for industrial uses or jewelry, but rather as a store of a value. This results in gold having a &#34;monetary premium&#34;.It&#39;s also worth mentioning that it is no coincidence that humans happened to chose gold as money. Among all chemical elements, gold has a favorable combination of chemical properties and rarity in the earth&#39;s crust that make it a suitable choice for storing value over long periods of time. In fact, nearly all gold mined in human history is still around today. We&#39;ve been hoarding it since the time of the pharaohs.I&#39;m sympathetic to crypto skepticism, but I&#39;m afraid many people are missing the forest for the trees. I&#39;m curious for those that still truly believe Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme or a bubble - at what price point and time would you start to consider that you may be tragically wrong?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of people are choosing to ignore that a lot of companies have done things in the past that were not illegal at the time of action. However, those actions were later decided to be made illegal because the behavior was deemed to be antithetical to our values.For example, Standard Oil did not break any laws in its ruthless consolidation of the nascent oil industry.  In fact, it exploited the law to allow it to grow into the monstrosity that it eventually became.  In response, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 which subsequently prevented the actions that Standard Oil had used to consolidate the market.There should be no question, that what FB is doing here, while not illegal, is highly dubious ethically."</p>

There’s a deeper problem here, and it feels more like the powers that he want to take down FB.I’m not denying any allegation made against FB, but why is it that Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, and Hollywood get a pass when they’ve been damaging America for much longer than FB has existed?If the government sees a problem and wants to get involved - great. But let’s hold an equal bar."</p>

This was totally different from any other hearing I&#39;ve seen -- little grandstanding, no partisan bickering, no evading of questions. Most of the Senators seemed genuinely interested in what Frances had to say, and she gave meaningful insights backed by real data.A lot of what she&#39;s saying is stuff that has been generally known in the tech industry for some time -- that algorithmic content ranking amplifies division and outrage. But the detail she gave about actual research quantifying it goes way deeper than I think most of us were aware of.https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/10/protecting%20kids%20..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is silly but sort of relevant.During college junior year (1993) as a physics major I took a class in digital electronics (which included 68000 assembler programming). We had a lab contest to create the fastest sorting routine for a set of random unique numbers between x and y.I won the contest by setting to 0 a y-x register range of memory and then inserting each number into the range based on the number itself (&#34;27&#34; into register 27, &#34;18&#34; into register 18, etc.). Then I printed out all non-zero numbers in the range.The other 20 or so students did versions of bubble-sorting and called my solution a cheat. The professor defended my victory as I had not broken any of the rules of the contest..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"High level description of why it sorts:The inner loop takes an array and an index i in the array, and rearranges the array to put the largest value at index i. This is done in such a way that if the sub-array up to but not including i is sorted, then afterwords the sort will be extended such that the sub-array up to and including i will be sorted.The outer loop says, just call in to the inner loop with i from 1 to n. This will result in a sorted array, because the initial array of a single element is trivially sorted, and then we&#39;ll have by the sort-extension property of the inner loop that the progressively larger sub-arrays of 2, 3, ... up to N elements become sorted.You can see that the inner loop has the sort extension property by thinking about two cases.Case 1: If the i-th element is already larger than all previous elements, it won&#39;t touch any of the elements before i, and will only potentially make the i-th element bigger, thus clearly extending the sort though the i-th element.Case 2: If the i-th element is smaller than one of the previous elements, it won&#39;t touch any elements until reaching that smaller element; then it will start a series of swaps until it reaches index i, at which point the the original value of the i-th elment is left inserted in sorted position into the sub-array up to and including i. So at this moment we have the sort extension property. From there, it may increase the value of the i-th element and change later elements, but of both those will preserve the sub-array sort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"[Edit: I took a quick glance at the paper and got carried away; the rest of this comment is about a different algorithm apparently known as &#34;exchange sort&#34;, and an interesting property of it. The algorithm in the paper is actually different, and indeed more surprising.]Hey! That&#39;s my sorting algorithm! (Well, I&#39;m sure it has been independently discovered many times, but one of those times was by me before I had learned of O(n log n) sorting; I used it many times including in the INOI 2004 programming contest, about which I asked the following question ten years ago in 2011 on math.SE about this algorithm and Catalan numbers, a truly surprising property that is not mentioned in this paper: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/36022/how-do-the-ca...&gt; For situations where a quadratic-time sorting algorithm is fast enough, I usually use the following:    //Given array a[1], ... a[n]
    for i = 1 to n:
        for j = i+1 to n:
            if a[i] &gt; a[j]:
                swap(a[i],a[j])

&gt; It looks like bubble sort, but is closer to selection sort. It is easy to see why it works: in each iteration of the outer loop, `a[i]` is set to be the smallest element of `a[i…n]`.----Also: A few years ago I emailed Prof. Richard Stanley of Enumerative Combinatorics fame asking whether it was related to any of the hundreds of problems in his Catalan Numbers list, and he said he didn&#39;t know a direct connection at the time (so maybe it&#39;s an addition to his list?):&gt; &gt; permutations equal to the product of all their inversions (in lexicographic order) [multiplying on the left]&gt; Example: The permutation 1423 has two inversions (24) and (34), and the product (34)(24) is the same as 1423.&gt; Non-example: The permutation 3412 has four inversions (13), (14), (23) and (24), and the product (24)(23)(14)(13) is 4321 which is not the same as 3412.&gt; Among the permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4}, there are 14 examples (and 10 non-examples).And 14 is C_4, the fourth Catalan number."</p>

She said she &#39;loves&#39; Facebook, and wants to fix it, not harm it.I don&#39;t want Facebook fixed and I do want Facebook harmed. I don&#39;t want the government to meddle with what types of things people can say online, I want them to ban the business model of stalking people online and selling intimate details of their lives. If the problem is Facebook choosing profits over public good, then cut off the profits. This is obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to imagine there are a bunch of Facebook Homefeed engineers out there who ran dozens experiments, tuning this-and-that, and found the ones that boosted revenue, and user engagement by X%. No one thought too deeply at _why_ some experiments were successful. Perhaps it was chalked up as &#34;our new ML model is matching users to content they care about more efficiently&#34;. Then they shipped it, and everyone celebrated their success.My theory is that experiment dashboards, data visualizations, and &#34;metrics&#34; allow employees to almost fully disassociate from their product, and the end users. Engineers at large companies don&#39;t need to use, or even be familiar with the products they spend all day building. Yes, leadership and small pockets (researchers) can see the full picture. Everyone else stays willfully in the dark, doesn&#39;t look too closely, and clocks out at 5 happy because their dashboards look good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me this is a fake story being promoted as a way to further a political narrative.Nothing the whistleblower has revealed is shocking or previously unknown.  Yes facebook tweaks an algorithm on your news feed to drive engagement and make money.Yes facebook allows some content that some would consider not to align with mainstream US narratives.My two cents this is an attempt to force facebook to kowtow to the US and follow googles lead in stopping “unapproved” discourse on topics dealing with covid among others."</p>

2) what if I lived in multiple states?
3) what if i…And on and on.And it’s not just one and done. Every year IRS and states are changing their shit so you have to go thru and make all kind of updates and verifications every year.It takes an army to build and maintain.  Generally not the kind of thing for open source (unless they’re paid).  But then what’s the point?  One may say it’s more transparent, but TurboTax etc are transparent with their formulas - you can check every box they fill in for you.I think the only thing that can really disrupt this dynamic are “free” commercial software (like credit karma now cash app), or government provided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real problem here is that Intuit and other companies lobby millions to maintain their status quo. The right thing to do would be to put every single dollar spent on these corporations into a government program that develops this kind of software or even does the taxes for you (this already exists in many countries in the EU.) Instead, in the US, you pay for Turbotax, they make a profit out if it, and then they use part of the money to lobby and keep the tax code and system rigged for their own benefit. I don&#39;t know if open source software is the solution here -- and as far as I know, the tax forms change every year, so it will be forever playing catch-up -- but it seems to be missing the point entirely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep being perplexed by how the Americans do stuff. I am Dutch and my government makes it (relatively) easy to do taxes. We got a website we can go to; it&#39;s filled by the government and we just need to verify that it is filled correctly and then click submit. Some people can make adjustments where needed and if needed. You can also let an accountant do it for you but that is optional; but useful if you have had a turbulent year that makes takes more difficult (like selling and buying a new house). 
When they did not use a website (a few years back) they offered a downloadable application that was available under Windows, MacOS and Linux (GTK). It worked fine."</p>

In addition, it is managed by an ASC, the “ANS”, which needs to be brought up before NVMe can work, and that also relies on a companion “SART” driver, which is like a minimal IOMMU.Stuff like this makes me wonder: why does Apple do this?  If I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, I can assume that these changes are done for performance, cost, power-saving, or maybe even security reasons.  Otherwise it just seems like Apple does these things in order to make it harder for other OSes to run on their hardware.  Which is certainly their prerogative, but it just makes me think less of them.On the other hand, this is really cool:&gt; However, Apple is unique in putting emphasis in keeping hardware interfaces compatible across SoC generations – the UART hardware in the M1 dates back to the original iPhone! This means we are in a unique position to be able to try writing drivers that will not only work for the M1, but may work –unchanged– on future chips as well.... but cynically (or perhaps just realistically), I can easily believe that this isn&#39;t done for reasons of openness, but because this makes maintenance of macOS itself easier for Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Asahi Linux progress reports rank up there with Dolphin[1] progress reports for being excellent examples of technical writing as well as simply reminding me why I fell in love with computers in the first place. Love reading this stuff even if I may never use it (although I would love to run Linux on M1 hardware someday!).[1] https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if Alyssa (or other devs that took a deeper look at the DCP) have any idea why the builtin HDMI port of the Mac Mini would not send DDC messages to the connected monitor.I’ve been struggling with this in Lunar (https://lunar.fyi) for a long time and while I tried my best by comparing ioreg dumps and looking at the DCP driver in IDA, I couldn’t find any obvious logic would block this communication voluntarily.I should mention that on M1, the DDC messages are sent to the monitor by calling IOAVServiceWriteI2C on the DCPAVServiceProxy of the monitor as seen here: https://gist.github.com/alin23/b476a02a8cd298436848e28476aed...I’m thinking that this logic might either exist in the DCP firmware which is not accessible from userspace, or it might just be a side effect of some out of spec behavior that the HDMI port might have."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s technically not a conflict of interest, as long as the revenue streams roll through different offices or partners. /sOr as McKinsey puts it&gt; &#34;across more than a decade of service to the FDA, we have been fully transparent that we serve pharmaceutical and medical device companies. McKinsey’s work with the FDA helped improve the agency’s effectiveness through organizational, resourcing, business process, operational, digital, and technology improvements. To achieve its mission, the government regularly seeks support from additional experts who understand both the government’s mission and the industries’ practices. We take seriously our commitment to avoid conflicts and to serve the best interests of the FDA.&#34;In practice, just another example of questionable behaviour from McKinsey"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet McKinsey also never told the Department of Transportation that it was working for both the DoT and major car manufacturers.Executives senior enough to approve hiring McKinsey to study something, whether they&#39;re F500 CEOs or government agency heads, know full well that the top consulting firms are all advising their competitors, counterparties, and regulators/regulatees. The facts reported in this article would indeed be scandalous if they included evidence that the FDA team at McK was tipping the pharma teams on private FDA plans or discussions, but that is not the case. If anything, this case is merely illustrative of why major consulting firms have borderline-paranoid cultural norms around never discussing client work outside of the respective client team, even (and especially) to one&#39;s own colleagues at the firm who are not staffed on said team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I see McKinsey on someone&#39;s resume, it&#39;s a huge red flag. Similar to &#34;Head of marketing for children&#39;s sales at Phillip Morris&#34;. Sure, all companies do some bad things, but the complete lack of ethics required to succeed at McKinsey is next-level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting bit on recovery w.r.t. the electrical grid&gt; flipping our services back on all at once could potentially cause a new round of crashes due to a surge in traffic. Individual data centers were reporting dips in power usage in the range of tens of megawatts, and suddenly reversing such a dip in power consumption could put everything from electrical systems ...I wish there was a bit more detail in here.  What&#39;s the worst case there?  Brownouts, exploding transformers?  Or less catastrophic?"</p>

You can read HN in read-only mode if you log out. Should be way faster."</p>

Side effect: you improve responsiveness for everyone!"</p>
