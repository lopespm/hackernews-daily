								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool. Seeing these beautiful colors I realize how much how I imagine the ancient world is shaped by museum artifacts and photos in textbooks, which show raw and brown/grey/white stones, rusty tools and weapons. I&#39;ve grown thinking about pre-medieval times as a landscape of ruins. It would be like if future humans were picturing our current world as nothing but bombed cities.It&#39;s a really cool project. Now I want a VR game where I could simply walk around ancient cities and watch people go about their day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very curious to see what the long term effects of unionizing will be in Academia. I&#39;m hopeful and optimistic it will improve things in the long run. Yes there will be some unintended consequences but academic life is already very rough if you&#39;re not tenured.Academia likes to cast itself as a true meritocracy. If you work hard and publish good papers you&#39;ll do well. In practice it&#39;s more of a gerontocracy where senior members  can single handedly destroy a young investigators career. (It happened to me and I saw it happen to several people). There is little to no recourse against this.Arguments against unionization from already tenured faculty usually sound like: &#34;If you want to be the best in your field you have to work harder than everyone else. Forming a union won&#39;t change that fact and may even discourage students from working so hard. This might interfere with their career goals.&#34;However, the power structures in academia are heavily skewed and toxic. Individually graduate students have little recourse when they are wronged. Life in academia is hard. You have to work long days, the chance of success is very low. At every stage the probability of getting that next job is very low.A lot of the field agrees that something needs to change, but no one can agree exactly what needs to change or how to get there.  The people with the power are the tenured professors who &#34;won the lottery&#34; and are out of touch with the problems they are causing. They aren&#39;t going to be the mechanism of change even though they hold all the power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a graduate student with a research assistantship position at the University of Washington in the mid 2000s, a few years after they unionized and got a contract with the UAW.By the time I was there, even though it was only a few years after the union struggle, I didn&#39;t hear much about the union, at least in my department.But what I knew it meant was: we had good health insurance, we had a guaranteed minimum stipend, we had the right to actually take vacation during university vacations, and a certain number of sick days. I knew from talking to oother students, that before the union contract, grad students with assistantships didn&#39;t necessarily have these things (it depended on department), and sometimes literally got no vacation or allowed sick leave at all.I was aware of no ways that the presence of a graduate student union harmed the grad students involved -- to the contrary of some suppositions in this thread. Grad student unions exist in dozens of universities, some for years now, so it&#39;s possible to look at actual experiences, not just forecasting supposition. I was also aware of no ways the union harmed research or academics at the university (beyond of course costing them more money to treat the grad students right).I wonder if a few years after I left, most grad students even realized what the union had won for them. The union was not very visible, once the fight for a contract was over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the UK, most students are members of their universitys&#39; branch of the National Union of Students.[1]The unions have a big presence on campus and a bar with heavily discounted drinks and organise a lot of the social clubs and events that happen outside of the study.They also negotiate with the university and faculty, fighting for students, and you can get individual advise and help too.Enrolling to the student union usual happens almost automatically when you turn up and register for your dorm, classes and doctors etc.The staff of the university (academics, lecturers, trainers, instructors, researchers, etc) tend to belong to The University and College Union.[2]I didn&#39;t know this was abnormal in other countries?[1] https://www.nus.org.uk/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone interested in learning more about partial reprogramming, I recently wrote a review article on the current state of the art: https://www.adanguyenx.com/blog/partial-reprogrammingIn short, we&#39;re still far away from using it in humans (10+ years). Currently, all companies working on this are in pre-clinical stage, with turn.bio as the closest, expecting to go into clinical trials late this year.This tech is exciting but there are still a lot of limitations:- Risk of cancer: this technology is based on the work of Yamanaka in 2006, who discovered 4 factors that can turn any cells into pluripotent stem cells. The work in the OP article basically used the same 4 factors, but only partially, so that the cells became &#34;younger&#34; without losing their identities (i.e. turning into stem cells). This requires understanding the right dosage for every cell type so we don&#39;t go overboard and turn them into dedifferentiated cells which could lead to cancer- Cell specificity, microenvironment, etc.: reprogramming is finicky and the right dosage is dependent on the cell type or the environment around the cells. This is important because you have to figure out the right dosage for each cell type so as to avoid cancer- Delivery: it&#39;s easy to deliver gene therapy to skin cells on a dish, not so much to other cell types or organs in the bodies -- that&#39;s why we have not seen very impressive results when this is used on live normal mice"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a Chinese, I can say that the situation is worse than it in the article. My brother is a student who lives in a flat and has not eaten for two days and no one has brought basic substances. He can&#39;t leave the flat, he turns to his tutor but his tutor is also forced to stay at home (eating instant noodles every day). We are worried about him but there is nothing we can do, if we criticise the government on chinese Twitter we will be arrested by the police. ಥ_ಥ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; People are finding out that state media exists not for accurate news, but only to spin reality into a narrative that fits the powers higher up.Are people really finding that out only now? I thought that this was generally accepted knowledge even in China, despite the constant fear and propaganda they live with.What&#39;s happening now with the strict lockdowns and zero-Covid policy is inhumane. People are literally prisoners in their own homes and anyone in a position of power will abuse it to avoid hurting their social score. What a fucked up situation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Based in Shanghai since 2014, I can share some details on why it feels so unbearable to be here right now.Firstly, the totalitarian government have never been good at communicating anything except propaganda. So on one hand we&#39;re inundated with &#34;Go Shanghai!&#34; and how brave volunteers distribute food, on the other hand, we&#39;re completely in the dark about what&#39;s going on. Goalposts are being moved daily, rumors proliferate, and things change every day, adding a lot of stress to an already suboptimal situation.Second, I can confirm that the food situation is extremely bad. We are a family of two, and always been kind of preppers, so we had many bags of rice, pasta, dehydrated veg, frozen meats in our large fridge. Chinese society, en masse, is much more used to just ordering food daily. Many people never cook. It&#39;s cheaper this way (though of course the quality varies). Bigger families with aunties who can cook just used to pop by the local wet market daily and get a bag of fresh produce. Many households might not even have a fridge at all, or have a small one.The government was saying that &#34;there will be no lockdown&#34;, and when the lockdown became imminent, people barely had two days to stock up. Queues, fights, empty shelves everywhere. More stress.A lot of people in our community do not have any food left, and we&#39;ve received two government issued &#34;rations&#34; so far (in 12 days of lockdown): one with 5 tomatoes, and one with 3 pounds of chicken drumsticks, 3 potatoes, 1 head of cauliflower, and a bunch of rotten lettuce. If we did not stock up, we would be starving right now. We donated quite a bit of food to our neighbors already, and many people are actually very close to having no food at all. Getting a delivery is almost impossible, group orders organized by compounds are often ridiculously overpriced, and not always work out. Scams are emerging.Thirdly, I understand the author&#39;s frustration with the guards (&#34;baoan&#34;). Those people never had any formal power, but now they &#34;run things&#34; and, for many, the newly obtained power went to their heads. Violence and abuse is abound. We have PCR tests every 1-2 days, sometimes at 6am, some compounds at 3am. People dragged from their beds and forced to stand in queues.How would you respond to all that?Yes, it has some potential to save lives, but if it was communicated better, if we had more time to prepare, and they could still run food deliveries, nobody would complain that much. It&#39;s terribly mismanaged, and even after we &#34;open up&#34;, I will strongly reconsider staying here. Omicron will return, and I do not want to be here for the next (and next, and next) lockdown."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really happy to see this on the front page!One thing to keep in mind if you&#39;re interested in joining: the Digital Corps is for early career technologists, so if you have much experience in tech, you might want to apply to USDS (https://www.usds.gov) or 18F (https://18f.gsa.gov) instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Public sector IT was an extremely frustrating experience for me.- incompetent administration (org flow chart, constantly changing paradigms, misnomers (&#34;open source&#34; == we tape together stuff from public git-repositories, push nothing upstream, and outsource lots of core development))- administration&#39;s priorities change with every election (project funding as a flag in the wind depending on current political climate)- red tape everywhere- bureaucrats everywhere- the whole job-stack attracted incompetent people, the kind that values stability over deep understanding and progress. the kind where I thought &#34;man, good that they are working here in [$current_politically_opportune_project] so they can&#39;t do actual damage somewhere else&#34;. this applied for the business administrators, the project managers, the &#34;developers&#34;, the admins, even a large part of the contractors.- &#34;you&#39;re working too fast! haven&#39;t been here for long, eh?&#34;- compliance &gt; securityNever, ever ever ever again. Granted, this was in Europe, maybe the US sucks less in the public sector. I would bet a good amount of money that there is a large intersection of problem spaces among the regions though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like that the Digital Corps exists in theory. I applied many moons ago, I believe during the Obama administration. Service to our country is something I feel is important so I applied to at least see if there was a fit.When I got to the phone screen, I made a point to ask if recreational cannabis would disqualify you from joining and they confirmed that yes, even if it was recreationally used, a positive cannabis result on a drug test would disqualify you.Major bummer, but unsurprising. The entire reason I asked was due to how many posts on HN I’ve seen about government agencies having a hard time hiring tech folks for this reason. I have what I believe to be a decently desirable skillset and a lot of tangible experience working in startups AND enterprise companies, and if I had to guess, would have brought some good value to the team.I hope (but doubt) these policies have relaxed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe they have overestimated the cost of using 3.5&#34; floppies, probably to make themselves look better by comparison.They give the cost as $211,172, but that&#39;s the cost to buy a 1 TiB pack of floppies. Their own storage cost is per-month, so to get the equivalent cost for floppies you need to also divide by the expected useful lifetime of a floppy disk. I did a web search for &#34;floppy disk lifetime&#34; and the internet [1] told me &#34;I’ve seen numbers saying the lifespan of floppy disks is three to five years. But I’ve also seen numbers that claim they can last ten to twenty years or even indefinitely.&#34;If you assume floppy disks have an expected lifetime of 5 years, you can amortise the cost across that time, bringing the cost per TiB-month down to a nice reasonable $3,520.[1] https://blog.storagecraft.com/data-storage-lifespan/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can remember that there was a vibrant community of Flash game developers before the demise of Flash (EOL December 2020, the date of its “demise” is debatable). There’s not really a replacement for Flash and the community kind of fragmented.That said, my impression is that a big chunk of talent from the Flash community went to work on HaXe. These are people who make games and want tools to make game development easier—as opposed to people who get excited about engines, architectural patterns, and programming languages. Just as a general impression, based on people I’ve recognized working with HaXe."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written a couple side project games in Heaps and I&#39;m a big fan.If you&#39;re familiar with Pixi.js, Heaps and it&#39;s language, Haxe, will feel very similar. Haxe is a pretty cool language, it&#39;s similar to TypeScript but compiles to native binaries for almost all major game consoles.Heaps was apparently the framework behind Dead Cells if that says anything about the level of polish you can accomplish with this set of tools."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are new to the Haxe or game development world I would advise against Heaps as the documentation is pretty bare bones. Haxeflixel [0] is one that is prominently recommended for good reason. Heaps is still great regardless and I have used it for a few private projects.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Keep in mind that a substantial portion of users now use ad blockers such that a lot of URLs used for analytics like this are blocked.Consequently, you can&#39;t actually expect to capture 100% of these analytics events nor even expect the percentage captured to stay the same over time since the filter lists are very regularly updated and users enable/disable different ad blockers over time.More broadly speaking, once you have sent a webpage to the user, you should not expect anything from the user&#39;s browser. They may or may not allow whatever arbitrary JS you have on the page. They may even intentionally give you bad data (e.g. hijack the payload to give you intentionally malformed data).edit: even more broadly speaking, there&#39;s additional reasons why you can&#39;t expect to receive these kinds of callbacks: consider what happens if a user loses connectivity between loading the page and them navigating away (e.g. their phone loses service because they went into an elevator before navigating away)"</p>

When something as seemingly innocent as a link can &#34;stealthily&#34; do something else when it&#39;s clicked, but otherwise looks exactly the same as a benign one (and moreover, behaves entirely as expected with JS off), it really brings into question whose interests such features are designed to serve."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi everyone! I&#39;m the lead developer of Zas Editor. I wanted to share some details about the editor you might be interested in.The text-storage data structure, syntax highlighting and search features are written in Rust, and the UI is written in Swift since we wanted to create a native macOS experience. The Swift and Rust code talk to each other using C FFI, and no, that doesn’t take away the safety features of both languages.We’re using the Rope data structure for text representation, and the tree-sitter parser for syntax highlighting and some smart features like file outline, local renaming and symbol search. All other language features are powered by LSP servers (rust-analzyer and gopls).I’d be happy to answer any questions under this comment or anywhere else in this thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zas Editor developer here. I think it’s important to address a problem a few people have mentioned so far: no data is collected other than your Mac’s serial number, which used to be used for finding how many computers a license is used on (we no longer do that)We’re going to add a privacy policy in the website. We haven’t already done that because we didn’t really expect this much attention within hours of releasing. Honestly, we were expecting few downloads and more technical feedback."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if it really still make sense to develop an editor as a commercial product. This is probably a massive effort, and the revenue is maybe not so large.There is IntelliJ and Visual Studio. IntelliJ is successful, yes, but they have a long history, and the editor is really good. Visual Studio is maybe also successful but I&#39;m not sure how profitable it really was or is.But otherwise? Sublime Text and others were maybe successful at some point but not sure how profitable they really were. If you count the amount of development which went into it vs the revenue.For me as a user, I&#39;m extremely hesitant to use any non-open source editor. An editor is a long-term investment. I would not touch this Zas editor unless maybe in 5 to 10 years when it is widely used by many people or when it has become open source but otherwise not. Yes, it looks nice from a first glance but that is by far not enough.My personal only exception is IntelliJ because it is so good. PyCharm specifically, although I have used other IntelliJ products in the past, starting with the original Java editor, 15 years ago or so, which was heavily praised by some friends.But otherwise, I want to be able to extend the editor easily, also its core itself. I want to be able to support it when the original developer stopped working on it. Or port it to other systems the developer does not care about. Or do some changes the developer disagrees with. Etc. I want to be sure that it is in principle possible to run this in the next 10-20 years. Or not only me. The nice thing with open source is that many people think likewise, and then there will also be others doing such effort, like supporting it on recent systems, adding features, fixing bugs, etc. So then it is a community effort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Obviously, from the AI point of view, this is just amazing and frankly terrifying.OK, I&#39;ll be the guy who brings the snark. It seems that when Silicon Valley tech people create AI, it makes exactly the art you&#39;d expect Silicon Valley tech people to like. I.e. this is very much the style you see in NFTs, or, as someone else said, in Dixit. It&#39;s quirky and stoner-ish, very &#34;transcendental&#34;... for an AI, it&#39;s amazing...For a human, it would be dross.Yeah, yeah, I know, art is subjective, well I like it, how can you impose your tastes on the rest of the world, et cetera et cetera. Sorry, but it&#39;s dross! It&#39;s the kind of work the guy in the art shop up the road churns out, and sells to the ignorant locals in my town. It&#39;s the art equivalent of Visual Basic. (I&#39;m trying to get through to you that in this world, too, things can not just be done, but be done well or badly.)If there&#39;s a lesson on the AI side here (and maybe there isn&#39;t) it is just that these machines are still copying. They were trained on a bunch of art - and you can clearly see the kind of art that was used. Presumably, if it were just trained on Old Masters and Picasso, Dall-E would be mass-producing the stuff I, an intellectual, like.Note the difference, though, with a real artist. A real artist takes as input the real world - Rouen cathedral, the horrors of war in Spain, a Campbell&#39;s soup can - and produces art as output. This takes as input art and produces more art."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Context in mind, what jumps out to me is a remarkable compositional competence of the algorithm, even when given extremely vague prompts like &#34;happy sisyphus&#34;. The images match the prompt remarkably well with a few notable exceptions like &#34;cottagecore tech-adjacent young robert moses&#34;, where it seemed to have focused on &#34;cottage&#34; rather heavily, not understanding cottagecore as an aesthetic neologism,  and &#34;power bottom dad is for the people&#34;, which definitely got the &#34;dad&#34; part, but it looks like it still struggled to understand &#34;power bottom&#34; (perhaps the curation of training data may have contributed to this). Even if these were curated specifically to match the prompt, what the algorithm was able to do with profiles is amazing (especially bearing in mind that these profiles are meant to be evocative, intentionally idiosyncratic blendings of extremely complex, contextual terms that were written without visual representation in mind, even if they gesture at specific aesthetics)Side note: what might make artists a bit relieved is the fact that artifacting is still pretty apparent even in the curated examples. Fine details or even whole figures sometime devolve into that scrambled topography familiar to AI art. Even in more compositionally competent artworks, the &#34;brush strokes&#34; frequently have identifiable blurs at the margins. Text also seems to be gibberish even if aesthetically coherent. Even still, these are all such minor issues that additional photoshop would be both easy and readily doable.Overall, this is frankly stunning and I&#39;m really excited to see what others come up with. I feel like it&#39;s language and composition ability definitely did not disappoint the hype of its press release."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Timeouts for Regexp is quite interesting.  The engineering purity in me saddens at such a thought, but indeed it seems highly practical.The syntax feels a little rough although I have no ideas how to make it better:    Regexp.timeout = 1.0
    ...
    /^a*b?a*$/ =~ &#34;a&#34; * 50000 + &#34;x&#34;

I think I would favor the:    long_time_re = Regexp.new(&#34;^a*b?a*$&#34;, timeout: 1.0)

version instead but I use the `=~` almost entirely, so that would still be a big style change.  Probably end up setting a global timeout per app and then overriding for individual checks as needed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some web apps still in production that I wrote almost a decade ago in Node+Express in the simplest, dumbest style imaginable. The only dependencies are Express and some third-party API connectors. The database is an append-only file of JSON objects separated by newlines. When the app restarts, it reads the file and rebuilds its memory image. All data is in RAM.I figured these toys would be replaced pretty quickly, but turns out they do the job for these small businesses and need very little maintenance. Moving the app to a new server instance is dead simple because there&#39;s basically just the script and the data file to copy over, so you can do OS updates and RAM increases that way. Nobody cares about a few minutes of downtime once a year when that happens.There are good reasons why we have containers and orchestration and stuff, but it&#39;s interesting to see how well this dumb single-process style works for apps that are genuinely simple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was interviewing for software jobs recently, and while I was studying up on the &#34;system design&#34; portion I kept circling around the same insight that Dan Luu writes about so well here.I would sit down at an interview and try to create these &#34;proper&#34; system designs with boxes and arrows and failovers and caches and well tuned databases. But in the back of my mind I kept thinking, &#34;didn&#39;t Facebook scale to a billion users with PHP, MySQL, and Memcache?&#34;It reminds me of &#34;Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster&#34; at https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-... , and the occasional post by https://rachelbythebay.com/w/ where she builds a box that&#39;s just fast and with very basic tooling (and a lot of know-how)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the biggest problem for most developers is not understanding what one computer can actually do and how reliable they are in practice.Additionally, understanding of how tolerant 99% of businesses are to real-world problems that could hypothetically arise can help one not frustrate over insane edge case circumstances. I suspect a non-zero number of us have spent time thinking about how we could provide deterministic guarantees of uptime that even unstoppable cosmic radiation or regional nuclear war couldnt interrupt.I genuinely hope that the recent reliability issues with cloud &amp; SAAS providers has really driven home the point that a little bit of downtime is almost never a fatal issue for a business.&#34;Failover requires manual intervention&#34; is a feature, not a caveat."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh RFPs are an everlasting source of fun in B2B.Like, we&#39;ve received the wrong questionaire once. It contained the question what we would do if armed forces intruded into our secured facilities to seize assets. We eventually settled on the answer &#34;Run or hide, while calling the cops&#34;. At that point the customer noticed their error and it was pretty funny.In other areas, the consulting teams and us are developing some degree of a safe word system. Ask us in operations for something the right way and we can give an annoying answer how nothing is possible due to security policies and compliance and further discussion requires meetings with people with long job titles. And suddenly, deal breakers aren&#39;t that important anymore. And sometimes you can even team up with the customers infosec department this way in order to simplify things into a both more secure and easier path.The best way we&#39;ve found around this is to write white papers for commonly asked questions and topics, like storage security. It&#39;s great for our sales guys to be able to answer common questions with a PDF with a bit of glamour, but with enough incomprehensibility density to look important and to get forwarded to infosec / CISOs.

A well known large/prestigious university on the East Coast US called us to help with the RFP, and bid.  We did.We found out later that they simply wanted help with the RFP.  They never took our bid seriously.  Small company with a great rep, they preferred dealing with the large companies with meh reps.Another one ... a university somewhere here in Michigan, an alma mater of mine in fact, did something akin to this, but used another vendor as its stalking horse.  We constructed our bid aggressively, and submitted.Later that month, while on vacation with the family in Florida, the purchasing agent called me up.  She wanted me to teach the other companies how to do what we did (much higher density, far better performance, etc.)  I asked why.  She said they liked our solution.  They just didn&#39;t want to buy from us.We&#39;d won the RFP.  But lost the business.Of course, we declined teaching our competitors.  They (the university) were unhappy with that, and didn&#39;t understand why we wouldn&#39;t do this for them.I was then, and still am somewhat, blown away by the complete lack of understanding of how businesses actually work, on the part of the RFP folks, the purchasing agents, etc.Another time, I had a university call us up asking for a bid for something.  I asked if they had a preferred vendor (all do).  She said yes, but state law said they need at least 3 bids before they can purchase.  I asked if our bid would be taken seriously.  She said no.Yeah.  I&#39;ve shared some of these anecdotes with others in this industry, and we all nod our heads.  All of us have run into this before.  Some of the stories are far more outrageous than mine.An interesting tangent:  I currently work for a company whose RFP we won ~14 years ago for storage, but was rejected by the person who was my first boss here, as we (the company back then) were too small.  That&#39;s happened multiple times throughout my career.   Even though our solution was demonstrably superior in all technical and financial aspects, we &#34;lost&#34;.Can be disheartening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some companies even do this for job applications. A manager has a person they want for a role but, because of policy, they must publish it on their employment website, and go through the charade of interviewing candidates, wasting everybody&#39;s time. In the end, their preferred candidate wins."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lovely game!I wonder if it might be a nicer UX if you could choose for the Shift key to be needed to slide circles around rather than to move the selection. In my mind, conceptually, arrow keys are for moving the selection, and tessellating objects &#34;requires more work&#34; so I&#39;d expect Shift to be needed for that - not vice-versa."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty fun. Thank you OP!Little off-topic, though, I love how Wordle kinda opened our eyes to the possibility of doing this kind of games in the web instead off a one-off native app. I recently made a word puzzle myself[1] which some of my friends enjoy playing and there&#39;s no way I would go through the soul-crushing cross-platorm native development ordeal for such a niche little app. But it can live in the web! (and pretty much for free thanks to Netlify). I&#39;m now thinking of dusting and old Objective-C game that I wrote 10 years ago and never released, and rewrite it on web.Idk, suddenly I feel excited about the web, again.[1] https://palabrije.com/en (Sorry for the self-promotion)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a kid, I loved a game called [James Bond Jr.](https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/james-bond-jr/screenshots...) that had these little puzzles that were super fun to do. Some of them were hair-pulling difficult, too. I never saw a modern rendition of those puzzles, so I thought to create one.Eight Colors is the result. The rules are simply, but puzzles do get challenging after few levels.Hope HN likes it! Happy to hear any feedback!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; During last year’s election campaign, Trudeau’s party also proposed a ban on “blind bidding” for houses -- the prevailing system by which offers are kept secret when someone is auctioning a home.This is such a huge deal. Anyone who has had to go through the process of buying a home through a bidding war knows how unfair and one-sided this process is. It take a high-pressure emotional situation, and gives all of the information to one side (the sellers), while leaving the buyer stuck guessing at what the real price for the house is supposed to be. An absolutely horrible process that should be banned. Banning this is such a simple reform. I sincerely hope it happens, though I doubt it it will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know the specifics on Canadian real estate market and the specifics of the problems there, but based on my understanding of the problems facing your neighbors to the south - I feel like it’s almost an attempt to appease citizens by blaming the issue on “foreigners” (always a move that is popular with politicians) to redirect attention from the much more likely cause - massive investments made by hedge funds, private capital, REITs which does not appear to be addressed at all?Thought I do agree that a non-primary-resident investment, whether from citizens, foreigners, or capital should be greatly limited overall and these rules should only loosen to direct investment towards areas that are in dire need of an influx of capital for redevelopment. That is - if it’s not distressed, and it’s not going to be your primary residence - GTFO, you should be last in line to buy.And I say that as former landlord. I just believe that if I was looking to make some money - I could probably do just fine under these conditions. I don’t see an issue of buying a distressed property needing a rehab, and I think doing so benefits everyone.I am getting real tired of society getting ever more dystopian just so that someone can make a buck.https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/r..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Originally released in 1993, the Onyx from SiliconGraphics was an absolute powerhouse. The machines were powered by between one and four MIPS processors (originally the R4400’s) — ranging from 100 MHz to 250 MHz.250 MHz in 1993 is insanity, considering that was the 33 MHz 486 era.&gt; The RAM on these machines were not industry standard [...] and could handle up to 8 GB of RAM. 16 GB in the rackmount version (yeah, there was a massive rackmount version).8 gig of RAM at a time when home users didn&#39;t even have 1 GB hard drives.  16 GB of RAM at a time when a home user&#39;s desktop could read memory at &lt; 100 MB/s.Having those specs then would be like running a 37 Ghz CPU with 16 TB of RAM now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at Rareware in that same era, similarly ridiculous amounts of SGI hardware in the building.  As I recall each artist had an SGI Indigo2 and later on the SGI O2 because the standard artist workstation.  I believe our lead artist used an SGI Onyx.  Programmers had Indy2&#39;s with the internal N64 development boards.There were at least 2 rack mounted SGI machines used for large-scale rendering jobs (ie promotional images, magazine covers etc).  May have been SGI Challenges (I know one certainly was) and were kept off-limits to most staff, at the time they were rumored to cost $250k each."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah yes, good ol&#39; SGI, it always brings a smile to my face reading these old war stories.I wish we could get some insight on the development of the first successful 3D game on PC, Quake by I&#39;d software as there&#39;s a famous picture of John Carmack sitting in front of some SGI workstation with a monitor with a resolution ox 1920*1080( in 1995!)Also, SGI powered most VFX Studios of that era, so many great movies went through those machines before ending up on the big screen.It&#39;s insane how quickly 3dfx, Nvidia and Intel X86 consumer hardware made SGI workstations overpriced and completely obsolete within the span of just a few years. The &#39;90&#39;s were a blast.But still, I&#39;m sad to see SGI go, as their funky shaped and brightly colored workstations and monitors had the best industrial design[1] in  an era of depressing beige, grey or black square boxes.[1] https://preview.redd.it/tt3ziuwt98o31.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e5cc61..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These articles typically come in the form of, I was paying for my brand name when I was number one on organic search. I wasn&#39;t validating any of my other ad spend, I stopped and didn&#39;t see any negative impact, therefore advertising doesn&#39;t work/is a scam.As someone who&#39;s worked in the industry a while, I agree that it&#39;s a sad state of affairs generally but when people extrapolate that this means all advertising is bs it&#39;s just not true. Fundamentally business orders should track results from their ads the same way they look at impact anywhere else in their business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I probably hate ads more than most people but when I hear or see an ad, it kills my willingness to engage with a business. I mean, this isn&#39;t entirely conscious. I was thinking about whether my kid would like those creative boxes from KiwiCo that I heard good things about organically. Then, I heard an ad for them on a podcast, and I noticed a new extra resistance and hesitation to buy anything from them.I don&#39;t want to be a sucker for ads. I don&#39;t want to support businesses that support our ad-polluted world. With my limited capacity to donate directly to creative work (which I&#39;d incidentally rather do as part of a coordinated general public than just unilaterally), I favor donating to those who forgo ads rather than reward or support anything that accepts ads.Now, I&#39;ve hated ads for a long time. But I was still surprised how much I no longer feel fine considering KiwiCo. Now that I heard their ad, I feel like I don&#39;t want to be one of those people who is seen as following ads, and I don&#39;t want to support them. I imagine there&#39;s other products that don&#39;t budget as much for ads that I should go out of my way to seek out instead.So for anyone like me, if you do paid ads, you just harmed your credibility with me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though only in a single industry and an n=1 case, we got to see what would happen if a movie went into wide release with no advertising. Would enough people see the movie poster or listing for what&#39;s playing at the theater and be curious enough to see the movie? Or would the lack of advertising doom it?&#39;Delgo&#39; was released to theaters on over 2000 screens with an all-star cast in December of 2008 and virtually no marketing budget. It averaged roughly two paying customers per showing. More people saw Conan O&#39;Brien making jokes about it on his show than saw it in the theaters. Though critically panned as derivative and several years out of date with its CGI, movies with far worse reviews have done much better. The real difference seems to be that no one knew that it existed.That said, a new Star Wars movie with no advertising likely would still end up with plenty of ticket buyers. Existing brands can much more easily get away with taking their foot off the media buying accelerator but how long could they do it before a slow-down occurred? Seems like Marvel and DC still purchase lots of advertising for their well-known and currently popular franchises. What would happen if they stopped? Not sure if we&#39;ll ever know since they&#39;re unlikely to take that risk."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The young man, who does not know the future, sees life as a kind of epic adventure, an Odyssey through strange seas and unknown islands, where he will test and prove his powers, and thereby discover his immortality.The man of middle years, who has lived the future that he once dreamed, sees life as a tragedy; for he has learned that his power, however great, will not prevail against those forces of accident and nature to which he gives the names of gods, and has learned that he is mortal.But the man of age, if he plays his assigned role properly, must see life as a comedy. For his triumphs and his failures merge, and one is no more the occasion for pride or shame than the other; and he is neither the hero who proves himself against those forces, nor the protagonist who is destroyed by them.- John Williams in Augustus"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is always a tough subject for me because everyone seems to have at least an idea of what they want to achieve.When I was younger I had these silly dreams of moving to another country, getting married, becoming a programmer to make games, have my own company and get rich (haha).I did become a programmer and got married, but never left the country or became rich. Now on my 30s I know how limited my options are.I could focus on my craft. But I don&#39;t have the same drive as before.
I could try to progress my career, but I&#39;m already earning good money and I know to earn more I&#39;d have to either start job hopping or study some leetcode to get into a FAANG.
I could try to focus on my hobbies, but you realize very quickly that to get good at anything, you need hundreds/thousands of hours.
I could try to start a company, but I know that&#39;s extremely hard to do and also requires a shit-ton of luck to work out.After all that, I realize that I have no real objectives to strive for. Some of the dreams I realized and they weren&#39;t that satisfying. Some I discovered were not worth pursuing.And now what?In the end, I&#39;m just a blip in the universe and when I&#39;m gone it will be unchanged, the same as if I had never existed. Yet we focus on these artificial goals set by childish dreams, society or life events.What&#39;s the point of it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Growing up, the idea of a career in computing was implausible. The only computing course my school offered was scheduled against doing a full science course, and they had nothing for the 16-18 range. The local night school programming class I signed up for was cancelled because I was the only person who signed up for it. My parents made it extremely clear that the idea that I could ever make money writing software was unrealistic, which meant I was 27 with a PhD in genetics before I jumped ship into software full time.And maybe because of that, I&#39;m pretty ok with things? Every day I&#39;m aware that I could do more. I know people who could take over my job right now who are 15 years younger than me. And that&#39;s ok, because I have achieved so much more than ever seemed possible to me as a teenager, and every time I stare out the window and realise I&#39;m in San Francisco and part of the industry that was so far away when I was growing up I have to take a moment to come to terms with the fact that this is actually reality.I know this article is satire, but I also know that many people hold themselves against standards that are not realistic. Almost none of us have achieved everything that we could be, and that&#39;s just fine. If you&#39;re spending a lot of time troubled by the fact that you feel like you&#39;re falling short of your potential then this is a great time to find a therapist who can help you work through that. It&#39;s ok to want more than you have, but if you&#39;re objectively in a basically good place then you really shouldn&#39;t be constantly aware of that in a negative way. I&#39;m at peace with the fact that I&#39;m never going to found the next unicorn company or be CEO of Google or even write some software that a lot of people care about. Let&#39;s be kind to each other and ourselves about what we&#39;ve achieved, rather than holding ourselves to a model of what we could theoretically be if literally everything had gone our way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I&#39;m not sure what the compensation model for recruiters is, but it seems to encourage bringing in as many candidates as possible over treating them with honesty and respect.From experience dealing with recruiters for the last 25 years they universally lie to both sides to pocket the commission at all costs.I drove 400 miles once to do an interview for a solution architect position. Got there and the company were recruiting an Oracle DBA. The recruiter had plain up lied because I had some Oracle experience on my CV. They assured me they would ream the recruiter and bought me lunch and gave me an Amazon voucher to cover the fuel and time though which was nice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was an engineer at Fast for over a year and wanted to clarify a few points--
- engineers did have access to data and could write their own queries to check revenue (but few people did until the article came out).
- the strategy leadership decided on was to go after massive enterprise sellers which would, in theory, result in step-change functions in revenue. Many people knew about the low numbers but were willing to let the strategy play out for a while. There was a lot of excitement internally around closing the first $1B+ seller
- Internally, the culture was something akin to &#34;toxic positivity&#34; which meant that we weren&#39;t willing to discuss failures or misses in a productive way
- The company spent a lot of money on marketing events including sponsorship deals with the Tampa Bay Lightning and the rumored million dollar concert by the Chain Smokers. People are talking a lot about high engineer salaries but IMO those were far from the biggest problem (possible biased view)The story is a lot more complicated and nuanced than the headlines you read in publications but I will say that Fast was full of really talented folks who I&#39;d be happy to work with again. For me, a big lesson I took away from this experience is the perils of an overly positive fully remote culture. It&#39;s very easy for leadership to hide things from people when information doesn&#39;t easily spread across different organizations"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the most applicable warning for engineers when it comes to the actual work, as opposed to whether one should join a particular startup, is this:&gt; Engineers calculated the load Fast had in needing to serve their traffic. The Fast button was rendered less than 500,000 times per day - rarely needed to ever serve more than a few requests per second.&gt; One of the few warning signs engineers noticed is how Fast spent far more on infrastructure than the scale of the operation would have called for. Engineers sometimes brought up suggestions to scale infra down, and save costs - given there was not much revenue generated.Sounds like the whole thing could have run on a single cheap VM, perhaps with a second one for redundancy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oof, just one of our customers pays about the same as their full revenue, and we&#39;re a cockroach team.The real thing here is they&#39;re not that surprising. A lot of companies with their kind of funding use enterprise sales to force say $5-10M ARR, but there&#39;s only so much VC money can force for a leaky funnel, broken product, and overall incorrect market + fit. I didn&#39;t appreciate this until maybe a year or two ago. Valuation multiples in 50-100X range are super common (and even wackier numbers in seed/a). Think make believe stories like &#34;well with another 12-18mo of growth  this really just a bit over a 30X on some future forward revenue multiple...&#34;. The cash almost always leads to overspending, and it&#39;s highly unlikely the next 2-3 raises won&#39;t blow up and everyone goes home. I&#39;m actually super impressed by the Docker team because they&#39;ve been one of those rare cases of crawling out of that trap, even if with a lot less of the team.We get job candidates with high competing offers for companies I know to be rotten inside, yet there&#39;s only so much I can say. &#34;Our new hires are getting paid from customer revenue and with equity that doesn&#39;t have $50M-$500M of investor thumbs on the scales already cutting you out in 95% of the likely scenarios&#34; generally doesn&#39;t punch through the kool aid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just like the author, I too am quite particular about empty space in my MP3 files.When I was ripping my CD collection, I religiously tagged the MP3 files with ID3v1. Later on, I had some tracks whose titles were just a tad longer than 30 chars so I had to use ID3v2 for those and I noticed the file size grew by _a lot_.Frustrated by this, I opened them in a hex editor and learnt that ID3v1 was a fixed format of 128 bytes, but v2 was variable. I also found out that the software had added a 4KB zero-byte padding to the v2 tag, which was &#34;necessary&#34; because the tag is now at the front of the file, and this padding allows more tag data to be added easily later on.I tried various ID3 tagging software at that time and all of them added a padding. So I learned about the tag format and wrote a tagger myself that didn&#39;t add any padding. It was a great learning experience, and I managed to shave those useless zero bytes from my MP3s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with the FLAC format and it also recommends padding to make it easier to edit metadata. I think libflac reserves 4 KB by default.&gt; PADDING: This block allows for an arbitrary amount of padding. The contents of a PADDING block have no meaning. This block is useful when it is known that metadata will be edited after encoding; the user can instruct the encoder to reserve a PADDING block of sufficient size so that when metadata is added, it will simply overwrite the padding (which is relatively quick) instead of having to insert it into the right place in the existing file (which would normally require rewriting the entire file).-- https://xiph.org/flac/format.html#format_overview"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ripping from cd reserves 0.05% (about 5kb) for metadata. I can imagine some communication breakdown where someone thought they meant 5% (about 500kb) when specifying the number 0.05 with a % next to it. You see percentage mixups all the time."</p>

But it&#39;s improving! (https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/t9nuaz/whats_up_wit...)In the meantime, some of us still use Google to search Reddit, hence https://redditle.comOr for some of us, because Google&#39;s results are increasingly filled with clickbait, &#34;reddit&#34; has been a cheatcode to navigate that. Redditle is for you too!Is it the same as Googling &#34;site:reddit.com&#34;? Yes :DRedditle also supports searching in a specific subreddit with &#34;r/&lt;subreddit&gt;&#34; e.g. &#34;r/webdev guide to vue&#34; would search in r/webdev.GitHub repo - https://github.com/greentfrapp/redditle"</p>

I have these set up for all kinds of sites, and they&#39;re accessible straight from my local machines (because: sync)More help for Google search operators: https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on a browser extension called More Rich Results that you might find useful.
It just looks for Reddit and Stack Exchange results and previews them in the sidebar. It makes for a pretty clean search experience when developing or looking for opinions.It looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/kb5OE0n.gifIt has definitely improved my workflow and a lot more features are planned such as Github repo/issue previews and support for Searx. It currently works with Google and DuckDuckGo, although it is still in the early stages.https://github.com/lassebomh/more-rich-resultsTo install you need to download the repo, enable developer mode for extensions in your browser and press Load unpacked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m only part way through the paper, but what struck me as interesting so far is this:In other text-to-image algorithms I&#39;m familiar with (the ones you&#39;ll typically see passed around as colab notebooks that people post outputs from on Twitter), the basic idea is to encode the text, and then try to make an image that maximally matches that text encoding.  But this maximization often leads to artifacts - if you ask for an image of a sunset, you&#39;ll often get multiple suns, because that&#39;s even more sunset-like.   There&#39;s a lot of tricks and hacks to regularize the process so that it&#39;s not so aggressive, but it&#39;s always an uphill battle.Here, they instead take the text embedding, use a trained model (what they call the &#39;prior&#39;) to predict the corresponding image embedding - this removes the dangerous maximization.  Then, another trained model (the &#39;decoder&#39;) produces images from the predicted embedding.This feels like a much more sensible approach, but one that is only really possible with access to the giant CLIP dataset and computational resources that OpenAI has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;We’ve limited the ability for DALL·E 2 to generate ... adult images.I think that using something like this for porn could potentially offer the biggest benefit to society. So much has been said about how this industry exploits young and vulnerable models. Cheap autogenerated images (and in the future videos) would pretty much remove the demand for human models and eliminate the related suffering, no?EDIT: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few comments by someone who&#39;s spent way too much time in the AI-generated space:* I recommend reading the Risks and Limitations section that came with it because it&#39;s very through: https://github.com/openai/dalle-2-preview/blob/main/system-c...* Unlike GPT-3, my read of this announcement is that OpenAI does not intend to commercialize it, and that access to the waitlist is indeed more for testing its limits (and as noted, commercializing it would make it much more likely lead to interesting legal precedent). Per the docs, access is very explicitly limited: (https://github.com/openai/dalle-2-preview/blob/main/system-c... )* A few months ago, OpenAI released GLIDE ( https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im ) which uses a similar approach to AI image generation, but suspiciously never received a fun blog post like this one. The reason for that in retrospect may be &#34;because we made it obsolete.&#34;* The images in the announcement are still cherry-picked, which is therefore a good reason why they tested DALL-E 1 vs. DALL-E 2 presumably on non-cherrypicked images.* Cherry-picking is relevant because AI image generation is still slow unless you do real shenanigans that likely compromise image quality, although OpenAI has likely a better infra to handle large models as they have demonstrated with GPT-3.* It appears DALL-E 2 has a fun endpoint that links back to the site for examples with attribution: https://labs.openai.com/s/Zq9SB6vyUid9FGcoJ8slucTu"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very similar and would just give you two pieces of advice: (1) buy books compulsively and don&#39;t do your research predominantly online, and (2) make sure you write often, whether or not you publish your work or keep it to yourself. I think the latter is the most important advice for those trying to pursue an intellectual path outside of academia -- if you don&#39;t develop a habit of writing, you aren&#39;t really synthesizing what you&#39;ve learned and developing your thought. Don&#39;t worry if the quality is not great to begin with (and certainly don&#39;t worry that it seems cliched).The other thing I would suggest, if your career and family would manage, is spending time working in the UK. It&#39;s very easy to get a visa if you&#39;re involved in the tech industry and their higher education system for MA/MS degrees and PhDs is very different than the US, both more affordable and better suited towards working life. In the US, the thought is that if you&#39;re doing a PhD, say, it&#39;s a full-time professionalized pursuit under the assumption you will be a professor; in the rest of the world, a PhD is essentially an apprenticeship in writing under a mentor for however long it takes you, often with no aim (i.e. career) other than that writing itself.Personally, I&#39;ve alternated between highly-paid years working in the tech industry and years studying or writing without employment to great personal satisfaction (and managed to help publish a few scholarly anthologies that wouldn&#39;t have happened without someone who didn&#39;t need to rely on academic grants etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t quit your day job - ya gotta pay the rent. And in the meantime, if you gain satisfaction from satisfying your curiosity about myriad things, go with that. It doesn&#39;t have to have an end or a greater purpose. Everybody you know has a head filled with things they&#39;ll never &#34;usefully apply&#34; to the greater world around them: it&#39;s a fact of life. So if you end up on your deathbed with nothing having really clicked for you - no celebrity, no fortune - then that&#39;s how it goes. There is always your family - don&#39;t screw that up. 
The world&#39;s a mess and so are most of the people in it so don&#39;t sweat it. Sturgeon&#39;s Law applies.
But by all means gather friends around you with whom you can have civilized, intelligent conversation - it&#39;s important."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Investing might be an area where you can profit from being the way you are.I am very similar, having read way over 1k books in the last ten years or so, on a perversely wide array of subjects. I’ve also done everything from tinkering with Arduinos all the way to marriage counseling. But I quickly get bored and move on to the next field.An early disciple of CG Jung, Marie Louise von Franz, wrote that the life of our personality type looks like a never ending track of fields sown but never reaped.But while you may never stay long enough on a field to reap its fruit, what you do reap is a very interconnected, multidisciplinary way of understanding the world, which comes to you not so much in the form of explicit knowledge but in the form of a very special “intuition”.That isn’t to say that you are infallible. In fact, you should always be careful to question that intuition and to try to make as much of it as possible explicit, even just to yourself. But if you do that, you have a good chance of being quite successful with a Peter Thiel style of investing.Just always keep in mind your three biggest enemies: The mimetic reflex of wanting to follow the herd and get approval from others. The seductive illusion of superiority or infallibility. And the general tendency of wanting to be right, and of fooling yourself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t need to use Twitter&#39;s JS to show Tweets. If you choose to use their system, you&#39;re subject to their rules. If you don&#39;t like their rules, don&#39;t use their stuff.Calling it &#34;altering the public record&#34; is a little hyperbolic imo. If you want to act as a repository for the public record, you better use your own system. Twitter is under no obligation to retain this kind of stuff on your behalf.I&#39;m not trying to say that this is right or wrong, just that these are the facts of the matter when you engage with a company&#39;s code and terms of service."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see so many people here arguing that by embedding javascript directly from Twitter, you are accepting whatever they choose to make that javascript do. While that is true to an extent, Twitter has provided documentation for this javascript that says that if the Tweet gets deleted, the javascript will simply stop styling your quote of the tweet that you have on your website.By changing the behavior of the javascript, without even updating the documentation, Twitter has broken every rule of being a good distributor of third-party code. In a similar vein, any third party code could at any time do any number of malicious things. Just because I didn&#39;t pay Twitter for the privilege of running their code and just because I embedded their code in my website does not make it okay for them to start distributing malware to modify my website to their liking.There are lots of other malicious things Twitter could have the javascript do. Twitter could start showing ads before and after all quoted tweets. This would also conflict with the documentation and would be malicious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Functionality aside embedding random scripts from twitter seems like a big risk for security and privacy.At a minimum, it should probably be embedded in a sandboxed iframe.Just taking a screenshot, and linking to the tweet, seems like a more robust solution, that won&#39;t randomly stop working, and doesn&#39;t have the same privacy issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple things about the content of this post, that people aren&#39;t talking about. Mastering Emacs by Mickey Petersen is a solid book on Emacs and a good companion to the official manual. Mickey usually has an update to Mastering Emacs not long after a new version is released, which is great. I&#39;m thankful for his many contributions to the Emacs community, and I really enjoyed reading his thoughts on the new features and additions to Emacs 28.Secondly, the breadth of the changes in Emacs 28.1 is staggering, especially considering that Emacs 27.1 was released some 19 months ago. I think it&#39;s safe to say that despite all the hand-wringing about the antiquated email-centric way that Emacs is developed, an impressive amount of work is getting done. Emacs  development is alive and well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wayland support didn&#39;t make it... Oh well it is in version 29.I&#39;ve been using the wayland version with libgccjit many months now from their git repo and it is extremely snappy and stable editor.My strategy to keep all of this together is a nix derivation that compiles the latest master branch with all the plugins. Oh and my config is an org file with clear comments...https://github.com/pimeys/nixos/tree/main/desktop/emacsAll reproducible...Btw. I recommend SystemCrafters video series Emacs from scratch. It teaches how to make a vanilla emacs to work like doom emacs does. It was helpful for me to understand the magic behind doom...https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bB..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been testing Emacs 28 for a few weeks now, as it was reported to improve performance on LSP integration (which was sometimes sluggish for me with rust).I have to say I wasn&#39;t disappointed. It&#39;s now comparatively blazingly fast. I hugely recommend to give it a try if you work in emacs with LSP.Since my distro had not packaged it yet, I installed it from guix instead (package `emacs-next`). It worked like a charm."</p>

When the patent was reviewed, the examiner found the user doc on the internet and rejected the application due to prior art. We had to prove to the USPTO that both were derived from an older doc (by finding the older doc with timestamp and sending it to them with associated legal knobs and whistles)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Identifying the connection between one-way functions and Kolmogorov complexity is truly impressive. But the article oversimplified a few things that may be misleading for someone.1. One-way functions are not all cryptography. Some constructions may need stronger assumptions than one-way functions (we don&#39;t know yet if they do). So this problem is a “Master Problem” only for a subset of cryptography (symmetric encryption, pseudorandom generators, etc.).2. This is not the first “Master Problem” to base one-way functions on. There&#39;s Levin&#39;s complete one way function [1; Section 4.3]. Breaking it is proven to be as hard as any other one-way function, in other words if there exist one-way functions then this is one of them. But Levin&#39;s construction is somewhat artificial (it combines many one-way function candidates to create the “master one-way function”) and is not as surprising since its techniques and formulation are similar to how the usual one-way functions are defined. The connection from the linked article, on the other hand, is very surprising and unusual; it connects one-way functions to a more distant field which (to me) seems to be operating with quite different concepts.It&#39;s also fun to know that similar “Master Problems” exist for other primitives too. For example, for public-key encryption there&#39;s a Complete Public Key cryptosystem [2]. Albeit this one is similar in spirit to Levin&#39;s construction (not as surprising IMO as the linked article), the complete cryptosystem is obtained by combining many other cryptosystems.[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0012023[2]: https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il//eccc-reports/2006/TR06-046/inde..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An even more tantalizing result by the prolific Rafael and Yanyi is the following paper [1] which discusses how to relate the existence of one-way functions to the assumption that BPP \neq EXP (two classes).If you spend the time understanding just the statement of their result in that paper, you get to an eerily small gap between &#34;heuristic algorithms&#34; for a version of the time-bounded K-complexity, and &#34;errorless&#34; versions of it.Their line of research has been even more inspiring than this very well-written quanta article suggests.[1] https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/535.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes sense, intuitively; if I gave you &#34;8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4&#34; (sha256(&#39;hi&#39;)), and you quickly told me its K complexity was 2, I would become skeptical that sha256 was a one way function. (assuming of course you didn&#39;t brute force it)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; First off, there’s Lumen—a fully dynamic global illumination solution that enables you to create believable scenes where indirect lighting adapts on the fly to changes to direct lighting or geometry—for example, changing the sun’s angle with the time of day, turning on a flashlight, or opening an exterior door. With Lumen, you no longer have to author lightmap UVs, wait for lightmaps to bake, or place reflection captures; you can simply create and edit lights inside the Unreal Editor and see the same final lighting your players will see when the game or experience is run on the target platform.Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but isn&#39;t this basically a software-based implementation of NVIDIA&#39;s hardware-based RTX?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t see how this could ever be legitimate. Giving out an unlaunched shitcoin and a t shirt in exchange for the biometric data of people who very clearly don’t understand crypto or biometric data (read: random person in a mall, regardless of country). This is pretty clearly taking advantage of people.My question is, couldn’t you do this fairly without even spending that much money? Say you need 5MM scans to build your database (that you’re going to delete the data from anyway). With shitcoins it’s close to free, but you had to pay a bunch of engineers and marketers. Why not give each person $5 USD converted to their local currency? For $25MM you are actually having a positive impact, don’t get dragged through the mud in articles like this, and it didn’t even cost that much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worldcoin talks about UBI which based on what Sam has said in the past I would take them at their word on. But beyond UBI what WorldCoin is going for is identity.In the nonblockchain world your identity is your Country ID, Passport, etc.In the blockchain world none of that stuff exists and people get uncomfortable when you start asking for it.This leaves a situation where a person is often just represented by a wallet. Well as you may know a person can make dozens or hundreds of wallets.This problem leads to all kinds of weird tricks that crypto projects get up to when trying to verify 1 wallet 1 person. For example in the idea of 1 person 1 vote on a project or for something like an airdrop early in a project where people on a discord get free crypto for being early adopters but you don&#39;t want one person registering with many wallets.Today that might look verification based on a phone number associated with discord or something. Real flimsy stuff.Worldcoin bases it on retina, which I admit creeps me out as well even if it&#39;s just a hash. But I can see what they&#39;re getting at. The need is there, maybe there is a better way.I used to work at crypto startup and we ran into this exact problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a few interactions with employees at Worldcoin. At a high level they&#39;re trying to solve a worthy problem: proof of personhood for crypto.HN is very anti-crypto so I expect any conversation on this topic is an uphill battle. If you&#39;re generally sceptical of crypto, Worldcoin will seem outright useless to you. I tend to believe there are some great ideas embedded in the cryptocurrency world alongside a lot of noise and speculation. Eventually the &#34;signal&#34; and core ideas will rise through, perhaps after a long period of pain.There are a whole class of ideas in crypto that require one wallet/address to correspond to one single person. Like all powerful ideas, there are ways that this could bring great value to the world and unfortunately also ways that this could be horrifically abused. Proof of personhood for crypto could enable verifiable UBI for the world. It could also enable mass surveillance if widely adopted.Given the interesting potential of the idea, someone was going to eventually work on it. Worldcoin should have approached the problem slightly differently. First, testing the concept in lower-income countries has a &#34;colonial experimentation&#34; look to it. Since the idea is controversial, they would have gained more goodwill by initially launching in the EU/North America under the more strict legal frameworks. Second, make the orb look less dystopian. Third, launch with a non-economic use case. Worldcoin won&#39;t solve UBI or inequality in one shot, so why not launch with a lower stakes use case such as an online forum or community that requires proof of personhood to post?Sadly I think because of all the missteps, I can&#39;t see Worldcoin tackling the proof of personhood problem in the longterm. I hope another project comes along and makes an attempt more &#34;sensitively&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great visual and concrete example of how easily a narrative can be controlled.This is but one example of a larger systemic issue with media in the 21st century, and an issue with how people consume that media.Virtually every platform is like this, not just TikTok. It&#39;s not like TikTok tries to present itself as a neutral, unbiased source. Their whole premise is delivering &#34;highly curated&#34; content to you as fast as possible. The problem is that people have accepted that as normal and it&#39;s doing horrible things to the world. There&#39;s a reason everyone feels like we&#39;re the most divided we&#39;ve ever been...and it starts with things like this.As far as the war in Ukraine is concerned, this is just like classic WW2 propaganda but turned up to 11 due to the nature of how fast and easy it is to spread [mis]information these days."</p>

I think it&#39;s motivated by prestige, not money, nor is free speech the heart of the matter.Twitter is a stagnant company. They have thousands of engineers that in the span of a decade don&#39;t seem to produce much at all, nothing visible or memorable anyway. Long-lasting Twitter problems (culture, spam, algorithm issues) never seem addressed. User growth is stagnating as Twitter fails to appeal to &#34;normies&#34; in a way Facebook and other networks can.A perfect target for Musk to come in, do a few sweeping changes, and get out. Thereby proving once again that he gets shit done where others can&#39;t. Case closed.It doesn&#39;t take much. People have been begging for an edit button for a decade.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some legitimate concerns about Warp throughout these comments (telemetry, business model, etc.).But the one thing that really excites me is to have a full team working full-time on building the terminal that developers want to use. They&#39;re doing real user research, talking to developers, and taking feedback in forums like HN seriously - and using up millions of VC-dollars building a new version of this fundamentally important core utility. I&#39;d much rather have that VC money go toward an attempt at a better terminal than some ML or web3 startup.I think this doesn&#39;t usually happen? All the terminal emulators I&#39;ve used usually open-source projects developed in someone&#39;s free time. Don&#39;t get me wrong, projects like Alacritty, urxvt, xterm, Terminator etc. are amazing for the funding they have (I think mostly $0?), but I&#39;m super excited to see what a cohesive terminal based on real UX research can look like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is perhaps slightly orthogonal to the main discussion here on this thread, but I have a question for Zach (and the various engineers posting on this thread):Did you guys talk to real-world users while building this and before this launch?This whole blow-up re: your telemetry / open sourcey&#39;ness seems like it could have been avoided.  I&#39;m curious if you actually floated these ideas with real world users and a) everyone else is cool with it but the HN crowd is super put off by it, b) everyone is super put off by it but you decided to launch anyway, or c) you didn&#39;t actually check with real-world users and hoped for the best.Sorry if that sounds snarky - it&#39;s not my intent.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think &#39;more customization&#39; which is a theme with a lot of these alternatives is a fundamental dead end. I don&#39;t know where this persistent myth comes from that people love choice and tinkering, because they clearly don&#39;t. There&#39;s a huge cost associated with having to make choices, and one feature of successful modern apps is that they&#39;re frictionless. That&#39;s why TikTok is so successful. There&#39;s no login, no user chosen social graph, everything&#39;s abstracted away.And that&#39;s by the way why Google is still successful as well. Because it literally still is a simple box where you put a question in and it gives you answers without needing to do anything else. The only way to beat that is to make it even better while not making it more complicated which is very hard to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just went on a mini vacation to Vegas, and was thinking how nice it would be to just call up someone and ask for some simple advice.  I did a bunch of online research before I booked things, but man was it painful.  There are so many copy-cat blogs who just throw together a bunch of basic information with no real research done in order to get those clicks/adwords.For example: best hotel pool in vegas.  Seems simple enough.  Circus Circus actually has a waterslide, but if you dive deeper (read a hundred reviews manually) you find out parts are often shut down, and the hotel itself is quite trashy and smells bad and has bad service (explains the really cheap room rate).  But do you find that information on blogs?  No way, they just include all the hotels with pools and copy in the verbiage directly from the hotel websites or other blogs.There&#39;s probably an actual traveler blog out there that tells you all this and has great information, but it&#39;s hidden by all the SEO optimized trash blogs.And this example can be applied to so many things we do all the time.  Try to find a product you want on Amazon without spending half a day sorting through reviews and trash blogs.So, personally, I think the future will be actual human service.  I&#39;d pay a few bucks to call up a service to answer these questions definitively for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These solutions don&#39;t answer any of the fundamental problems with Google:- who pays for the service (ads? users pay? Average user will never use a paid service if a free one is available)- how to resist attacks against the algorithm (Google has been fighting spam for decades)- how to personalize without invading privacy, e.g. Google had an option to search through your email in Google search...it&#39;s gone now, I wonder why?"</p>

In combination with lorri [1] you will be dropped into a shell with all required development dependencies available, when you enter the project directory. This does not only include the interpreter/compiler versions but also any other dependency you can think of, like specific libraries the project links against (well almost any, it has to be available as a nix expression, best case directly in upstream nixpkgs).For me, it has come so far that I don&#39;t have any interpreters or compilers in my main OS environment and even for one off REPL sessions, I&#39;ll use `nix shell nixpkgs#python3 -c python3`.[0]: https://nixos.org/[1]: https://github.com/nix-community/lorri/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently discovered Hermit[1], which is a really straightforward tool for managing versions of tools for a given project. From the FAQ[2]:&gt; Hermit is probably most similar to asdf, but their goals differ. Hermit&#39;s goal is to make isolated cross-platform tooling consistent, self-bootstrapping, and reproducible at the project level. asdf&#39;s primary goal is to allow developers to install and switch between multiple versions of languages and tooling.The downside for the author of this post, though, is that Hermit doesn&#39;t yet support Ruby because it&#39;s not static/relocatable.[1]: https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m constantly amazed at how Metaverse aficionados quote Snow Crash and and other 1990s works as cornerstones of cyberspace, when Gibson invented the term and Neuromancer was written in 1984. Gibson is the original. The passage where Case connects to the matrix (also a Gibson term) again for the first time once his nervous system is repaired is heartbreakingly beautiful. I relate to it as a young phone phreak growing up in South Africa in the 80s and 90s when I would bluebox the home country direct phone trunks to connect to BBSs in the USA. When I could not get through, usually because they were filtering my seize tones, I felt the same deprivation. And when I finally connected I felt the same elation Case feels in this scene…“Please, he prayed, now—A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky.Now—Disk beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler gray. Expanding—And flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of his distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to infinity. Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of military systems, forever beyond his reach.And somewhere he was laughing, in a white-painted loft, distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I read somewhere -- and it might have been an interview with Gibson or with someone else talking about his work -- is how much William Gibson despises derivatives of cyberpunk in the books, videogames and movies that followed.Specifically, he dislikes the focus on the aesthetic, neon lights, mirror shades, etc. I think Gibson really dislikes Cyberpunk 2077, for example. Gibson argued they are missing the point, staying shallow and forgetting the &#34;message&#34;, which was PUNK: a rebellion and a rejection of the mainstream state of affairs. Gibson was a punk writer, and his writing was a critique of Reaganomics and the direction the world was going back then.I think he means we need a different kind of critique now, not anchored to neon lights and vaguely Japanese inspired retrofuturistic aesthetics which look like what the 80s thought the future would be. And nothing can be more conformist and anti-punk than lazily copying a now classic aesthetic and doing nothing else with it.That said, I love that aesthetic myself, and have no problem being stuck in the past. But I see his point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Sprawl trilogy and its fashion/world is formed a lot by politics. Gibson himself says that Neuromancer is an exaggerated critique of Reaganomics and the problems it exasperated (or, at the very least, failed to address). The rampant drug abuse, sovereign corporations, the ever increasing gap of poverty and technology -- I think a lot of derivative media adopts these elements to look cool (without actually understanding their context or meaning)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t know what it is about game development that really brings out the yak shaving in people.One time, about 8 years ago, I backed a game called Nowhere[1] by a very talented programmer. The original premise was an alien life simulator.Well, it&#39;s been eight years, and development is still going strong!The developer is currently working on the String implementation for the programming language he invented[2], which he&#39;s using to write the other programming language he invented[3], which is eventually going to be used to write the game.[1] https://duangle.com/nowhere[2] https://hg.sr.ht/~duangle/scopes[3] https://hg.sr.ht/~duangle/tukan"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting that this phenomenon is much more prevalent in game development, as opposed to (for example) web development: some people build their own web development frameworks, but it seems like every game dev tries to make an engine at some point.My theory why: good web frameworks consider developer experience to be of paramount importance, and invest heavily into examples, documentation, and API improvements. Unreal and Unity by comparison are unpleasant to work in. The UI is clunky, the examples cap out after a certain point of complexity, and community input is almost nothing when compared to the Django, Express, Rails, or language-specific ecosystems.Anyway, I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever made it far enough down the rabbit hole to want to make my own language... but I know for me, the desire to make my own engine* has punctuated every attempt over the years to get better at both Unity and Unreal*Acknowledgment that I might be partially disproving my own point, as I&#39;ve tried to build both my own web framework, AND my own game engine... but I spent a lot more time on the game engine (https://github.com/RobertTownley/gamehook)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always a pleasant surprise to be scrolling through HN and seeing one of my articles on the front page!For anyone interested in how that code would get zero memory safety overhead without the classic borrow checker, a big part of it is because of the &#34;region borrow checker&#34; [0]. There are some other factors (iso regions, hybrid-generational-memory, etc.) but region borrow checking is the big one.[0] https://verdagon.dev/blog/zero-cost-refs-regions"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The environment around Jd has changed a bit since it was young! Jsoftware[0] announced it in 2012, and this particular page has been effectively the same since it was created in 2017 (I suspect this was a page move, and the content is somewhat older). In these early days the column-oriented database was quickly gaining popularity but still obscure, which is why there&#39;s this &#34;Columnar&#34; section that goes to so much trouble to explain the concept. Now the idea is well known among database users and there are lots of other options[1].The history goes back further, because column-oriented is the natural way to build a database in an array language (making a performant row-oriented DBMS would be basically impossible). This is because a column can be seen as a vector where every element has the same type. A row groups values of different types, and array languages don&#39;t have anything like C structs to handle this. In J, Jd comes from Chris Burke&#39;s JDB proof-of-concept (announced[2] 2008, looks like), and the linked page mentions kdb+ (K) and Vstar (APL). KDB, first released in 1993, is somewhat famous and gets a mention on Wikipedia&#39;s history of column-oriented databases[3].[0] Company history: https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Jsoftware[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_column-oriented_DBMSes[2] https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/JDB/Announcement[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS#History"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did some work to compare Jd to data.tables and found that it was more performant in some instances such as on derived columns, and approximately equally performant on aggregations and queries. Jd is currently single-threaded, whereas multiple threads are important on some types of queries. I tried to further compare with Julia DB at the same time (maybe a year ago) and found that was incorrectly benchmarked by the authors and far slower than both; that might be different now. Jd is more equivalent to data.tables on disk; Clickhouse is far better at being a large-scale database.Rules of thumb on memory usage:
Python/Pandas (not memory-mapped): &#34;In Pandas, the rule of thumb is needing 5x-10x the memory for the size of your data.”
R (not memory-mapped): &#34;A rough rule of thumb is that your RAM should be three times the size of your data set.”
Jd:  &#34;In general, performance will be good if available ram is more than 2 times the space required by the cols typically used in a query.”Re CSV reading, Jd has a fast CSV reader whereas J itself does not. I have written an Arrow integration to enable J to get to that fast CSV reader and read Parquet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve programmed in J professionally (admittedly not for all that long) as a data scientist and, coincidentally, have just completed a small analysis using J as part of an internal workshop about data analysis I am planning. I typically work in R and Python and I have to say that at this stage there is almost no reason I would pick up J to do any work. Unless code-golf level conciseness is your only goal, these other platforms offer superior performance, clarity, ease of use, access to libraries and are, as programming languages, substantially better designed.I say this as a great lover of function-level programming and as a J enthusiast. I would say I am quite familiar with J&#39;s programming paradigm and conceptual widgets and doodads (I know the verbs, nouns, adverbs and conjunctions and can use them appropriately). I even remembered a pretty good portion of the Nuvoc. But doing even the simplest analysis in J was _excrutiatingly_ slow and inconvenient compared to using R and the tidyverse (in particular, I missed dplyr and ggplot). The tidyverse CSV readers are, for example, much faster and smarter and more convenient and informative than anything you&#39;ll get from the J universe.I love vector languages but at this point J can&#39;t compete with the major platforms for data analysis. Its less convenient, often _slower_, much more low level, strange, and its library situation is anemic at best. I recommend learning J because it will expand your mind, but I can&#39;t imagine picking it up for real work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you want a decent dock you have to spend a bit of money. I went through this pain before accepting the cost and buying a CalDigit Thunderbolt 4 Element Hub[1]. Run&#39;s two 4k displays at 60Hz, any peripheral and charges my laptop.So good I bought a second.1. https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-4-element-hub/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It honestly feels like no matter what you buy, you get more or less the same hardware, and you’re most likely getting a heavily overpriced product just because some company printed their logo on it.Isn&#39;t this like a known thing? Almost all peripherals on Amazon will have dozens of the exact same form-factor with different logos on it. You just buy the one that is the perfect intersection of costs, positive reviews, and shipping time. The assumption is that they all come from the same factory in China anyways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gone through a number of Thunderbolt docks over the last few years. I tend to prefer docks to hubs because you tend to use your laptop at several fixed positions, each of which might have 1 or more monitors, a network cable, accessories (eg keyboard, mouse, camera) and so on. It&#39;s easier to just plug in one cable from the dock to the Macbook that&#39;ll do everything including power it.A good example of this is the Caldigit TS4 [1]. All the ports you could possibly want. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned.First and foremost, you&#39;ll be surprised at how many issues come down to a given cable being bad. It&#39;s gotten to the point that whenever I buy any sort of cable I typically buy 2 or even 3 at the same time because I assume 1 will be bad or will go bad.Second, also to do with cables, don&#39;t use any cable to connect from your dock to your laptop longer than a foot. These cables that can take power and full bandwidth for displays and accesories are the most technically demanding. Keep them as short as possible. And again, have spares.Third, while I&#39;m a traditionalist and like a wired connection (and thus an Ethernet port), it&#39;s really optional now, particularly at home where you have some control over the network. Like I can get easily get 500+ Mbps over Wifi at home. This of course assumes a sufficient Internet connection but if you don&#39;t have that then Ehternet is even less necessary.If you have flickering display in particular, your first instinct should be to blame the cable.[1]: https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-station-4/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, I love this. What a thoughtful, empathetic project. This passage really stuck out to me--&#34;A typical problem is that, in the absence of equations, they project literal meanings onto words such as ‘grains’ of space-time or particles ‘popping’ in and out of existence. Science writers should be more careful to point out when we are using metaphors. My clients read way too much into pictures, measuring every angle, scrutinising every colour, counting every dash. Illustrators should be more careful to point out what is relevant information and what is artistic freedom. But the most important lesson I’ve learned is that journalists are so successful at making physics seem not so complicated that many readers come away with the impression that they can easily do it themselves. How can we blame them for not knowing what it takes if we never tell them?&#34;Of course, this writing often isn&#39;t for the layperson, it&#39;s for an audience who can tell the difference between diagram, artistic license, and metaphor, but even so, it&#39;s good to think about, especially when communicating science to the general public."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really interesting, I&#39;ll be forwarding to my science writer friends for opinions.Potentially interesting to some: we get the same phenomenon right here on HN regularly! To someone an advanced understanding of music theory (including western harmony, tuning systems, acoustics, psychoacoustics, doing a graduate degree, etc) HN is a regular source of armchair music theorists putting forth their own musical grand unified theories of everything without understanding the foundations. I guess, much like the field the author works in, the nature of it is that a strong understanding of a small piece leads one to easily believe there is this neat and tidy system of well behaving patterns when the reality is vastly more complex. I&#39;d say once a week or so I see posts on HN that are the musical equivalents. I used to answer with pointers to what one might want to learn or suggests books, but really, I have no idea what the right response to that sort of thing is. It&#39;s way, way more complicated than one would think coming from a tangentially related field. Perhaps similarly, the popular music theory writing out there creates the same effect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Science writers should be more careful to point out when we are using metaphors.I think she should replace &#34;science writers&#34; with physicists. In my experience, it&#39;s when physicists give overflowing and superfluous explanations of things that cause the most trouble, because they are viewed as authorities. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku, Brian Greene, PBS Space Time, and many others. It&#39;s interesting, because I once read an interview with Brian Green, and the question was: what career would you have chosen if you weren&#39;t a physicist? His answer was both surprising and unsurprising: a Baptist preacher. One should note that he actually has the speaking style of one.It brings up an interesting point in that physics at the highest level sounds almost like what ill-informed amateurs produce. I have degrees in mathematics and some understanding of physics, but I&#39;ve watched a few lectures of Ed Witten before, and he might as well be just making it all up. I know, it can all be backed out such that it all follows from known mathematics and physics, but one does have to marvel at the similarity, and I think this is what so-called cranks get emboldened by. It makes it worse when physicists use words like &#34;believe&#34;.I think physicists have done a poor job explaining that what they do is model building. The models are not reality. What reality is currently lies in the realm of philosophy. The models physicists build are simply our best descriptions based on what we observe (string theory aside). The article gets at this a bit with mentioning metaphors, but it still doesn&#39;t drive home the point because she&#39;s referring to metaphors of metaphors (i.e., metaphors for the physical models). Once you understanding that physics is about building models that describes what we observe in physical reality, it lowers the barrier of &#34;authority&#34;. In that, in some sense, the entire point of physics is often to find out how we&#39;re wrong just as much as it is to clarify where we&#39;re right. I think many don&#39;t understand that when &#34;is&#34; is used in physics, it really means &#34;is modeled by&#34; (or something to that effect).I&#39;m reminded of this scene from one of my favorite movies, A Serious Man: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbzWYjVrvpI"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work for a school district (not CPS) with about 2000 deployed Chromebooks and you&#39;re likely running into one of two things.1) You somehow &#39;enrolled&#39; the device into the Chromebook management.  This is hard to do by mistake but if you do, essentially puts the device under the control of the school district.  It also uses up a license on their end.  We only allow particular IT only accounts to enroll devices.
2) You&#39;re logging in with their CPS account.  Once a person logs in with their managed account it can deploy user level policies that include everything you described: extensions, filtering, and blocking signing into another account in the browser.  You&#39;ll also find some random pages are blocked to keep students from bypassing the restrictions.That you can wipe the machine makes me think you didn&#39;t enroll it - if you wipe an enrolled device it will prompt/force you to re-enroll.
You should be able to reboot the device so you land at the login screen and hit &#34;Add Person&#34; down at the bottom.  From there sign in with a different Google account and it should be completely unaffected by any policy the school is deploying.  Unless you enroll it, the policies are deployed to the Google account, not the device.Its likely the CPS Help Desk Staffer you reached doesn&#39;t have the power to fix things for you if you&#39;ve enrolled things - that usually requires permissions that are restricted to a few admins.Feel free to shoot me a message via the email in my profile - I&#39;m happy to give you some of the inside perspective and help you figure it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I bought him a Chromebook for schoolwork, but also for other private things. When we logged in...This is why you need to pay attention to the technology choices that you make, and that your schools make. Chromebooks are designed from the ground up to be locked-down dystopian spyware once you &#34;log in&#34; to them with a specific Google account. For heaven&#39;s sake stop buying any more Chromebooks.The correct solution here is not technological at all. Call into the school&#39;s board meeting during public comment, and make it loud and clear that the school is installing spyware on students&#39; Chromebooks. Share your technical credentials and the method by which you found this. Emphasize stories of previous data breaches involving educational companies [1], and show officials that they are putting students&#39; sensitive data at risk. (Edit: See the important point in the reply from &#39;n8cpdx below about the correct tone to use in your comments – don&#39;t repeat my words verbatim!)The technical details don&#39;t matter too much to educational officials – as soon as the &#34;Chromebook = bad spyware&#34; label sticks and they think that a fuck-up here could cost them them bad press, they will allow their IT department to make more privacy-respecting technology choices even when those choices cost a little more. If no one speaks up, it&#39;s a race to the bottom driving us closer to the fiction in The Right to Read [2].----------------------------------------[1] https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/smarterselect-exposed-mill...[2] https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a longtime armchair attorney who has closely read summaries of cases like this on Slashdot for well over the past decade (IANAL, BTW)...you could go the lawyer route but this basically amounts to your kid being a minor in school which means they don&#39;t have full legal rights, and the interpretation of 4A is likely up in the air here anyway. Constitutional rights don&#39;t necessarily apply at school or anywhere near school (see bongrips4jesus case), your kid is a minor anyway (another special case), and a school doing this for the sake of &#34;preventing cheating&#34; may not fall under the umbrella of unreasonable search.There was a PA school district back around 2009 that issued laptops to students preloaded with spyware that let school staff watch students through the webcam, while the students were at home and not doing schoolwork. Neither the students or parents were informed of this. IIRC the FBI got involved but nobody actually got in any real trouble, I&#39;m not even sure they were fired.I wish things weren&#39;t this way. You could maybe use Wireshark and black hole anything the spyware tries to connect to at the router, or maybe add the addresses to the hosts file on the machine itself (not sure if ChromeOS lets you do this)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a useful analysis of what &#34;being an adult&#34; means. I&#39;ve noticed that the moment when I feel like avoiding social discomfort or potential conflict as the precise moment when I have a choice: either be an adult and understand what I want and communicate it, or avoid it and dislike myself and project those feelings onto others.Invariably when I choose to behave like an adult I feel empowered and ultimately at peace with myself and others in the end. If I choose avoidance, resentment builds, and further avoidance follows.The idea that avoidance behaviors can be selfish or agreeable cuts through much self-deception. This can be helpful when I tell myself &#34;I&#39;m just being nice&#34; because it adds the proviso: &#34;yeah, but I&#39;m not being an adult.&#34; Which I could see being a really helpful inner monologue in those situations.This is also intimately connected to the concept of &#34;taking responsibility&#34;, which begins with not avoiding something which &#34;someone else&#34; might deal with so you don&#39;t have to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just an observation, n=1; when I moved to Los Angeles to go to school, I was shocked to find that people cancelled plans on me all the time. At first I took it personally, because that didn&#39;t happen in the more rural town I&#39;m from. But then I realized: its part of the culture, and maybe its just an attribute of very dynamic urban social networks, where an exciting new opportunity might pop up any moment. So I learned to not get my hopes up, and learned to cancel on others too without worrying about it over much.When I moved back to rural California, people thought I&#39;d become a jerk. Took me a while to shift back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like this article, but I wish it was phrased &#34;are you being a baby&#34; instead of &#34;are you a baby&#34;. Labeling oneself as wholly a particular attribute is one of the mechanisms by which anxiety takes root: you _are_ or _aren&#39;t_ something, full stop. Labeling actions or states shifts your mindset so that you can clearly see this is something you&#39;re free to change. It&#39;s the sort of thing that makes no difference at a factual level (they&#39;re logically equivalent! right!?) but emotionally the tone shift makes a huge difference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This study shows that 25% of Twitter users send 97% of all tweets:
https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-study-shows-that-2...And some 80% of that are retweets or replies, not original tweets.Most people do not use Twitter at all. When they do use it, it is mostly read-only. When it&#39;s not read-only, it&#39;s most retweeting stuff.You can&#39;t deny that Twitter has an outsized cultural influence, but the underlying reality is sobering. It&#39;s not a &#34;speech&#34; platform for the masses as no actual speech happens by the masses themselves. If the retweet button were to be removed, the platform would collapse.It&#39;s not surprising that the masses don&#39;t post. You can&#39;t express yourself on Twitter due to the character limit, so all you can do is witty superficial takes. Threading and replies are a disaster making a structured discussion impossible. These two things alone make the platform useless for most speech purposes.And let&#39;s not forget the sour atmosphere of extreme hostility, permanent outrage, bad faith discussions, smearing, doxxing, cancellations, the culture is terrible.Back on point, I think Twitter has a far bigger problem than a free speech problem. There is very little speech and it excessively rewards the most unreasonable speech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worth noting that the date of buying these shares is March 14th, and the date he started rather unsubtly tweeting about Twitter&#39;s approach to free speech is March 25th.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The major goal of the program, Amazon’s head of worldwide consumer business, Dave Clark, said, was to reduce employee attrition by fostering happiness among workers — and also productivity. Shout-Outs would be part of a gamified rewards system in which employees are awarded virtual stars and badges for activities that “add direct business value,” documents state. At the meeting, Clark remarked that “some people are insane star collectors.”Truly insane, there is nothing stranger (or more dystopian) than fiction after all. Rather than fix the system of working their employees to death (literally in the case of the tornado) or improving their conditions, Amazon tries to use virtual gold stars (not even physical stickers like kindergarten) as a band-aid. That list of banned words is right out of 1984 (as cliché as it is to reference at this point): ethics, fairness, freedom.I cannot imagine anyone here seriously defending this unless you’re just looking to be a contrarian. This is not “par for the course” for manual labor jobs as some people are claiming. Most manual labor jobs do not restrict you from talking about ethics or justice with your coworkers or have even a need for some virtual gold stars beyond a little whiteboard in the building with number of sales, employee of the month, etc. The fact that these techniques won’t work for Amazon just shows that their laborers are really over-worked compared to the norm. Unfortunately, Amazon is able to use their massive resources and capital to pay just more than the local factory, packing gig, etc. so they have a stream of desperate people willing to take it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent five years in the Air Force. Posts like this are really helpful, a lot of Americans are disconnected from members of the military, especially in the upper classes where people do not need to serve, or in fields (like tech) where people can often find less intrusive ways to pay for college. My favorite part of the article is dispelling the myth that in the military senior people bark orders, and don&#39;t ask for feedback, and subordinates dutifully carry out those orders. None of those is true. There is a time to &#34;shut up and color&#34; but that is by far the exception. For the young people on here, I can&#39;t tell you what to do, but I can tell you serving in the military was a positive experience for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most important thing to realize about military service is that you sign away all your citizenship rights (free speech, etc.) when you sign up for the service.  Hopefully you won&#39;t be used in ridiculous debacles like the 2003 Iraq Invasion, based on lies about WMDs pushed by Washington (and see British role as well), but you&#39;ll have no say in the matter.The other thing to realize is that, at least in the USA, they&#39;ll do everything they can to deny you medical benefits for injuries suffered in basic training, and this will persist after you get out, i.e. Veteran&#39;s Administration health care is pretty poor by all accounts.  You can&#39;t just trust the system to look out for your interests in this area.In addition, the &#39;educational assistance&#39; is barely enough for a two-year vocational training program, certainly nowhere near enough for a full four-year college degree.  It&#39;s better than nothing, certainly, but the advertising and the reality have a big disconnect.If you&#39;re a teenage with zero alternative options and are completely desperate for a way out of an urban slum nightmare or a poverty-stricken rural life, the military is there as an option.  I was once in a similar situation but I rejected military service because I&#39;d heard too many Vietnam vets tell horror stories about how they&#39;d been treated by the military.  It wasn&#39;t much better for those who had to serve more recently in Afghanistan and Iraq, for equivalently dubious reasons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I knew my country&#39;s armed forces were 100% a domestic defense and emergency response force, I would absolutely have considered signing up when I was young. You learn good skills, and I see great value in some larger-than-self contribution to community there. My father is German and left Germany for good not long after doing his compulsory 1 year service. He hated it, and it was one of many factors that led to him emigrating. But one thing my aunts have told me is that before he joined he was a disorganized messy irresponsible person, and afterwards he was neat and structured. He is also an amazing marksman, which he learned there (before he left they were talking to him about advancing him through sniper training). He amazed my Canadian uncles when he went hunting with them.But even here, in Canada, the armed forces gets involved in adventures abroad which I can would characterize as &#34;dubiously thought through&#34; at best ... but &#34;blatantly imperialist&#34; at worst. Being deployed to Afghanistan or some other adventure that I could not support would both enrage and depress me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You should definitely go to an exit interview.In the case of a sour breakup, you should 100% lie. Just say it was great but you were in need for a change. Don&#39;t dramatize the lying part because you lied to get in and the employer lied about how great their company is. Work is a lie, play the game.In the case of a drama-free breakup, when pressed for feedback and the room being receptive of it, do share your thoughts. But toned down, in a light hearted manner. Comment on things and processes, not people. This gives the impression &#34;helpful until the end&#34;.Both ways are a clean exit, with no bridges burned. There might come a time in your life where you&#39;re less desirable on the market, having intact relations can make a huge difference then.You should internalize the dishonesty as a type of strength, because that&#39;s what it is in this context. In a sour breakup, you&#39;re given the perfect opportunity for revenge, with little immediate consequences.Your ex-boss Tim is an asshole. He knows he is. And you know he is. You now have the opportunity to finally say it to his face.Applying silence in this situation is powerful. It says so much more. I could harm you right now, but I chose not to. This radiates self control, which is widely respected. Meanwhile, Tim was looking forward to a good burn and argument, but didn&#39;t get any. He feels submissive, like a Roman emperor giving him a thumbs up, allowed to live another day.And that&#39;s how you play it. Alternatively, you can be 21 years old and post on Medium &#34;7 reasons why I quite company X after 8 months&#34;. Let me know how that goes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I made the mistake and told the truth one time early in my career.I got fired, err... I wasn&#39;t retained after a multi-month temp period, and was brought in to be fired, then exit interviewed.I was upset, but stuck to the truth. My direct boss was passive aggressive, didn&#39;t like me, and excluded me from the team. His code was awful, in the long term wasn&#39;t maintainable, and wouldn&#39;t be able to meet the needs of the road map because of poor design decisions. Some cliques had formed to the determent of the tiny company.Unfortunately after that exit interview, it became extremely difficult for me to get work in that community. Unknown to me at the time, I made an enemy of my direct boss, who had much deeper connections with that area tech community than I ever could have imagined. I only found out after making friends with someone else who told me they had heard nothing but bad things about me.It was a lesson learned. After a many years, and a move, it is no longer a problem, but it derailed me for quite a while."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has done exit interviews on both sides some quick notes:1) I would dial back dramatic sweeping criticism. Now is not the time to relitigate every grievance, claim doom will befall company etc.2) Treat it as any other feedback cycle. Here&#39;s what was working well, here some areas I might look at improving. Keep it light and friendly.3) Do a slight &#34;I&#34; perspective. I&#39;m moving for higher pay and to have a bit of a bigger role / influence on decisions etc. I&#39;m moving in part because progression options were unclear to me. I&#39;m moving in part to be able to do a masters program with an EAP program, start a retirement plan match (401K) etc.I had great references from all my former employers AND I did the exit interviews they wanted. They were friendly.I left one very very cushy job, did a very friendly exit interview, they hired me back on as a consultant at x times my normal rate. It really worked out better. I&#39;d had a split reporting structure internally (nightmare), and when I came back consulting each project had a clear &#34;customer&#34; I could work with / manage against. Everyone was happier. When I left I just said, One area that was tricky for me was the split reporting structure which made it harder to prioritize my work. When I consulted I had a point of contact clearly defined."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One nice thing I recognized is that the generated RSS feed contains full html text. I wish more blogging platforms are like this; save a lot of effort for feed readers.I&#39;d also recommend to add open graph meta for the blog posts. Presumably people will want to share the posts somewhere; a nice set of open graph metas goes a long way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Content in mataroa blogs is unfiltered and unmonitored. Users are free to publish any combination of words and pixels. However, content of animosity or disparagement of an individual or a group on account of a group characteristic such as race, colour, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or sexual orientation will be taken down immediately.&gt;If one notices something along those lines in a mataroa blog please let us know at admin@mataroa.blog.There should probably be something explicit in there about what kinds of pornography is allowed on the site. Also, the first part of the paragraph seems contradicted by the second: I would say users aren&#39;t really free to publish any combination of words given the sentence that follows.P.S. it looks like a great service"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was using and loved mataroa. It was the fairest, most painless option I had found for blogging (as of 2020.) I eventually switched away from it because the default font was small and I couldn’t change it. I wonder if this has been updated since. (At the moment, I’m hosting my blog as a static site with NFS. I go back and forth about wanting comments/email sign-up.)The developers were nice though, and I used their source code to learn Django. Really grateful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My time to shine! I work in music distribution.The Apple Music style guide is a great and accessible place to look if you&#39;re interested in music metadata: https://help.apple.com/itc/musicstyleguide/en.lproj/static.h...DDEX is the set of metadata standards used across the music industry: https://ddex.net/Also worth knowing that not all content on streaming services is music! Some of it is spoken word, ASMR, non-music field recordings, etc. The difference between sound and music is subjective of course though.On an artistic note, music can of course be presented in an infinite amount of ways. Not all these can be represented (i.e., re-presented) on streaming platforms. Installations and generative music for example. That&#39;s ok! To be able to represent all this music (and non-music) requires restrictions, otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be able to create programs for it in the first place.Sometimes restrictions on sound content are to make the streaming services friendlier to use, like the formatting of featured artists in titles. Royalty laws put restrictions on the handling of different roles, like songwriters and composers.BUT nothing is stopping you from building your own way of representing music digitally, so long as you follow relevant laws."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a reason why MusicBrainz SQL schema looks like what it looks like, after years of careful simplification to achieve an optimum approximation of reality.https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema10+ years ago at Zvooq, during the golden age of music metadata and recsys startups, we tried to really solve entity resolution in the domain. I&#39;ve never seen another streaming service make an honest attempt at this, even at Spotify with their 2014 acquihire of the Echo Nest. You still get Utada and Hikaru Utada as ~completely separate entities"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand &#34;horrible&#34; in this case in a somewhat lighthearted sense. But it points to a tendency to simplify cultural complexity in the interest of &#34;legibility&#34; from the system perspective. The same diversity of cases need to be accommodated in much design done for, say, a diverse country like India where though urban populace me be English savvy, rural populace aren&#39;t necessarily so ... And even in urban areas local language and culture dominates.A place this diversity crops up most commonly is the so called &#34;standard&#34; firstname middlename lastname fields. This just doesn&#39;t work in India where people may have even 7 components to their names ... and who are you, dear system developer, to dictate what their name should be like.The name structure diversity I understand is a problem for Europe too with hyphenated names. This brilliant sketch by Fry and Laurie says it all - https://youtu.be/1LopIroSjsU"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Windows for about two years. Just this morning, when I booted into Windows, the boot loader (or whatever you call the part before Windows is fully loaded) prompted me saying I need to finish setting up. The only options were &#34;accept&#34; or &#34;remind me in 3 days&#34;, so I accepted. Then it asked me to change my default browser to Edge. Apparently &#34;finish setting up&#34; means &#34;we don&#39;t like that you are using Firefox&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the one hand, WSL has made Windows truly viable as a developer platform. But on the other hand, this sort of aggressive marketing bullshit makes it such an unfriendly place to be. I want my computer to treat me as an adult. Since it increasingly doesn&#39;t, I did the adult thing and walked away. If a relationship turns abusive, one must leave.I would love to be able to pay for &#34;Windows Professional&#34; or something to get rid of this bullshit. But I guess my eyeballs are more valuable than my dollars. In that case, MS will get neither.I moved back to Linux two months ago because of shit like this. Good riddance. Thankfully wine acts as the WSL for Linux, and makes the migration possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Howdy. My name is Dave Martin. I&#39;m the CEO of WordPress.com.VM (Sorry, I don&#39;t know your full name) thank you for sharing your concerns. Comments aren&#39;t open on your blog, so I&#39;ll weigh in with a few thoughts below. I&#39;m happy to chat more about any of this in the comments below, or you can reach out to me directly via email dave.martin (at) automattic.com.You&#39;re right to call us out. I did a poor job of sharing context around why we are making change, so I can see how they could come as a shock. I&#39;m sorry! That&#39;s on me.Yes, as of this week we&#39;ve gone from 5 plans down to just 2. That said, we&#39;re not done making changes. This was the first of a couple of phases of changes.Those 5 older plans that you mentioned were the culmination of like 10 years worth of plans and features sort of haphazardly being added to WordPress.com with no real strategy. With those older plans, it was really hard for customers to see at-a-glance why they should choose one plan over another.Let me address a couple of the things you mentioned in your post:- No older sites/blogs have been affected by these new price changes. If your site is on an older plan, there should have been no changes to your billing.- As you pointed out, we have historically adjusted our subscription plan prices in a number of regional areas to ensure that WordPress.com stays affordable for folks in those areas. We will continue to do so. Looks like we forgot to do this for the new Pro plan. Thanks for calling this to our attention! We will get this updated ASAP.- Traffic limits will only be enforced on the honor system. If you consistently go over the cap month after month, we will let you know and ask you to pay a tiny bit more to cover the cost, but we will NEVER shut off access to your site, nor will we ever auto-increase the amount you&#39;re paying.- Our mission still remains to democratize publishing. We have no intention of ever removing older sites from WordPress.com. Even if you had a custom domain that expired, your site will always have a default WordPress.com sub-domain and your content isn&#39;t going anywhere.- The Pro plan you see now (at $15/mo) is essentially the the exact same plan as the old Business plan (which used to cost $25/mo). The only difference being the default storage that is available and a cost savings to customers of $10/mo.- We will be announcing affordable add-ons for both the free plan and the Pro plan to extend both your traffic and your storage as needed. In fact, we plan to also add a handful of affordable add-ons to the free plan to make it easy for customers to pick and choose which additional functionality they want, without needing to upgrade to the Pro plan.Again, thank you for sharing. I&#39;m sorry that I did a poor job of publicly sharing context around these changes, prior to making them. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s worth contemplating on Steve Job’s simplicity of marketing: Give consumers less choices. Cut down the number of SKUs and slim down the product line.Wordpress options at this point are just stressful. Do I really need to keep track of page views? It’s like the same absurdity when it comes to font licensing. Every time I want to buy a font, myfonts wants to inject a tracking script to track how many people visit the site. And then the same people complain there isn’t money in selling fonts. Simplify and give less stress to customers. Explain that in the marketing copy. For SaaS where the marginal cost is diddly squat, increase in sales will most likely offset whatever last penny you want to squeeze from customers.Marketing people just don’t get it. I’ve seen this happen in my own company, seen it first hand how it damages sales. Marketing that works with AWS doesn’t work with Wordpress. Totally different customer needs.Ghost blog guys do it better but it can still be simplified.Edit: I just checked https://wordpress.com/pricing/ – That looks very simple. Two choices, sorry for the rant, I was just going by the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the features WordPress.com doesn&#39;t offer on a free plan is a proper backup that can be restored to another WordPress instance. Posts/Pages/Comments and Media can be exported, separately, but for a proper backup you need to fork over $180.I have an old site on their $13/yr custom domain plan that I&#39;m probably going to let die this year because I don&#39;t wish to keep paying for it and it&#39;s not worth that hassle to restore to its original state on my own server."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Same. Half the people we hired during work from home are remote (that was never allowed before). Now all meetings are on zoom and all conversations are on slack. Being in an office is beyond pointless. It wastes time, gas, etc. the main take away from the past 2 years is working in an office is beyond stupid (at least for certain careers like developers). I drive to work, communicate with no one except on the computer, then drive home. So so so stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Forgive me for this digression and for sounding selfish, but as a junior, I’ve really struggled for the last 2+ years to fully adapt to remote / hybrid working.I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how I can continue to grow and become a top-class engineer within a remote environment?Based on my experience so far, it’s very difficult to both onboard and mentor a junior from a remote setting. It’s not impossible, however, a lot of employers / teams still have not setup effective means for including and training the less experienced members of the team. I realise that much of this learning is of my own responsibility but I really, really miss spending time with my team and learning from those more experienced than I. I feel as though I have stagnated an awful lot over the last two years and there’s only so far self-learning can take you when software engineering is such a collaborative process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the most frustrating part of being forced back to the Bay Area. Even before the pandemic, we always had distributed meetings, with people calling in from various buildings, conference rooms, phone booths, etc.So nothing changes between last month and this month, except that managers get peace-of-mind knowing I’m calling in from somewhere on the premises, and I’m back living in a place where I can’t afford a house.(I did have previous jobs where we worked on hard technical problems, and spending face-to-face time with a couple colleagues hashing out solutions at a whiteboard was invaluable. But that is not my FAANG job, where the whiteboards are rarely used for anything other than interview questions.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember many years ago coming across a reimplementation of the server side for a popular MMORPG of the time, reverse-engineered from the client (which was Flash) by what was likely a teenager --- it was over 100k lines in a single file, written in Visual Basic. Global variables everywhere, short names, and not even indentation. All the account data was stored in flat files, there was no actual DB. No &#34;best practices&#34; at all. Yet, not surprisingly, it worked pretty well and was actually not difficult to modify --- Ctrl+F would easily get you to the right place in the code.I guess the moral is, never underestimate what determination and creativity can do, and always be skeptical when someone says there&#39;s only one best way to do something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the days at Zynga, there was this ritual that new members of the STG (Shared Tech Group, which developed the game engine stack) had to try to refactor the road logic code.Suffice it to say, it&#39;s a 28k LOC file that was so bad, it could even hold up in court as evidence that a South American company stole the code of Zynga&#39;s -ville games. We could reproduce each and every single bug and its effects 1:1 in their games, with all the crashing scenarios that were easy to reproduce, hard to debug, and almost impossible to fix.Once you dig into the hole of depth sorting and being smart by &#34;just slicing&#34; everything into squared ground tiles on the fly, there&#39;s no way out of that spaghetti code anymore.Fun times, was always a joy seeing people give up to a single code file. The first step to enlightenment was always resignation :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So afraid to write bad, spaghetti code, I ended up writing no code at all.This thread made me realize that it&#39;s better to have a working profitable project with bad code, than a perfect unfinished  project, with meticulously chosen design patterns.Afraid   of being judged for bad code, I could not start until I had the right architecture.I&#39;m glad I read this.This is developers therapy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the story one of my university teachers used to introduce himself. He was the most brilliant educator I&#39;ve had, really passionate about making sure people could actually follow and so humble. The course was called &#34;Digital and Computer Technology&#34; and it was a first year course teaching you to build a CPU starting from logic gates and then program it with assembly.He said that when he had recently graduated and just moved from Norway to Sweden his first job here was as a technician for the local railway. One of his first assignments was a call where the computer controlling all the track switches had stopped working. Luckily there was a backup, but they needed him to fix it immediately.He arrived, took a look at the computer and its backup running next to it. He started out by measuring voltages on both, comparing to see what the difference was. After a while some men in suits came in and asked how things were going. He said it was all good, they said it wasn&#39;t because now all trains had stopped. Apparently, he had short circuited the backup.&#34;And that&#39;s when I decided to go for a theoretical career!&#34; My teacher happily concluded. The classroom was left in a stunned silence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While having algorithms and computers dictating every aspect of train movements, crew scheduling, resource allocation is efficient and in a sense optimal, I think there&#39;s something compelling to be said about having a system that can survive with human-rememberable patterns when such an optimizer fails.   That it can fall back on (or have at the core) simple patterns that people can still operate without algorithmic intervention.  I.e. the algorithmic tuning enhances at the edges, and isn&#39;t at its core some tangled non-interpretable system that someone can&#39;t operate without computer assistance.  The idea of a protected set of core routes and staffing patterns that operates without having to be computer-determined?I used to be so impressed at European train stations that they had a single sheet that would give the entire day&#39;s arrivals and departures, down to which track.   I assume that behind that were schedules that weren&#39;t so far from being hand-calculated with equivalent sheets that told people and equipment where to be at what times.I think we lose something when we jump so far forward that you cannot fall back gracefully without a system completely breaking down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My curiosity is killing me as to what exactly went wrong. And as someone living in The Netherlands I&#39;m also kind of mad at the apparent fragility of this huge chunk of our infrastructure. If this had happened on a work day, it would have been a real national emergency, rather than just a huge national inconvenience.I would appreciate one of those post-outage &#34;what happened&#34; reports like with the AWS and Facebook outages last year. But outside of IT I don&#39;t think anyone really expects those over here. And there might be national security considerations preventing such disclosure until any chance of a repeat has been engineered away, at which point everyone will have forgotten."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not sure a lot people know that Albini ended up washing his hands of his work with Nirvana. After the recordings were wrapped and the mixes were done, Kurt was really unhappy with some of the sounds. If memory serves it was the vocals and the bass. They ended up doing some overdubs and sharpening things up in the low end in mastering. The very thing Albini specifically said he didn&#39;t want them to do. I personally think the results speak for themselves. In Utero is a FANTASTIC rock record. I can&#39;t help but wonder what the original would have sounded like though..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great letter. My favorite piece of writing from Albini is &#34;The Problem with Music&#34; [https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-music] in which he explains how record companies were screwing artists in vivid detail, numbers included. The first two paragraphs alone are worth reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Other than a few technical details, most of it seems to me like DIY punk cliches and goes on much too long. But I guess they know the business better than I do, hired Albini, and made a hit record, if that&#39;s what they wanted.I though the sound on In Utero was too glossy. Listen to live Nirvana, including their official live album. Nothing in a studio, by anyone, can compare and with the live material available it has no reason to exist.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhYNe6yu0JMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGc8jL4dzaoAdmit it - you were sleeping.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty common actuallyAt Facebook too there was no staging environment. Engineers had their dev VM and then after PR review things just went into prodThat said features and bug fixes were often times gated by feature flags and rolled out slowly to understand the product/perf impact betterThis is how we do it at my current team too…for all the same reasons that OP states"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article has some very weird trade-offs.They can&#39;t spin up test environments quickly, so they have windows when they cannot merge code due to release timing. They can&#39;t maintain parity of their staging environments with prod, so they forswear staging environments. These seem like infrastructure problems that aren&#39;t addressing the same problem as the staging environment eo ipso.They&#39;re not arguing that testing or staging environments are bad, they&#39;re just saying their organization couldn&#39;t manage to get them working. If they didn&#39;t hit those roadblocks in managing their staging environments, presumably they would be using them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see how this can scale beyond a single service.Complex systems are made of several services and infrastructure all interconnected. 
Things that are impossible to run on local. And even if you can run on local, the setup
is most likely very different from production. The fact that things work on local
give a little to zero guarantees that they will work in prod.If you have a fully automated infrastructure setup (e.g: terraform and friends), then 
it is not that hard to maintain a staging environment that is identical to production.Create a new feature branch from main, run unit tests, integrations tests. Changes are 
automatically merged in the main branch.From there a release is cut and deployed to staging. Run tests in staging, if all good,
promote the release to production."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having been an interviewer at a FAANG for many years, I can explain some of the logic behind it. I&#39;m not saying this logic is valid, but it&#39;s how we got here, imho.First: we no longer trust the hiring manager alone, because probably they aren&#39;t a strong developer. We instead trust strong developers that are well trained at evaluating good devs. At the same time, we don&#39;t want to thrust a dev onto a hiring manager, so they also need to interview you too and have a say.Second: Is it really fair to have just one or two developers evaluate you? When I first was an interviewer, I liked everybody! I would have hired them all. So getting multiple data points matters. Best to have at least a couple dev interviews.Then there&#39;s the whole problem of needing to evaluate you on multiple dimensions. Can one interview really tell if you&#39;re good problem solving, coding, algorithms/data structures, and any specialization the role has? What about the soft skills aspect? We&#39;re going to need to have at least 3 or 4 interviews to cover all these aspects. These roles pay a huge sum of money, so there&#39;s a lot of worry that someone will be hired who doesn&#39;t really meet the bar, you know?But now we have a bigger problem: if we&#39;re going to invest 4+ people to spend an hour of time with you each, we&#39;d better have some data points that you&#39;re worth that investment. So maybe we need one or two initial interviews ahead of time to weed out any obviously unlikely candidates.After that, it&#39;s every other company going &#34;Oh shit, Amazon does 6 interviews? We should do that too!&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tech is very cargo cultish, which comes from having a young average age, and a strong survivorship bias in the media. Remember the Google brainteasers? Fizzbuzz? &#34;Culture fit&#34;?Tech companies have the lowest infrastructure costs of any industry, and so they have no place to hang their risk aversive paranoia except on personnel (the safer you are, the more trivial the things you fear).There&#39;s nothing logical about it, but since they have to fear something, it&#39;ll be whatever some douchebag with a following puts in their next &#34;XYZ considered harmful&#34; blog post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hiring manager here. IMO the current tech hiring norms are gross and not sustainable. It feels like a weird hazing ritual and with the current market, is the single biggest reason you can&#39;t hire. Why on earth would someone burn a weekend on a take-home test for your startup when they have 15 other irons in the fire? At my current employer we got rid of all that ridiculousness. No take home test. No live coding. We&#39;ve gotten the whole process down to a few hours over a few days. I&#39;d like to think it&#39;s a mutually respectful process.I think it&#39;s time we accept that the person we are talking to is who they say they are on their resume. You don&#39;t see accountants balancing books before they get hired. Why should this be any different? If you aren&#39;t who you say you are, its either blatantly obvious in the interview or we&#39;ll find out when you join and we&#39;ll try to correct or part ways. This is like pretty much any other job out there."</p>

I know it&#39;s drastic, but if companies can turn what should be a basic device into an amorphous system that starts serving ads without the end-users consent after purchase, that should constitute a material change to the end product that was not appropriately advertised.This is the exact kind of thing that consumer protection laws should be able to cover."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sadly it&#39;s a logical and inevitable consequence of giving up control over our technology.I think the answer has to be, simply never buy a TV that you wouldn&#39;t be completely satisfied with as a dumb HDMI display. Cos even if it&#39;s not abuse like this, eventually the built in functionality will break, or become too insecure to keep active on your network.In fact it goes for just about any appliance these days: whether it&#39;s your fridge, microwave, dryer, doorbell or anything else, if it doesn&#39;t have a &#34;dumb&#34; offline mode where you are still completely happy with what it does, don&#39;t buy it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m bothered by the description of the history of “junk” dna. Going by this article dna, researchers labeled it junk just because they couldn’t analyze it well and prioritized the easier 92% and thus didn’t understand it. Calling it junk just seems like trying to compensate for not understanding it like “I don’t understand it but that’s fine because it’s junk anyway”And the scientist quote seems so wrong. if missing almost 10% of something when that ~10% is not like the other 90% then it seems like a very bad assumption to assume that it doesn’t show a lot of important features.The quote: “ You would think that, with 92 percent of the genome completed long ago, another eight percent wouldn’t contribute much“"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“As it is assumed that there is an even distribution of bugs through all software, it is safe to consider any piece of software to be bug free once a certain number of bugs have been found”Lol genius. Anyone else ever do that thing where you write some good code and it works the first time you test it, but somehow that makes you feel less confident. Other times you write some crap code and it has several immediately found bugs but weirdly you emotionally feel more confident in that code because you “fixed” the bugs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blockchain can help with this. We can record all defects on the blockchain and have tamper proof evidence of those who consistently fail to adhere to this RFC. It will encourage developers to write bug proof code everywhere. Employers can further encourage developers to stop writing bugs by docking the gas fees from their paycheck. This works doubly so on devs who are blockchain &#34;non-believers&#34; because they desperately will not want to contribute to the heat death of our planet. (Those people clearly don&#39;t get the bigger picture. The colossal waste of energy will obviously be offset by the fact that code throughout the world will no longer have bugs and people will be more efficient.)This seems like it could be the one of the best thing to ever happen to the software industry in decades and has no possible chance of unintended consequences."</p>

We all know that it was some mistake by some AI. Even the author knows that.But we also know that the only way to get customer support from YouTube is to get some social media outrage.It&#39;s so common, Google should put on their website: &#34;If you need customer support, please try to create some outrage on social media.

None of the content moderation anywhere seems to have a problem with butts in thongs. Bulbed cylinders: bad. Smooshed jiggle orbs: good. Just no nipples."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not saying this is what&#39;s happening here, but here&#39;s a playbook I could see behind it:1. Automatic/ML/AI/buzzword filtering that is, in blunt terms, kinda crappy2. Preemptively and diligently correct for any such crappy decisions that would result in PR nightmares or credible lawsuits3. Apply some portion of your effort to reviewing some portion of the cases that appeal. Hope (nudge nudge, wink wink) that those cases that you couldn&#39;t review, because you simply don&#39;t have the resources to review everything in depth, are those of your &#34;enemies.&#34; You&#39;re not suppressing them; you just didn&#39;t have the resources to help them.Result: The system punishes your enemies by design and you and your enemies can just blame the AI and your front line support, which everyone already loves to do. People who are suspicious can be painted as nutjobs, because it&#39;s obviously just the unfortunate but classic case of the little guy against the giant indifferent bureaucracy.Thus any sufficiently influential entity can wield Hanlon&#39;s Razor as a weapon. You don&#39;t event need to plan for this; it is bound to happen. Parts 1. and 2. happening are foregone conclusions. When the opportunity for part 3. arises, I think people in all levels of the organization would quickly and tacitly realize that uneven review is in their best interest, if they don&#39;t just do it automatically out of laziness or tribal thinking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s interesting how different people view status, like the &#34;Harvard Professor or Homeless guy?&#34; quiz that used to get passed around.I grew up in one of the last WASP strongholds in the US and the more money you had, the smaller the house you lived in (up to a point).  People could afford insanely expensive cars, but would buy tasteful ones instead (excepting kids).Most people wouldn&#39;t be caught dead in a Ralph Lauren polo, but would happily wear a bleach-stained, rumpled Brooks Brothers shirt.  Outside of special occasions, people didn&#39;t dress nice at all - they dressed like they just came back from sailing.Engineering, medicine, and law were not considered high-status.  Well, if you wanted to work a job, I guess they were - but they were considered ordinary.  It was better to own something (but not work), run a non-profit, or have a PhD (in the classics, or whatever).  Most parents told their children &#34;I don&#39;t care what you do - but do something interesting!&#34;.  Being an artist was considered good, too.Fame, and appearing in the media, were about the worst things you could achieve.The biggest status indicator was how well read you were.  It is so deeply ingrained in me, that I still find myself more impressed by well read people than almost anything else, and I haven&#39;t lived there in over a decade.There are a couple of these strongholds remaining, where even the wealthiest people are not allowed to move to because they don&#39;t have the right last name, or can&#39;t trace their lineage to the Mayflower.If you removed these people and put them anywhere else, you&#39;d think of them as low status and strange."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Choose money and you’ll end up working all the time. Choose beauty and you’ll always want to look better. Choose fame and you’ll constantly be seeking attention.This is straight-up paraphrasing David Foster Wallace in This Is Water, just that DFW was talking about these things as de-facto personal religions that we&#39;re usually unconscious of. So the &#34;choose&#34; part isn&#39;t nearly that explicit in his view.The bit in This Is Water:&gt; If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you... Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure how this will sit with the HN crowd, but a couple of years back I got into menswear, and I derive some pleasure from being the &#34;best dressed guy&#34; at the office.Beyond personal opinions on that particular hobby, I can confirm first hand that living at the intersection of two or more personas (e.g. a programmer that dresses well) brings a peculiar sense of joy. I might no have much status in either of those categories, but bringing both together makes you stand out more."</p>

What the judge has done is send a clear message, that he won&#39;t sentence you on the merits of the case but will sentence you to serve his own agenda. The only message this sends is that justice has failed. It&#39;s always completely transparent who exactly gets made an example of, and who gets off with a slap on the wrist. We&#39;ll spend months hunting down every rioter in the London riots throwing the book at them and putting up massive billboards in city centres trying to identify them, but when a prominent tory steal millions from the tax payer in dodgy PPE contracts?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; There is no way for changes in the outside world—such as a new version of a dependency being published—to automatically affect a Go build.&gt; Unlike most other package managers files, Go modules don’t have a separate list of constraints and a lock file pinning specific versions. The version of every dependency contributing to any Go build is fully determined by the go.mod file of the main module.I don&#39;t know if this was intentional on the author&#39;s part, but this reads to me like it&#39;s implying that with package managers that do use lockfiles a new version of a dependency can automatically affect a build.The purpose of a lockfile is to make that false. If you have a valid lockfile, then fetching dependencies is 100% deterministic across machines and the existence of new versions of a package will not affect the build.It is true that most package managers will automatically update a lockfile if it&#39;s incomplete instead of failing with an error. That&#39;s a different behavior from Go where it fails if the go.mod is incomplete. I suspect in practice this UX choice doesn&#39;t make much of a difference. If you&#39;re running CI with an incomplete lockfile, you&#39;ve already gotten yourself into a weird state. It implies you have committed a dependency change without actually testing it, or that you tested it locally and then went out of your way to discard the lockfile changes.Either way, I don&#39;t see what this has to do with lockfiles as a concept. Unless I&#39;m missing something, go.mod files are lockfiles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most package managers have lockfiles. Yes, npm&#39;s decision to have both &#34;npm install&#34; and &#34;npm ci&#34;, just so you can confuse and mislead developers, is a bit silly.But Ruby&#39;s Bundler, for example, has been refusing to run your code if your lockfile is inconsistent for as long as I remember.Locking dependencies is, generally, a solved problem across most ecosystems (despite node botching its UX). Go doesn&#39;t get to claim that it&#39;s superior here.But of course, supply chain attacks are still possible with lock files. Because somebody is going to update your dependencies at some point (often for security reasons). And at that point you might be pulling in a malicious dependency which you haven&#39;t carefully vetted (because nobody has time to vet all their dependencies thoroughly nowadays).That&#39;s still an unsolved problem, as far as I know. I don&#39;t think that Go has solved it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The elephant in the room here is NPM, and I think the obvious problem there is the culture. I have a tiny app I&#39;ve been playing with using create-react-app. There are over 800 directories in node_modules. That absolutely dwarfs the number of any other language I&#39;ve used. Even in a medium sized rails app, you likely have some awareness of what every dependency is. It&#39;s just impossible with npm.One thought I&#39;ve had to &#34;reboot&#34; the npm culture is to somehow curate packages that are proven to have minimal and safe dependencies, and projects can shift to using those. I imagine there has to be some sort of manual review to make that happen."</p>

Many US cities have large stocks of older housing in moderate condition -- sure, it&#39;d take some money to get them up to snuff, but nothing near what new construction would cost."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a difference between affordable housing and &#34;affordable housing&#34;(tm) qualifying for a LIHTC.Affordable housing is simply developing new housing that serves the market you intend to serve. It might be more humble, etc., to make it affordable for that market.Part of the equation is realizing that there are also poor people who simply don&#39;t have enough to pay the rent on any place at all that is built according to building codes. Developers can&#39;t solve that problem, even with some kind of tax credit bible and tax consultants."</p>

Almost all interesting real world problems are non-linear to some extent, therefore, linear algebra is really the only tool we have to make progress on many difficult problems (e.g. through linear approximation and then applying techniques of linear algebra to solve the linear problem)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In high school, my friends and I managed to resuscitate a 914 that had been stowed away in a garage for over a decade. We towed it to the top of a hill with a pickup truck and attempted a clutch start after we&#39;d picked up some speed. None of us (especially me in the driver&#39;s seat) expected this to work, but amazingly it fired right up. One of my friends managed to jog alongside and jump into the car as I tried to keep it puttering along, and we ripped a few laps around the neighborhood. Soonafter, we stopped the engine and were never able to get it started again. Thanks for bringing up this memory. Cool article."</p>

I have absolutely no clue what this person is talking about and have no interest in cars, yet I read every single word.I love when people have such a deep knowledge of something that they can write an essay as unique and thoughtful as this. It reminds me of Kitchen Confidential, Surely You&#39;re Joking Mr Feynman!, or any rant about British politics by David Mitchell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story reminded me of the time I was trying to exploit a web app as part of a bounty programme.Unfortunately the application was so unstable that any attempts to SQLI, or really send any kind of malformed request would simply crash the entire site for hours, presumably until an admin came and restarted the server. DoS wasn&#39;t included in the programme so I never won a bounty. I&#39;m sure it could have been exploited, but it was simply so rickety and shoddy that I couldn&#39;t figure out how.Security through instability?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A single successful effort of unionization at an Amazon facility is more than symbolic: It will encourage -- and serve as a blueprint for -- employees at other Amazon facilities to do the same. Moreover, it will motivate employees at other large companies to try. This has been brewing for a while.It&#39;s possible we&#39;ll see a generational wave of unionization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Freakonomics ran a recent episode on unions [1]. A pair of interesting stats were presented near the start: the approval rating for unions stands at 70% in the US (even higher among the young) at the same time that union membership stands at 10%. Both numbers are at multi-decade extremes.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any coincidence that this success at Amazon comes right now. After the GFC all regulatory efforts turned to keeping financial markets solvent. That has meant unwavering support for policies that favor those with assets over those who don&#39;t.The pandemic happened in early 2020 just as the wheels were flying off the US economy yet again. So what would have played out got masked by many other factors, including direct government transfers.Those stimmie checks of yore are long gone, and it will be a very steep uphill battle to bring anything remotely like that back given the rip-roaring yr/yr increase in CPI and PPI now underway. Those checks are being blamed for the ongoing inflation that more than just the lunatic fringe now thinks is the start of Weimar-style hyperinflation.So with the 2/10 year yield curve now inverted [2], it&#39;s just a matter of time before the economic chickens come home to roost once more. Will it be different this time? Will unions step in to fill the gap that government can not?[1] https://freakonomics.com/podcast/do-unions-still-work/[2] https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/us-bonds-treasury-yields-inv..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When this has happened at individual Walmart stores in the past, the company would immediately shut down the store and everyone would lose their jobs. A couple years later they would build a new store within 20 or so miles of the old store, free of the union. This was obviously financially painful for Walmart, but it served as such a strong signal to employees to not even try to unionize that it must have paid for itself many times over given Walmart&#39;s thousands of stores. I wonder if Amazon has been taking notes from them on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One of the unfortunate facts about open source operating systems like Linux is that specialized hardware support sometimes lags behind commercial operating systems like Windows and MacOS.Well that&#39;s just because the manufacturer just doesn&#39;t write one, not because of some intrinsic factor of FOSS. That&#39;s an odd point to make when it&#39;s the manufacturers&#39; fault."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool! I always assumed the Linux driver was maintained as a best effort side project by Wacom engineer(s), not as an official endeavor.Overall, Wacom tablets work fairly well under Linux and have for quite some time. There are some caveats with what events the devices report vs what apps expect, but I think that’s smoothed out in the modern world of XI2, the wayland tablet api, and libinput.I’m not a passionate user of graphics tablets, but in my experience, Wacom tablets work better on Linux than Windows (and similarly good to macOS) partly because on Windows, they predate Windows having an input stack that can support pressure-sensitive graphics tablet pens. That arrived in Windows 8. Wacom had instead implemented a sort of defacto standard called Wintab, which they seemingly standardized with a company called LCS/Telegraphics in the Win 3.x days. In the modern invocation of this, the tablet kernel driver appears to act as a relay for hardware events, but those events get pumped back to a usermode service, and then wintab32 clients get them pumped into their event loops. Modern Windows has WM_POINTER* events, but it seems this usermode service is needed even for those events to work, probably so that wintab and WM_POINTER events can remain consistent, sync with control panel, and not fire over eachother. Still, it’s a shame.In the modern world, if you happen to have a USB tablet that speaks the HID digitizer API, Linux should be able to give you fairly good support straight out of the box, usually only lacking support for rebinding keys easily, controlling LEDs, etc. More tablet manufacturers have been choosing hardware that can support the HID digitizer class as it’s probably the only way to get graphics tablet support for Android devices. I found this to be the case with an XP-Pen device that I bought with intent to try writing a driver, only to find it spoke perfectly good standard USB, produced events in evdev, and plumbed through to Krita absolutely fine. To be sure, not all XP-Pen tablets will work this way, but some will. I’d guess ones that advertise Android support are likely to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been building prototypes with this. It is everything good web design should be– UI with good contrast, legible type and accessibility patterns.My only gripe is perhaps if their teams made example pages from their own use cases– sub-nav from the components page, charts/references from their Covid dashboards.Great work overall!"</p>

But why reinvent the wheel when the org-mode format is well established and does everything you want, and more?There are an increasing number of tools using org-mode as a plain-text data store, so you are more likely to be able to participate in a tool ecosystem. In addition to my own https://braintool.org see the list below. BrainTool (mainly a bookmark manager) has an elemental to-do system, I&#39;d love to have my users be able to use your tool for todos.NB see also Karl Voit&#39;s push for org markup awareness outside of Emacs via Orgdown: https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown.------

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am conflicted on this.The spec is nice. I love the recognition that dates may be imprecise (e.g., 2022-05 --  although I would count that as the last day of the period, 23:59:59 on 2022-05-31, rather than the first day of the next period, 2022-06-01). I like the thought that went into it and the nice presentation.On the other hand, I do not think this is necessary or even all that helpful in the real world. You don&#39;t need a standardized format if you are writing to do items manually in a text editor. You just write them. In the vast majority of cases no one is going to see them but you. Time spent conforming to a spec is time wasted.A formal spec also doesn&#39;t help much for apps to use this format. There is not a huge need for portability between to do apps, and for most users to do items are ephemeral and not something that needs to be archived and revisited. Even if an app adopted this, being tied to a plain text format would likely hinder feature development, including the ability to sync across multiple devices. Beyond that, different to do apps use different systems of categorization and tagging, so really in practice I doubt this will become any kind of standardized format.So, all told, it is a beautiful effort, nicely presented, but  I think it is unnecessary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This thread has (at least at the moment) serious Bob Martin Sudoku Solver energy to it. Tailscale has solved an infamously complicated problem using, for the most part, simple tools. They&#39;re not just successful; they&#39;re remarkably successful, spookily successful, upsettingly successful.Consider whether the secret sauce here might not be au courant database choices, but rather something much harder for random teams to pick up and run with: just straight up good design and programming.This is a thing that happens in other fields, too; some of the hardest dishes to cook seem extremely simple and have few ingredients. They&#39;re hard because there&#39;s no place to hide: your technique has to be flawless or they don&#39;t work. A famous entrance exam for new cooks at fine dining restaurants is &#34;make an omelet&#34;. Tailscale is, thankfully (and, to me, irritatingly), more like an omelet than a truffled hash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved this article, despite the negativity.A discussion that keeps recurring on HN is how you can get a lot done with simple, boring solutions. This is a perfect example of that in practice. What’s the simplest thing that’ll work? Do that, monitor the solution, and when you start hitting a limitation reevaluate what the next appropriate solution is.There are plenty of comments here deriding this as insanity when we have established best practices, but “best practices for me are not necessarily best practices thee”.People aren’t perfect, not every engineer comes fully-formed grokking the industry’s best solutions and their trade offs.This is what learning looks like. This is what an evolving system looks like. And this is how valuable software gets built every day.Who gives a fuck about scalability on a poc? “Let’s just put in a json file”. I Love it. Personally I start at the “use SQLite” step and go from there because SQLite is such amazing software. Thanks to this post I’m excited to try out Lifestream.You might rightly point out that Tailscale isn’t a side-project/poc anymore. But that’s exactly why they’re changing to SQLite and writing this post; this is their team learning to deal with larger problems and changing needs, and they’re sharing that journey with us.As long as they’re not _ignoring_ serious risks let them experiment. But try not to get too upset if they’re making different risk/effort trade-offs than you would. Even if it’s “objectively” the “wrong” thing.My rubric for technical sanity is:- are you taking (and testing) backups?- is your infra/data secure?- are you monitoring what’s happening?- can you recover from catastrophic failure in a acceptable time frame?- are you meeting your legal obligations?Cover those needs and you can be forgiven a lot suboptimal/experimental implementation details."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re using litestream [1] to replicate a SQLite database, which streams additions to the SQLite WAL file to object storage and can replay it back. This is fairly hands-off from SQLite&#39;s perspective. There&#39;s also the SQLite Session Extension [2] that is a built-in way to support generating and applying &#34;patches&#34;.I&#39;m curious how these tools will mature, it seems like a good match for microservices.[1]: https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream[2]: https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In terms of evolution through the donation and acceptance of information carrying material, the most bizarre ritual I have witnessed is that of Developa Linuxia:  git format-patch --stdout | mail

  ... | git am

It is recommended that this be seen in the wild. The beasts that exchange material this way are rare and ancient but we are fortunate that it is easy to observe them performing their rites.  They make a point of enacting them publicly, in open clearings know as mailing lists.  You will note that, in comparison to more evolved techniques, what first seems like clumsy fumbling takes on a primal beauty of its own.These creatures are aware of more modern practices and yet they choose to remain in their own evolutionary niche, in part, because they lament the way in which Developa intercourse has been cheapened and corrupted by an unmentionable website named “something”hub.com."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems fairly straightforward to me..when it is expensive to procreate due to restricted resources, procreation becomes picky. Birds are mostly monogamous because flying is very energy intensive and the male parent doesn’t want to waste resource on fledglings that isn’t his..obviously, exceptions exist. It is very costly to raise the young. Parental investment is high.It is different for birds that don’t fly. Water fowl especially have a different reproductive system. Because they don’t fly. This is true for all flightless birds. Even for birds like geese that only fly for seasonal migration. They get their food from the water. Ground dwellers have plenty of food and don’t have spend as much energy foraging for food as a bird that flies. Very few of them mate for life.Further: Galus Galus has different design than geese and ducks. Castrated roosters are called ‘capons’(French)…produces a nice soft fat capon for Sunday lunch. It’s genitalia is less developed than say..geese.As a chef, I knew how to sex identify geese/duck. water fowl  genitalia is different than fowl. Most farmers know this as sex determination is key to raising animals for profit. With the exception of Pilgrim/Emden/White Italian and some Chinese geese where the autosexing is straightforward with feather colouring and down colour, most have to be identified while they are still goslings.Goslings can be gender identified as early as the first week and also when they are adults. Male adult penis is invaginated and like a corkscrew. Female organs has genital eminence. The breeding ratio is 1:3 or max 1:5. So it’s important to separate them as early as possible.Mammals are different..example: feline penii is barbed and most copulation results in kittens. A female cat can have a single litter with multiple tomcats. Male cats will kill kittens ..probably those that aren’t their own..because a lactating mother cat won’t go into heat.With insects like bees and mantii, the male often meets his end after sex. It comes down to energy needs and availability of resources.P.S: [..] Birds, she thought at the time, didn’t have penises. In her two years studying them at Cornell University, a world leader in avian research, she’d never once heard her colleagues mention a bird penis.[..] Huh! Really? Cornell university scientists don’t know what a farm child picks up during one farming season? The article is full of red flags for clickbait lies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some points I found interesting:- Kristian Andersen offered to abuse his power as editor to stealthily edit a preprint. He is the main author of the most notable paper supporting a natural origin, and has been one of the major resources of the natural origins camp. Now his scientific integrity is seriously questioned.- Peter Daszak appears much more focused on finding new sources of grant money than on doing good science: &#34;What was needed, he exhorted his staff, was a “change in culture” as “part of [a] mentaility [sic] to get money,”- The Wuhan Institute of Virology is more of a second zone lab than a top lab: &#34;The WIV was also viewed as subpar, especially when compared with the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. Harbin was China’s Harvard, said the former DARPA official. The WIV was more like a safety school&#34;- EcoHealth Alliance and Daszak were seen by DARPA as amateurs in virology, not at all the expert frontline organisation that&#39;s been suggested before: &#34;EcoHealth Alliance was viewed as a “ragtag group” and a “middle guy,” a backseat collaborator willing to get on an Air China jet, eat terrible food, and stay in bad hotels&#34; &#34;EcoHealth Alliance had “bolted on” a serious scientist, Ralph Baric&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;The report he finally did submit worried the agency’s grant specialists. It stated that scientists planned to create an infectious clone of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a novel coronavirus found in dromedaries that had emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and killed 35% of the humans it infected. The report also made clear that the NIH grant had already been used to construct two chimeric coronaviruses similar to the one that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2002 and went on to cause at least 774 deaths worldwide. (A chimeric virus is one that combines fragments of different viruses.) These revelations prompted the NIH’s grant specialists to ask a critical question: Should the work be subject to a federal moratorium on what was called gain-of-function research?Wait what?! Is this new information ? Because this is incredibly troubling"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Article makes fun of how slow i2c is compared to the super high speed pairs next to it on HDMI plug.
Well, please note that there is a bus that is literally a thousand time slower than i2c on that same connector. It&#39;s CEC. Contrary to i2c it only occupies one wire rather than two though.
CEC, which is used mainly to power TV on/off or switch sources has a whopping bandwidth of 400bps. No missing multiplier.Maximum device name is 16B. If you have a TV, a tvbox and a game console, simply asking the name of those devices can take more than a second.
I&#39;m in the process of shortening my product&#39;s CEC name, in order to reduce congestion on the bus.Mainline Linux CEC developer jokes that Voyager 1 which is on the other side of solar system, made 40 years prior to CEC, is faster than CEC.Edit: Sorry for the atrocious original formating"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I nearly got taken by a scammer because Amazon transferred me to one.  I purchased a set of Reolink cameras on Amazon, (they&#39;ve been great) one of them failed a couple months in.  I contacted Amazon customer support (via my Amazon login and in their interface) and they wanted to troubleshoot with their technical team.  Eventually the (very helpful) Amazon technician suggested contacting Reolink for support and started a 3-way call.  The &#34;Reolink&#34; technician got my phone number and then said they wanted to call me back.They called me back a minute later (now without Amazon recording the conversation) and asked me for my NVR&#39;s serial number so they could connect to my NVR.  I was shocked they had a backdoor into my NVR but I figured I&#39;d let it play out.  A minute later the technician said that he was having trouble connecting because &#34;an internet virus is corrupting my firewall&#34;.  I was extremely confused and thought it must be a translation problem.  Until he kept insisting it was a problem and became belligerent and angry.  He said I needed to pay $300 to have an on-site technician troubleshoot the problem.  I got angry because he was making some weird excuse for their camera not working, and wanting to charge me rather than just ship me a replacement.  I refused and he started mocking me.  I demanded his manager and he ignored me.  Eventually I hung up and called Amazon back.The Amazon technician was helpful and shipped me a replacement.  I contacted Reolink via email to complain about their technician.  They responded that they have no on-site technicians and that it was a scam!I was blown away that Amazon would transfer me to a scammer.  I contacted Amazon again and let them know what had happened.  Hopefully they will figure out how their guy got this scammers phone number and teach him how to find a 3rd party phone number..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s one easy rule that could have avoided all of this - never give out any info on incoming calls. If I get a call or text about fraudulent transactions, I&#39;ll keep them on hold while I log into the bank website. If I get a call about a late payment, I&#39;ll thank them for the info and ask them to stay on while I pay online. If I get an inbound call with a more complex request, I&#39;ll ask them for their employee info and call back the official service number. It annoys the caller sometimes, despite always treating them professionally, but I keep that a hardline rule no matter how real it feels.I heard this from a security guy and was under the impression it was one of the sacred laws of security. If it&#39;s not, it should be - it&#39;s a rule of thumb that would stop 90% of social engineering attacks I hear about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It gets even weirder when your bank acts like a scammer. A few weeks ago I was trying to help my wife add her USBank credit card to Apple Pay and Apple Pay said I needed to call this number to finish setting up the card. So I call the number and the guy is very friendly and asks me for a bunch of identity verification details, which I provide to him, but then he asks us to send a code back that will be coming over text messaging - yes, I initiated the phone call, but I suddenly realize that the number Apple directed me to was not the same number on my USBank card. Being a bit paranoid I tell the guy “Look, nothing personal but I get nervous when people ask for a verification code to be read back to them, I’m just going to call the regular number and go from there, okay?” Instead of being friendly, this guy suddenly gets in my face and is like “Oh, you’ll give me all this other info but won’t read that code back to me? I’m Fraud Prevention dude, good luck getting this done calling the main number. Oh, and just for this I’m putting a block on your card.” I hung up immediately and called US Bank’s main number and asked to talk to a supervisor - sure as hell, it turns out the guy I had talked to did work in their fraud prevention department and actually had retaliated against me by locking my credit card. It was the most incredibly ugly thing I’ve ever seen from a customer service department."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s so much more to CI/CD than the build definitions (e.g. dashboarding, log viewing/retention, access control, manual interventions, secret management, test reporting, etc.) and while some of your points resonate very strongly with me (e.g. local builds), I can&#39;t help but wonder what the endgame is here?You&#39;ve raised $27m to what? Give away a free tool for engineers to define their builds in? While they continue to use and pay for another service to actually run the builds? I assume you intend to replace the CI service at some point and move up the stack to monetize?Without more transparency its easy to imagine something like...Step 1. Drive uptake of your tool by selling people on the pitfalls of &#34;CI lock-in&#34;
Step 2. Introduce your own CI solution, which people can now easily switch to
Step 3. Lock people in"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m highly jealous of teams that can containerize all their build tools.If you deal with proprietary toolchains that are tens of gigabytes (Windows WDK, Xilinx Vivado/Vitis) it’s just untenable, and that’s before even mentioning licensing. Even Azure doesn’t have a great solution for WDK development.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d like to see more attention put into carving out a subset of Mastodon&#39;s functionality that would allow you to host your fediverse node on a static site, à la blog feeds powered by RSS/Atom.The discovery problem can be handled pretty straightforwardly: if you want notifications of replies to your posts, then that&#39;s just another feed that you subscribe to—a separate service.  You don&#39;t exactly need an always-on &#34;instance&#34; providing an inbox endpoint to relay notifications to you.You give up private channels (DMs), but you gain a lot more flexibility.  It&#39;s a shame that there are so few server (and client) implementations for &#34;the fediverse&#34;.  We should have at least half as many options as we have in static site generators themselves.  (In fact, with this approach, your preferred static site generator could become part of your &#34;client&#34;...)Imagine your corner of the fediverse being reachable at $YOURNAME.github.io.Prior art: Fritter &lt;https://github.com/beakerbrowser/fritter&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Discoverability has always been a hot topic on Mastodon. Discoverability makes or breaks a platform, as there is nothing more important to retain a new user than to let them find something interesting to stay for, as soon as possible. In 3.5, we bring a new explore page which features currently popular posts, news stories that people share a lot, trending hashtags and follow recommendations. Furthermore, for the first time, we attempt to bring people content in their own language.An algorithm to rank posts and people? Did we learn nothing from twitter?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see new updates!I run a mastodon instance [0] (themed to look like Windows XP). Overall I really enjoy mastodon (and the fediverse in general), it gives the user an opportunity to carve out their own niche through their own instance, while still being able to interact with the overall system.There are still some challenges with setting up your own instance (I couldn&#39;t get the docker image working, the documentation for setting up a dev environment could use some improvement, and email confirmation is difficult without using an external service), but think this will improve over time, and there are managed services you can use to run your own instance.[0] https://lunadon.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a lawyer, i&#39;ve read this entire filing and it seems like nonsense at a glance.Krebs mentions the person was arrested. Ubiquiti claims first that he doesn&#39;t point out the person he sourced it from what arrested, and that he tries to mislead people by not saying repeatedly that the person is basically felon, and that being arrested makes him an invalid source of evidence, etc.  They also claim he describes him as a current employee.This is all nonsense AFAICT1. Krebs mentions the person was arrested.2. Krebs says &#34;In March, a ubiqitui employee said X&#34;. That was accurate at the time (AFAIK, and ubiquiti cites no real evidence I see that Krebs should have known it was not true).3. Krebs carefully points out the arrested person claims x and y (which is accurate).4. The filing says Sharp made false claims, and spends a paragraph explaining them.5. The filing says Krebs made them too, but ironically, for all of its bluster, doesn&#39;t cite where and when (that I can see), and which exact claims, they are claiming Krebs said that were false.6. The filing cites no evidence that Krebs knew or should have known, in March, that the claims were false.  They get into some weird arguments about their 10-q filing but it&#39;s hard to understand the point they are trying to make. It apperas they are trying to claim that krebs should have known they notified the public but i think that&#39;s kind of a silly argument - krebs is clearly talking about their users, and most users do not read 10-q&#39;s.  Saying you notified the public because you put it in a 10-q is like saying you notified the public because you put it in a classified ad section.  It&#39;s dumb wordplay.7. The December blog post they say he &#34;doubled down on&#34; seems again, carefully written to say what Sharp claims, not what Krebs claims.I could go on.The whole thing is, IMHO, not written very well.  It&#39;s very emotionally written for a pleading, and you will be hard pressed to find a judge who will get themselves worked up over that kind of writing. Instead they mostly roll their eyes and wish that someone gave them a clear and convincing pleading instead.Put another way - if there is a case here, it isn&#39;t visible on this pleading.  This feels like &#34;throw a bunch of emotional stuff at a wall and hope it sticks&#34;, where you really want &#34;here is an open and shut case of why this person defamed us&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems pretty close to textbook SLAPP in a jurisdiction - Virginia - that has strong anti-SLAPP laws [correction: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30867948 notes this is federal, and it has not been established if VA SLAPP laws apply] and  and precedent for their use. I am a fan of Ubiquiti gear but I hope they lose, pay Krebs&#39; costs, and pay a multiple of the costs as damages.https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1509374736903507974 is just an example of how well this is going over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The lawsuit, it seems like a grey area. Report on something but then further facts come out and your story is literally outright false. You&#39;ve been misled and abused by your source. I guess that&#39;s the job of a journalist to ensure what you are publishing is true.Flipside, there&#39;s a term named &#34;Krebbed&#34; for a reason. https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=krebbedKrebs has a history of poor journalism to say the least. Frankly, it&#39;s best to ignore Krebs. I stopped reading him years ago.https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/new-york-times-...https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/infosec-researc...https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/ex-wp-man-krebs...3 separate instances where Krebs got it wrong. Seems to happen a little too often.Seems clear to me, Ubiquiti got Krebbed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zulip is fantastic. It mixes the paradigms of IRC and email while providing a clean interface that runs beautifully in a browser. The Rust language developers use it and I couldn&#39;t imagine any better way to keep up with the volume of so many discussions across so many teams.However, the mobile app could use a whole lot of polish. I rarely use chat apps on my phone, but if I did then I wouldn&#39;t have nearly as good an impression of Zulip as I do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried [when is ambulance coming out], and you did correctly understand it was referring to the movie. But the result is strictly worse than the same search on Google (which also knew it was a movie, but actually gave an instant answer to the question rather just a IMDB link, and answered the question correctly for my location unlike the IMDB page). Bing also returned an instant answer, but their answer is even more wrong (the release was pushed back by a couple of months, Bing claims that the movie would be released at the future date of February 2022).Then I tried [will there be a wheat shortage this year?], and the top result was a lunatic fringe prepper blog, from which you extracted a confident answer that there will definitely be a wheat shortage. Google doesn&#39;t try to answer the question (which I&#39;d argue is correct for something this speculative), and only links to reputable news sources all of which look relevant. Bing is the same, but mixes in some more alternative results at the bottom of the page.Then, since you said that this worked best in a conversational manner I asked [is it due to the war?], obviously referring to the previous question. Rather than keep the context of that previous search in mind, you replied with information on the current local weather. (In Fahrenheit, for a location in Europe).At this point, combined with how incredibly slow the searches are, my goodwill would be gone as a real user."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good luck, I hope this works! Here&#39;s my initial feedback.1) The site needs to be much more visually attractive. On my 13&#34; laptop it&#39;s a gray chat box floating in a ton of white space. Not centered, no color, and the logo looks like it&#39;s from 1999. The other icons on the page look like something from an Android demo app. I would never ever land on this site and think this is something new or exciting.2) I asked &#34;Who is in first place in the eastern conference?&#34; and it did correctly infer that this was an NBA question (despite my UK IP address) but the top result it gave me was a mangled table from 6 months ago. The second result was a yahoo sports article which was more helpful.3) I asked &#34;how many covid cases were there in the UK yesterday&#34; and got &#34;the answer is about 16.5 million&#34;. That&#39;s off by about 100x."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wanted to say after trying out a few searches how blown away I am by this.The level of understanding is indeed not there yet to rival directly with competitors, but you’re doing more than a decent job on a lot of requests which is no small feat looking at the competition.Wishing you luck, and curious to see it evolve!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The &#34;STIR/SHAKEN initiative&#34; was supposed to fix this.[1] There&#39;s now a whole system with signed certificates, much like SSL certs, to sign caller ID info. The info is at least good enough to find out which carrier generated the phony data.You should file a complaint with the FCC that your carrier has not clearly not properly implemented STIR/SHAKEN, since they badly mis-identified the source of a call. While calls from outside the US can be unsigned, the carrier should detect that the number is inconsistent with the source.There are &#34;A&#34;, &#34;B&#34;, and &#34;C&#34; level of verification. &#34;A&#34; calls are probably legit. The others, maybe not.If you&#39;re in California, try making a personal data request to your carrier for the detailed STIR/SHAKEN data for that call.[1] https://commlawgroup.com/2021/stir-shaken-robocall-mitigatio..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your phone company knows the originator info of your calls and texts (or at least enough hops until they reach some even more untrustworthy than normal phone provider). They simply don&#39;t give you that info and instead show you an unverified caller ID that anyone can basically set to anything by whoever is contacting you.Blame your phone company and the FCC for not solving this (and for not providing you with the data to solve it yourself)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The good news is that Verizon has all these grand plans to intercept your browsing data and use it to target ads, but they can&#39;t even implement the most rudimentary spam protection on SMS, so I don&#39;t have high hopes that they&#39;re going to make any money by spying on everyone.One could argue that since the more messages you receive, they more you pay, they have no incentive to reduce spam; whereas with ad tracking, as long as they find some advertiser willing to pay 100 million dollars for a 1% increase on click throughs on their overpriced toothpaste, they&#39;ll have a financial incentive to do a good job.  So maybe we&#39;re actually really screwed.Sad that a cell phone company can&#39;t be just a cell phone company.  They were pretty good at that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first leadership lesson looked like this: as a junior engineer I had an abysmal quarter or two. My manager asked me what was going on. After I gave them an assessment of the situation, they said that they believed me and went to bat for me.Because of that manager&#39;s trust and belief in me even in the face of irrefutable evidence that I was doing poorly, I immediately became fiercely loyal to that manager and the organization, and I wanted to work harder for them.I&#39;m no 10x engineer, but any time I get frustrated with someone else&#39;s poor output, I think about this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overworking makes me think of falling into a hero/rescuer mode of the karpman drama triangle[1].Basically the idea is you can really disempower others if you constantly do the work yourself to rescue them from their own mistakes. And the other person can take the role of victim in the relationship, in need of rescuing instead of being responsible the consequences themselves. Or persecutor - blaming and casting out against others.1 - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main character is trying to do their job effectively, but can’t due to the low performance of a peer. They escalate to the appropriate manager to address the issue, but that manager transforms the performance issue into a relationship issue: it’s not that the peer isn’t performing, it’s just that the two of you don’t like each other.It is quite hard to find the line between performance issue and relationship issue. I ran into this myself when I had a new manager who wanted to institute policies that to the tech leads seemed nonsense, and I chose to not do what they asked. They took it as a performance issue to the +1 but the +1 turned it into a relationship issue and this was the right call. The problem is that by that time we were both so set in our view that the other was obstructing the way forward that we couldn’t find a middle, and eventually it came down to a hard choice which I “won” by pushing them out of the company. In hindsight I could have made more of an effort to build a personal rapport and get on good enough terms to find a middle ground."</p>
