								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is great overall, but there is some stuff you should do differently, if you&#39;re wanting to follow in the author&#39;s footsteps:1. Just use UPC connectors everywhere unless you have really good reasons not to.2. Use single mode fiber (SMF) everywhere, including internal wiring. SMF is infinitely scalable for future needs, multimode (MMF) is not. These days the cost differences for cabling and optics is negligible. In fact, SMF cabling is often cheaper than MMF. And no, you generally won’t have to worry about attenuating signal.Also, in my extensive experience, FS.com optics modules are typically better manufactured and more reliable than OEM modules.I resisted the &#34;cheap chinese&#34; modules for a long, long time, but then discovered that most of my uplink carriers used them.It&#39;s been years now. I&#39;ve had many Cisco OEM, Dell OEM, and a couple from another 3rd party manufacturer go bad, but I have yet for one FS.com SFP to go bad. I&#39;ve got several hundred deployed in a wide variety of environments, from great (cool, clean areas) to bad (hot, dirty areas)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always end up green with envy that people seem to have pre-existing conduits in their walls for running new cables.  There&#39;s no way, in my old house, of doing this without some invasive smashing in to walls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice read, and great work on the terminations.I did an extensive amount of both fiber and CAT6A in my recent house build, totally about 21 miles together. I did a mixture of single mode and multimode only because of some AV device support for multimode, and because all of it was so cheap compared to the labor and time.I ended up with significant fiber runs between the MDF and IDF closets, the server room, and all of the AV endpoints which is a typical layout. I did run single mode fiber to all 18 wireless AP access-point locations, but I suspect those will not get used much given I also have 2 CAT6A shielded wires to each AP that can support 10G AND provided power.  I do use a direct fiber connection in my office to provide 10G to my network core from that desktop, but that could have been done over copper as well.Perhaps the biggest gain over copper is my switch interconnects which are 40G from the upstairs closet to the server room.  If needed it would be easy to upgrade those to 100G, and since there are 24 strands available you really could expand as far as you are every going to need to go with WDM and the like.The one really good use case for only fiber was running it down my driveway to our gate, which is about a 1/4 mile in distance. That is something that would be more challenging to do with copper. [although I do have copper installed].From my perspective the cost of running fiber was almost 0 compared to the entire project because so much more cost is involved in path finding and clearing ( cutting holes, etc), and the actual pulling.  I was very fortunate to have a large group of friends who spent a couple of days working with me to do the large pulls, combined with many weeks of evenings and weekends doing the rest myself.  Many hands makes that task much much easier.My particular build is documented in a build thread:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It varies through regions. It is completely the opposite in China because:- No extra app. People scan the QR in WeChat (everybody has it) on the table, it will call a mini-app dynamically (somewhat similar to React Native but interpreted in WeChat).- You are putting orders directly.- You are paying within WeChat as well so it&#39;s seamless.- The app is smooth because almost every restaurant is using the takeout giant Meituan&#39;s mini-app.- Almost every single restaurants in China is tech savvy enough to use those systems because it&#39;s already a take-out centered society. Restaurants not leveraging these systems have virtually zero chance to survive the competition.- You don&#39;t have to wait for anything or talk to anybody in the whole process.The problems people mentioned in this thread:- Minorities, people without smart phone or those are less tech savvy, are left behind.- The walled garden and monopolies and such.These problems are real, but it&#39;s probably not the QR menu to blame, because it&#39;s a far greater problem - in China, you are not allow to go anywhere without WeChat and scanning QR code due to those draconian regulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it. It&#39;s annoying to wait for the waiter to come over with menus, it&#39;s annoying to wait to ask them to bring a menu back because you want to order more, and it&#39;s gross when you get a menu that hasn&#39;t been wiped down properly and is sticky with god knows what, and it&#39;s wasteful when they&#39;re printing hundreds of fresh menus a day for the places that give everyone a fresh one.Keep a few backup printouts for those who need them (like your phone gets no signal), but otherwise it&#39;s a fantastic step forwards. Goodbye to grimy wasteful printouts.Plus the bonus of never having to experience &#34;oh sorry we&#39;re out of that&#34; if they update the menus dynamically is fantastic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate QR code menus as they are often poorly implemented.However, I just experienced a QR code check for the first time.  That was really nice ..  I scanned the QR code with my iPhone, it downloaded the Toast &#34;app clip&#34;, which allowed me to pay the bill with Apple Pay.   It was totally seamless and far better than handing my credit card to a server to get lost or cloned."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I continue to be genuinely shocked that we don&#39;t treat touch screens in cars the same way we do as phones in cars (that is to say, it is literally illegal to use them while the vehicle is moving in most places because the distraction is such a danger). Moving away from tactile in-car controls has to be among the more boneheaded things we&#39;ve allowed that industry to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GM also has electronic primary door release mechanisms in their vehicles.  So if the car has no power, you can’t open the doors from inside.Granted, because of regulatory requirements there is STILL A MANUAL RELEASE… on the floor, near the chassis sill (and might be driver-seat only).  So you save money going to electronic releases, but still have to put a manual one in anyways.The glovebox is merely annoying (though I can think of edge case situations where it could lead to your death), but with the door release, there are documented instances where it HAS led to someone’s death:  https://jalopnik.com/texas-man-and-his-dog-die-after-getting..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hate the US penal system. I grew up a semi conservative individual. Good guys and bad guys. Three strikes and your out sounded great. Tough on crime. All of that.A couple years ago, I was asked by my faith congregation to serve as a volunteer at our local maximum security state prison, offering Sunday services to the inmates. I did so for 3 years. It changed me.We’re there some truly troubled/warped people there? Yes. Do I kid myself that their “stories” weren’t surely one sided? No.I was struck by how arbitrary the whole thing is. And how utterly ineffective it is. What troubled me the most is that we have outsourced    this whole raft of problems, without sending it overseas. We want “problems” to just go away. And stay away. And so we outsource the existence of human lives to an alternate universe that exists right beneath our toes. And we maintain fascinating opinions about these people and their lives, with almost zero insight into what the existence we consigned them to was.  When people heard I went to the prison every Sunday to visit with inmates, they would immediately wax their opinion about what it must be like. And I found over time that their imagination did not match my reality. Their can be no empathy in that scenario.I dream (pointlessly) about a world where a much higher percentage of lay civilians spent volunteer time in prisons. Awareness leads to empathy. And only then when we weren’t outsourcing the issue, we might actually be moved to find something more effective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a month in the hole. It wasn&#39;t pleasant.- I stayed asleep for as long as I could, whenever I could. Chlorpheniramine was readily distributed to prisoners.- Exercise was difficult for me after the first week, as was motivation for basically anything.- I read anything they would bring down there.- We didn&#39;t have a choice in the books we had, so picking something to study wasn&#39;t really an option. Outside of the hole, I eventually had an outside person send me a biochemistry textbook though. However, being autodidactic is difficult with a single reference.- No one talked to me in the segregated housing unit, except for correction officers and during the 5-10 minutes I was able to use the phone a day.- I didn&#39;t experience any prison administrators attempting to provoke any inmates. Although, the grievance system was basically a journaling activity.- I found it very difficult to write anything longer than a paragraph to anyone my whole time in prison.- I was a known atheist in prison, due to some reading material I received in the mail. Outside of the SHU, people often tried to engage me about my beliefs, which I avoided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So is prison meant to reform or punish? Life without parole clearly means the person will never renter society, so there’s no point in reforming. It’s just punishment. So why not allow the guy to read literature? Or is it because that would be enjoyable for inmates, and we want them to be punished? But the analogy of a tree falling in the woods and no one around to hear it is apt. I can’t think of a single time I’ve contemplated how prisoners are punished and thought “man it’s so great they’re sitting in there bored out of their minds, this makes my life so much better and I feel happy about it.”  They’re completely removed from society, they may as well be on Mars. It has no bearing on me or anyone else whether they’re having a good or shit miserable time. They will never leave, they will die in there. Can’t they just read a goddamn book if they want to?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wasn&#39;t aware of SAFe until one new manager got our director to loose his head for it and institute it in all teams.It was a total disaster.The idea of Agile is for each team to be responsible to improve their processes. Because improvement loops involving higher management are taking forever to complete and because each team has its own needs. &#34;Agile&#34; (quotes intentional) as practiced today is bad enough -- teams are not really improving their process, only implementing something taken from a book.SAFe is taking it one step further by absolutely obliterating team&#39;s ability to influence the process.At least with &#34;standard Agile&#34; it was possible for some teams to do the right thing, as long as they had a manager that understood what Agile really is.With SAFe that was gone.I was told that we can&#39;t even modify our t-shirt sizing because &#34;It has to be standardised, otherwise there would be too much chaos. BTW, we are definitely not creating a new request form to change t-shirt sizes in Jira&#34;Forget about changing any other part of the project. We had a bunch of testers and business analysts which did absolutely nothing but had to stay on the team because they were required in the process by higher management. We did not need them. I spent time hiring people who could do the work from discussing requirements with the business people through design, implementation up to deploying it to prod, but that did not matter.Talk about crazy projects..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SAFe seems to be a bit like &#34;internet scale&#34;, it&#39;s designed for very large organizations building very large single software solutions. Most organizations wildly overestimate their size and the size of their solutions. A Microsoft Office release probably can benefit from SAFe, an update to an auth microservice maintained part/time by a team of .75 FTE doesn&#39;t.SAFe seems to sort of be a micro-waterfall approach inspired by Conway&#39;s law [1]. It build massive communication and coordination teams so that this gets reflected into short-term development waterfalls that produce software that mirrors the system that managed it. But this team needs to be dwarfed by the development effort they are trying to push forward or they&#39;ll end up dominating all of the activities with largely useless communication and coordination activities resulting in very slow forward software movement, confused goals and priorities, and overstaffing of projects.Example: I once ran a team that was developing some internal tools for a large org, but we were outside of the main SAFe effort. At one point we became dependent on some service the SAFe effort was going to produce. It took 60 people 3 years to not produce a correctly working service. Exhausted with this, I finally just had 1 person build the service we needed as a stopgap. She spent 3 months building it with part-time support from one other engineer for a couple weeks. More than 3 years later that is the service that&#39;s still running and the SAFe effort never did manage to get a properly working solution out the door. I can think of half a dozen similar examples where the parallel effort by a smaller team with less organizational overhead radically outperformed the giant SAFe team -- and they did it mostly by just ad hoc communication channels between the small teams.1 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_law"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t forget the classic parody of SAFe which shows it as the overblown &#34;waterfall in agile clothing&#34; that it is: LAFABLE. https://www.lafable.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t say nice things about Oracle very often, but they deserve some praise here. Graal is a very, very ambitious project, and Oracle has been funding it for years. It&#39;s still rough around the edges, but it promises to enable new programming languages to run on a high-performance JVM, compiled to native code. Write-once, run anywhere, at native speed. And now they&#39;re donating it. It&#39;s very decent of them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GraalVM is truly great stuff.GraalVM native compilation helps Java in the data center to avoid being a cost sink and to reduce start-up latency. Oracle needs Java to sell enterprise software.Oracle contributing to OpenJDK may be required for Amazon cooperation (since Amazon is pushing its own JDK build) and probably helps the library ecosystem work towards native compatibility.Native support for reflection (used in many libraries) requires &#34;reachability metadata&#34;, maps of reflective API usage, at build time.  Anyone can do it, but enterprise requires authoritative sources.  Until authoritative reachability metadata covers the transitive graph of library+version dependencies in enterprise software, GraalVM native AOT builds are a PITA.- https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata- latest release: https://medium.com/graalvm/graalvm-22-3-is-here-jdk-19-build...- graalvm &#34;community&#34; roadmap: https://github.com/orgs/oracle/projects/6(As a side note: Mark Reinhold has run the JDK team since 1997: is there any comparable example of such stellar leadership for broadly-adopted software across multiple technical and organizational eras?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I refuse to praise Oracle for anything. But I could make an exception if they put Isolates in the CE version of Graal and not only the Enterprise one. :)Also, obviously Oracle didn&#39;t do this out of the kindness of their hearts, if they didn&#39;t contribute Graal into the OpenJDK the would risk to Graal never become anything other than a niche VM because most people, specially big clients don&#39;t want to change VMs and the CE version will be their new gateway drug to their Enterprise version of Graal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m sure not everyone came here to hear tech book recommendations, but I will add another vote for Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppman. It’s one of the best tech reference books I’ve ever read. It manages to explain SO much while requiring so little prior knowledge from readers.Another book that is relatively new that I loved was Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen. I worked in productionizing ML systems for 3 years and this book equips you with exactly what you need to do so. It does a great job of explaining the whole ML modeling pipeline and some of the commonly overlooked nuances that can cause your models to fail spectacularly in production. I will be referencing this book for years to come."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How the World Really Works by Vaclac Smil is one of the best book I&#39;ve read this year. It gives such a great perspective on how much energy and material we use.It&#39;s one of the most readable books by Smil and has gems like this :“Moreover, within a lifetime of people born just after the Second World War the rate had more than tripled, from about 10 to 34 GJ/capita between 1950 and 2020. Translating the last rate into more readily imaginable equivalents, it is as if an average Earthling has every year at their personal disposal about 800 kilograms (0.8 tons, or nearly six barrels) of crude oil, or about 1.5 tons of good bituminous coal. And when put in terms of physical labor, it is as if 60 adults would be working non-stop, day and night, for each average person; and for the inhabitants of affluent countries this equivalent of steadily laboring adults would be, depending on the specific country, mostly between 200 and 240. On average, humans now have unprecedented amounts of energy at their disposal.”My review is at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4708765021Another excellent book is Arbitrary Lines by Nolan Gray - which is a great book about zoning and why we should all be YIMBYs.My review is at :  https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4800787011How Asia Works by Joe Studwell is a fascinating look at why Japan, South Korea and China have done so well.My review is at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4806521204Another book I really enjoyed was Firepower : How Weapons Shaped Warfare by Paul Lockhartreview at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4417950705"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"- Conquest: Cortes, Montezuma, and the Fall of Old Mexico by Hugh Thomas , because he brings history to life and the story of the Spanish and the Mexica is stranger than fiction, more subtle and terrible than you might think, and has many lessons on human behavior applicable to today.- Ecclesiastes by Qoheleth: In my opinion, superior to Marcus Aurelius&#39; Meditations. &#34;Go, eat your bread with enjoyment, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already approved what you do. Let your garments be always white; let not oil be lacking on your head. Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life which he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.&#34; (Eccles 9:11)- Amusing ourselves to death by Neil Postman: We thought we had to worry about 1984 and big brother. We were wrong. We are living in Huxley&#39;s Brave New World where digital media has made us dumber, distracted and cut our connections with one other. Our smartphones substitute rosaries and entertainment becomes the dogma.- Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs by Hal Abelson and Gerlad J. Sussman: Need I say more? This books makes me fall in love all over again with programming every time I pick it up.- Nichomachean Ethics by Aristotle: What does it mean to live well? How can we be happy? Aristotle makes the striking claim that everyone knows how to be happy, but we have to create the habits that are in accord with reason and right judgement in order to get there. Also, happiness is not a state but rather the result of our active will and right ordering of desire. Required reading for any political leader.- Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser: Javascript frameworks come and go, language standards change, Computer platforms rise and fall, but math and the underling concepts of computation stay the same. Knowing what computation is, what its properties are, etc. will not only make you a better programmer but a better thinker. Church-Turing Thesis essential reading for anyone serious about algorithm design and analysis."</p>

It’s amazing that modern CPUs still use the multiplication circuits he created (along with his wife). Also one of several people that can claim to have created the first spinning magnetic storage!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to see some people are making it work living off these types of projects.&gt; I created a Patreon back in April of 2019. I felt a bit silly at the time, with thoughts like “who do I think I am” and “what am I even doing” echoing in my head. I still did it though. I was too curious to see what would happen, even though I expected nothing. Amazingly, a couple of people actually signed up!I&#39;m definitely relating to this experience. Feels hella pretentious and weird to set up donations. Was likewise surprised to actually get people sending me money. I guess the moral of the story is if you build cool things, people are willing to chip in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah, Andreas YT programming sessions. The length, the sincerity, the mood. The way he is able to communicate with us while being alone in a room. His very conscious effort to not get side tracked. And, of course, him just being a really effective programmer, while not being flashy or pretentious about tech or tooling in the least (and also probably because of it).Sometimes I watch and listen intently, and learn a lot. Sometimes I zone a little. It&#39;s perfect. If you are interested in programming in general I can just highly recommend checking it out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for sharing Andreas! It&#39;s absolutely phenomenal how far along SerenityOS has come and it&#39;s also a peek at how FOSS is supposed to be - a way to learn, hack on something fun, share it with others but without any huge expectations.Building the next unicorn is awesome and all but in my opinion, this has it&#39;s own place. I am glad some people out there get to work on their dream projects and actually can make a living out it. Kudos to all the supporters, obviously.I also love how focused SerenityOS is and what kind of audience it caters to. Some people might say, &#34;make it for everyone&#34; but that doesn&#39;t work most of the time. Having a focused audience allows a lot of freedom in the way of UX/DX, docs, communication etc. So I am glad Andreas set that down upfront."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In this particular case, I suspect a trademark complaint against Google would make sense.Google misrepresented the ad as the product of the Gimp project, and were paid as a result.  They usually use an &#34;obeying the law would not scale&#34; type argument in court, but that would clearly be bullshit in this case.  They have a business relationship with the ad buyer, and should have verified their affiliation with gimp.org.  Also, a simple string match on the URL would expose the attempted fraud on Google&#39;s end.I&#39;m not sure how to check if Gimp is a registered trademark in the US.  This page kind of implies it might be (or that the author of the page does not understand trademarks):https://www.gimp.org/about/selling.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is also a huge issue with Blender and pops up on /r/blender from time to time.(Here&#39;s a few random recent examples: https://redd.it/xxkx5s https://redd.it/vvrxko https://redd.it/xwkky8 https://redd.it/vuqu1r)Ad networks and content providers get up in arms over widespread ad blocking but then allow stuff like this through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think people are missing the actual issue here. Google used to have a clear distinction between what&#39;s an ad and what is organic.In these screenshots you have to pay good attention to see the top result is an ad.To keep their conversion numbers up they had to constantly reduce the difference between the ads and everything else. The fact that they can do this and we are so used to it that we don&#39;t first identify that as the culprit is quite interesting.I have ran a few Google ads in the recent years and the people who come through them, some of them, clearly have no idea that they have clicked on an ad. This might be good for business but I think it does more harm overall."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have said this countless times, and I will say it again - it is just marvelous how Lichess provides so much value being completely free (both libre and gratis).I would love to see more publicity of Lichess though - and seems like this move will help in that regard.I don&#39;t know for sure, but is there any other chess organization in the world of this scope that is truly non-profit? Sure, FIDE itself is non-profit, but profit-motives of its commercial counterparts and allies are controversial, to say the least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I think a US non-profit makes a lot of sense, I would exercise caution with the non-profit board.The board’s job is to provide oversight and to appoint a director [1]. In this case it would clearly be Thibault, but what happens in a few years when Thibault is ready to go? Does he have say in his replacement? Does the French organization take precedent over the US nonprofit when it comes to leadership and governance?I say this because Lichess is extremely valuable (even as a non-profit) and that will attract the wrong kind of people. Thibault should take every precaution to make sure he retains control of the org, with good people around him. I’m not sure if there is a non-profit equivalent of retaining voting rights, but I’d want to be sure he retains control until it’s well established as a non-profit and a succession plan is in place.The wrong board could evaluate his performance (which right now he says he works at his leisure and loves what he does) and say “we need more fundraising and appearances in the US at tournaments” and he could balk / want to focus on the product. They could then look to appoint a US director of the nonprofit and things could get awkward and extremely costly.It’s incredible what has been built and maintained with a small team. I think they will see extreme diminishing returns after they hit a certain level of governance. Whether that’s going international with a nonprofit status in the US or at another point is beyond my level of expertise.If someone more knowledgeable that I am can correct what I’ve written above and point out that my concerns are overblown, I’d be happy. I’d also ask that person to volunteer and help Lichess establish a presence in the US.[1] https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/board-ro..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Therefore, in 2016, Lichess was formally registered under French law as an association loi 1901. This type of association applies to groups with clearly defined purposes that benefit the public, similar to charities. However, it’s quite easy to form one - the total number in France is over 1.5 million!It is surprising that Lichess is a French charity, much like VLC. France also has a very low entry barrier for forming an LLC, so it seems to be a rather good approach all things considered.&gt; once we become an association of general interest, our French donors will be able to make tax-deductible donations, meaning they can reduce their individual tax burden through supporting us. In theory, this should also apply to donors who are citizens of other EU countries, but the last bit of legislation supporting EU-wide application was passed in 2009 and we’re still waiting for it to be cleanly implemented. Classic EU.It really is a running theme that EU member state governments have to be dragged kicking and screaming to implement beneficial EU directives as local laws while they at the same time blame the EU for everything unpopular they do themselves. If that&#39;s not a clear indicator that the Parliament should have more authority to assert itself I don&#39;t know what is. At least we get the &#34;project funded by the EU&#34; signs on random buildings to not make the good stuff completely invisible on the local level."</p>

Cars and spaceships on a closed network are fundamentally “clean” compared to having hundreds of millions of people who produce dirty and often adversarial data.But I guess the point of this exercise isn’t really to judge code quality, but to drive fear at Twitter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t at all object to code reviews/evaluation, but the thing I wonder about is this: I rarely open an empty file and write some big block of code. 98% of the time I&#39;m fixing bugs in legacy code or shimming in some new feature. It would be trivial to produce the diffs I generated in the past 30 or 60 days, but the volume of code isn&#39;t really a great metric for my productivity.There may be some three line change that was the result of eight hours of debugging and analyzing how to best fix the bug without disturbing the stuff that is working. Is that more or less productive than someone who cut &amp; pasted a 100 line routine they found via google?"</p>

Anyone who has contributed to the gitea project more than 2x PRs is invited to be a maintainer. Every maintainer gets 3 votes.
Maybe there are some suggestions for improving - please open a PR.&gt; Describing the ways in which democratic decisions are to be made.Again, I&#39;m just confused what&#39;s being requested. Moving on.&gt; Providing accessible places where all relevant information can be found.This seems like the same request as above. Or maybe a request for better documentation. I agree. Open a PR, don&#39;t fork gitea.&gt; Establishing a DoOcracy that works and continue to improve it.I agree with this and I suspect that was the intention with the original reference to DAOs, but needs to be clarified.&gt; A non-profit organisation owned by the Gitea community is created.
&gt; The Gitea trademark and domains are transferred to the non-profit.
&gt; The name of the company is changed to avoid any confusion with the non-profit.Does anyone have experience with how this is typically handled? It seems like this is the only actionable request. What are some examples of non-profit open-source companies? Is that typical?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the story from the announcement[1].&gt; We have a long history of trying to bring Factorio to other platforms, including consoles and mobile phones (not including April Fools). We even worked with some external companies, but the projects never even got to the point where they would run technically, let alone the complicated part of making the game playable using controllers or touch screen.&gt; We had some history of starting Factorio-related sub-projects that ended up in development hell for yearsThis reminds me of their post on good foundations[2].It sounds like they discovered the pain of growing tech debt and paralysis due to an aging stack, and the lack of results when you throw money at the problem (in other words, contract work to some external entity).What&#39;s also interesting is that this work ended up being a one-person project. It&#39;s just too hard to make progress fast when you add people to a project: people don&#39;t agree, they need to communicate not to overlap or to understand the changes added by others, this all slow things down. And if the stack is complicated, this can really put a stop to productivity.I think there&#39;s a real case for having one-person teams for the first X months on a new project. As long as the one person understands how they can later scale themselves.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure why this pops up now, nothing new afaik, but I&#39;ll take this as a chance to leave a quick review ;)I bought one during the kickstarter, mostly for note taking; but also as a ereader &amp; perhaps drawing tool.
- For note taking: I prefer a simple paper notebook, as my notes are more procedural. I don&#39;t really look back often. It&#39;s fine. Just not better then paper for note taking imo. 
- As a e-reader, it is absolute dog shit. period.
- If you are not artistic, this will not change that
- The subscription model is terrible, I&#39;ve cancelled my &#39;grandfathered&#39; account and tried to sell my rm2 over it.
- Currently using it as exceedingly expensive notepad, no cloud crap etc.
- Battery life is kinda meh, either you have it go to standby and have to wait a few second to use it. Or it is constantly empty when you want to use it. Not the eInk experience I had expected.You can install custom software, as it is not locked down, that might solve some of these issues. I haven&#39;t tried. For me, this is just a notepad. And not a great one at that. I use it mainly because I paid for it tbh.I have several friend that have one too and enjoy it much more, but this how I experienced it, ymmv obviously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am one of the original kickstarter backers and got mine at a very favorable price compared to what they are selling it for now. As a original kickstarter backer they also provided me with a free tier for their subscription service so I am not paying anything extra to have full functionality, this is very important to me because I am not very excited of subscription based software features - remarkable please take note of this!The remarkable unit is still a thing of beauty. It excels at what it does, and I bring it with me everywhere. I use the cloud features to pick up documents and use it to hold my PDFs and eBooks and it is an important device for my note taking. I have modded the unit a little bit by replacing the original back-ground pictures. To be able to access this device as root appeals very much to me, I very much feel in control of my device.From a security point of view, they still have some work to do. It is embarrassing when the unit goes into sleep mode and private notes are kept visible to everyone. I created a ticket in they support system, but they don&#39;t seem to take it seriously. There is also the issue with only having a 4-code pin to unlock the device. This means that you must be very careful with what you write and store on the unit. Sensitive notes should not be stored on the unit.There is also no way to deprecate the unit and the content if it is lost or it hasn&#39;t check in against the cloud.The software that is installed on your PC/Mac has very basic functionality.Overall, would still strongly recommend, 8/10."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought a rm2 a while back but abandoned it when I discovered it had extremely weak security: no fde, a weak remotely-resettable 4 digit pin, no local file syncing (doesn&#39;t appear as a mass storage device when plugged in as a usb, doesnt support standard file transfer protocols), non-e2ee (!!) cloud syncing (their company can see my notes unencrypted).Now I use an android tablet that I locked down + synching and i couldn&#39;t be happier. The only thing I&#39;m missing now is a good note taking app that writes my notes to a directory that can be synced with synching. Recent versions of android broke this for all apps except Google&#39;s Files app unfortunately."</p>

My understanding is that currently if you can&#39;t install Tailscale on a client you need to use Subnet Router.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Going off on a tangent, but the scale of production is very hard to grasp.  I&#39;m probably not the first person to observe this, but I once did some napkin math about steel production, and what I realized kind of blew me away.  About 1.9 billion tonnes in 2020.  Like with billions of dollars, I have no intuition for such numbers.  Context is needed.Global steel production just before WW I was about 70 million tonnes.  So production has increased about thirty-fold in one century.  That wasn&#39;t so shocking to me, at first.  But 1910 was not the beginning of the industrial era; things had been under way for more than a century then.  Railroads.  Ocean liners.  Factories.  Knives and rivets for fabric owned by hundreds of millions of people.  Dozens of skyscrapers in New York by then; the Brooklyn Bridge hung on thousands of tonnes of cable.  All made out of steel.Then it struck me.  A few million tonnes a year in 1850.  70 million tonnes in 1910.  All of it adds up to less than 1900 million tonnes.  Every single tonne of steel manufactured by humans from prehistory until about a century ago -- the entire output of the industrial revolution -- amounts to less than one year at current production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The sad thing is that 100 years ago humans and livestock accounted for around 5% of the biomass (all zoomass, not land mammals only), 95% being the wildlife. Now the numbers are reversed.We&#39;ve stolen the land from the wildlife and dedicated it to a few species we consider edible (agriland is more than forests now, and 75% of it for animal agriculture).Is anybody surprised that we&#39;re living in the anthropocene, defined by massive die off of wild species?We have to (as a species) return the land to wildlife and let it repopulate the earth, otherwise we&#39;ll lose them. We don&#39;t even know what gems we&#39;re losing. I&#39;m not talking about some bugs, but about dna - those are millions of years of (computer) code generated by nature, code so precious we don&#39;t even have an idea how to simulate it, let alone understand it (at this point in our evolution).If we lose it, goodbye new medicines, new regenerative dna techniques, new technologies, and who knows what. We simply cannot know what we&#39;re stealing from future humans (this point was made for the selfish humans we are, better arguments could be made)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lets take in mind that there is a problem to compare two groups when one group is much easier to measure than the other. The error interval in the mammal biomass should be much higher. The actual real values are probably not so extreme.... I see, is just megafauna. The most competitive groups (rodents and bats) are deliberately excluded. The title is incorrect then."</p>

Early adopters and hackers really did some great work using the API until they walled-gardened it and rate limited it to make it unusable.  They need to do this for goodwill at the very least, but I think it will spark the fire to make it popular with techies again.Based on the recently published discovery chats we will probably see:* High def video* Focus on music publication* The highest revenue sharing cut from any social media platform for content creators to get people to switch.* Removal of twitter blue but some kind of subscriptions to edit tweets* Paid push DMs to followers (e.g. follow this account for drops, then the tweeter has to pay to tweet to this group)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the spirit of trying to be high-information and add value:Where Musk is going, there are no maps. So it&#39;s very very hard to project. But we can predict likely developments.At a very high level, it&#39;s going to involve: bringing back controversial personalities like Donald Trump; increasing Twitter&#39;s commitment to &#39;free speech&#39;; assuaging skittish advertisers; retaining users who might be concerned, while bringing in new ones; managing the exodus of users (size:?) that will happen regardless; cutting a large amount of staff, while keeping Twitter&#39;s lights on; open sourcing the code, discussing the impending rearchitecture; and - long term - folding this into Elon&#39;s vision of America&#39;s WeChat, and ultimately expanding Twitter, under X.com.That&#39;s a lot. But at a high level, I think that&#39;s correct.I would expect Elon to take the fight to the media. Whether he&#39;s going to focus on neutrally spreading a message, going more on the attack on media outlets that would support him, or doing something in between, is unknown.Musk has an unusually large amount of media power: that&#39;s his unique value add, in a way. I would expect this to be a &#39;bigger deal&#39; as a story, as multiple stories, than I would for any other company undergoing a takeover. We&#39;ll be hearing a lot more about Twitter in the weeks to come, since the developments will keep piling up, and the press/public loves to read &amp; discuss stories about Twitter &amp; Musk.We&#39;ll see how it goes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"~5 years ago, I hired three Indian developers. They asked me if we could set up an Indian legal entity, so that they could just get regular salaries in India with tax payments, deductions etc taken care of. I agreed and we got it done.One of the worst business-decisions of my life. The amount of red tape, stupid rules, corruption, signatures, stamps, showing up physically in a certain office etc etc... Mindblowing.I will not tire you with all the details, but to this day, Indian tax authorities still hold money hostage, that they agree my Indian company is owed (GST refunds). But all attempts to actually get the money back falls on deaf ears. We have sent experts to the relevant tax offices etc, but the ONLY guy who can handle it is never there, refuses to deal with it, then says we need to go somewhere else - where we are sent back etc etc. Sent around in circles, basically - with everybody recognizing the money is in fact owed...I will never do business in India again. Happy to work with Indian developers (I still do), but they will get paid as freelancers and deal with the red tape on their end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"India&#39;s obsession with paperwork is unceasing and baffling. Everything requires an application, even when everything can be done digitally. You need letters and stamps to get anything done.Case in point: the &#34;company stamps&#34; that are required for everything you do with your business. From getting a debit card to changing the maturity instructions for a corporate deposit, you need to sign your name AND stamp it with your company stamp.The company stamp can be made by anyone for $1-2. It has no bearing on security at all. Yet, you need to carry it with you if you want to get anything done.It&#39;s utterly baffling. I can access my corporate bank account online and make any number of transactions, yet if I want to apply for a debit card, I need my company stamp and signatures from all directors.Why? I have no idea!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is my competing take:The biggest problem I see in developer communication is what I call the &#34;assumed context&#34; problem.As in, you talk/write to people as if they know all about your code, except the detail being discussed. In reality, they usually have much less detailed understanding, and you&#39;re making no sense to them.I&#39;m pretty sure this is related to people &#34;on the spectrum&#34; often having low &#34;theory of mind&#34; capabilities. People without that will just assume people know what they know, and proceed to fail at communicating with those who don&#39;t.It also makes it easy to think of those who don&#39;t know what is obvious to you as idiots.The workaround, if you want to communicate with the idiots surrounding you, is to start conversations by fact finding. The question &#34;so how much do you know about the flurbigator system?&#34; can help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has little to do w/ being a developer vs. being human.People joke about the programmer in a dark corner plugging away and never talking to others, but that&#39;s actually pretty rare. In 20 years I&#39;ve only worked with a handful of developers who don&#39;t want to socialize, collaborate, or solve problems together.The truth is that people - regardless of discipline - generally all want the same things from their work: to work on something meaningful, to be productive, and to be recognized for that work (both output and input).That&#39;s pretty much it. If - as a leader - you can do those, you&#39;re going to generally have rather happy employees.When it comes to this article, the issue is that there are a lot of people who believe that documentation and effective communication ARE necessary, but that work ISN&#39;T recognized, and (because it isn&#39;t recognized) steals time that could be spent being productive doing something that is.If you want effective communication, documentation, etc. at your workplace, it&#39;s incumbent on leadership to create that culture. Nurture it, get better at it themselves, and help those less eloquent to find their [written] voice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who went from engineering to product management, partly due to having developed a skill of communicating effectively in writing and in speech, I would suggest perhaps the most important part of communicating effectively is storytelling.  If what you are sharing does not have a clear and obvious narrative arc, people are going to disengage quickly.  This is not necessary for short bursts of information in a high-context environment, but any time you need to level set and share context before communicating the critical information, you should do so in story fashion.If you want to level up your technical communication, I&#39;d highly recommend taking classes in creative writing, participating in things like NaNoWriMo, or taking a class in improv comedy/theater.  All of these things emphasize construction of narrative arcs and how to draw people through a story, which are essential communication skills. This gets more important the farther up the chain of command in a company you are communicating with."</p>

As of this writing, that includes the Origin-Private FileSystem (OPFS) [0]This is really good news, and exactly what the OPFS was designed for.You may have seen “Absurd SQL” [1] which was a proof of concept for building a SQLite Virtual FS backend using IndexedDB. It provided full ACID compliment transactions. Incredible work but a hack at best.The OPFS supersedes all that and makes it possible to have proper consistent and resilient transactions.WASM SQLite with the OPFS is the future of offline first web app development. The concept of a single codebase web/mobile/desktop app with proper offline storage is here.What I really want to see next is an eventually constant sync system between browser and server (or truly distributed with WebRTC). The SQLite Session Extension [2] potentially has the building blocks needed for such a system.0: https://webkit.org/blog/12257/the-file-system-access-api-wit...1: https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql2: https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not about the colors, FYI. This is about someone referencing a specific Pantone product as a spot color. And the automatic conversion from that spot color name to the regular RGB / CMYK color values is now gone. But if you embedded the actual RGB/CMYK values into your file, then it&#39;ll still open just fine and display those colors just fine.Edit: Also, converting from Pantone to regular RGB/CMYK is a lot more lossy than one would think. If I reference a Pantone product, that pretty much covers all properties of the printed surface, including things like reflectivity angles, fluorescence and phosphorescence. A cheap xRite will already measure reflectivity in 13 wavelength bands. And then it&#39;ll average those 13 characteristics into 3 RGB numbers. Professional color measurement tools can have hundreds of properties per ink type, thereby making reduction to 3 values even more lossy.If I give you RGB, that merely specifies the color at direct reflection under normal light. If I give you a Pantone ID, you also now how it&#39;ll look from the side or under UV light. RGB specifies an averaged wavelength mixture, Pantone specifies a chemical ink mixture.Edit2: You know these car paints that have fresnel reflections, meaning they appear to have a different color of you look at them from a different angle? That&#39;s an excellent example of a case where you need to specify a specific ink type like Pantone, because the RGB value changes based on the viewing angle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The comments here seem to be mostly litigating whether Pantone ought to be allowed to license colour names. To me though, the scandalous thing about this is that a piece of software which you paid for can work fine one day can stop functioning the same way the next because of a change in the vendor&#39;s license agreements. Like imagine if you bought a song which uses samples and one day the backing track just disappears because the artist didn&#39;t renew the sample clearance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are in the USA, then what you received are unsolicited marketing phone calls under the TCPA, a law which allows you to personally collect up to $1500 per violation of the law or associated regulations, per phone call that you received. If your personal phone is on the federal &#34;Do Not Call&#34; registry, it&#39;s possible that there are at least two violations of the law per phone call you received.I would suggest sending a demand letter to Meta&#39;s legal department offering to settle for somewhat less than $1500 per violation. Here&#39;s an example: https://www.junkfax.org/w/images/0/0b/SampleDemandLetter.pdfIf they ignore you, be prepared to file a local case in small claims court (which you can do yourself without an attorney). The court can force them to pay you if you present evidence of the calls and the law(s) or regulations that were broken.Disclaimer: I am not a laywer and this is not legal advice, but I have collected money from TCPA legal settlements in the past, each without needing to go to court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to be clear...You&#39;re absolutely sure, 100%, this is Meta employees themselves calling you? And Meta sending you e-mails?Not spammers, of which there are many, and they get your contact info from all sorts of places? And which often lead you to believe they&#39;re Meta when they&#39;re really just scamming you or trying to sell ad placement consulting/optimization services?Because with &#34;multiple&#34; calls and emails... this sounds like 3rd-party spammers, not something Meta does. And while Meta has been loose in the past with walling off information internally (to put it mildly...), it&#39;s not like they sell your contact info to spammers or anything (simply because it&#39;s not worth the effort, the money&#39;s way too small for a company of their size). Third-party spammers, on the other hand, will get your personal info from anywhere and everywhere.For you to make a credible claim that Meta is using your 2FA contact info for marketing, you&#39;ve really got to be sure that it&#39;s 1) actually Meta contacting you and 2) that they got your phone number specifically from 2FA and not just from looking it up publicly the way salespeople do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a feeling that Meta has some kind of internal system for slurping up everyone&#39;s contact info, and that some kind of bugs/criteria occasionally cross some streams.Meta recruiting somehow got a hold of my name@amazon.com employer email -- which I have never posted publicly -- and started sending me recruitment emails to my work email. This struck me as incredibly unprofessional, though I understand it&#39;s almost certainly an automated system doing it.I still don&#39;t know how they got the email address (though I guess it&#39;s just lastname+first initial, so they could have guessed?). I may have DM&#39;d it to someone in a FB messenger chat? Maybe I used it in an &#34;work email&#34; field during sign up for some industry conference whose data later got hacked? A colleague accidentally merged their work/personal contact list and uploaded it somewhere? Who knows."</p>

Not just release the hounds.Keep the advertisers happy, but try to reduce the reliance on advertisers.  Keep moderating content to reduce abuse, maybe eliminate the high profile banning but a person on the ground will have largely the same experience. (probably less action on more contentious issues, but you still can&#39;t use racial epithets and call for violence).  Evaluate most employees or teams on the merits, there will be layoffs, probably big layoffs but they&#39;ll be managed incremental and strategic.  Build more products and pivot the product strongly but again, not in the image of a Parler or a Truth Social.
Twitter won&#39;t become a cesspool because he understands that people need to be able to control what they see or they&#39;ll leave.  Essentially try to create more safe spaces on twitter, not less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a 7 day ban for a tweet that included “political suicide pact” as an idiom.I then got permanently banned for including the line, “sending their children to die in Ukraine” in a tweet.The “appeal” button causes me to get a denied email within one minute. This tells me no humans are in the loop on any of this.I don’t think these tweets were controversial or require any diversity of viewpoints. They just require appreciation that you cannot automatically moderate anything accurately unless you are prepared to be very very VERY relaxed about the rules.I’m not sure Elon is even interested in fixing this kind of problem. He seems focused on the politics and “cancel culture” type issues (whether they’re real or imagined)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Potentially of intellectual interest: Some people here might be wondering about speech that is &#34;harmful,&#34; with the famous quote about &#34;you can&#39;t yell fire in a crowded theater.&#34; That quote from the Supreme Court is commonly used to justify why there need to be restraints on free speech.This is actually a popular misconception. The decision where &#34;you can&#39;t yell fire in a crowded theater&#34; was from was actually overturned in almost entirety in Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969. And even then, it was only an analogy, and never actually was the law. You actually, theoretically, CAN yell fire in a crowded theater. Websites on both sides of the isle have admitted it is a terrible analogy for defending censoring certain content for being potentially harmful. It is, quite literally, a legal myth. A legal myth that still affects our Congress today while they examine how to prevent the spread of misinformation [1].https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/why-falsely-claiming-its-ill...https://reason.com/2022/10/27/yes-you-can-yell-fire-in-a-cro...https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/its-tim...https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/shouting-f...https://www.whalenlawoffice.com/legal-mythbusting-series-yel...https://www.thefire.org/you-can-shout-fire-in-a-burning-thea...[1] For an example (out of many) of why regulating misinformation is legally almost impossible, see United States vs Alvarez, which ruled that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 (which criminalized faking having a military honor) is legally protected speech and the act was a violation of the constitution. Since then it has been extended with a new 2013 act which requires intent to gain something by fraud, which hasn&#39;t been struck down (yet)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On youtube&#39;s desktop site, I&#39;ve also noticed that sometime within the last couple months the home page no longer shows the duration of videos when the page loads. After 3-6 seconds, the timestamps pop in. I don&#39;t know if this is intentionally or a result of lazy-loading - but seeing that the video thumb, title, author, view count, and age all load instantly with the page, I struggle to come up with a reason it could be unintentional.This bothers me because I like to know how long a video is before I commit the time to sitting down and watching it. This feels like an attempt at a dark pattern with the intent to improve metrics - surely watch time is a metric youtube cares about."</p>

(I, for one, have always wished for most popular over the last 30 days, but oh well.)&gt; Also, there&#39;s less videos on a single row now.You&#39;re going to have to tell us how many there were before and how many there are now. I&#39;m not seeing any difference. It also depends -- are you talking about the home page? Channel home page? Channel videos tab? Because they all act differently.Are you sure you just haven&#39;t changed your zoom settings or something? Or your window width?"</p>

I&#39;m defining high quality as recordings with zero typos, and relatively controlled timing between commands.I&#39;m going to assume this works well because all the stuff from Charm seems to, BUT its limitations are ... problematic.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hands down, shell scripting is one of my all time favorite languages. It gets tons of hate, e.g. &#34;If you have to write more than 10 lines, then use a real language,&#34; but I feel like those assertions are more socially-founded opinions than technically-backed arguments.My basic thesis is that Shell as a programming language---with it&#39;s dynamic scope, focus on line-oriented text, and pipelines---is simply a different programming paradigm than languages like Perl, Python, whatever.Obviously, if your mental model is BASIC and you try to write Python, then you encounter lots of friction and it&#39;s easy for the latter to feel hacky, bad and ugly. To enjoy and program Python well, it&#39;s probably best to shift your mental model. The same goes for Shell.What is the Shell paradigm? I would argue that it&#39;s line-oriented pipelines. There is a ton to unpack in that, but a huge example where I see friction is overuse of variables in scripts. Trying to stuff data inside variables, with shell&#39;s paucity of data types is a recipe for irritation. However, if you instead organize all your data in a format that&#39;s sympathetic to line-oriented processing on stdin-stdout, then shell will work with you instead of against./2cents"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Use bash. Using zsh or fish or any other, will make it hard for others to understand / collaborate. Among all shells, bash strikes a good balance between portability and DX.I think fish is quite a bit different in terms of syntax and semantics (I&#39;m not very familiar with it), but zsh is essentially the same as bash except without most of the needless footguns and awkwardness. zsh also has many more advanced features, which you don&#39;t need to use (and many people are unaware of them anyway), but will very quickly become useful; in bash all sorts of things require obscure incantations and/or shell pipelines that almost make APL seem obvious in comparison.In my experience few people understand bash (or POSIX sh) in the first place, partly because everything is so difficult and full of caveats. Half my professional shell scripting experience on the job is fixing other people&#39;s scripts. So might as well use something that doesn&#39;t accidentally introduce bugs every other line.Most – though obviously far from all – scripts tend to be run in environments you control; portability is often overrated and not all that important (except when it is of course). Once upon a time I insisted on POSIX sh, and then I realised that actually, &gt;90% of the scripts I wrote were run just by me or run only in an environment otherwise under my control, and that it made no sense. I still use POSIX sh for some public things I write, when it makes sense, but that&#39;s fairly rare.I think bash is really standing in the way of progress, whether that progress is in the form of fish, zsh, oil shell, or something else, because so many people conflate &#34;shell&#34; with &#34;bash&#34;, similar to how people conflate &#34;Google&#34; with &#34;search&#34; or &#34;git&#34; with &#34;GitHub&#34; (to some degree)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Use the .sh (or .bash) extension for your file. It may be fancy to not have an extension for your script, but unless your case explicitly depends on it, you’re probably just trying to do clever stuff. Clever stuff are hard to understand.I don&#39;t agree with this one. When I name my script without extension (btw, .sh is fine, .bash is ugly) I want my script to look just like any other command: as a user I do not care what the language program is written in, I care about its output and what it does.When I develop a script, I get the correct syntax highlight becuase of the shebang so the extension doesn&#39;t matter.The rest of the post is great."</p>

India is taking pot shots at it to see if it can get away with forcing them into intercepting communications. If they leave as a result, they&#39;ll simply shrug and move on.Also, I&#39;m convinced that if Signal were to become popular they&#39;d probably sell it to some commercial provider, since the cost of maintaining a service used by hundreds of millions if not billions is extremely expensive.WhatsApp is an entirely different matter. Hundreds of millions of Indians probably use it and if the company were to suspend service because the Indian government mandated a backdoor all hell would break loose!For the same reason both Australia and the UK haven&#39;t as of yet forced WhatsApp to install a backdoor, even though legislation forcing them to do so is already in place there."</p>

Unfortunately, this can be easier said than done since we do not have access to the training data.A solution will be to have an AI submit modifications to the other side&#39;s enforcement notifications.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is my article from 2017.Here&#39;s a short update on what happened since then:1. DMCA takedowns did not destroy ad blocking (thank god), but there were a couple more times when it was tried, nothing huge though.2. Streisand effect is a thing and the domain in question was blocked by everyone and everywhere. There was even a special filter list and later a browser extension which only purpose was to block such domains. It got some traction but later got abandoned: https://github.com/paulgb/BarbBlock. If something like that happens again I am pretty sure it can be revived very quickly.3. The corporations still try different angles to prohibit ad blocking. The last example I know about is something like this: Axel Springer claimed that the web page and all its content (including subrequest) and ads is subject to copyright law. So when you modify the web page with adding new styles or blocking a web request you violate the copyright."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the article is from 2017, the relevance is high today.Large adtech companies are coalescing and supporting a single browser framework that gives them a modicum of control around how adblockers are integrated into the extensions, while also funding directly or indirectly realistic browser competition through Firefox (sorry Brave and Vivaldi... still a ways to go market share-wise). The economist in me thinks there is formal and informal coordination to make this ad &#34;market&#34; exist (no one wants ads, really, they want search engines with relevant results) and there is exercise in market power to the detriment of businesses purchasing advertising (and waste to society writ large)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ad blocking is by definition attacking ads and all the companies and interests that revolve around that.So ad blocking is and always will be &#34;under attack&#34;, that was always expected, &#34;small&#34; players, like individual news sites for example have been fighting ad blocking for years, now big players are feeling the heat too and since ad blocking is an &#34;existential threat&#34; ( Meta just learned that ), they no longer ignore it or &#34;kinda deal with it&#34;.It always has been a war. And like every war, there are endless philosophical theories and discussions about the &#34;sustainability&#34; of the Web &#34;without ads&#34;, the  tracking, etc.But the reality is: It always has been a war."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is neither shocking, nor new.A decade ago I remember a friend who had a small business selling some niche collectors items. One day, he was scammed. The guy reported that the package was never delivered and, without even investigating, Paypal banned my friend&#39;s account and awarded the buyer their money back.Paypal has always, and will always be a shit company. Charging people $2,500 for wrongthink is simply asinine. They must be betting BIG on either woke politics being mainstream for the long term, unbreakable bonds with their existing customers, or both. I can&#39;t even think of someone around me that uses paypal regularly.I will be interested in reading the technical report on how they plan on implementing this because I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be silicon valley diarrhea. I am currently working out how to pay companies in a similar fashion to Paypal. I&#39;m looking at Privacy.com but something is off about it to me for some reason. Once that is solved I&#39;ll get this ape off my back forever.I wonder what happens if I just say &#34;lol, not paying&#34; to them. Would they put me in collections? It seems infeasible to even enforce this and it strikes me that clicking a button doesn&#39;t amount of a legal agreement."</p>

I can get a client to sign it, perhaps it&#39;s part of my conditions as a freelancer.I can&#39;t realistically see any court enforcing that.As far as I can tell PayPal can only get away with this nonsense because they hold your money anyway. It&#39;s exactly the sort of reason people are fighting against cashless/custodial financial systems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something similar happened to my dad (USAF fighter pilot) in around 1961 or 62: He was test-flying a T-33 single-engine jet trainer assigned to his unit after it&#39;d had repair work. The engine quit and wouldn&#39;t restart. He ejected, but his parachute didn&#39;t deploy fully (much the same as in the article) and he got tangled in the shrouds. He said a quick Hail Mary just before crashing head-first in a muddy, fresh-plowed field. The pilot of another plane in the area saw the crash and radioed the tower to send the meat wagon and not the ambulance, but my dad walked away with just a headache — and with his helmet split open like a melon. The impact apparently damaged his inner ear: five years later he started getting vertigo while aloft, and soon afterwards got medically grounded. (That meant he lost the extra flight pay and was reduced to his base pay, with four school-aged kids while stationed in the Washington DC area — to make ends meet, my mother had to go back to work as an RN [registered nurse].)EDIT: What I remember was that when my dad crashed (see above), my mom came to get me from playing with the neighbor kids in their yard. Dad had called her from the flight surgeon&#39;s office and told her about the crash (very nonchalantly, she later said), and that he was OK. So six-year-old me blithely went on playing. Of course, my mom had been living with that possibility all their married life ...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a story of insane luck (and unluck!), the craziest part is definitely this&#34;  He said that if I had had a spleen, it almost certainly would have ruptured when I hit the water, and I would have bled to death. Of the 25 pilots in our squadron, I am the only one without a spleen. It gives me something to think about. Maybe it does you as well.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This happened in 1963.  Planes had only been flying for 60 years at that point; it really is pretty amazing how quickly we progressed on technology during those early years.  We still fly 737s, which are descended from a design that first flew in 1967.  As well as the C130, which was part of this story.  And don&#39;t get me started on B-52s, which are even older.We have made great strides since then, of course, but it does feel like 90% of the fundamental aviation technology we have today was created just in the first few decades."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As others have noted, they still have an education focused robotics set, it’s just not called Mindstorms:
https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-education-spike-prim...As a now-successful robotics engineer, I was the target age when the first Lego mindstorms set came out. Due to the cost it had to be a combined birthday and Christmas present (still obviously very privileged). The simple scratch-like programming system that kit used was great for me as a tween learning robotics.Today I am designing an open source farming robot as a non profit project! (See my profile)The early history of Lego Mindstorms is interesting. I didn’t realize Seymour Papert was involved but that makes a lot of sense! Especially with the name Mindstorms:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstormshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms_(book)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got the original Lego Mindstorms 1.0 kit for my 8th birthday - there was no programming interface, just a way to select one of 256 possible sequences of high-level actions the robot would perform in a loop. I paid for my first car by working at summer camps that taught kids how to use the Mindstorms 2.0 and NXT, and built my first 3D printer with Lejos (https://lejos.sourceforge.io/), Lego Technic parts and a tiny spindle router that could sculpt shapes into floral foam.While I&#39;m saddened by this news for nostalgic reasons, I personally believe that today&#39;s young learners are better served by the proliferation of hobby robotics platforms like Arduino/Raspberry Pi. Every summer camp I worked at would claim that Lego robotics teaches real-world engineering skills, while in reality the students were just happy to stay within the comfort zone of playing with Legos and using a block-based programming environment (one that has quite frankly gone from bad to worse to absolutely horrible with each product cycle). Also, FIRST Lego League does nothing meaningful to prepare students for FIRST - when I donated supplies and a few weeks of mentorship to my former high school&#39;s FIRST team, I was dismayed to see how much dead weight the team was carrying in students who participated in the middle school Lego league, who did not have even the basic coding/engineering skills to make any contribution to the high school team other than paying the membership dues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to see this as someone who enjoyed these as a kid and entering robotics competitions based off of them; hopefully the new products will keep the spirit alive.There was even some decent FOSS tooling that developed on top of Mindstorms: I used NXC (Not eXactly C, https://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/welcome.html) which was a C-like language  for programming Lego Mindstorms. It looks like the last release of NXC was in 2011."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit tangential but I just got a Tesla Model 3 and paid $6,000 extra for “enhanced autopilot” buying into all the marketing about it, and its one of the biggest regrets of my life and makes me unable to appreciate an otherwise great car. I just feel sick about it. The enhanced autopilot is buggy and doesn’t save me any effort. The summon and auto park don’t really work. I think it’s a scam.  Other than that it’s a great car."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always thought the Autopilot name and the claims about having all the equipment for FSD were basically fraudulent and Tesla would be liable for false advertisement.  Never made the connection of Fraud =&gt; Someone driving negligent as a result =&gt; Negligent Homicide/Manslaughter but it seems solid and somewhat obvious once stated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I met someone recently who told me they SLEPT on their way to work in their Tesla. On purpose. They bought the car specifically because they had a very long 2.5 hour commute.The marketing for this stuff is absolutely liable and as much as I like what Tesla has done for electric cars in general we are one big, massive accident away from this all absolutely blowing up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When people say they want career progression, and opportunities, what they mostly mean is they want more money. Unfortunately, most companies have fallen into the trap where if someone has a title of X they can only make up to Y, regardless of how good they are at their job or how long they&#39;ve done it. When that happens then the name of the game is getting a promotion in order to keep making more money. That creates a perverse incentive, and the result is political bullshit that is typically misaligned with the company&#39;s interests which further drives away your high performers.End the perverse incentives. Pay your people well if they&#39;re doing a good job, regardless of how long they&#39;ve been doing the same job or what their title is. Reward seniority and loyalty. Suddenly, you&#39;ll find that employee retention goes through the roof, and you don&#39;t have to worry about hiring new people all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Too many times in my career have I seen an employer lose an employee, who has a ton of institutional knowledge and performs adequately or even excellently, only to replace them them with someone that ends up costing much more money, and then takes a lot of time to get up to speed (which also slows the folks who help get them up to speed).It is like they haven&#39;t taken the time to even make a rudimentary calculation on the costs involved in keeping the employee versus replacing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hazard of retention is creating dependency. Dependency means, not just high bus factor, but opening yourself (the business) up to being vulnerable to another person&#39;s superior negotiation position. Then CEOs/boardmembers would have to spread their wealth rather than hoarding it all for themselves. Without a way to force CEO/boardmembers to spread their wealth (unions), I think we can expect companies to do what is in their best interest, maintaining a monopoly on power by ensuring no dependencies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I used play soccer regularly, I&#39;d occasionally experience being &#34;in the zone&#34;. It&#39;s a blissful experience where my body is able to execute incredibly complex set of moves in perfect coordination as my mind enters a state of zen-like calm.The sensation is almost like a being spectator in my own body. My brain feels like it&#39;s been relieved of the task of managing the moment-to-moment decision. Instead I start noticing moves 3, 4 steps ahead as time slows to a crawl around me. I don&#39;t know if this type of experience is related in any way to the theory of consciousness, but it feels like the unconscious mind holds a lot of secrets that I&#39;d love to see unlocked in my lifetime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a rumored experiment called the &#34;precognitive carousel&#34;, supposedly run by Grey Walter, where:(1) Subjects are told to push a button to advance a slide projector carousel, but not told that the button is inert(2) The carousel advances based on electrical signals measured by wires on the subjects&#39; scalp.(3) Subjects supposedly report the uncanny feeling that the projector advances &#34;just before&#34; they were about to push the button -- 300-400 milliseconds before, a pretty long time.I read about this a long time ago in a since-deleted post on an old timey internet forum (everything2).The writer suggested this research supports the idea that your body chooses what to do, then informs your brain, and your consciousness convinces itself that has decided to do what the body is about to do on its own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I realize that the link between consciousness and quantum effects are far from proven but if you will entertain the idea that they are...Delayed-choice experiments demonstrate the seeming ability of measurements in the present to alter events occurring in the past. eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraserNow I&#39;ll throw out another completely unprovable thought...Perhaps consciousness has the ability to affect how wavefunction collapse occurs, perhaps it even has the ability to influence the observed outcome.I&#39;m not going to try to prove these two ideas but together they can help form an idea that perhaps observations on the past actually influence the past and perhaps despite this &#39;observation after the fact&#39; there&#39;s still free will.It&#39;s not provable but then neither is the &#34;there&#39;s no such thing as free will&#34; arguments that this sort of research leads to. The point of the above is to highlight that there&#39;s still a way out for free will."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. 90% of the Application&#39;s Data are already in my LinkedIN, or my CV / Resume. Why the heck do I have to fill it in again.2. Some companies even / still requires you bring your University Certificate or whatever as proof. For Pete sake. That was decades ago. Can I pay $5 to LinkedIn or whatever so once and for all they can verify it from there.3. The other 8% of the application that I have not included details in my CV/ Resume or LinkedIn could have been reused across all applications. Why do I have rewrite it again.4. You are not fucking suppose to verify or reference check on me before I even had my interview or offer. So now my boss / management knows I am job hunting?5. By the time I get to the end of the application I am already exhausted depending how bad the day I had. And some form of PTSD from previous interview where i had to contain my thermonuclear anger or else going absolute animal against the HR / agent / interviewer. Because I have to be professional.6. My thought on why all these are so bad is because job application, listing site, social network ( LinkedIn ) all work for hiring companies, they are the ones who pay them. And not job seekers. Someone needs to figure out a way where we can turn this around and empower ( I hate this word, but I dont have anything better in my vocab ) employees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I m one of these, i fill out the form, then i get the memories i had interacting with some of these companies, working at other companies. The Process-Dementia, the hostilitys, the relentless culture of using all things in human interaction as renegotiation ammonition. The relentless pressure, ignoring all social norms and employee health, to complete a task. The shallow friendliness, that ended as soon as your usefullness expired. The internal fights, silos and slightly drunk employees, who hated it there, but couldnt say it, cause big Brother Middle Management is everywhere.Its considered the &#34;good jobs&#34; in my area, as in well paid enough to own a house, but every time im tempted to apply and see the logos, and the memories come back, i abort these applications.Some companies are cesspools and its good to remember that and stay away from them. I also warn others to stay away from them. Some people hack these companies and get the easy life there, which is nice, but for people who actually want to work and not interact with such a culture.. not even as customers, if it can be avoided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently I wanted to apply to a company. First they had you read some weird document telling you how they can’t pay high salaries, so you should be modest with your expectations.Then further down the form they require you to record a video introducing yourself and telling them why they should hire you.Ended up closing the form right there.Do these people not realize how annoying their process is and how talented people don’t have to put up with crap like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I first entered the working world as a programmer and administrator of an &#34;academic computing center&#34;, in the early 70s, you met men like Ray - ex-military, GI-bill educated, learned computers from the electricity on up in their mid-career, rather frequently, either as customer engineers for one of the big mainframe manufacturers (there were 7 or 8, depending on when and how you counted), or from the minicomputer upstarts who were then assaulting the mainframe world of computing with their smaller, cheaper, 12 and 16 bit newcomers.   Sometimes you&#39;d get the privilege of a lunch or dinner with one sent out &#34;from the lab&#34; who was actually designing and building the machines you were working on.It&#39;s hard to explain just how new it all felt, then.   But in 1973, even though we were sitting on the cusp of the single chip microprocessor and personal computer revolution, the commercial computer was less than 20 years old, and college recruiting materials might well brag that at their institution, there were not one, but two computers on campus.  I remember the day the total RAM at our institution passed the megabyte mark - closer to the end, than the beginning, of the 1970s.  The ability to &#34;program&#34; was a rare skill - even the people  who taught it were still just learning it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the minimalist resume is appealing, can we also bring back walk-on hiring?In warehouse and construction work, if someone shows up at 7:30 AM on a Monday morning, odds are quite good that the foreman will have something for them to do. Maybe not that day, but maybe tomorrow, or maybe someone on the list above them won&#39;t show up that week and they&#39;ll get called. I made rent doing that in my early 20s and they even let me leave early sometimes to work on my internet business because I didn&#39;t have a family to support and maybe someone else had a bill they needed to pay and wanted my shift.Why again does boutique startup need to interview 500 overqualified people? Hire someone right away and let them quit if they want to and hire someone else. It&#39;s just business for crying out loud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve had more ideas come to me after hiding in my office to take a nap than sitting at my desk. It got to be such a gold mine of solutions that I still to this day allocate 30 minutes of my day to a nap. Non-negotiable. So many hard problems that have been brought to me, or complicated needs for architecture, etc were solved by simply turning my active brain off. When I was in graduate school I&#39;d regularly get stuck on some stupid thing I didn&#39;t understand and slamming my head against the paper/book/whatever didn&#39;t help. Again, a quick nap and I was good (or at least better than I was).Performative work is a disaster. I worked in a stuffy IT office of a company before I got my degree and became a software engineer. It took YEARS to deprogram performative work. I still hide when I take a nap. I suspect that if my current company found out I was sleeping on the job they&#39;d still be upset with me. However, my output is so good the results speak for themselves. It would be difficult to fire me for napping."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Software development is creative work. Creative insight can come anywhere, any time. Better ideas can make difficult things easy. And make the impossible– possible.So the most important thing on a software team (or really any team creating high technology products or services) is an environment where team members feel safe to be themselves– psychologically safe, where they can try out new things, make mistakes, fail, and not be punished or belittled. Say their ideas and have them improved by others, not criticized. It&#39;s an environment where team members take care of themselves so they can be creative– sleep enough, exercise enough, be with friends and family enough, play enough.You have to be at your keyboard or lab bench or whatever enough to make things. But if you are there too much your creativity plummets. This is what I try to get across to my teams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The better error messages alone make it worthwhile to upgrade. The trend started in 3.10, and it already made a difference for me, my coworkers and students.But remember that while it&#39;s great to play with it freshly out of the oven, and that you might want to test your projects/libs with it, we should wait a bit before migrating production.Indeed, every first release of a new major version of Python eventually important bugs that get ironed out in a later patch. Also, some libs on pypi may simply not be compatible with it yet, breaking your pip install.I usually wait until the 3rd patch myself, after many years of paying the price of greedy upgrades."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After years of configuring webpack for various projects I have finally decided to migrate all my projects to Parcel[1] manly because I got tired of creating and maintaining hundreds of lines of webpack.config.js files, I wanted something that just works. I am really happy with that decision.Parcel is plenty fast and is pretty much zero config, I can use it to build libraries[2] as well as applications[3] for the browser and node.I am manly building client side react applications, so your mileage may vary.[1] https://parceljs.org/[2] https://parceljs.org/getting-started/library/[3] https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From my experience working with esbuild since it&#39;s early days, all I can say is to that there has been a very high bar set by esbuild&#39;s speed and ease-of-use. I&#39;ve used it for all my web apps and services since and i&#39;ve finally begun to like my front-end build chain, unbelievably."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These bundlers do not do the same work as webpack. Turbopack is using swc for typescript which means it will not do typechecking during compilation which effectively makes it fairly useless as a compiler. Now, if you only want bundling and minification then sure but why would anyone want only bundling? Good luck having a sensible workflow when your type checking has to run separately and perfectly match whatever typescript version is hidden inside your bundler, good luck dealing with constant mismatches when there are errors on either side.EDIT: The responses pointed out that the author is the maintainer of webpack, I removed that part of the comment calling it deceptive. Maybe the entire intent is to deprecate webpack. I still think that it should be renamed to &#34;Turbopack: our webpack successor&#34; because calling it &#39;the&#39; successor is a bit presumptuous and the article doesn&#39;t even directly say that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unfortunate that some of what made MacOS great for developers is now being phased out in favor of features that are lifted out of iOS. Apple has made developer-hostile moves over the years that seem out of line with it&#39;s old &#39;think different&#39; ethos. I hope Apple takes this customer segment seriously and reverses course here, but I&#39;m not super hopeful.The real problem is that there isn&#39;t a reasonable alternative. Windows is out of the question for me due to not being a POSIX-based OS. WSL isn&#39;t integrated deeply enough and is still a pain in the ass to use coming from MacOS. I experimented with using a mostly stock Xubuntu setup for a bit and also found the user experience to be really subpar. Call me old, but I have no interest in dealing with the amount of configuration and tweaking necessary to be productive in a Linux environment.Ultimately, I&#39;m just going to stick it out with MacOS."</p>

Let me explain why.This is how I understand all these posts. It’s fine not to like something. You don’t even need a good reason. That is what taste is all about. Just don’t pretend that your emotional response is grounded in objective and universal fact.Am I being facetious? Not really.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s so interesting, these waves of CSS improvements.Before the flexbox/grid arrival, there were years of near-zero progress.The flexbox/grid release, uniquely coordinated across browsers (for once), was an excellent milestone, but not really a movement.These last 2 years though feel almost like a revolution in comparison to CSS&#39;s history. Somebody is pushing very hard.These are some very serious improvements that address core needs and gaps. In particular scaling CSS in large applications, with things like @layers, @scope and container queries.The second goal seems to be to make CSS preprocessors obsolete.Compliments to whoever is working on this. My favorite upcoming one has to be toggle, controversial or not, the idea that for simple interactions you don&#39;t even require JS anymore is a good development.The luxury problem this creates is the slow adoption rate. Something extraordinarily powerful as grid is still barely used. Old habits die hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great overview. I&#39;m always excited by newer features to CSS that make older JS-only methods obsolete. I&#39;ve also grown CSS-tooling fatigued after using SASS and PostCSS plugins for years. I&#39;ve recently gone back to only using vanilla CSS on personal projects and while there are niceties I do miss (nesting) it&#39;s refreshing not having to deal with config files or waiting for stuff to compile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">":has() basically removes the need for us to use JS to attach classes to parent elements as we can essentially look ahead now, e.g. &#34;.some-component:has(.input-select-all:checked) { background: blue }&#34; whereas we would have to use JS to query the input, then query the parent and attach some css class as a styling hook.Container queries will allow us to fine-tune the not-so-predictable gaps between our predictable breakpoints.  Breakpoints will probably still be used for larger-picture layout, but container queries will help with the smaller parts especially in UI that have many moving dynamic parts.The rest are just icing and honestly I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it takes a while for many of them to become mainstream."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work!!!&#34;SQLite is extensively tested with 100% branch test coverage. We discovered this vulnerability despite the tests, which raises the question: how did the tests miss it?&#34;Tests only validate known behavior. They didn&#39;t have a test that exercised a large string. I don&#39;t know how their test suite works but I&#39;m curious if quickcheck might have possibly found this or if the 32-bit viewpoint of the programmer at the time would have also limited possible generated values?"</p>

The bug cannot be reached using SQL nor can it be reached by providing SQLite with a corrupt database file. The bug only comes up when very long string inputs (greater than 2 billion bytes in length) are provided as arguments to a few specific C-language interfaces, and even then only under special circumstances.&#34;Source: https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html#status_of_recent_sqlite_cve..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The root of this problem seems to be the widespread availability of 64-bit CPUs.≥ When this code was first written, most processors had 32-bit registers and 4GB of addressable memory, so allocating 1GB strings as input was impractical. Now that 64-bit processors are quite common, allocating such large strings is feasible and the vulnerable conditions are reachable.One has to wonder how much code written in the past 30 years has safety checks assuming 32-bit processors which now have vulnerabilities like this one. I&#39;d bet quite a lot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a confusing headline. The judgement here is in NY state court, and pertains to employees of and in the City of New York, which enacted a vaccine requirement for employees of the city and later private employers in the city. Months later, Eric Adams was elected mayor of NYC, and he issued an executive order exempting athletes, performers, and artists from the mandate.Petitioners sued, saying that the mandate with the exemptions was essentially arbitrary, and the courts agreed. So what happened here is that Eric Adams sabotaged NYC&#39;s vaccine mandate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s confusing: the NY Supreme Court is just a trial court, it&#39;s not at all like the US Supreme Court. The top appellate court is called the Court of Appeals. It&#39;s called &#34;supreme&#34; because it has general jurisdiction, as opposed to things like traffic court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I&#39;ve been wondering in recent cases where courts are overturning recent government action, whether unconstitutional bills passed into law, or unconstitutional executive actions that overstep authority, is where&#39;s the penalty for committing those actions in the first place?The state of New York famously responded to the outcome of NYSRPA v. Bruen, which overturned the defacto ban on concealed carry, by declaring nearly all public spaces &#34;sensitive areas&#34; in which licensed individuals may not carry for their protection. Regardless of one&#39;s opinion of said rights, how do courts blatantly ignore rulings and orders from higher courts with no repercussions?How do courts declare certain executive orders unconstitutional, and yet the perpetrators, who took an oath to uphold and defend said rights and values, face no consequences?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I came on board with the NeXT acquisition (or rather reverse acquisition as ex-NeXT often refer to)…So I do recall seeing a few times after we relocated to Infinite Loop, that Steve at first was just working as a consultant, and not as an employee. Thus at the time he didn’t have a badge to enter in IL1 (Infinite Loop 1: hold Apple HQ); many times when he was coming in the morning, he had to wait at the glass door to enter the campus, until some kind soul was letting him in (despite the policy only badged employees could enter or visitors with a printed tag). I saw it happening more than once while grabbing a coffee at the coffee booth in the IL1 building.Later on, after he came back officially as CEO (or iCEO), I remember clearly during a lunch with co-workers (at Café Mac, seating outside) watching at a distance Steve &amp; Jony walking inside the campus, then seating at a bench and Jony opening some carrying case/luggage, and let Steve pull the content out of it, so he could look at it in the sun: it looked like a piece of plastic… at the time, we had no clue what it was, except the color was orange. 
Many months later, Steve introduced the first iBook (which was the first Mac with Wifi): when I saw the orange color of the iBook I made the connection with what we saw back that day; Jony was most likely showing to Steve the first shell of the future iBook.Steve otherwise at work was truly laser focus at a time on different projects: I was working on backend web services development with public facing web site, so usually every 2 weeks our boss was presenting to Steve our progress (every week or even more while closer to ship): our boss usually was always coming back with clear feedback on what was good or terrible, which we obviously had to improve for the next presentation… stressful yes, but truly enjoyable.
More than once, Steve did cut some projects that were close to finish and you just had to go along since no one had a say in it, except Steve.Obviously I have a few more stories of that sort, since I spent close to 20 years at Apple (/NeXT).It was quite something to get the hard work you did for months presented on stage by Steve… I still miss the excitement from it even if it is more than 15 years ago.Edit: fixing a few typos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was there in 1999 as OS X was being developed, and the beta was just about to be released. I was building another product that was released at MacWorld in 2000 (and still exists today)!I have a lot of funny stories.  Steve didn&#39;t like our data center rack mounts being silver, we had to pull them all out and spray paint them black, because silver just wasn&#39;t acceptable, in a datacenter. That was my first day at work. And no, I&#39;m not a datacenter employee, everyone on the team did everything, there were just very few of us.We had to work from about 10am to about 3 or 4 am every day to make the deadline, we sometimes got Sundays off. There was a lot of rage and anger at many management levels.Steve would get a question about a two button mouse at every company meeting, he was super pissed every time about the question. We enjoyed trolling him.Steve&#39;s attention to detail was unbelievable. I once witnessed him make a team work overnight just to move an icon 10 pixels to the left.The guy had a vision that seems unparalleled. He was able to figure out the concept of &#34;cloud&#34; well before its time, and make a shift towards that.Of course, he was an supernatural presenter. I witnessed him present through some really messed up errors in live demos and no one I asked in the audience afterwards even noticed the errors.It was an insane work environment, never seen anything like it."</p>

Occasionally I&#39;d get early glimpses at things like QTi and HyperCard 3.I vividly recall the day Steve introduced the iMac in the Infinite Loop quad. If I had to pick a day that telegraphed Apple&#39;s future fortunes, it would be that day. Rhapsody&#39;s potential was compelling, but as Macintosh OS it was still pretty Crapsody at the time. The iMac was a Real Thing — as friendly as computers get, that only Apple could&#39;ve created and sold."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My late father, who was a software developer by trade before his retirement, had a desktop machine set up running Windows 7 (probably?) that he used for checking email, and buying stuff online.A few years later, when he had been diagnosed with cancer and was on chemo, it updated itself to Windows 10 without his explicit consent. It completely fucked up the install, and was unusable for him from then on. He was too tired to go through the process of getting it sorted out, and was thus unable to book a vacation that he had intended to take to recover from that round of chemo.Microsoft&#39;s unfriendly us-first, customers-second process robbed him of his last holiday and I will not easily forgive them for it.If a seasoned developer can be robbed of quality of life by this flavour of bullshit, what chance do the non-technical types stand?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it. For a few more bucks they instantly get their brand connonated with slowness and being unreliable.How do manufacturers throw in all the crapware and expect a good user experience and happy customers? Oh of course, they don&#39;t care.I&#39;ve moved to Mac but back in days I used Windows, the VERY FIRST thing I did was to install a fresh copy of Windows, then install any necessary drivers which are absolutely required for proper function (I remember just finding the driver files and installing them manually from add hardware dialog instead of installing bloatware of the manufacturer).Wish things have changed in 10 years... apparently it didn&#39;t.And of course I&#39;m tech savvy. I don&#39;t see any less-savvy senior being able to solve this problem; it should be regulated in a way that there should be a mandatory and ugly label showing all the crapware included with the device while buying, perhaps even extra taxing for each crapware included, discouraging manufacturers from including them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These days I simply can&#39;t recommend anyone (especially nontechnical people) buy a computing device that isn&#39;t either:- An Apple device- First-party (Microsoft Surface, Pixel phone, etc)- Running Linux (assuming they can deal with everything else that comes with that)Even these aren&#39;t perfect, but everything else I assume to be hot garbage unless you&#39;re planning to install your own OS anyway. The problem, though, is that this mostly excludes the real budget-tier devices (at least for nontechnical folks), which is unfair to those who can&#39;t afford anything elseBurn it all down"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things that has kept me out of the cryptocurrency space is that when their advocates discuss value, they speak in pure nonsense.A big part of that problem is that value is very difficult to discuss. On the one hand you have the classic goldbug that insists that gold has &#34;intrinsic value&#34;, which is some sort of platonic ideal thing that gold simply ambiently has and defies any attempt to nail down what it grounds out in. On the other hand you have cryptocurrency advocates claiming that all value is arbitrary and/or based entirely on scarcity. In that context, observing that my kid&#39;s doodles are scarce but not valuable is not a cute tweet; it is a complete and utter demolishing of the argument.(I think one of the things education can accidentally (mis)teach is that short arguments are always worthless and arguments must always be long. This is false. A good grounding in mathematics can help with internalizing this. It is completely possible to demolish entire massive argument edifices in 10-20 of the correct words, and the fact that the &#34;other side&#34; has deployed literally hundreds of thousands of words does not make them right if the foundation is rotten.)Value is intrinsically a dynamic process. It grounds out in human desires, which are intrinsically temporal, variable, and fickle, and this makes a lot of people uncomfortable as they seek either a more solid or a more completely ethereal/arbitrary base. However, there is no other sensible way to think about value, however complex and ever-shifting this may be, and it is neither mathematically solid, nor an amorphous vapor of no consequence subject to one strong person&#39;s Nietzschian will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a concern of mine for a while; I have also published absolute garbage just to see how far I can take it. I&#39;ve published music under various pseudonyms, books underneath different pen-names... the list goes on. I&#39;ve retracted such publications, but it is frightening if one person like myself had the curiosity to try, what is already out there, and, what a well-funded nation-state actor could do.----Post-truth, like post-modernism, does not mean an absolute absence of truth, but a decline in confidence in common knowledge, making your own truth the center of your life, rather than a set of values   shared by a community.We now believe that our own truth is somehow better than the &#34;centralized&#34; or &#34;official&#34; truth. We are now free from the institutions and authorities that controlled the truth. But this is an illusion, because the very definition of truth requires trust in something other than you.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/j5gyp5/the_sear..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there’s a good chance it was ghost written by a content farm for someone who wanted to publish a book in a popular category to make a quick buck. I recently learned that this is a soft-scam technique advocated for by a couple of guys called the Mikkelson Twins. They say you can make money by publishing audiobooks on audible by finding a popular topic on audible, then hiring a ghost writing service to write your book, then hire a voice actor to record it, publish it on audible, and then you too can become fabulously wealthy as the Mikkelson Twins claim to be. Except what the Mikkelson Twins actually make money on is selling you on a “money making course” where they tell you to do the above. So there’s all kinds of people trying to follow this method out there, it seems.This excellent video [1] from Dan Olson at Folding Ideas is in my opinion a fascinating deep dive in to this whole scam. I don’t want to spoil everything in the video, but Dan does an exceptional job exploring how this ghost writing works, and why it produces the kind of nonsense writing that looks like GPT-3 but is actually being done by an overworked human who is trying to write an entire novel in three weeks or so on a topic they haven’t had time to properly research.[1] https://youtu.be/biYciU1uiUw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pigs were recorded in Domesday as having woodland to support them. Note that woodlands supporting pigs was primarily comprised of oak, since the pigs fed on the acorns they dropped.Source 1: https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/domesday/discover-domesd...In the modern world, you can manage about 5 pigs per acre. You should be able to do that many pigs or more per acre in the medieval world since the animals were physically smaller for the most part. So in an 80 acre pannage woodland, expect about 400 swine.Some tree types are far more damaged by pig foraging than others since, if they don&#39;t get the yummy acorns, they tend to dig up roots, eat the saplings and do other damage. So the oak and the pig are good neighbors. The elder or the olive tree, or even the wild apple tree, all tend to suffer far more damage when used as pannage.Source 2: https://acrcd.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pigs-and-Trees...."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of a passage in Jesse Schell&#39;s game design book. Playtesters were confused seeing flags of pirate ships blow forward, toward the front of the ship. They were told that sailing ships have the wind at their backs, so everything blows forward. However, so many playtesters were confused and made comments that they just made the flags blow back.Maybe it was the same with the pigs; people just want to see pigs squealing around town, adding to the atmosphere of the game."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I really like their lightweight, SQL-like protocol instead of Elasticsearch&#39;s fat JSON, I really think that this project could have much more impact if it could be a drop-in replacement for ES.Even if it offers only a fraction of the features offered by ES, that may be fair enough for at least half of the use-cases out there.Sonic could have really had a strong selling point: &#34;Use an ES-alternative that works fine in most of the real-world applications, but it&#39;s written in Rust and it only takes a fraction of the memory footprint required by ES, and it shouldn&#39;t require you to change your application code&#34;.Instead, they are proposing yet another search protocol, that developers have to learn and adopt. That definitely increases the adoption barriers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow it&#39;s weird that this comes up, I&#39;m actually running a site I am going to repost to HN today that I want to use as a testbed for search engines (kind of like an extension to my recent collaboration with supabase[0]).Right now I&#39;ve got the site going on just Postgres FTS + trigram and it&#39;s pretty darn fast, looks like I need to test sonic too.Going to burn some midnight oil (in my timezone, anyway) and get it out -- though sonic isn&#39;t implemented yet!Anyway to make this comment useful to people, here&#39;s my short list of engines that I want to run in parallel:- MeiliSearch (https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch)- TypeSense (https://github.com/typesense/typesense)- Lyra (https://github.com/LyraSearch/lyra)- OpenSearch (https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch)- ZincSearch (https://github.com/prabhatsharma/zinc)- Sonic (https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic)There isn&#39;t enough out there comparing all these for the simple typical fuzzy search/search box usecase, so I&#39;m adapting a little podcast search site I made to try and use all of these at the same time. So far only Postgres though, will try and add Meilisearch today and post it!Like other people are pointing out, most of these engines won&#39;t have all the features of ES (or more accurately Lucene) but I am pretty convinced that most of the time it doesn&#39;t actually matter and if someone is searching on your site excessively maybe there&#39;s a problem with your UX (unless you&#39;re a search engine or repository of information).[0]: https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-full-text-search-vs-the-r..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written a full-text search engine as well. I don&#39;t tout it as a replacement for Elasticsearch, but it does have a few advantages: it&#39;s fast; supports HTML documents; supports Polish inflection (via a full-blown morphological dictionary, not just a stemmer); and has a very compact on-disk format (pre-parsed HTML trees, Huffman-encoded over large alphabets). Oh, and it&#39;s 100% Clojure.It underlies a concordancer GUI called Smyrna: https://github.com/nathell/smyrna, https://smyrna.danieljanus.plI haven&#39;t touched it in six years, other than a few small changes. But I do plan on revisiting it when time permits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here in the ultra-dense Netherlands, threats to insects are magnified. As such, it&#39;s easier to point to specific causes.Butterflies: 50% reduction in 50 years. Beetles: 75% decline since 1985. Ladybugs: 50% reduction in 20 years. Across the border in Germany: a 75% decline in flying insects since 1989.It doesn&#39;t take much of a scientist to see the trend. I&#39;ve been hiking the forests here multiple times per week for 20 years. You can clearly see how some groups are disappearing whilst others remain.There&#39;s several root causes but the primary one is a lack of native plant diversity. Since agriculture over here is done in close proximity to forests, the soil becomes acid due to the nitrogen disposition. This benefits the growth of a handful of plants at the expense of all others. In some of our forests, the soil is now so acid that snails no longer develop a case and bird eggs collapse.In this plant monoculture, insects depending on a specific host plant disappear. Outside (protected) forests, things aren&#39;t much better. Even the tiniest of strips of grass that would normally produce wildflowers, are aggressively mowed down. People&#39;s gardens are designed to be as hostile to insects as is possible.Secondary reasons are invasive species and light pollution.It&#39;s a sad state of affairs and one we should be deeply ashamed of. We&#39;re not talking about some iconic predator requiring hundreds of acres of wild forest just to survive. We&#39;re talking about insects that require little space, healthy soil, a flower, and for it to be left alone. We can&#39;t even offer that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is  pretty characteristic of the chemical industry influence trying to muddle the waters.I&#39;ve watched recently a conference[1] by several renowned scientists. They affirm that neonicotinoids / neonics are responsible of at least 80% of the decline.They also affirm that the &#34;merchants of doubt&#34; are working their best to muddle the evidence with things like &#34;there are multiple factors&#34;, &#34;it&#39;s complicated&#34;, &#34;we need more research&#34; etc.But just like the overwhelming majority of lung cancer comes from smoking, the overwhelming factor in insects decline (and its consequences like birds decline) is PESTICIDES and neonicotinoids in particular.[1]: sorry, in French : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQT7b2ExP4

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To everyone replying “aerodynamics”, I’ve had the same car for about 9 years now and the drive along the 5 from Bay Area to LA feels like there’s fewer bugs on my windshield (granted not recorded diligently for scientific purposes but whereas before I’d need to scrub the windshield at least once halfway these days I can drive all the way and still don’t need a wash at the end)Same goes for the argument that bugs have evolved to migrate away from the roads - the 5 has been a busy thruway for a long time with lots of cars and trucks.The article is short but says scientists have clear data that populations have plummeted and the larger vehicle consumer trend + more people on the road means that there’s fewer bugs to encounter per windshield on top of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are plastics 3-7 allowed if they are unable to be recycled? Also it seems to me that a tax on plastic might incentivise glass and metal usage.  Plastic is only used for convenience and cheapness, let&#39;s make it less convenient and cheap than glass and metal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the best way to prevent pollution of the environment with plastics is to ban the export of plastics as garbage. Currently, much of the plastic pollution is due to dumping in 2nd world and 3rd world countries where rules on disposal are very lax. So, while many people are actually quite conscientious and dispose of their waste in the appropriate manner, the garbage then just gets exported and not disposed of in any way that is responsible. Stopping the export also forces the originator of the garbage to deal with their waste creation... so dual benefit.Of course, eWaste is also a sizable contributor to plastic pollution and most people don&#39;t even think about disposable of these items. They either sell them, or they toss them in the garbage... sometimes with lithium batteries still in them which is extremely hazardous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a Linux idiot, just got sick of Windows, and took the plunge in 2016. (After some ill-fated tinkering in 1996 with Slackware, but we don&#39;t speak of that.) I started with Ubuntu and had a pretty good time for a year or two, until a dist-upgrade broke everything. Luckily /home/ was easy to restore from backup.So I was fine for another two years on Ubuntu until another dist-upgrade broke everything again. Sensing a pattern, I decided to give Pop a try.I&#39;m now about a year into Pop and sure enough, a few weeks ago a dist-upgrade broke a lot of things, but unlike Ubuntu, I was able to find System76&#39;s tech support page, I ran the commands it suggested, and everything&#39;s fine again!https://support.system76.com/articles/package-manager-ubuntu...Miraculous, I tell you.I still can&#39;t figure out why there are multiple versions of some things in the Pop Shop, but they all seem to work, so I&#39;m not complaining, it&#39;s just weird. Someday I&#39;ll figure out this whole tiling-windows thing, but I think that&#39;s for people with bigger screens so I turned it off so my alt-tab reflexes work again.In general, it just works, and that&#39;s more than I can say for Windows or Ubuntu at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Pop Os. I&#39;ve always liked Debian descended distros, and prior to this I was using Ubuntu. While I like it, I always found a lot of rough edges esp. when it came to proprietary drivers, etc. where things didn&#39;t always work without some tweaking. Pop Os on the other hand seems to &#34;just work&#34; - it is like a polished version of Ubuntu with a nice selection of apps in the Pop Shop. Theme is pretty nice as well as a bonus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am quite a fan of their Pop!_Shell. I wanted to improve my desktop efficiency by using a tiling window manager; I tried i3wm and XMonad, but none of them really clicked with me. Finally, I decided to try the Pop!_Shell tiling mode and it was awesome. (Hardcore tiling window manager fans might not agree but Pop!_Shell is a lot more newbie-friendly.)Furthermore, you don&#39;t even have to install Pop!_OS to get Pop!_Shell. For example my preferred distribution is openSUSE Tumbleweed with GNOME, so I just need to    sudo zypper install gnome-shell-extension-pop-shell
    wget https://github.com/pop-os/shell/raw/master_jammy/scripts/configure.sh
    # configure.sh mostly configures keyboard shortcuts. Inspect it before running.
    sh ./configure.sh
    
And then enable it. That&#39;s all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The update is cool but the update process was not.  -Update available, wanna install?
  Sure
  -OK don&#39;t mind me I&#39;m gonna need a while
  OK
  -HA HA I LIED I&#34;M READY TO TERMINATE EVERYTHING BYEEEE
  WTF
  5 reboots with just an Apple icon and a progress bar
  The progress bar also moves backwards sometimes
  I guess it&#39;s a metaphor for life, which is how long this seems to be taking
  -OK hello I am back but I need 10 minutes of alone time
  -Here is some unfamiliar wallpaper but you can log in I guess
  -Oh it&#39;s you again, do you want to share analytics with us
  -OK here is your familiar desktop, I am not telling you what has changed
  Um preferences
  -Oh hai I&#39;m called Settings now and I reorganized everything
  Yikes but OK this is sorta well laid out I guess
  -Hello I am Stage Manager, I put a desktop on your desktop so you can work while you work
  Sorta neat, can I configure some things differently though
  -No
  
Funnily enough I had just started reading the Ars Technica review when the upgrade took place so that helped with navigating the changes but it was an oddly jarring transition. I get that Apple doesn&#39;t like burdening users with too much technical information (as in &#39;any&#39;) but given how significantly the Settings app has changed I&#39;m surprised there was no Release notes or feature tour of any kind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the real complaint is dynamic pricing, which is essentially raising prices to what the market will bear, instead of having (what was formerly artificially) low prices that get scalped. Now the extra money that used to go to scalpers goes to TM instead, and the downside is that some % of fans that could previously luck out and get cheap tickets no longer can.Isnt this...not a bad thing? There&#39;s fundamentally just a supply and demand problem, with more people wanting to see these concerts than there are concerts. The article mentions that Garth brooks solved this by doing more concerts (e.g. 9 in a row in the same city!), but that&#39;s obviously not viable for everyone. Is there a better solution? Even if there were 5 different companies selling concert tickets, wouldnt they inevitably move to dynamic pricing for the same reason?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sometimes wonder why venues choose Ticketmaster; large as Ticketmaster is it&#39;s not the only option, and how did they come to be the main player? My only conclusion is that the venues (and bands) are benefiting.Here&#39;s my theory:Venues and bands know that for PR reasons they can&#39;t jack up the price of tickets, but they don&#39;t want to miss out on the revenue from people willing to pay scalper prices. So they set tickets at a nominal price but reserve huge blocks of tickets for the band and venues. Nominally these are &#34;family and friends&#34; tickets, but in practice the band and venue put them immediately for resale. This way the bands and venues can get that gigantic revenue. Meanwhile a small number of tickets are sold at face value and immediately sell out.  Ticketmaster profits from fees on the ticket sales and resales.A &#34;known evil&#34; company like ticketmaster is now a benefit, as &#34;obviously&#34; the jacked up costs are ticketmaster&#39;s fault. Meanwhile ticketmaster is really just a service to take the heat off of bands and venues for what would otherwise be seen as price gauging."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of comments here from people who haven’t read the article and don’t know about the scalper-eliminating on-demand pricing it’s actually about. Or that it addresses supply-and-demand near the end with some interesting comments on Garth Brooks:Country superstar Garth Brooks—who has called out dynamic pricing as well as suggested that the secondary market should be “illegal,” has more or less solved the problem for his fans with one simple trick: He adds shows until they no longer sell out. In recent years, on single tours, Brooks has done the following: He played nine concerts in a row in Edmonton, Canada. He played a dozen shows in Chicago. He played six in Kansas, nine in Tulsa, and eight in Denver.Indeed, the headline doesn’t seem particularly supported by the actual article to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really neat! My only complaint is that the handling is very sluggish. Also it might be nice to have a first-person vew, maybe the camera view contributes to the sluggish feeling.I love the procedurally-generated landscapes. It really captures the feeling of driving on unfamiliar roads.I&#39;m curious how the physics works. Is this using raycast wheels? A couple of years ago I made a racing game for Oculus Quest using Godot[0], based on Godot&#39;s &#34;VehicleBody&#34;, and getting the physics to work satisfactorily was a major headache. But a procedural world would have made it so much cooler.[0] https://sidequestvr.com/app/1403/ghost-racing-vr-wip"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would be great for Rally racing games, since it&#39;s all about reacting to unknown terrain.Also, it would be better if mouse steering is damping impulse based, i.e. every frame the steering position exponentially decays, mouse position resets to center and the change is added as impulse on the steering position.  sensitivity = max_ang / ( screenwidth/2 )
  decay_rate = 6.0

  frame(dt){
    dx = mouse.x - center_pos

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having your own email/domain isn’t about privacy. Email has become essentially the key to almost everything in modern life. If I lose access to my email I lose access to basically everything I own and it would be a massive hassle to switch emails. Banks, schools, apps, etc. Often times these services won’t even let you change to a new email if you don’t have access to an existing one. Some use email as 2factor. It’s a nightmare. Owning your own domain separately is crucial. Who hosts your email matters less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is everywhere. In India, people in the departments, especially the Governments usually ask, &#34;What is your Gmail?&#34; Almost everyone uses Gmail here and it is extremely rare to find their own custom domain.I&#39;m actually surprised that the Government Departments do not have a service that takes care of these! They will fine Google but almost all of the government email IDs are Gmail.I was one of those that distributed hundreds if not thousands of Gmail invites when it started. However, since 2010-ish, I left Gmail to be just for Newsletters, and the ones that I&#39;m not serious about. I&#39;m always reminded that a day will come when I will just have no access, lock out and be done with it.I had used my name&#39;s domain and had used the web hosting provided email service and I felt nice using the likes of `webmaster@brajeshwar.com` (early 2000s). Then I got a shorter domain with our family domain and is, now, powered by Google Workspace (with a plan to move to the competitors soon before the yearly plan expires). I had so many domains under the Google Suite free version since its beta. I did upgraded my primary domain to the paid version, when I had few mail delivery issues so I can talk to a person and that was also the time I realize I cannot go back. That was almost/about 10 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular on HN, but I just don&#39;t see a problem with Google having my email, for what they provide me. Almost unlimited uptime, global redundancy, best search experience, storage all for free. I&#39;m ok with the trade off for now.Its just not worth the hassle."</p>

Very much a labor of love and a surprising way to realize I still liked programming. I wrote some scattered thoughts here [0]I also &#34;run&#34; this project quite differently than I usually do - when I receive a pull request instead of merging it I do a quick glance through the user&#39;s github to make sure they&#39;re not a spammer before giving them _commit access_ and asking them to merge their own PR [1].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve previously attempted this for Windows 95. I tried very hard to be pixel-accurate. https://hikari.noyu.me/demos/ shows off a bit of what I achieved, but alas it lacks most of the UI elements.I learned some interesting things from the process. The biggest one for me is that web browsers have only one kind of focus, but Windows has two, a dotted line on the inside (element affected by space bar) and a black outline (element affected by return key). You therefore can&#39;t get exactly the same UI in a browser without adding some JS to simulate this second type of focus."</p>

Previously it was on GitHub and there was zero friction to contributing other than figuring out your elisp changes. But now, I think that Issues in the github site are discouraged, and so there will be no convenient way of watching issues and feature requests raised against the project, or of following discussion of proposed patches and code review. In principle of course, these things are possible by using old issue tracking applications and following often dysfunctional/cantankerous discussions in a email list, both of whose scope is the whole of emacs."</p>

Moving to cgi-bin will.I&#39;d suggest Cloudflare shouldn&#39;t try to establish their scheme as canonical url and rather implement github pages behavior, but what do I know...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For anyone who actually used those models for more than few days and learns their strengths and weaknesses it is completely obvious all this talk of &#34;societal impact&#34;, or as you called it self imposed limits are 100% bulls**. Everyone in the field knows it.99% of those using this tactics use it to justify not releasing their models to avoid giving competition a leg up(Google, openAI) and to pretend they are for &#34;open research&#34;. As I said this is 100% bull.The remaining 1% are either doing this to inflate their egos (&#34;hey look how considerate and enlightened we are in everything we do!&#34;), or they pander to media/silly politicians/various clueless commentators whose level of knowledge about this technology is null. They regurgitate the same set of &#34;what ifs and horror stories&#34; to scare the public into standing by when they attempt to over regulate another field so they can be kingmakers within it(if you want an example how it works look at the energy sector).All this sillyness accomplishes is to raise a barrier to entry for potential commercial competition. Bad actors will have enough money/lack scruples to train their own models or to steal your best ones regardless how &#34;impact conscious&#34; your company it.Now, I don&#39;t claim everyone should be forced to publish their AI models. No, if you spent lots of money on training your model it is yours. But you can&#39;t lock all your work behind closed doors and call yourself open. It doesn&#39;t work like this. One important point is that there is value even in just publishing a paper demonstrating some achievements of a proprietary model, but if the experiment can&#39;t be reproduces based on description given that is not science and for sure it is not open."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s be realistic, just like building codes, medical procedures and car manufacturing sooner or later we will also be subject to regulations. The times where hacking culture and tech was left unbothered are over.Twenty years ago we were free to do whatever we want, because it didn&#39;t matter. Nowadays everyone uses tech as much as they use stairs. You can&#39;t build stairs without railings though.Keeping the window for abuse small is beneficial to the whole industry. Otherwise bad press will put pressure on politicians to &#34;do something about it&#34; resulting in faster and more excessive regulations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there is a bit of an issue here that isn&#39;t addressed in the article. They reference using the SpaceX published ephemerides which are created from the GPS receivers onboard the SpaceX satellites:&#34;SpaceX satellites regularly downlink accurate orbital information from onboard GPS. We use this orbital information, combined with planned maneuvers, to accurately predict future ephemerides, which are uploaded to Space-Track.org three times per day&#34; [0]So using the positioning information of the SpaceX satellites is already dependent on GPS. Saying that it could be used as a backup to GPS is a bit non-sensical to me. Sure you could go back to using ranging measurements for each of the satellites to get TLEs from NORAD or LeoLabs or one of the other commercial space tracking companies, but it would likely be less accurate and not updated as frequently as the SpaceX satellites don&#39;t have a precision clock onboard for timing and propagation like the GPS satellites do.[0] https://www.spacex.com/updates/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GPS is also coupled with WAAS which relies on a network of ground stations at known coordinates to determine GPS error. These errors are caused by bulges in the ionosphere that throw off timing. Error is calculated, broadcast up to satellites and then rebroadcast down to GPS receivers that are WAAS enabled. This is known as a satellite based augmentation system. The other satellite nav systems that compete with GPS are building similar augmentation systems (like GAGAN, EGNOS, MSAS and SDCM). These systems are required for precision approaches like LPV for aircraft on instrument flight plans. Regular GPS precision due to ionosphere changes is too low. They&#39;ve enabled the FAA to lower the minimums for GPS approaches down to levels that are close to ILS, removing the need for expensive ILS installations at many regional airports. So replacing GPS isn&#39;t just about creating a system to locate a point in space. You&#39;d need to replace critical systems like WAAS that enable precision approaches during instrument conditions, for example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Massively impressive! A very exciting paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12334v4 from the first two authors shows how Starlink can be fused with ordinary GNSS to get extremely impressive +56 dB anti-jam advantage (see Figure 1)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading this made me grin. Pocket Casts is one of the only applications that&#39;s survived me bouncing between iOS and Android and back again over the last who-knows-how-many years and I paid for their web player a long time ago, too. I&#39;ve tried other players and none of them stick; the differences in affordances in something like Castro or Overcast send me back to Pocket Casts every time.They seem to have had a rough time of it over the last few years, and seeing them end up at Automattic (&#34;land of the misfit web toys&#34;) was nice. This is a cherry on top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Best part of PocketCast is the stats. It can tell me that since 2016 I&#39;ve listened to 135 days worth of podcasts and apparently I&#39;ve &#34;saved&#34; 46 days by increasing the playback speed and 3 days from trimming silence. (I also have 350 hours in my &#34;up next&#34; queue ...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After being a user for many many years, I just recently tested out to Snipd [1] and have not looked back since.  Pocket Cast were great but I don&#39;t see them innovating. With Snipd there is almost always a full text transcript available including a surprisingly accurate AI generated Table of Contents to cue through.  Then I can easily save a transcribed clip of some section I am listening to  for export to a TfT program like obsidian.  Not sure how I ever lived without these features now I am used to them lol.[1]  https://www.snipd.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great step.  Subscriptions errode first sale protections by subscription-gating physical objects, allowing OEMs a work-around to first-sale doctrine.  If you buy something, you should own it, and be able to fix it, scrap it, re-sell it, whatever you want.It&#39;s interesting NJ included self-driving in the subscription ban.  These require significant overhead in compute, engineering resources and greatly impact safety, and if Tesla&#39;s pricing is any indication of overall market, FSD will cost a pretty penny.If full self-driving was offered at 10k up front for the life of the car, or $80/mo, I would imagine many buyers of lower-end vehicles would prefer a subscription."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Go New Jersey! Now get Texas and California on board so car companies don&#39;t bother offering these in the country at all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is great, and though I agree that determining whether there is an &#34;on-going cost to the manufacturer&#34; will be a gray area that automakers will try to game, I think that&#39;s a solvable problem.The heated seats example is a great one. There is no reason for this not be a one-time charge.On the other hand, I think it&#39;s fair to offer autopilot/&#34;full self driving&#34; on a subscription, or at least the upgrades as a subscription. Clearly there is a large ongoing cost to continually improve self-driving capabilities, and it seems reasonable to me to have a pricing model that reflects that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amsterdam local here — in fact, I live in exactly this street. Where the first cartel guy gets subdued is where I get my coffee, and the people that live in the canal houses are my neighbors. (My house may or may not be in the map, would have to play the game to check.)Fun facts:(1) A year or two ago several guys spent days using some sort of device to scan all buildings in our street. They got complaints from several bar owners and tenants as they appeared to be taking photographs inside the buildings, and they wouldn’t explain why. I wouldn’t be be surprised if it was for this map.(2) The footage is hyperrealistic not just graphically, they got the details right with surprising accuracy. Even the garbage bins are in exactly the right place. (It’s also not unlikely that a guy could be subdued like this without people being too surprised, as tourists like to use this district to get wasted 24/7.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Though it does look great, i wish more games focused on actually being fun to play instead of having long cut scenes and micro transactions.Ironically other than the fact that you have to pay per game and that you’re often forced to die, I prefer arcade games. They generally minimize friction to playedit: to clarify, I mean games with good graphics specifically. There are many great games (especially indie) out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks incredible.Although this beautiful recreation is missing the endless tourists aimlessly walking on bike paths and the very loud conversations between Dutch people (their talking volume is what many of us consider yelling, but that&#39;s just normal).Once we get VR headsets that are maybe twice as good as the best now, and we have high quality simulations, the scifi stories of people choosing living in unreality seem more plausible."</p>

A small fine and a promise not to do it any more. This should basically be the end of that company entirely. Instead they just have to point the finger at some low-level managers, fire them, and keep on rolling. I would think criminal charges are warranted for importing 12 and 13 year-olds for labor. The children can&#39;t consent. That&#39;s essentially child slave labor.If Hyundai/Kia drops them, that would at least be a much bigger penalty than the DOL imposed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m bullish on this because mobile (and web) development is ridiculously overcomplicated to a beginner. I think it&#39;s a common misconception that coding/logic is difficult. I find the development setup and deployment to be much more complicated. As evidence, take a look at the impressive workarounds that citizen developers use to make things work in an easy environment like Excel.A keyboard and mouse probably solve most of the complaints in this thread."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want a token based keyboard with the following propertiesLanguage and syntax awareness. When I’m writing JavaScript - it should provide keys for ‘if’ ‘each’ ‘function’ etc.When I have unbalanced parens, braces etc, it should tell me how many levels deep I am and what context I’m in.Instead of me naming variables it should generate random names and let me declare with a single tap. Provide easy refactoring tools so I can rename them later.On mobile I want to manipulate symbols or the AST directly rather than rely on text input.Take advantage of a keyboard that can display infinite variation and change on the fly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very little innovation is done in the area of coding on a small-form mobile device.  Early attempts are needed in order to get feedback and learn from experience what works and what doesn&#39;t.It&#39;s nice to see repl.it is at least attempting to address this &#34;market&#34;.  Their previous mobile app was so bad I uninstalled it and used the web site directly instead.  Hopefully this works better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to use Ubuntu for everything and was very happy in the massive Ubuntu ecosystem with a .deb for everything till I was forced to use Snap a few releases ago for installing even some basic utils I used on a daily basis. I then had Snap constantly hang on installs and just break for no apparent reason and waste my time debugging it. It didn&#39;t &#34;just work&#34; anymore.Swapped to Arch and haven&#39;t looked back yet, Arch took me a lot more work to get set up but once it was it&#39;s been pretty invisible, which is how I like my OS to be.I&#39;d probably happily swap back to Ubuntu if I read somewhere that Snap was removed entirely/canceled or something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The regular as clockwork bi-yearly releases are one of the best things about Ubuntu. Ubuntu is the default supported Linux laptop/desktop env in so many tech orgs.If you use Ubuntu and want to help ensure it works for your env remember to test the upcoming release alphas / betas eg with USB boot stick and file bugs on Launchpad if you notice something broken.(Same goes for other distros your org may use, eg Debian, Fedora etc)Snaps mostly work great, and are a great improvement for keepign up to date sw available for people using LTS releases. This and the security improvements brought by the sandboxing greatly overshadow the sometime teething problems of the system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure precisely why, but when I first saw ads in Apt(8) I decided I wouldn&#39;t be using Ubuntu for any more personal projects. On one hand they obviously need to keep the project alive. On the other hand, putting your own ads on top of something that fundamental to the system just felt ... weird/narsty?Reading state information... DoneCalculating upgrade...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not surprising at all. All of these review-driven P2P marketplace businesses end up with the same problem. After the initial phase of early adopters that offer generally high quality products, a flood of fake or low-quality listing tries to squeeze money out of the platform. These people are not listing their homes on Airbnb, they are trying to make a living by extracting as much money from the platform as they possibly can. They don&#39;t care if they&#39;re banned or reported. They&#39;ll just make a new fake account. Low ratings? No problem, just pay for some fake reviews.The same is true for Amazon and other marketplace business. It&#39;s overrun by Amazon FBA sellers selling cheap low-quality white-labeled Alibaba products. It&#39;s almost impossible to find real brands or high-quality products these days, unless you specifically know what to search for.How to deal with it? Personally I&#39;ve started going back to hotels to be safe. If I do use Airbnb, I do a lot of research on the host and reviews and assume the place I&#39;m getting is 80% worse than what the pictures show.Other examples: App Store app reviews, restaurant review apps and food delivery apps. Fortunately it&#39;s not a big deal if these are scams. It&#39;s just a few dollars. Sucks much more when it&#39;s your vacation rental."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This stuff is incredibly common in short term rental market.  You are scraping the bottom of the barrel on landlord scruples.There was a recent fire in a summer vacation town popular with NYers.
The town requires summer short term rental landlords to get a permit &amp; inspection.
The landlord did not get one.
The landlord also had sketchy kitchen wiring that was probably some sort of DIY and not up to code.
The landlord had removed batteries and hardwiring from 3 smoke detectors.
These are the kind of things the inspector would have found immediately.A family visiting from out of state lost 2 of their 3 children in this fire.Apps like AirBnB create the facade of officialness on what are instead very sketchy markets.  Family probably thought they were doing the right thing going through an app and the landlord must be verified and more &#34;legit&#34;.  Being from out of state they wouldn&#39;t know the intricacies of local town permit&amp;inspection requirements and how to check if the landlord has one, etc.Likewise in my condo in NYC, we had one particular owner who was trying to use their unit as an Airbnb.  Regardless of the local laws which were tightening up at the time, our condo expressly forbid short term rentals, and had language around minimum length of stay and lease approval requirements.  It only stopped when we started fining them $1000 per incident.Stuff like this matters because you buy a condo to live in it and don&#39;t expect the unit on the other side of your bedroom wall to essentially be a hotel room with new neighbors every 3 days, staying up all hours (vacation, yay), dragging suitcases in&amp;out at odd hours multiple times per week.. forever.The building itself takes on a lot more wear &amp; tear, and they put a burden on staff as they think the building porter&amp;doorman are there for them like a hotel concierge and front desk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If only there was some regulation for such services that would require some sort of standard. You know some sort of licensing by the state. /sThis is what you get when you skirt laws, artificially lowering prices to kill competition and exploit workers. Stop complaining, it&#39;s your own doing for supporting this type of economy. Only because maybe some of those existing laws were cumbersome or outdated doesn&#39;t mean you just go around all of them."</p>

I feel like I’m starting to notice the gradual decline more and more, despite not having had a serious clinical relapse for about 10 years (some minor ones).Things you can try:
Changing your drugs - maybe going for something drastic like HSCT.Being patient and not panicking - if you’re currently having flare ups your symptoms will appear worse than they really are while there’s acute inflammation happening.  Don’t forget that.  If the flare ups get under control you’ll should see some recovery and improvement.Not giving up - keep pushing yourself as hard as you can, make sure you’re training whatever’s left of your central nervous capacity.  There’s probably still some left.  Keep trying to do as much as you can and you’ll get access to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also had it for 15 years, I was sharper in my 20s than now but now and I think age and MS have affected that. I realise I&#39;m at my best when not stressed, well rested and happy. However I&#39;m not always in control of those. Stress is easier to deal with as I talk to my employers about my condition and I avoid anything stressful when possible. I still feel useless some days and have bad brain fog and can&#39;t think clearly, it gives me a lot of imposter syndrome.Im currently moving somewhere else to get better rest. And my happiness is in progress, I tried anti depressants but I get anxiety and I tried CBT but it didn&#39;t work either. I do also swim regularly which helps too but still not enough. Im hoping this move will help. However its gone on for so many years that I think I will seek a professional soon.Covid and the pandemic definitely affected me, I couldn&#39;t walk properly for weeks after recovering from it. I used to do 20min walk every day to recover and just to keep active and get out. My depression got worse (was getting CBT in days before lockdown) but a few friends of mine play regularly online so I got to be social at least and talk about it. To add to this, I also quit my job before lockdown to travel so I was unemployed for a year in pandemic. I remember going to cafes when things partially opened to practise interview questions and did little projects. I finally got a job the next year.I&#39;m still worried I won&#39;t be strong enough to travel one day, my max distance walking is 1.5km, give or take, without a rest, I could go a lot further only a few years ago.I know MS affects everyone differently and it can be a very hidden condition. My life could of been quite different without it but it could have been worse. Im lucky to have found a job coding and the silver lining of the pandemic is wfh. I see it like you have to play with the cards your dealt and whatever you can change for the better then try to. It&#39;s not been an easy road till now but I try and remain hopeful for the future.I know it must be even harder considering your circumstances and your health. I hope this helps to know your not alone at least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That sounds incredibly tough.My brother has a similar/worse sickness that halves his life expectancy. He&#39;s also a programmer. Some quick thoughts from going through the downs with him:- There&#39;s no silver bullet. More sleep, better nutrition, more sports, and less stress make a difference.- My brother literally left a PhD in treatment optimization using ML at Cambridge because pharmaceutical companies are churning such better treatment so fast that optimization past ones felt irrelevant. The bad news is that most new treatments only stabilize your situation, so you have to stay as healthy as you can until the cure comes. We felt it was better to plan around this, and open the door to be positively surprised, than hope for the moon and get crushed with never ending disappointment.- There are many ways of earning a living that don&#39;t involve programming. Career switches can be daunting when you&#39;ve lost self confidence, but most jobs require only a fraction of the brain it takes to program.- If the prospects are very gloomy, consider changing country. We had my brother move country so he could get a medication that&#39;s not covered at home and costs &gt;$250k/year. The medication changed his life, and will soon be covered at home too. Having to leave your friends for health reasons suck, but European countries offer such better health coverage that it can be worth it. And it&#39;s easier living a happy life when you don&#39;t have to worry about unpredictably becoming homeless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made that image![1]. And this is not the first time it&#39;s been on the front page of HN either[2]. So I&#39;d like to share some context that I&#39;ve not mentioned elsewhere before.My father died from alcoholism in 2004. He made his living writing software (hence why I do too, and why I enjoy HN). But he also, for a short time, taught Astronomy evening classes. I&#39;ve always felt short-changed by the emotional absence and traumatic passing of my male parent. But the continued virality of this image has been some sort of magical glimmer from the depths of the universe that it was still his shoulders that I stood on in order to reach where I am today. Maybe it was the glint in his eyes every time he showed me the latest APOD image[3], and the deep love with which he would explain their contexts. I made this composite image of Andromeda and the moon precisely because of that extra commentary, or rather I should say, extra love, of the night sky that my father gave me. Seeing it here, sparkling in the &#34;night sky&#34; of the HN front page stirs the same kind of wonder I sometimes feel catching those million year old specks of light above my head. Reminding me that though the universe is mostly cold and dark that doesn&#39;t diminish its warmth and brightness.1. https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceporn/comments/1u0dxs/andromeda...2. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=229923843. https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This (or some sort of very similar comparison) prompted me to figure out how to locate Andromeda. And I could not see anything, So I bought a nice pair of binoculars, and perhaps I could see something, but it was impossible to tell for sure. until I went camping in Arizona, I was looking at the stars, I remembered how to find Andromeda, remembered my binoculars. everything had came together and there it was! it looked like a blue mist.But really it was a nearly spiritual experience. Out in the cold Arizona desert, more stars than I have ever seen in my life and you bring up a pair of binoculars to what looks like an empty area of sky and it too is full of stars, And there is this blue mist, the furthest thing you can see with the naked eye(at least with better eyes than mine) with billions and billions of stars contained within. I don&#39;t know, but you feel stuff under those circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It may be obvious and this may be a bit pedantic, but the “actual size” and “size compared to the moon” part is confusing, as comparing the size of two objects is usually comparing two objects at the same scale.If someone was completely clueless, they would think Andromeda is a teeny tiny galaxy. But it’s actually 110,000 light years wide — quite a bit bigger than the moon. :)The title show just be something along the lines of “Andromeda in the sky if it were brighter, next to the moon”. Or just “Andromeda if it were brighter”.I say this because I’ve seen other “X compared to Y” articles on HN (one compared planets and the sun to the moon, where the moon was a pixel), and these are all at-scale comparisons. So I was expecting something similar here from the title."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s why interrupt is inherently more efficient: as long as both participants are willing to yield to interrupt-denies and counter-interrupts when interrupting, you have shifted the communication mode from:A) Anticipate up front what other person needs to hear and say it allB) Rapid adjustment to ideal info requirements as your model of their knowledge/interest is live-updated.But the trick people seem to miss is that interrupt-denies and counter-interrupts make the whole thing possible.When I&#39;m talking with someone for whom this style is natural, there can be many very rapid small gestures to interrupt, which sometimes are accepted and sometimes are rejected by a small &#34;just let me keep going, you&#39;ll see why&#34; gesture. Each of those gestures takes a fraction of a second (and generally does not actually break flow of speech, just eye contact + a little head motion), and conversations employing them are far more enjoyable because information flow is near optimal.On the other hand, when speaking with anti-interrupt people, I often get so bored it&#39;s hard to pay attention because either 1) they left something out that I wanted to ask about so I can&#39;t follow what they are saying, or 2) I already had a thorough understanding of something they insist on giving a long explanation of."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a strong habit of &#34;autocompleting&#34; people&#39;s thoughts in my head before they&#39;re done saying them. I&#39;m only right maybe ~60% of the time, but it comes with a strong urge to interrupt them and let them know where I think they&#39;re going. This is especially true if I can tell that it will take them multiple sentences to finish their thought. It does not come from a place of &#34;you&#39;re wasting my time, I get it, jeez&#34;, but more from a &#34;I understand the point you&#39;re making and I am eager to hear the next thing you have to share.&#34;What I&#39;ve noticed is that my habit of interruption is received wildly differently by different kinds of people. It drives some people absolutely crazy, and in these settings I&#39;ve learned to be a little more mindful and try to restrain myself from interjecting so frequently. However, for other people, it works wonderfully and we&#39;ll get into a really fast-moving conversation where less redundant information is shared.My theory is that two well-intentioned interrupters can have a pleasant conversation, and two well-intentioned waiters can have a pleasant conversation, but any pairing of an interrupter and a waiter will be disastrous unless both are very mindful of how they participate in the conversation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised no one here has mentioned the power dynamics of interruption.  It is well known in psychology that interrupting anothers speech is a way to exert power.  The boss can interrupt anyone, no one interrupts the boss.  It&#39;s one of several types of interruption:https://www.psychmechanics.com/psychology-of-interrupting/Interrupting someone can say &#34;I am more important than you&#34;.  This can also cause failures to communicate since the boss can change the subject and the interrupted speaker may never get to finish their thought.  I&#39;ve seen projects fail because a boss intentionally interrupted people who were trending in a direction they did not want to go, squashing anyone who was pointing out a major flaw in the bosses plans, which resulted in building things in a bad way and then having the flaw manifest and cause the project to fail.There are other types of interruption though that can be more supportive or more like parallel conversations.  The efficiency of those often depends on the quality of the participants memory and ability to follow multiple threads simultaneously."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool project! A true, open source alternative to Postman will be valuable. It seems like you’ve got the major elements in place.Unsolicited UX notes…I read Hacker News on mobile, so tried the app on mobile and ran into some challenges. In order to save space, eliminate the right click, and work on mobile please consider changing:    You can right click here to create a new request or a new folder

To the following (illustrated using pseudo markdown):    [Create request] or [Create a folder]

It would also be helpful to replace the GitHub star link with a link to your README. GitHub star links are problematic because they require a login that adds friction that prevents people from getting to your README page. People will login if they decide to star the project, but they might never get to your GitHub if they don’t have time to login or can’t easily login on the device where they’re reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Last time I posted this it didn&#39;t garner much interest.Looks good.  I use Postman daily and it sucks, so always open to alternatives.I don&#39;t recall what it looked like the last time you posted, but I wonder if part of the low interest is because upon arrival it doesn&#39;t instantly jump out to the visitor that this is something you can host/run locally.
It&#39;s very easy to miss the Github links top right.  And if you don&#39;t realise that, then what you see is a third party website expecting you to send your development requests through their UI, which is off-putting.As I say, I don&#39;t remember, but that may be why I skipped it last time.

I started watching the video first and was a little troubled that the bellows appeared to be home-made, crappy looking, and not nearly as effective as they could be. Aftermarket bellows are not hard to find and are not even that expensive if you get them from China. But then I saw that he made them out of _floppy disks_ and decided that was pure genius.This also made me realize that a computer keyboard pretty closely resembles the right hand of a chromatic button accordion, so I assume that&#39;s how it&#39;s laid out.Anyway, he certainly plays this cobbled-together instrument far better than I&#39;ll ever play my analog accordion. There are MIDI and other &#34;digital&#34; accordions out there but they are either extremely expensive or limiting in terms of what you can do with them, or both.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"a cool thing you can do with MagicDNS: Set your &#34;global nameserver&#34; to a host within your tailnet and run your own resolver accessible &#34;anywhere&#34;.It&#39;s easy enough to set up pi-hole.net on a machine on your LAN and configure your home router to hand out DHCP records that will instruct LAN machines to use it, but if I wanted to have DNS-based ad-blocking at the coffee shop or library or elsewhere I previously had my pi-hole listening on a public IPv4&#39;s port 53 and deal with resolve.conf etc... and boy howdy does running an internet-accessible DNS resolver suck! My server would receive millions of requests, weird reflection attacks like [1], probes, the whole nine, it made the dashboarding useless for personal tracking.But now my pi-hole only listens on my LAN network and its tailnet address, and any machine connected to the tailnet including my phone will use the pi-hole without configuration on any network via MagicDNS.[1]: https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/ther..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think you&#39;re forgetting the main reason: the group of people using it to communicate is really small and shrinking every year.The only large group of people who still primarily use SMS to communicate person-to-person is Android users in the USA.Every other country has settled on either Telegram, WeChat, WhatsApp or FB Messenger, or other niche apps. These apps work on both iOS and Android and often also Windows. I haven&#39;t sent an SMS in probably 12 years. I don&#39;t know anyone who has.It&#39;s only in the US that iMessage is so prevalent that Android users have to use SMS, the only other way of messaging iOS devices. And the US is quickly becoming a de-facto iOS only country. It already has more than 50% market share, even 80% among young people.With the US going (almost) full iMessage and the rest of the world having already settled on another app there simply no point to supporting SMS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SMS was, in my opinion, the killer feature for Signal. Telling people to install yet-another-inbox which was only going to be used by their one privacy-weirdo friend was a non-starter.Saying &#34;this is a better SMS app&#34; got people on-board and let them &#34;upgrade&#34; to secure messaging.  That&#39;s why I started using it in the &#34;TextSecure&#34; days.But, sadly, I agree with Signal&#39;s reasoning here. Mixing the two protocols was annoyingly complex. If someone stopped using Signal, messages you sent to them would never arrive - with no notification.  And there&#39;s no obvious way to &#34;downgrade&#34; to SMS.I was working on RCS a decade ago. I&#39;m glad to see it is finally getting somewhere - but I&#39;m sad it is at the expense of better and more secure protocols."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once spend several euros sms-ing instead of what I thought was Signal-ing with someone in another country. Since then I keep the two strictly in 2 different apps.I certainly wont mourn for this. Sms gets super expensive to other countries (outside the EU), it also gets super expensive when you don&#39;t pre-pay for a bundle (it&#39;s 2 eur for 1000 messages, then 25ct per message after that, ridiculous). Imho dutch carriers did everything they could to kill sms, and now I&#39;m happy for it. The only bad thing is that my society at large seems to have chosen Whatsapp as it&#39;s replacement..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this point it&#39;s pretty much common knowledge that legislators engage in insider trading using nonpublic, oftentimes classified information and intelligence gathered on the taxpayer dime routinely and with no fear of political or legal repercussions.  They&#39;re not particularly motivated to close this loophole either, for reasons which should be obvious.This should be a much bigger issue, IMO.  We the People need to make them understand this blatant self dealing will not be tolerated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; That same day, while the stock market remained lofty, Dr. Auchincloss reported selling $15,001 to $50,000 of a stock mutual fund. Days later he sold two more mutual funds and a stock&gt; Dr. Auchincloss disclosed six sales of mutual funds that day, totaling between $111,006 and $315,000 in value.And&gt; The rate cuts hadn’t immediately calmed investors. Stock trading was halted for 15 minutes on the morning of March 16 when the S&amp;P 500 fell 7%, triggering a so-called circuit breaker. The index staggered to the closing bell, down 12%.&gt; That same day, Ms. Chao, the transportation secretary, made three purchases in stock funds that track the S&amp;P 500 and the U.S. stock market broadly, totaling between $600,003 and $1.2 million, according to her financial disclosures.Every time I click on one of these articles, I expect to find some individual stock trading related to specific companies on the receiving end of government action. However, when it ends up being vague examples of officials buying and selling broad-market or S&amp;P index funds, it&#39;s much harder to see where the &#34;insider trading&#34; angle comes from. Especially when we have examples of officials trading in March, a full month after the viral panic had already spread through even public forums like Twitter.The line needs to be drawn somewhere, and I&#39;m not convinced that forbidding public officials from buying and selling generic index and mutual funds is really that big of a concern, IMO.Now if someone can find evidence of government officials buying something like Moderna stock ahead of the FDA approval, then by all means let&#39;s prosecute with stiff consequences."</p>
