								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years back I got audited, and it was called an &#34;electronic audit&#34; by the IRS. Which basically meant that they had their computer systems scour a bunch of the bank records and discovered that I had forgotten to claim a 1099 for some contract work I had. OK, so they sent me a computer print out and they had cross checked everything on my return electronically, my property tax deductions, my stock dividends so on and so on.Ok, so if they can do all that automatically for an &#34;electronic audit&#34; why am I filing a return, just run that thing and send it to me and I can file an exception if there is something on it I disagree with.I think the answer has already been identified in several other comments here, a heavy lobby effort on the part of Intuit, H&amp;R and whoever else to keep it tricky and complex so you have to buy their B.S&gt; software or services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny side note: I had a flat mate once who was on a working holiday from Japan.He was in love with and endlessly curious about English slang, it’s basically all we talked about.I remember explaining to him why my uni friends and I referred to things as being “craptastic”, starting with American marketing’s love affair with the portmanteau.He got it pretty quickly and enjoyed using it in conversation.The saying that was harder for him to understand was “fuck all”.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the kind of pain that comes from trusting scammers and nincompoops about unworkable blockchain &#34;scalability&#34; fixes.Here&#39;s the sequence. Those dumb enough to ignore it are doomed to repeat the pattern. I&#39;m probably getting some details wrong in this Rube Goldberg scheme, so feel free to correct.1. Citing &#34;Ethereum network congestion,&#34; Axie Infinity announces an ethereum side chain, Ronin.[1]2. Ronin was a centralized server (therefore fast and cheap) authorized to make Ethereum Mainnet transactions. The server was a hot wallet in other words.3. The Ronin team tried to make it look like they were &#34;decentralized&#34; by splitting signing authority among 9 &#34;validator nodes.&#34; (the article)4. An attacker obtained 5 of 9 keys, which is the signing threshold.5. With the required threshold of keys, the attacker signed the transitions moving assets off the Ronin servers.None of this is new. The Bitcoin &#34;block size war&#34; was fought over this very point. Unworkable scaling schemes are going to end in disaster with no fallback, and no recourse for those who lose money. You end up with nothing, and will be sad.And it&#39;s sad that the same lessons keep getting replayed over and over. It&#39;s really simple. Can your &#34;blockchain&#34; be validated with regular hardware? Does it use a secure consensus algorithm? Is there a secure side channel through which low-value transactions can flow? If not, you&#39;re going to have a bad time when the shenanigans start happening.Now, is that side channel effectively a single server? Handling hundreds of millions of dollars of value? Have they rolled their own crypto? If yes to any of these, get out and stay out.[1] https://medium.com/axie-infinity/introducing-ronin-axie-infi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m out of the loop and trying to understand - people lent over half a billion dollars of their &#39;real&#39; fake money (ETH) to a game studio so they could transact on the studio&#39;s sidechain because gas fees are prohibitively expensive on ETH, and then the game studio got hacked and lost it all?How was this ever going to end any other way? Imagine how preposterous the idea of storing $650mm in USD in a random game studio&#39;s checking account would be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a system run by people, the transaction could be reversed, traced, and the culprits eventually brought to justice.In a system run by algorithms, designed to avoid oversight by people (governments), there is no such powers. There&#39;s no reversal. There&#39;s no checking the name on the account the transfer was to. It&#39;s just gone.I do not understand why people who have legal intentions would want to be part of the crypto economy. There&#39;s nothing but more risks with zero benefits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have to admit I find this whole situation (and also Krebs article bizarre). The problem seems to be that tech companies approve EDRs without much checking. Then the argument somehow becomes it is essentially impossible for them to check because there could be any of the thousands of police departments in the world requesting the EDR? Why should MS in the US somehow respond to a request from police department in Cuxhafen in Germany?I think the argument being made here is one of those &#34;we can&#39;t make a perfect solution so no solution works&#34;, which is nonsense. Simply don&#39;t answer requests from police departmenents you can&#39;t verify. I bet you if a police department would request some business sensitive information they would not hand it over without going over the subpoena with a fine toothed comb. The issue is just that they don&#39;t value their customers privacy high enough to do a proper check."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Trying to find more information about Emergency Data Requests leads in large part right back to this discussion and the original Brian Krebs post, with a few hits to various private organizations that explain what it takes to use an Emergency Data Request with them.I&#39;m having trouble finding any basis for this in law.  Can anyone help clarify that?  Are EDRs just 100% voluntary compliance on the part of some private organizations who are choosing to divulge customer information without an actual court order?If that&#39;s the case, why are we lamenting the existence of the hackers and not publicly shaming the companies complying with these nonsense EDRs?  Real court orders aren&#39;t that hard to get, and at least there&#39;d be a more blatant crime to prosecute if anyone forges them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;“The only way to clean it up would be to have the FBI act as the sole identity provider for all state and local law enforcement,” Weaver said. “But even that won’t necessarily work because how does the FBI vet in real time that some request is really from some podunk police department?”There are already preexisting systems for solving this sort of problem. For example the FBI could set up a PGP based certificate authority[1] for email. Then the FBI signs the identities of the podunk police departments ahead of time. All the service providers would need would be the FBI identity (PGP public key) which they would sign once to authorize it and then they would be able to verify emails coming from any of the podunk police departments with no extra work on their part. This example comes with a revocation system that actually would work in this case.All secret key material would remain under the control of the specific FBI department acting as the certificate authority. No third party involvement would be required.[1] https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2021/05/12/202105-hello-openpgp..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what is so frustrating about companies harming many people by small amounts. There is no actual recourse for the individuals. If an individual missed a credit card payment by mistake, the bank would assuredly charge them a late fee, report the payment to the credit agencies, etc. But when the company makes a mistake like this, no penalty, no consequences. It really should be the other way around—we should extend grace to the person rather than the company, yet the company basically has more “rights” in a way than the person."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article seems intentionally misleading. It&#39;s implying that if the organization disabled the &#34;Web &amp; App Activity&#34; setting will not carry over to the user. That&#39;s not what the support page says though:&gt; If you disabled Web &amp; App Activity in the Admin console, it is turned off for Google Workspace users. Users can turn it on if they want.So nobody will be tracked on the web who wasn&#39;t previously. The setting that will be turned on is just the one controlling search history within Gmail, Docs, Drive etc.(But it does seem surprising that they didn&#39;t just show a option dialogue on the next load of a Workspace app and ask the user to choose.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently left Google after spending a few years there.Internally Google puts a huge premium on user safety and privacy. So much so that shipping anything requires getting changes through a regulatory process to safeguard users.Google doesn’t do a good job of marketing its process. In some domains Google does explicitly use user behavior to drive revenue, so from the outside it becomes easy to spin changes like this as encroaching on user privacy, but I don’t see that here. I see something like a PM who is trying to surface some more functionality to users directly, and some engineers who spent far too long with lawyers to get sign off on this change.It may be fashionable to sensationalize product changes like this, but the truth is often more mundane.Edit: found a comment from the PM themselves in a previous discussion https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30174304"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awesome!  Glad this is finally out, and really looking forward to seeing what features the React team adds in follow-up releases.The Working Group model really helped us in the community give feedback - APIs like `useSyncExternalStore` wouldn&#39;t have happened otherwise, and I really appreciate the responsiveness on that topic.FWIW, React-Redux v8 is in beta right now:- https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releasesI think it&#39;s basically ready to go, but I haven&#39;t had a chance to really test out the SSR support I added a couple months ago.  I&#39;d love to have some help testing that out.v7 will _run_ with React 18, but v8 has been specifically reworked to behave correctly when used with React&#39;s new &#34;Concurrent Rendering&#34; capabilities.  We&#39;ve also converted React-Redux itself to TS (no more separate types package).Ideally, I&#39;d like to release v8 as final in the next week or two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how concurrent mode in React stacks up with Solid.js.

I suspect not, but it is an unfortunate accident he was born in and runs his company from Russia, the government of which is a dirtbag, so, correct me if I am wrong, Kaspersky must be a dirtbag by association, but especially for discovering Stuxnet. Believable, but I think the real reasons Kaspersky is persona non grata is due to having discovered Stuxnet, and Kaspersky Lab suspected of uncovering secret US cyberweapons in the future.I am a patriot, but even I don&#39;t appreciate being lied to by my government. It would be good if the next best cyber security firm and software was half as good as Kaspersky&#39;s. But I suspect not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Kaspersky also maintains that it “doesn’t have any ties with any government, including Russia’sThis take is either naive in the extreme, or disingenuous.For a security company trying to maintain a trusted reputation, neither of those two options is good.While possibly technically accurate, it is a dodge or a flub that overlooks the fact that their autonomy can be usurped by the governments where they are based and where they operate.To be fair, this is true of almost any company I can think of, although I wonder if a DAO could get around it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be against standardized tests, but I grew up as a low-income minority in a single-parent household and I ended up getting into good schools pretty much only due to my high test scores, which has been a life changer. Other than test scores, I couldn&#39;t afford to do any fancy extra-curriculars. It felt a lot more achievable to know I can change my life if I just focus and do well on a test than it would if I had to somehow do a bunch of random things to look competitive on paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Definitely for the best. Standardized testing was pretty much the only reason I and many other working class folks I know could get into good schools -- I was never going to do a million side activities, and my summers were spent working, not building my academic resume.Of course the real tragedy is that we fixate so much on college, even prestigious ones, at all given how unnecessary they are for making people into productive and happy human beings. This change is significant but affects less than one percent of the population each year.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hated taking the SAT/ACT, but holy cow are we in the US in a better situation than Chinese students dealing with the Gaokao. A Chinese pen-pal once showed me some calculus problems from the Gaokao and the example I saw (a bunch of integrals) looked like a math test a sadist would create: long, complicated expressions just for the sake of complexity, &#34;ugly&#34; numbers that turned into messy fractions you have to carry around. I (a graduate engineering student at the time) couldn&#39;t identify any trick or educational point to the complexity, only the malice of the people giving the test.EDIT: wording"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is pretty clear why peoples interests in nuclear power has gone up. Natural gas prices have gone up and as a result the energy price that customers has to pay is swinging up and down based on supply and demand. It the same story as in many other places in the world. Nuclear represent a stable price of energy that doesn&#39;t get impacted by changing fossil fuel prices, and while the initial capital cost is high, stability and freedom from fossil fuels has their benefits. Especially since fossil fuel and wars tend to be associated with each other. It is a bit indicative of the global age we live in that a war between Russia and Ukraine is dictating what a Japanese citizen is paying for electricity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title is misleading and I think many commenters are missing the point. This is support for *restarting existing reactors* and not really a support for nuclear in general. This may lead to the latter, but it is very different turning on reactors that already exist (meaning some danger already exists) compared to creating more.Proposed title change:&gt; Majority in Japan backs restarting existing nuclear reactors"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a time during the first shut down when my company decided to reduce peoples hours and also reduce their salaries instead of laying off more employees. I end up working 20 hours a week (instead of my normal 35) with a reduced salary (and I was even able to collect partial California unemployment benefits for the remainder of the reduced hours under a special program called Workshare).Honestly it was amazing - made me really want to find a job that was less pay but also that low in hours. Working less than 40 is nice but once you get down to 20 you have whole DAYS where you can do whatever you want. You sometimes start work at noon or end at noon and then have the remainder of your weekday to yourself or in the company of others. It was an odd experience seeing my neighbours and friends going through so much stress and pandemic related BS while I was (temporarily at least) having revelations about how much I wanted to work in life. Fortunately and unfortunately it was very short lived."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the content of the article, but I don’t agree with the premise that these things aren’t also “work”.Engineers tend to obsess over, “focused work” like it’s the only way to be productive, and anything that’s not “focused work” is wasted time.  That is a surefire way to burn out.Instead, finding ways to “riff” on your job by doing work with longer time horizons of payoff keeps your job fun.It’s all “work”.  Maybe the title ought to be, “Stop obsessing over focused work.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Getting my task completed at my own pace makes me feel good. Often that is fast and on time. In my heart, when I touch the keyboard, I feel like a greyhound dog with a little Bob Ross afro - it can be a race, a competition, but it is also an expression of my art.This article makes me feel bad because in the authors world, people like me are relegated to worker bee monkies trying to please the bossman due to pathology or some such delusion. I work this way because it pleases me. Doing my tasks diligently and in a timely manner affords me more time to relax, review what I have created, and enjoy it rather than drag myself to the next task.A bit off topic but as of late there is this creeping normalization of intentionally subpar or less optimized results I&#39;m noticing in our industry but also general society.When did we become so not only complacent but also discouraging of any genuine effort? It is as if everyone is so aloof that if you show any effort or appreciation of your craft that you&#39;re societally acknowledging your own serfdom or that you&#39;re serving &#34;the man&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a physician. I really appreciate Tom’s enthusiasm, but I think that enthusiasm led him to overestimate the significance of the problem. Moreover he didn’t really understand for whom he was building this product. At first he thought it would be a consumer product. But he realized that consumers would not pay/subscribe and later learned that advertising wouldn’t work. Next he thought doctors would pay because “Doctors have money, right?” Again paying for this or any service is an expense. Its value has to justify the expense. We pay hundreds of dollars a year for UpToDate because it’s valuable. Cochrane is the gold standard for meta-analyses and they’re publishing for topics that are of clinical significance. Ultimately I doubt anyone is going to change their practice based on this product because there isn’t a compelling reason to do so. 
My major observation is that Tom tried to make a healthcare startup with negligible understanding of healthcare: the players, how payments work, how physicians practice, and what patients want/need. By not understanding the environment you’re not going to be able to understand the Problem which means your Solution will probably fail. This is a mistake repeated by most of the engineer founded health startups I’ve read about.
Finally for anyone wondering I usually recommend ibuprofen 800mg every 8 hours and Tylenol 1000mg every 8 hours. This isn’t medical advice, just something you may find from a quick search."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a fun read, but I think it came to the wrong conclusion. The real issue imo was &#34;I had practically only weeks of runway&#34;. You just don&#39;t have time to make it happen.As a fellow start up founder, I see most of my job being just buying time for the business. Buying time to make, to talk, and to think.It wasn&#39;t like the tool had no value to Susan, maybe with a booth at her go-to annual expo, mentioning a few past lawsuits the tool could avoid, and an affinity partnership with her industry association, the tool would have become a fact of life for her.It&#39;s a lot of work, I&#39;m not denying that. Yet, this is the sort of thing YC&#39;s idealized startup stories often fail to say. If &#34;instant Product Market Fit&#34; is so good, then how come practically every new high flying SV startup is using loads of VC money to &#34;bend the market to the product&#34;?Exciting Startups have to venture far, it&#39;s not about &#34;we let you buy your potatoes online&#34; anymore. Chances are you won&#39;t get deals by talking to people once. I wouldn&#39;t say that means your idea is bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In all honesty, I don’t think the author correctly identified his error. And I think that’s a shame. It’s right here:&gt; Here I was, living the Silicon Valley dream: making the world a better place through technology.I don’t know how this has become a thing people believe, however widely it might be believed. But if it’s representative of SV or tech innovation at all, it’s either wildly distorted through a wealthy person’s pet futurism project—or held in the imagination of someone aspiring to that stature. SV is about making money, that’s it, that’s the whole story.The totally overlapping error here was assuming those things—making the world better, and making money—aren’t inherently in conflict. And overlapping that: assuming that a profit driven health care system has altruistic goals as such, rather than in concert with its profit-driving priorities.This project could have been successful (and could still do if the author or anyone else wants to pursue it). And it could have been a valuable contribution to society.The author would probably have realized this error if he’d considered entering a global market where health care has different economic incentives. Programs like this which help people are funded by government contracts and grants, not by payment from arbitrary people acting on their arbitrary interests."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some good books on the general topic that I&#39;ve read over the years are Debt: The First 5000 Years by Graeber:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_YearsMoney: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing by Goldstein (also of NPR&#39;s Planet Money):* https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358103-money* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_GoldsteinAnd The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession by Bernstein:&gt; In this exciting book, the late Peter L. Bernstein tells the story of history&#39;s most coveted, celebrated, and inglorious asset: gold. From the ancient fascinations of Moses and Midas through the modern convulsions caused by the gold standard and its aftermath, gold has led many of its most eager and proud possessors to a bad end. And while the same cycle of obsession and desperation may reverberate in today&#39;s fast-moving, electronically-driven markets, the role of gold in shaping human history is the striking feature of this tumultuous tale. Such is the power of gold.* https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Power+of+Gold:+The+History+o...* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._BernsteinBernstein was also the author of Against The Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a data scientist, perhaps this is a case of a hammer looking for a nail, but  personal finance made a lot more sense when I started treating “money” as: 1) a collection of arbitrary rules invented by humans, 2) probability distributions over the ability to exchange certain assets at different points in time, 3) a giant optimization program.So, the terms “U.S. dollar”, “fixed rate mortgage”, “401k”, “capital gains”, etc. don’t really have any inherent meaning beyond the set of rules that govern their interactions. This rule system itself can change over time depending on politics and human emotions, so you have to try to model the dynamics of this meta-system as well, even though that’s pretty difficult.Once you’ve gathered all the different rules into some programmatic representation, then you decide what it is you want out of life and at what points in your life, then you start optimizing. For example, would you rather have a 10% chance of having $1,000 on some future date, or a 1% chance of having $10,000? The expected return is the same in both cases, so your optimization should really consist of targeting a specific shape for the entire distribution of outcomes rather than a single number (or specific assets).Not surprisingly, the average person (including me) does not have the right combination of 1) detailed knowledge of the global financial system and its rules, 2) how all these rules are likely to change, or 3) the technical background to implement the advanced mathematics required to optimize all of this in an accurate way that actually makes valid predictions.So most people instead just guess and base their financial plans on their hunches about how “money” works, and large organizations that have the time to do all of this modeling in a more rigorous way come out much further ahead.I still think simplifying the “rules” of finance would be one of the best things we could do to reduce wealth inequality, as inequality seems to largely be hidden in the highly volatile landscape of the cost function for the optimization problem I described."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have basically the opposite opinion of this article. I often hold up Rocket League as an example of a great free-to-play game. 1) You 100% can unlock a lot of cosmetic items through free play. 2) The items that you buy have absolutely no impact on gameplay and are just visuals.For the same reason that people wear nice clothes in real life, why are you surprised that some people want to look cool in a video game? Are you surprised that people don’t just wear monochrome black shirts in real life? Likewise, you can resell RL items, there’s a market for that. Are you surprised when you can’t resell a shirt you wore for a year at the same price as when you bought it?That’s not to say that games where progression is locked behind time gates where you need to buy 1000 Realm Warp Crystals or whatever just to actually play the game aren’t a toxic hell. But that doesn’t seem to be what the article is pushing against."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, Nintendo made a wonderful game called Super Mario Run. It was simple - Mario automatically runs and you tap to jump - but surprisingly deep. The timing of the jumps and the height of jump was paramount, and there was a ton of replayability in trying to get out-of-reach coins and finding shortcuts. It also captured the aesthetic of the Mario World games with modern graphics. I was VERY skeptical of a mobile Mario game, but was won over by the quality of game design and the clear level of polish.Nintendo charged $9.99 for this game. The response was absolute evisceration in the ratings. Mobile game players EXPECTED a F2P experience that would waste their time with energy charge ups, loot boxes, etc. and were upset when Nintendo didn&#39;t do that.
In response, Nintendo switched to this type of experience for their next release, Fire Emblem, which performed much better.The Wikipedia article for Super Mario Run explains in detail.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Run#CommercialA select quote - &#39;[Nintendo President] Kimishima said that &#34;we honestly prefer the Super Mario Run model&#34;, though in a June 2017 investor question-and-answer session, he said &#34;in the future we will consider not only a single set price, but other methods that incorporate a wider variety of elements that allow as many consumers as possible to play&#34;&#39;"</p>

Absurd.This just is a guess, but, I&#39;d wager that most Google OSS developers just wanted a fancy corporate job and got stuck interfacing with the public on an OSS project. I don&#39;t think that most of them aspired to be OSS developers and it shouldn&#39;t be a requirement.[0]: Just today a two year old bug that I&#39;ve been watching was closed by merging a pull request that was first opened in early-2020, closed as stale in mid-2021, and re-submitted/merged this week."</p>

These safeguards included:  * Only serving the iframe at specific times, presumably when they knew an intended target would be visiting the site.
  * In some email campaigns the targets received links with unique IDs. This was potentially used to enforcea one-time-click policy for each link and allow the exploit kit to only be served once.
  * The exploit kit would AES encrypt each stage, including the clients’ responses with a session-specific key.
  * Additional stages were not served if the previous stage failed.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like walkie talkies are something all network engineers need to play with. Furthermore, remember that real world telephone and radio networks were in fact... Networks. (Called &#39;nets&#39; in the radio world)Ethernet, and 802.11, are both based on the concept of a singular channel shared by many individuals. When Alice talks, she says &#39;I&#39;m Alice calling Bob, can you hear me Over&#39;.Alice is the source address. Bob is the destination address. Over is the stop code/stop bit signifying the end of frame. The payload is &#39;can you hear me&#39;.-------This is everything up to layer 3. But if you wanted to send a radio/telegram across the country, you need one more layer, IP4 or the ARRL protocol (American Radio Relay League meets on the air at predestinated times to pass messages to each other on Ham radio frequencies. It&#39;s a human network)I&#39;m Alice, calling the Eastern Operators. I&#39;d like you to relay a message to Bob for me. The message is &#39;Can you Hear me&#39;, Over.This is a radio frame like all others, but an additional layer has been added. The radio operator has its own protocol built on top of the Frames.------Dave may overhear all of this chatter, but Dave knows to stay off the channel (otherwise he will cause interference). Only if Dave is addressed specifically would Dave respond (Ex: This is Alice, calling Dave. How are you doing? Over)We can see that the operator is itself just another person on the network. The operator may have a message from the rest of the world.This is the Eastern Operator calling Alice. I&#39;m relaying a message from Bob. The message is &#39;I got your message Alice!&#39;. Over.This is how a router may take a message from the greater internet and pass it to your local network."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The answers I get have taught me that most programmers don&#39;t have a basic understanding of how the internet works outside of their narrow specialtyJust yesterday I couldn&#39;t fall asleep because my stupid brain thought something like &#34;What information would I need to fully grasp the topic &#39;programming&#39;?&#34;.
Since I am a visual thinker, I quickly started to draw a mind map in my head that basically started with the history (starting with Alan Turing), going through electrical engineering, went through different layers and finished in different programming languages. The languages alone branched out in a pattern so large that my head startet to hurt. It included different languages, concepts, architecture patterns and compilers.
Each one of those steps is important and you will find people specialized in any of those which will tell you that their part is the most important.I am a web developer myself and I try to learn and improve every day. 
But I also think to be really good you have to focus on a few specific parts of the process and not try to be an expert in everything there. That grew way too complex quite a while ago and trying to understand everything usually only makes you mediocre in everything but good at nothing in particular.
If a web developer does not know the difference of a GET and a POST I would seriously suggest to evaluate their choice of profession.
But for example the last time I&#39;ve had to care about a subnet mask was 11 years ago and I would not ask anyone I recruit as a web dev to know anything about this topic. You have to draw a line somewhere.
My bottom line in all this is that you should have at least a general understanding on the whole process, but you only need to be an expert in a few of them to be really good."</p>

ScottI started my career in international development, and the book above provides a dozen case studies on states using scientific management, stats, etc. to try and control their growth/populations/economies and failing miserably.It is a beautiful book in that it illustrates how difficult it is to actually manage a country and economy well, especially if you are trying to completely change it (i.e., &#34;develop&#34; it, solve poverty, etc.). It humbled me as a 22 year old &#34;professional&#34; wanting to fix the world.&#34;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&#34; by Jane Jacobs is a close second to this theme of economic, technocratic development.EDIT: I notice 22 upvotes. WOW! If you are a fan of this book or curious to hear more, please comment. Happy to elaborate. If you want a third book, The Evolution of Civilizations[1] is another fun one here. It tries to apply scientific principles and hypothesis testing to historical analysis![1] https://10millionsteps.com/review-evolution-of-civilizations"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"PiHKAL by Alexander and Ann Shulgin is on its face a book about love and chemistry. Taken together it becomes more of a treatise on how psychopharmacology is a method of personal and sociological analysis. Drug use becomes a psychological tool to manifest the phenomena of the mind that are normally hidden, and novel synthesis becomes a tool to then access the areas of the mind unexplored throughout history. Aside of all this, the Shulgin&#39;s story is one of absolute dedication to science in the face of its many impediments: internal psychology, interpersonal relations, social stigma, technical innovation, and authoritarian censorship."</p>

There have been a lot of things which have disappeared over the years – such as apps bundled with Windows 3.x which have disappeared in newer versions (for example, Reversi or Cardfile) – but which were never sold as independent products, do they count? And what about stuff which is discontinued but has an upwardly compatible replacement – Visual C++ is the successor to the Microsoft C/C++ line going back to the 1980s, in a somewhat similar way VB.NET is successor to the Microsoft BASIC line going back to the 1970s. Microsoft Mail was replaced by Exchange/Outlook, etc. Xenix, OS/2 and LAN Manager were effectively replaced by Windows NT, the POSIX/Interix/SFU/SUA subsystem was effectively replaced by WSL. There are also products Microsoft sold on behalf of third companies, whether rebranded or under their original names (I mentioned muLISP; muMATH and R:Base are other examples)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me Firefox’s UI design started going off the rails with Australis and Photon, where its UI began to be a major component of Firefox as a brand. I much preferred v1-v4 where Firefox felt more focused on being a tool that fit well into your desktop instead of trying to stand out.I’m sometimes tempted to try to start a Firefox fork that returns its UI to a “smaller part of a larger desktop” look and feel, but then I remember how impossible it would be to maintain that over time. Wish Gecko was still embeddable so one could just write a new UI and not have to keep patches maintained."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The issue with crypto is that reasonable use cases are early, and don’t attract attention except for niche communities.There’s a few big ones, for example, filecoin right now has created a commodity market for storage that is currently 10,000 cheaper than S3 in some instances. (See file.app for stats)But realistically, the interesting projects are very small and hard to find.However, scams and ponzi schemes, by their nature are very public, easy to find, and have lots of people talking about them (often for financial gain).Everyone building anything sane is so tired of having to explain that their thing isn’t a ponzi, isn’t an nft thing, and isn’t shilling proof of work, that they don’t post to hacker news, and so they exist outside of your bubble.Crypto is like the story of the blind scientists studying an elephant. The first one touches its trunk and says “it’s a snake!”, the next one touches its tusk and says “it’s a spear!”, the next one touches its side and says “it’s a wall!”. None have the correct answer, because no single party has a full view.The crypto skeptics are as irrational as the crypto optimists: firm believers in their own view, based on an incomplete information."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This format is interesting at first but when it starts getting to 5 paragraphs of dissecting each phrase, it gets too much.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article (or, rather, the commentary in the link above on the article) talks about the fallacious notion of &#34;market cap&#34; in regards to cryptocurrencies. That is to say, e.g., multiplying the number of bitcoins in existence times the current market price is a silly metric because the entire market would never be able to cash-out at that maximum price.What I was wondering was: is there a better number? e.g., is there a way to calculate the amount of USD put into a cryptocurrency across a timeframe? What I&#39;m imagining is a metric like (sum of all bitcoins bought by USD purchase price) - (sum of all bitcoins sold by USD sale price) = amount of USD that has been put &#34;into&#34; bitcoin. That first glance, one might expect this number to equal zero, but it should be greater than zero because of the new coins created by mining."</p>

The NES&#39; video output is composite from start to finish[1], with palette entries corresponding to approximate output frequencies for the color subcarrier.So there is no canonical palette for the NES - the colors produced by games varied by region, a little bit by unit, and especially because NTSC had trouble with stable color even by TV.So people imagine that RGB or HDMI mods of the NES are somehow tapping into a missing layer of raw color information, but what it&#39;s actually doing is intercepting communications with the PPU and modelling (on an fpga) an extra PPU that does operate in RGB, and then constructing a new video signal from that.And then you have to pick a palette, because there isn&#39;t just one.I have an RGB modded NES (a US toploader) but I doubt I will ever buy or make another one. At this point I think it&#39;s better to just use an upscaler, which will produce no less authentic a picture. The main benefit imo of the rgb mod is that there&#39;s less interference so the picture is clearer, even if you just output reconstructed composite from it.[1] There is actually a model of NES PPU that outputs RGB, it was used in the PlayChoice arcade machines (which generally used RGB monitors, not composite) and it has a palette that most people agree is ugly as sin."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There were so many things the NES did right.For instance the color palette was designed with aesthetics in mind:  it had 56 colors that you&#39;d want to use,  compared to the 216 colors of the web safe palette that must have been chosen by a physicist because 60% of them make me want to puke.The Atari 400 and 800 had an elaborate system for game-friendly video that couldn&#39;t touch what the NES did with tiles.  They did amazing things with the TI-99/4A (like simulate framebuffer graphics with tiles so long as you didn&#39;t need to cover the whole screen...  a trick you couldn&#39;t do with the character ROM talked about in this article) but it didn&#39;t have the brilliant end-to-end engineering of the NES...... And of course the ability to extend the hardware with the cartridge took advantage of the falling cost of electronics AND fit with the business model that the cheap console is subsidized by expensive games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Principally the thing it did right, having lived through the era, is bring a real video game home with Super Mario Bros.At the time I had a C64 and an Atari 2600, but would spend every quarter I could dig up at the arcade at the bowling alley next door playing pretty much anything, but especially Super Mario Bros.The Nintendo was the first console to bring the arcade home and it was absolutely revolutionary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wife and I were just talking about this yesterday. She is an extremely specialized surgeon and she is horrified by the academic publishing in her area of expertise. It is often utterly wrong and conflicts directly with her experience. I&#39;m not sure she&#39;d agree with the reasons mentioned in this article here as the main issue - although we have personally seen less ethically motivated doctors publishing research to help line their pockets via the industry. In her opinion the main issue is that academic doctors HAVE to publish in order to advance their careers. So you end up with a never ending stream of terrible research, churned out by doctors that are not experts in doing research and that actually spend most of their time doing other things. This happens even at the best centers; at least in her area of expertise. I don&#39;t know what the solution is, but I do know that whenever she has needed treatment for herself she generally ignores most of the research and talks to the most experienced surgeon she can find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Evidence-based medicine, more than the indeed important issues raised in the article, is mostly impaired by the absolutely abysmal average quality of clinical research papers. The absolutism of higher-ups combined with their unrivalled (in the scientific world) statistical ignorance is hurting science more than anything else. And there&#39;s a reason to that: MDs are not scientists. We&#39;re highly-skilled workers, and more of the blue-collar kind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading this article I find only one problem with it, and that is the title.The problem the authors have so perfectly characterized has nothing to do with the emphasis on evidence that medicine requires, but on the distortion imposed on the system by large pharmaceutical companies.The reality of the obstacles standing in the way of rigorous testing for drug or therapy effectiveness does not make evidence-based medicine an illusion.In fact, the authors actually make a strong argument in favor of evidence-based medicine, by stating the need to acknowledge these biases. And that the reason for all these biases is greed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My partner sat in the same cube pod as someone who took their life. One day they were just gone and a crying family member came by to take away a box of things. There was no official acknowledgement of what happened, no service or memorializing, only hushed whispers. It was terrible.Thank you for your humane response to Pete&#39;s death, for creating room for the team to grieve and official acknowledgement that it was no longer business as usual. This is one of those moments that leadership really matters. There&#39;s more to being a leader than shipping a volume of features, you are also an important figure in the lives of your team and they need you in a time of crisis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pete would ask to work more hours. He claimed he could use the money. He was a contractor rememberAmidst the loss here, this line stood out to me and brings to mind all the terrible ways contractors are taken advantage of, or at least, treated and compensated vastly different than their &#34;staff&#34;/&#34;full-time&#34; peers who are often doing the exact same work. For fun, google the phrase &#34;permatemp&#34;.E.g. I had a past job as a middle manager where my team interfaced heavily with a group of contractor developers overseas.  When the time came to demo new features and place superlatives upon the various teams, I noticed my leadership cadre said nothing about the contractors and did not acknowledge any of the work they had done.I spoke up about it when the floor was given for anyone else to give kudos where they desired, and mentioned the overseas team and thanked their team lead for working with me on delivering. He spoke up and expressed his gratitude in kind.Apparently, this got my CTO into &#34;trouble&#34; with &#34;legal&#34; because I guess merely acknowledging contractors was some kind of a &#34;problem&#34;. As a result, my boss got in trouble. As a result, I got written up. I was out of that company within six months after relationship with my boss and CTO deteriorated immediately after I opened my darn mouth.For expressing gratitude.To contractors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with my current company (where we work mostly-remote) last year. One of my interviewers was a very sharp, experienced, and nice developer. After I learned they were going to make me an offer, I emailed my interviewers, and this developer emailed me back saying he was looking forward to working together.The week before I started, he passed away in a car accident. I was really looking forward to working with him, but I never got the opportunity.As soon as I found out, I again emailed everyone I knew at the company to express my condolences.When on-boarding I said “I know I’m joining at a rough time for the team”. It turned out it was the day after his funeral (which I found out my manager and at least some devs attended). They didn’t seem to be expecting empathy from a brand new hire, but some folks were obviously still mourning. I’m glad I acknowledged their loss. We didn’t dwell on it, but it might have been really awkward if I had just charged like a bull into a China shop saying “I’m so psyched to be joining your team!!!” as if nothing had happened.In my inbox, I also found an email from our CEO to the whole company (about 100 employees) from the week of his passing.There is also an archived Slack channel to memorialize him where different folks who knew him shared their fond memories. The company established an annual teamwork award in his name. And a lot of folks contributed to a GoFundMe for his son’s education.All of these things are strong indicators that I’m at an awesome company. We don’t say we’re “a family” (don’t believe it if your company or prospective company claims that - often it’s an outright lie and otherwise it’s code for a toxic culture with no boundaries), but we do care about each other.No matter your position, if empathy doesn’t come naturally, learn it. It will serve you in so many situations in life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience docker-slim[0] is the way to go for creating minimal and secure Docker images.I wasted a lot of time in the past trying to ship with Alpine base images and statically compiling complicated software. All the performance, compatibility, package availability headaches this brings is not worth it when docker-slim does a better job of removing OS from your images while letting you use any base image you want.Tradeoff is that you give up image layering to some extent and it might take a while to get dead-file-elimination exactly right if your software loads a lot of files dynamically (you can instruct docker-slim to include certain paths and probe your executable during build).If docker-slim is not your thing, “distroless” base images [1] are also pretty good. You can do your build with the same distro and then in a multi stage docker image copy the artifacts into distroless base images.[0] https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim[1] https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This and other common considerations and gotchas are brought up in Shekow&#39;s excellent Docker optimization guide.https://www.augmentedmind.de/2022/02/06/optimize-docker-imag...Was posted here last month: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30406076"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using `COPY --chmod` is not the correct solution for this. It works, of course, but it isn&#39;t very logical from Dockerfile readability standpoint. The real issue is the incorrect use of multi-stage builds. In multi-stage builds you define additional build stages where you prepare your binaries(eg. compiling them) and copy to the final runtime stage, so your final stage remains clean of temporary files created by your build steps. Based on your comment in your current build stage you run curl, extract etc., but you don&#39;t actually finish preparing the binary by correcting the executable bit. Instead, you copy the half-prepared binary to runtime stage and then try to continue your further modifications there. Eg. similarily if you would skip extracting step, copy the zip instead and extract it in runtime stage and then you would have the zip and the final binary in your exported image.Another red flag is that you run `apt-get` after copying the binary to runtime stage(because you still want to tweak the binary there). That means any time source for binary changes, the `apt` commands need to run again and are not cached. If you just add the executable bit in your build stage you can reorder them, so the `COPY` comes after `RUN`."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These comments make me feel like I&#39;m getting old, which is weird to me. There are so many proactive comments that remind me of my 18 year old self.Social awkwardness, for me and for a lot of people I know, sort of just vanished with age.
- The same kind of weird, unexplainable, vicious attitude that passes for cool among teenagers and some early adults fades for most people. The people who still adhere to that code go off and form their own cliques and you just don&#39;t see them anymore.
- Real adulthood is simpler socially. With personal stability (job, hobbies, network, etc.) and age you care less and less what people think and put less emphasis on what people think about you.
- At the same time, you judge people less and less because, what does your judgment really matter? And when you judge people less you judge yourself less.
- A lot of awkwardness is a function of trying hard to fit a social shape and failing. When you let go of most social expectations of yourself and others, in my experience mostly because of age and stability, you lose the awkwardness.If you really need help with social anxiety I have heard that there are psychologists who are good at treating it, although I have never used one myself.Take some comfort in knowing that it will probably pass with time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Practice. Practice practice practice. Which sounds daunting, but……now, I realize it’s unfair to map physical appearance to awkwardness, but…let’s take a look at me in 2008 versus 2021. https://imgur.com/7sR0qKt Can you infer I might have been awkward? Because I was awkward. Always had been, and in a lot of ways, I am still am.But I am vastly better than I used to be. And it was practice. Slow, slow, slow practice. I started at the gym. Built a little confidence. Got a job where I was required to be in more meetings. Built a little more confidence. Moved to a new city. Built even more confidence. Joined a sports league. Built yet even more confidence. It’s a slow process of leveling up and being out there and exposed to the world and learning to live in it.And as you get older, I find for me it’s gotten easier. People in their late-20s and 30s are not the back-biting den of snakes they were in high school—everyone begins to realize they have their own faults and foibles, and you begin to accept that other people are always going through things too. And, conversely, you begin to realize you’re never the star of anyone else’s internal story. People are paying far less attention to your awkwardness than you think. So…roll with it, find some hobbies you like that involve other people, and just keep practicing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwing myself out there, getting rejected and snubbed otherwise slapped around a lot .. until I slowly started to figure out how to observe &#34;normal, healthy&#34; people and learn from them.Among the things we learn is -- that we are much more &#34;plastic&#34; (and able to change by sheer force of will) than we initially thought.  Things like hygiene, posture, clarity of speech (such that people can at least understand us) and tonal confidence are, for many of us, simply matters of bad habit that can be unlearned and their negative effects reversed, over time.The more we improve ourselves in these basic areas, the better we feel about ourselves... and soon enough people notice, and over time it becomes not only gets easier but starts to feel natural.  Not instantly but... over time.  Until the day comes when you stop thinking (so much) about how &#34;awkward&#34; you are, and instead you&#39;re thinking about your new life, your new friends, your hot new relationship, your awesome new day job (if that matters), etc.That and two other tips:  (1) Taking the plunge, and moving to a totally new geographic area (or even just getting a different, much better place in the city where you live) can do wonders; as does (2) Paradoxically, not giving an F about what other people think.  That is to say, acknowledging that it matters to some degree, on a certain level ... but in the scheme of things, it also just doesn&#39;t matter.   Which helps you relax and feel confident (which does a lot to ameliorate the negative perceptions people have of you)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unfortunately, this (really nice) PDF isn&#39;t complete.For me an Operating System means processes in userland, sadly it comes short of that.I&#39;m now pushing my own x86 32bit OS in Rust using [0][1]:There is definitely a shortage of information on this stuff (for example writing a USB driver is really hard and I couldn&#39;t find easily available tutorials - you have to resort to raw *HCI and USB specs to get things done).[0] https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page[1] https://os.phil-opp.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the PDF:
&#34;It is true: in our quest to make full use of the CPU, we must abandon all of those helpful routines provided by BIOS. As we will see when we look in more detail at the 32-bit protected mode switch-over, BIOS routines, having been coded to work only in 16-bit real mode, are no longer valid in 32-bit protected mode; indeed, attempting to use them would likely crash the machine.&#34;So what this means is that a 32-bit operating system must provide its own drivers for all hardware of the machine (e.g. the keybaord, screen, disk drives, mouse, etc). Actually, it is possible for a 32-bit protected mode operating system to switch temporarily back into 16-bit mode whereupon it may utilise BIOS, but this teachnique can be more trouble than it is worth, especially in terms of performance.&#34;--In the toy 32-bit OS I am currently writing, having easy disk access and text output was more important to me than performance, so I decided to implement this technique to access the disk and screen via the BIOS instead of writing an ATA disk driver.Although I could not find any minimal yet complete working examples of dropping to 16 bit and later resuming 32 bit mode, I was able to piece it together and write assembly functions called enter_16bit_real and resume_32bit_mode. See https://github.com/ironmeld/builder-hex0/blob/main/builder-h.... Those routines are working well but beware the project is a volatile work in progress and is coded in hex for bootstrapping reasons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a feeling that any piece of closed-source software that becomes important enough will inevitably be reverse engineered by highly motivated people. This is doubly so for Vanced: The original team took pains to not release the source, but it merely took a few weeks for someone else to reverse engineer the reverse engineered codebase.I&#39;ve worked on preserving a few games with decompilers long after the original creators have moved on. Anecdotally, the death of Flash all but killed off a couple of assorted communities that didn&#39;t have enough motivation to hack the binaries themselves.My guess is the only software that can perpetually maintain a community is software where the source code is available to be modified."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The NetBSD kernel still has support for a.out.  On BSD, a.out is something simpler than ELF that works without any problems.^1  On Linux, a.out may have caused problems when building shared libraries thus motivating the switch to ELF.^21. ELF is OK, but times have changed since ELF was created.  The same constraints no longer exist.  Personally, I prefer static binaries and can afford the space for them.   It is good to have options for people who prefer shared libraries as well as those who prefer static binaries.2. https://people.freebsd.org/~nik/advocacy/myths.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I &#39;m an heavy user of diagrams to take notes while learning topics in biology and medicine. I think the most interesting feature of diagrams.net is its extensibility, which is not frequently mentioned. If you run in the javascript console...    var editorUi;
    Draw.loadPlugin(app =&gt; editorUi = app)
    var editor = editorUi.editor
    var graph = editor.graph

... then you can automate changes to the diagram using mxGraph&#39;s api [1] on the `graph&#39; variable from the console.Around this plugin mechanism I wrote some dirty hacks for personal use to make the editor behave more to my likings [2] (some features stopped working with recent versions of the desktop app), and an even dirtier Emacs mode for editing labels and having the js REPL available directly from Emacs when I need to run some code to fix my diagrams programmatically [3] (based on Indium [4] + the fact that electron apps can be launched with --remote-debugging-port=...). It&#39;s not pretty, but works enough for me, and it&#39;s only thanks to the customizability that diagrams.net allows.[1] https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/js-api/files/view/mxGr...[2] https://gitlab.com/spellcard199/drawio-plugin-eight-droves-o...[3] https://gitlab.com/spellcard199/emacs-drawio[4] https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Indium"</p>

Not bad but not a new thing either. Starting from 1991 when he joined Softdisk it took him a few months to figure out smooth horizontal scrolling, and in just a bit more than one year, around late 1992 he managed to go from it to a mature ray casting engine, and you can see his evolution from hovertank to wolfenstein. And it took him another year to go from Wolfenstein to shadow caster to Doom. Quake took longer but it was still impressive considering he has to got it before anyone else solved it.I mean this guy learns really fast. It&#39;s not only the rendering engine remind you, he had to do a lot of other parts of the engine too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the past few months we’ve been trying hard to make Appwrite as simple to setup and use as possible. Your candid feedback has been crucial in shaping the project and it would be great if you can share some features you’d like to see in the project going forward.What is Appwrite ? 
In simplest terms, Appwrite is an open source Backend As A Service (aka BaaS). Appwrite is an all in one solution with all the essentials you need like Authentication, User Management, Realtime Databases, Webhooks, Storage, Cloud Functions, SDKs for your favourite language and it’s light weight. Appwrite even runs on a Raspberry Pi. Most importantly, Appwrite is self-hosted which means you own your data and prevent any vendor lock-ins.Talking about Appwrite’s features
- Realtime Databases and events ( Recent benchmarks have showed a single server handling 1M+ concurrent connections )- SDKs for iOS, Android, Flutter, Web ( React, Angular, Vue, Svelte etc.) Python, PHP, Node, Deno, Kotlin and more- Bring your own Database - Use your choice of SQL or MySQL databases ( MariaDB, MySQL, MongoDB and more )- Database permissions for finer tuned access control- Storage API with built in encryption, compression and antivirus- Bring your own Storage - Use your choice of the local filesystem, DigitalOcean Spaces, S3 or an any other storage provider of your choice- Cloud functions with support for over 20 runtimes- Webhooks to connect with 3rd party APIs and services- User Management and Authentication- Multiple authentication methods - email, 25+ OAuth providers, JWT, API Keys- Completely stateless and extensible architecture allowing easy integration with your existing backend- A Dashboard, CLI and VSCode extensions to manage your server and many more..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From my quick research when I was selecting the next backend I was going to use for a project in the past, and today reading some responses on this page:- Appwrite is written in PHP. Just because something is open source, doesn&#39;t mean it is extensible, scalable or otherwise written well. I haven&#39;t seen many popular projects written in PHP recently. The only time I used PHP was in university, where the PHP application was the target machine in a CTF.- AppWrite doesn&#39;t yet have their Cloud version, so they aren&#39;t ready to be a &#34;backend as a service&#34; - it&#39;s a product that isn&#39;t ready &#34;as a service&#34;. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t use it, and I can see similar sentiment here on HN. I&#39;d be willing to try it out when it&#39;s ready.- It&#39;s not built on Postgres. Their comment about Supabase using postgres did not include any real substance: &#34;I&#39;m trying to be as objective as I can, but building the entire ecosystem around a single product like Postgres ( even though tried and tested ) comes with its own downsides...&#34;. The downsides of what AppWrite might be that they&#39;re rolling their own database... in PHP? They may not be database experts, and there&#39;s lots to think about and fix when building a database, and Postgres has been tested for a long time.- Not much progress is happening on the GraphQL side: https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/974/files, whereas Supabase has it: https://supabase.com/blog/2021/12/03/pg-graphql.Overall, it seems like the project doesn&#39;t move as fast as its competitor (primarily Supabase) for features I care about, and perhaps this is caused by PHP?Anyway, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts about my comments, Eldad and team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before I even look into it, I&#39;ll tell you this: the headline was enough to grab my attention on its own. I strongly feel this is a badly underserved niche and I&#39;ve had major issues with Firebase&#39;s limitations. You definitely have a winning idea here in this user&#39;s opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was prepared to get my pitchfork out, but after reading I&#39;m struggling to connect the dots. This article is scant on details of what illegal or favorable behavior Microsoft is expecting in exchange for money. The only concrete mention is a previous SEC filing that has nothing to do with this whistleblower. The first example about $40k doesn&#39;t seem to explain what Microsoft was actually thinking it would get for that money, let alone whether that money was illegal. At worst, it seemed to violate corporate policy, which I can understand if that got missed in an initial review. The other examples don&#39;t sound like bribery on Microsoft&#39;s part so much as resellers squeezing as much out of a deal as they can get away with. I call that a problem with the reseller model.I imagine Microsoft looks the other way while resellers make lots of money because, realistically, being in some of the markets mentioned is impossible unless you&#39;re connected with the right person. While not necessarily efficient, I wouldn&#39;t call that illegal or even unethical without a lot more detail than this article provides.But maybe I&#39;m missing something. This article reads as poorly researched, and the whistleblower comes off as disgruntled more than ethical.Edit: It&#39;s worth noting that the whistleblower&#39;s original words are a little more well-written than this article [1]. However, it makes the contrast clearer between what is factual vs what is only insinuated.1: https://www.lioness.co/post/microsoft-is-using-illegal-bribe..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been common knowledge for me for a long time, after this case surfaced in the media here in Romania: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_licensing_corruption...Pretty much all of the public system uses windows as OS, and most of the times it&#39;s just to use a browser to access a webapp. But there are actual windows lock-ins (due to people training and existing workflow/infrastructure that has no incentive to change), such as MS Office and Adobe Reader.So there was no reason for Microsoft to bribe decision-making people to use windows, windows was already firmly locked in, they did it just so they can overprice licenses and for them to accept leased licenses instead of a permanent one time pay windows license. Big win for MS and bribe takers, big loss to common decency and public spending availability.A sign of a healthy democratic government can be seen in the decisions to build future public software infrastructure on open source technology, and use Linux as client/server OS (as it&#39;s pretty much the only other alternative offering similar ease of use/maintenance/compatibility with existing software).edit: wrote this to show it&#39;s not necessarily the cost of doing business, in most places, because the software ecosystem is already locked in and can&#39;t be replaced overnight and without considerable spending. It&#39;s just the cost of extracting more public money. And sometimes it&#39;s the cost to keep the business safe from decisions to steer towards Opensource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would speculate that this is mostly meant to be used for identifying bot rings and ATO (account takeover).  Brand new accounts on a site with open signups are, on average, quite a lot more suspicious than older accounts.  There&#39;s a significant demand for aged accounts to use for various banned activities (mostly spam first and vote manipulation second), and fingerprinting is likely a high value signal in combating it.  Two easy ways to generate aged accounts in bulk - create a whole lot of them and wait (and optionally do some activity on them to make them look real), or take over abandoned or compromised accounts.  Fingerprinting is very good at identifying clusters of the former, and at least helpful for the latter.EFF appears to have rebranded Panopticlick as &#34;Cover Your Tracks&#34;, but it&#39;s usually a fun thing to look at in discussions of this type as an example of what can go into a fingerprint and the informational value of various parts:https://coveryourtracks.eff.org"</p>

Without the internet, we got together as needed to merge code, usually once a month, but sometimes once a week. We talked on the phone. We went to Microsoft once in awhile. It was ideal and worked very well.Maybe it was just our personalities that made it work, but I am astonished that any programmer would rather go into the office. With high speed internet and video conferencing, I assume that some people are just very lonely and need face to face. I see nothing wrong with that.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The coding used by this survey is a joke.  If 40% of an occupation says they work outdoors that&#39;s below 50% so it&#39;s bucketed into the work from home category on that criterion.  I think if even 20% of a job is saying they work outdoors that&#39;s pretty strong evidence you&#39;re missing some information about what the other 80% are doing in their job that prevents it from being a work from home job.  The net result of their setup is obviously a vast overestimate so take the 37% number with a grain of salt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know some companies are trying to get their employees to go back to a hybrid schedule, but for me, I think the bell can&#39;t be unrung.  My company is a f500 company that I would not have thought would remain remote, but we have, and it really helps us hire and retain talent.  It honestly helps us recruit people that would otherwise have sought out trendier employers."</p>

A sandwich is any food that uses a carbohydrate to protect your hands from a messier food, so that you can eat it at a card table without getting your hands dirty (a la the origin myth). Let&#39;s go through the things here:Pizza: YesSushi: Mostly no (the carbs don&#39;t protect you from the insides, the seaweed does)Pumpkin pie: No (unless eaten with hands, without falling apart)Quesadilla: YesToast sandwich: No (inside is not messier)Victoria sponge: No (eaten with fork)Hot dog: YesSub sandwich: YesSlice of pie: No (unless eaten with hands)Falafel wrap: YesPigs in a blanket: YesEnchilada: No (the one pictured has cheese and sauce on the outside)Quiche: No (unless eaten with hands)Cheesecake: No (unless eaten with hands)Soup bowl: No (I&#39;d love to see you try)Falafel pita: YesDeep dish pizza: If eaten with handsSalad in a bread bowl: NoKey lime pie: No (unless eaten with hands)Calzone: YesCorn dog: No (if held with stick)Pie (whole): No (good luck)Dumplings: Yes (unless they have sauce on them)Pop tarts: YesUncrustables: YesThis is the best and most accurate method that actually provides a strict definition that lines up with my intuitions—the cube rule is fun, but you&#39;re really gonna claim that a subway sandwich isn&#39;t a sandwich?"</p>

It&#39;s not like I can draw a pikachu, release it to public domain and make a slam dunk legal claim that all other pikachus are henceforth kosher.I think Adam Neely makes a more relevant point in his videos about Dark Horse and Levitating: it doesn&#39;t really matter what any actual infringement claim is because you can typically find relevant prior art from legitimate works of music if you dig deep enough, even without going through the exercise of autogenerating note sequences.As I understand, the legal arguments focus on whether there is a clear and traceable connection between the creative process for a song and the alleged infringed work, and whether there is clear intent to omit credit where it is due. I.e. the argument already starts from the assumption that similarities and inspirations from existing works of art can and do exist."</p>

It has the entertainment value needed to capture the interest of young viewers who may not be otherwise interested in engineering disciplines. There are many, many other channels out there (backyard scientist, action lab, Cody’s lab, stuff made here, etc.) who are very successful on YouTube, but they tend to cater to viewers who are deliberately choosing to watch their videos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Steve Yegge tells the story[1] of his dad cooking:&gt; When I was a teenager, my dad and my brother Mike decided to make homemade chili. I&#39;d never seen it made before, and I watched with keen interest as they added beef, beans, some veggies and spices, and other ingredients. Dad would taste it, add some more ingredients, wait a bit, taste it again. My dad has some pretty good recipes. So you can imagine my puzzlement when he opened the cupboard, pulled out 2 cans of Hormel chili, opened them and dumped them in. I waited a respectful moment or two before asking him why he was adding canned chili to his chili.Similarly, I think it detracts a bit from building a home-made x-ray machine if one of the ingredients is an x-ray tube from an old x-ray machine.[1] http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/10/egomania-itself.html"</p>

Under their &#34;prevention&#34; section they say manufacturers should use rolling codes. This implies these FOBs don&#39;t use them, but per my previous understanding, they do.Perhaps there is more to the setup of this CVE than they&#39;re talking about. Is it possible they&#39;re doing a rolljam attack + replay?The CVE is really scant on details, so while I believe they did manage to get this to work, they don&#39;t really say how.If rolling codes are implemented, it should be pretty simple with the right gear to prove it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, I&#39;m annoyed by the benign protestware messages when they start to get in the way of using the software, particularly on mobile. I was looking at the isomorphic git documentation the other day, and noticed that their &#34;#BlackLivesMatter #DefundThePolice&#34; banner scrolls under the rest of the content, leaving this annoying gap that takes up screen real estate, especially in landscape mode on a phone.[0] What&#39;s the point? Is a single person going to be persuaded to support either cause by seeing this banner on a relatively niche JS library that reduces readability of its documentation? Will anyone find the library any more useful because they support the cause? (I support neither cause, but find the library useful nevertheless.)Recently, I saw a similar pattern with the Svelte REPL adding a pro-Ukraine message.[1] The banner along the bottom is so large that landscape mode becomes unusable, and non-trivial examples are hard to see even in portrait mode. Again, who does this help? (I support Ukraine, so feel like, &#34;yeah, I get it; can I close the banner now?&#34;)The worst part about these patterns is that they can&#39;t be disabled and seem to be deployed haphazardly without regard for the overall design.While these aren&#39;t malware, they are still hostile for the majority of users who aren&#39;t so gung ho in their support for the current thing.[0] https://isomorphic-git.org/docs/en/deleteBranch[1] https://svelte.dev/repl/hello-world?version=3.46.4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just don&#39;t understand what the node-ipc dev was expecting when he did that.&#34;Hm, maybe if I put malware into a community-trusted module that destroys files of people in a certain geopolitical region, the countless innocent citizens that are affected will realize what they did wrong! Wait, who am I actually targeting again?&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It harms all of technology and by extension anyone who participates in the modern world.  Just like any malware or other antisocial behaviour.It&#39;s a bit too indiscriminate to be a good protest, unless the thing you want to tear down IS the whole modern development process, which is based on the idea that most people are somewhat trustworthy and you can get the risk down to an acceptable level through the usual means.It doesn&#39;t quite work if malware is not only a threat, but a semi-mainstream thing sometimes made by people you would think you could trust.   The normal social process of trust breaks down if malware is included in the scope of normal things people sometimes do, as opposed to purely being something by the more criminal types.I almost wonder if these people don&#39;t actively want to tear down tech itself, or not care, given how many coders dislike the fact that society is tech dependant."</p>

I’ve also been thinking what I would want “heaven” to be. Eternal life doesn’t appeal to me much. Imagine living a quadrillion years. Even as a god, that would be miserable. That would be (by my rough estimate) the equivalent of 500 times the cumulative lifespans of all humans who have ever lived.What I would really like is to see my parents and my beloved dog again, decades after they have past (along with any living ones at that time). Being able to see them and speak to them one last time at the end of my life before fading into eternal darkness would be how I would want to go.Anyway, there’s a free startup idea for anyone—recreate loved ones in VR so people can see them again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The other day I wanted to learn Svelte. Even though the tutorials on the Svelte homepage are great, I found the MDN Svelte tutorial to be better: it explains the conceptual differences wrt other frontend frameworks well, it explains in detail how to enable Typescript and migrate your projects, and it has a dedicated section that describes different deployment options.While of - of course - all of these infos can be found somewhere on the web as well, I very much appreciate such a well-written, holistic intro to a framework. I signed up for the MDN Plus 5 plan.P.S.: If someone from the MDN team is reading this, maybe include a &#34;sign up&#34; link directly in the blog article from Hermina."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems fair enough. It won&#39;t prevent anyone from accessing the actual content and it probably makes it easy to justify paying something to MDN to employers.In practice, if you are not paying:- Bookmarks can most certainly easily replace the Collections feature- you can clone the MDN repository for having the documents offline- notifications could be computed from the commit logand the subscription probably makes these features more convenient, at least for the notifications and the offline without actually removing rights from anybody.Seems clever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wait, so you mean to say I can pay $50 a year for high quality documentation that is eminently useful in my day to day work, and I get things like notifications when said content changes? And on top of that, I’ll be supporting free access to said content to those who might need it he most, like kids learning to program or rookies just starting their careers? AND it’s tax deductible? Pfft, shut up and take my moneys please!I have no need for any of the stuff in the supporter plan but even at $100 a year this is a total bargain. I know I don’t have to pay for it, but with the amount of value I’ve gotten out of MDN over the years it’s a steAl. I’ll buy this as soon as am back at my laptop. I have no analytics to support it, but I swear !mdn is my most used DuckDuckGo shortcut. I’m signing up as soon as I’m back at my laptop."</p>

Either the designer&#39;s opinion or the wish to copy the look of something.Whenever I see a hamburger menu I silently think &#34;Here someone has given up&#34;.And there are a lot of behaviors that are not functioning well.Is something a button?

It has not worked properly for decades and today only work in some super old apps like Notepad.Another thing is type-ahead. I remember in classic MacOS, people pressed shortcuts and started to type the filename or whatever. It was all perfectly recorded and replayed. In modern Windows, press Win-key and start to type, oops, it missed the first keypresses, presented the completely wrong results and made a mess of your workflow.I feel confused and disrespected as a user every day and I&#39;ve been using WIMP graphical user interfaces since 1986. Sure, computers do more today, but there&#39;s less consideration of almost everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree 100% with the author, the old GTK button was gorgeous, it will be missed.&gt; I have had to explain to people tons of times that the random word in the UI somewhere in an application is actually a button they can press to invoke an action.This is one of my biggest complaints with the super flat modern designs. Many widgets lost their skeuomorphic depth, which encoded a lot if visual information (the clickability, the current status), but in many cases nothing was added to supplant the loss of those visual cues, so now it is just a label (or a label in a white or grey box) and there is no way of knowing if it is clickable or its current status."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like KDE and Plasma is the place where look and feel is constantly but incrementally refined; we&#39;ve been saved from this flat design trend so far and things keep looking pleasant and modern and being usable. We know they care, and have great attention to details because that&#39;s documented weekly [1].I find the Breeze theme really well done and its GTK port, Brise, is also very nice, to the point Gnome looks good in it.There was just the KDE 4 era where I didn&#39;t like Oxygen at all (and indeed I used to change the theme to Fusion there) but that&#39;s over. KDE 3 was fine and KDE 5 is great. At this point, most things that are not Breeze don&#39;t look great to me now.As for the customization and theme support, that&#39;s supported and it works well, they prove that it&#39;s nothing insurmountable too. KDE comes with themes that look like Windows 95, Motif, Adwaita, GTK 2 and other things and you can download more if you want.I&#39;d be curious to have a review of Breeze / KDE by Martijn.[1] https://pointieststick.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rant engaged. As a person who feels responsible for ensuring what I build is secure, the security space feels inscrutably defeating. Is there a dummies guide, MOOC, cert, or other instructional material to better get a handle on all these things?SSH keys make sense. But certificates? Is this OIDC, SAML, what? Is it unreasonable to request better and deeper &#34;how to do {new security thing}&#34; when PKI is a new acronym to someone? Where can I point my data science managers so they can understand the need and how to implement measures to have security on PII-laden dashboards? As so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that trying to make SSH keys short-lived is becoming more painful each year because there&#39;s an increase of tools that use SSH keys for purposes other than SSH logins. For example, age [1] encrypts files with SSH keys, agenix [2] does secrets management with it, Git can now sign commits with it [3], and even ssh-keygen can now sign arbitrary data [4]. All of these become useless the moment you start using short-lived keys.[1]: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age[2]: https://github.com/ryantm/agenix[3]: https://calebhearth.com/sign-git-with-ssh[4]: https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article was very illuminating. And, I wish it was written like this:  To really secure your SSH server, do these three things:
  1. Setup a trusted authority
  2. Use ssh certificates
  3. With ssh certs, you can easily add MFA for logins expire until you reauth.
  Now that we&#39;ve established this, here are the gory details.
  Lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum.


It&#39;s a great narrative, but I wish I knew the big payout in advance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think its important to recognise that quite a lot of modern web based companies are running their business on the 0 cents model. That is they take the marginal cost of a customer and push it down to zero and rely on scale to make a profit from it. They can&#39;t add anything to their business that would scale with the number of their customers that has any real cost, computing resources even are heavily optimised for let alone having an actual human to speak to.What this means is that as a 0 cents customer (even if you pay them) you are completely disposable, no customer matters to them at all. This culture comes along with a cold disdain for customers and a desire to run everything off algorithms and if some people get caught up in error they just don&#39;t care. As a customer its annoying and you can loose a lot of data, but for the companies its their business model. The only way as a customer to not be in that situation is to avoid the businesses based on this model. If they were somehow forced to provide human customer support they may very well be substantially less profitable or not viable as a business anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had the experience of trying to do a banking operation that required an in-person visit.  For some reason this bank required me to do this operation at the branch that I originally opened the account, which is not where I live anymore, and it&#39;s very inconvenient for me to go there.So, while I was in another city of that country, I decided to try and handle that problem.  I went to a branch and asked them to do the operation, saying that there must be a way to do it without me having to travel hundreds of km.  The person absolutely refused to even try to help me.  &#34;No, there&#39;s no way to do it, you&#39;ll have to go to your branch office.&#34;  I begged, I got angry.  (This was after leaving this issue for a couple of years -- travel has not exactly been easy, so there are reasons I didn&#39;t manage to do it yet, and was getting desperate.)  All to no avail, the person just. could. not. help me.Fine, I left, very annoyed.  The next day, I went to a different branch, told the same story, and explained how extremely inconvenient the whole thing is.  I went in expecting failure.  To my surprise, the person responded kindly, said &#34;okay, I can send an inter-branch memo, I&#39;ll do the operation you pay this much, done and done.&#34;  I signed something, walked out smiling, and the next business day, received a confirmation email from my branch in the other city.Moral of the story: I completely agree with the premise here, but just keep in mind that even if you talk to a human, your millage may vary greatly depending on who you speak to and what side of the bed they got up on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that companies have a responsibility to listen to and address customer complaints. The problem is that a small percentage of customers create the bulk of the customer support burden. With phone support this gets even more skewed. You can&#39;t have engineers do phone support or they won&#39;t be able to get any real work done with all the interruptions. You can have engineers investigate and address all complaints that arrive by email. I strongly believe email support that goes directly to the people most knowledgable to fix the underlying problem is the best approach.Companies that provide bad customer support just don&#39;t care. They&#39;ll provide phone support if they feel they have to, but they&#39;ll outsource it for cost reasons. Talking to people who are friendly but clueless is at least as frustrating for me as creating a ticket that doesn&#39;t go anywhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This does indeed seem to work for me, but the repeated emphasis on the patents and trademarks makes me suspicious. It looks like a company who cares much more about patent royalties than about their invention - whom I would never be willing to give my money to. Having seen the principle, I could write a browser extension in an hour. I suppose I&#39;ll have to wait 25 years (or whatever the French patent expiry length is), though.If you want to read the patent (in French), it&#39;s here: https://data.inpi.fr/brevets/FR3052587. I couldn&#39;t find the German patent (10 2017 112 916.2), but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the same substance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have some feedback regarding the testimonial from “Sangeeth”, whose Memoji shows a Sikh person. Did the user choose their Memoji? The two don’t go together well for reasons of odd cultural differences in the Roman/Latin transliteration of sounds in the south and the north of India. The -th- cluster represents the dental t, IPA /t/, but only in South India. In the North the same sound is represented by -t-. Therefore you might find a Sikh named Sangeet, or a non-Sikh named Sangeeth, but a Sikh named Sangeeth? I’ve never seen a Sikh name using the -th- cluster in my life. There are Sikhs who grow up in South India of course but their names use the North Indian transliteration rules.What I’m trying to say is: if you chose the Memoji with a turban to show an Indian person, it doesn’t match the -th in the name. As an Indian my first reaction was that the testimonial was fake, for this reason."</p>

So any speed gains from the reading methodology were lost during the understanding phase"</p>

But it couldn&#39;t even count to &#34;4 U&#34;. Instead, it printed &#34;./count.sh[3]: syntax error: `(&#39; unexpected&#34; and just stopped Dead. I tried again, thinking It&#39;s Gonna Go Away. Nope, No Way. Am I Going Crazy? Somebody Somewhere has to know what&#39;s going wrong. Before long, I realized I had to Wake Up and face the truth that KornShell is very particular about whitespace.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to go to Wikipedia to see if ksh was named after the band,¹ but it turns out that it was created by David Korn and not a metal fan.⸻1. Not completely inconceivably given that Python gets its name from Monty Python. I&#39;m thinking there are other similarly fandom-based namings of popular tech tools (the only other one that comes to mind is the occasional assertion that Knuth&#39;s choice of TeX was to honor his alma mater CalTech²).2. I created a short-lived California TeX Users Group in the late 80s/early 90s which we dubbed CTUG after being warned off naming it CalTeX (but being at Harvey Mudd College³ at the time, I was disinclined to name it that anyway).3. Which, of course, summons to mind one of my favorite pranks⁴ in the HMC-CalTech rivalry in which the freeway sign identifying the exit for CalTech and Pasadena Community College had parentheses added so it read “CalTech (Pasadena Community College)”4. Most people would consider the Fleming cannon theft to be the pinnacle of the pranks (when I had my pre-frosh campus visit, the cannon had just arrived on the Mudd campus), but I think the freeway sign gets points for being more creative."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Years ago I was putting out the garbage in the back alley behind our building where I lived on the 8th floor. A crow attacked me out of the blue.  Distracted by the attack, the back door slammed shut behind me.  Since my key was only good for the front door, I had to walk around the building.  That damn crow followed me the entire time, dive bombing my head, and screaming bloody murder at me.  It was a little spooky.When I finally got back inside and upstairs, I went and looked out the living room window, which looked out the same direction as the back alley.  The crow had flown back around and was at the 8th floor looking in the window, from the other side of the pigeon netting we had on our balcony.   On the inside of the pigeon netting, was another crow, desperately trying to figure out how it could escape.  Not really sure how it had got itself through the pigeon netting in the first place.I went out and sliced a hole through the netting and the trapped crow quickly joined its mate outside, who finally stopped screaming bloody murder.   To this day it still amazes me that the crow&#39;s mate, knew which apartment I lived in and spotted me downstairs."</p>

As far as I know, he&#39;s not contributing to the Emacs internals and instead providing packages, he has given most of his code to be part of GNU. I came across his work on modus-themes and understood from his documentation that he&#39;s done a lot of research in making it compliant to accessibility standards of WCAG AAA.

All without acting like a typical youtuber. He doesn&#39;t ask for likes or subscribes, doesn&#39;t have ads, doesn&#39;t have chat, he isn&#39;t a slave to patronage, and best of all he doesn&#39;t use that hyping style that many youtubers use today.I wish more technical youtubers would go back to presenting like Prot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People use centralized systems because they actually like the convenience that comes with it. And with that, comes the decentralized system changing in such a way that it changes to almost NEEDING centralization. The problem is that engineers and cybersecurity people all think that everyone else thinks like they do, when in actuality the complete opposite is true.The biggest example is the internet itself - the internet is a completely decentralized network until it wasn&#39;t, with website certs becoming required. People use popular web hosting because it&#39;s easier and just better than what they could do. Email is completely decentralized, and it&#39;s very easy to set up your own web server - as long as you want every single spam system to immediately block all of your messages.&#34;Decentralized&#34; systems will all go the exact same way. And it&#39;s because people don&#39;t want to spend time setting up their own shit, they are very happy to pay in either money or data to have someone else do it for them. Yeah, it&#39;s very easy to say &#34;well just set up your own thing&#34; but once you get to a critical mass of everyone using Gmail instead of their own server then the system becomes unusable without centralization.Decentralization is a fantastic idea, and it works great in theory, but it fails to actually consider any of the practical problems that come with decentralization and doesn&#39;t consider what people who aren&#39;t programmers actually want to do with their time and money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A lot of Web3 platforms are in fact centralized. Your wallet (MetaMask), marketplaces (OpenSea), APIs (Alchemy) are all central platforms. Sure, they use a distributed database (blockchain), but before that it’s still a Go app on AWS, meaning its centralized.&gt; Your wallet (MetaMask)Run your own node. This is lazy reporting to reach the end point about fawning over FreeBSD (its in the article, literally an article about having fun staying poor), when you can just as easily inspire and teach people how to use custom RPCs. There is an opportunity to inspire people with the tools to know what to look for, even if it&#39;s absurd to suggest people actually compile and run a node themselves. Tell them why the default behavior is a convenience and if they are interested in the decentralized parts then here is what to do.&gt; marketplaces (OpenSea)Yep. It is a GUI ontop of their smart contracts (public access backend code). You don&#39;t have to use their GUI. You should inspect their smart contracts for centralized control, or at least look to see if anyone else has. There is an opportunity to inspire people with the tools to know what to look for, even if its absurd to suggest people actually do all the analysis themselves.&gt; APIs (Alchemy) are all central platformsa fine example. don&#39;t use Alchemy or Infura as your RPC endpoints? Why not just make blog posts about that?This kind of energy could just as easily be steered into &#34;how to improve the concept of Web3&#34; which lots of people are actually doing. It could just as easily be &#34;This isn&#39;t decentralized! Let me fix that!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some platforms like Ethereum are completely decentralized. You forfeit some of this decentralization bit by bit when using MetaMask, OpenSea or Alchemy, but the platform itself is still decentralized. The Web is completely decentralized, by you forfeit some of this decentralization bit by bit when using Paypal, Facebook, or AWS. The trend in technology has always been to trade control for convenience. This doesn&#39;t stop you from writing your own browser and pushing packets out of your own HTTP server.The (now infamous) Andre Cronje had a whimsical tweet reminiscing on his days as a lawyer: &#34;The contracts aren&#39;t for when everything is going right. They&#39;re for when everything is going wrong.&#34; Some network wide catastrophe is seemingly inevitable for any sufficiently large system. When these occur it will be the decentralized blockchains like Ethereum with failsafes in place to survive, and it&#39;s the centralized blockchains like Binance that will implode."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Self-hosting is something that we should be constantly iterating on making easier; it&#39;s really the path forward for privacy centric folks. The main challenges are managing workload scheduling (SystemD is complicated for a layperson). Networking is another challenge; for instance, if you wanted all or part of these services to remain offline or on a Mesh VPN there&#39;s a lot of knowledge required.There&#39;s some projects trying to tackle the workload orchestration piece; CasaOS (https://www.casaos.io/) being one of my favorites but there&#39;s also Portainer (https://portainer.io). TailScale and and ZeroTier are great for Mesh VPN networking, where you may need to run some workloads in the cloud but want them networked with your home applications (or just to keep them offline). They also allow you to access applications running on a home server that doesn&#39;t have a static IP. Cloudflare Access is okay; I haven&#39;t tried it because it deviates from the mesh VPN model significantly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I&#39;m building Timelinize [1]. It&#39;s a follow-up to my open source Timeliner project [2], which has the potential to download all your digital life onto your own computer locally, and projects it all onto a single timeline, across all data sources (text messages, social media sites, photos, location history, and more).It&#39;s a little different from &#34;self hosting&#34; but it does have a similar effect of bringing all your data home and putting it in your control. We have to start somewhere, might as well start with bringing in all the data we&#39;ve put out there. (It&#39;s not a replacement for self-hosted media servers, for example.)The backend and underlying processing engine is all functional and working very well; now I&#39;m just getting the UI put together, so I hope to have something to share later this year.[1]: https://twitter.com/timelinize (website coming eventually)[2]: https://github.com/mholt/timeliner"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Self hosting is hard. You need to take care of security, backups, software updates, software installation and so on.Even on something like a QNAP (which can be compared to managed hosting) this can be hard. Flip the wrong switch and you expose something to the world. Missed a security update: your device is now vulnerable.While I host a lot of things myself I can understand self hosting is not for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, it is amazing that the author managed to analyze the patch in so much details, it probably is an effort comparable to the bug fix itself. Still I think the article is missing some bits. I would expect any core migration to require barriers (either implicit or explicit) on both the old and new core otherwise the process would risk seeing its own stores and loads out of order.But in this case the barrier is predicated on the execution of some cache manipulation instruction, so I suspect things are more complicated. Maybe these specific cache manipulation instructions do not respect the usual architectural memory ordering and require some different set of barriers. Possibly they bypass cache coherence completely and require an actual flush of the cache. That is going to be very expensive and it make sense that it is only done only if the process was actually fiddling with these instructions. &#39;jmgao&#39; else thread reported that tegra has coherency issues on migration, so it might be related."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Makes you think, do Linux, Windows and Mac handle this properly? Honestly, I doubt it!Context switches, idle state transitions, etc tend to be fairly delicately handled as a common cause of CVEs and Heisenbugs.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still plenty of bugs but more attention ends up being paid to these things on general purpose operating systems.  More eyeballs on the code, more security researchers, more hardware variants to expose things that were thought to be fine.  Also fuzzing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And how do you even find / debug a bug like this?As someone who has worked on cache code, I suspect it&#39;s quite possible they were just reviewing this code again and realised the potential hole. Or they were trying to track down some horrific bug and fixed this along the way (whether or not it caused it), reviewing anything to do with caching is probably worth doing because it&#39;s notoriously difficult to get right, especially with context switching involved.Another possibility is that the bug is more deterministic than it looks, under the right conditions, and they managed to replicate it and analyse it in a debugger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Life finds a way. My wife had generalized tonic-clonic seizure for an entire year (non previous seizure history) without any cause being detected by multiple MRIs. She was taking increasing doses of Levetiracetam that somehow controlled the scope of the seizures but not avoid them completely. After a year of this, we go for another ER visit after the latest one and she ask, somehow randomly, to have a pregnancy test, it comes negative but, finally, the root cause of the seizure does appear on imagery, at that point a low grade astrocytoma. She went into major brain surgery to try to remove it and pathology confirms the low grade astrocytoma, and after a month of recovery, the oncologist recommends to start a chemo and radio therapy treatment.As the low grade astrocytoma is treatable and with high long term survival rate, he recommends that we might extracts some ovules if we decide to have another kid in the future, as the chemo had a high chance of infertility. We had one son, and being both on our middle to late 30s, we agreed.We go to her OG for this, and as he is performing an preliminary echography... a heart beat start blasting on the speakers, over two months of his negative blood pregnancy test, after major brain surgery, after major doses of meds of all kinds, she was, indeed, pregnant. We knew exactly when she got pregnant, it was 5 days before that ER visit. She &#34;knew&#34; it that day in the ER, that&#39;s why she asked for the pregnancy test (that, once again, came negative).She decided to have the baby, no matter what the risk for her it was, no matter what risk for the baby it was. Chemo was out the question and radio treatment was a high risk and had to wait for at least another month. 6 months later we had a healthy baby, who is now a healthy 10 year old girl.Sadly, some months after given birth to her, my wife had a relapse, the brain tumor came back, this time as GBM, a month after the girl second birthday, she passed away.Life found a way, tho, and my wife never had any remorse of the decisions we made and she would be proud of what her sons are coming to be"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several years ago my wife and I agreed we&#39;d actively start making a baby and quit contraceptives. She was on the pill (progestogen-only) and we&#39;d been using it for the better part of three years. Worked fine, she took it religiously at the same time every day.So we agreed to quit, and the next day she comes to me, awkwardly, saying &#34;It worked!&#34; half-jokingly. I stared at the pregnancy test, positive and unambiguous as ever. At the second test, too.Turns out she&#39;d been already pregnant for almost a month. That kind of contraceptive is only 99% effective. Our daughter was born eight months later.Safe to say, the missing percentage is warranted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wife and I had an unlikely pregnancy ourselves.  We tried for possibly 8 years with no luck, finally we gave in and started the process to do in vitro with entailed lots of tests and everything.  Then, the day before we were scheduled to start the process (during xmas no less) and lay down a lot of $$$ for the procedure, wife takes a pregnancy test and shockingly, it indicates positive.  Kid was born healthy and happy.  I hesitate to call him some kind of xmas miracle kid, but I mean.. the context and everything really drove the point home.  :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve spent a long time with folding bikes over the years. My advice: bite the bullet and buy a Brompton[1].Yes, Bromptons are expensive.  But they ride like a bicycle, have gears, a stiff enough frame, luggage racks etc.  There&#39;s very little compromise.  The fastest I&#39;ve done on mine is 45 kph and I&#39;ve ridden 70km in a day. I carry it on and off buses and trains multiple times a day without issue.In the past I had an A-bike[2].  It&#39;s a fun and cute little design but the wheels are absolutely tiny and has no gears.  You feel like you&#39;re riding a folding contraption rather than a bicycle. The build quality was rather plasticky too.  I like the idea of an A-shape with telescoping tubes. It&#39;s quite an ingenious fold.I&#39;ve also ridden (but not owned) a Pacific CarryMe[3].  The ride experience again suffers for the short wheels and no gears, but it could be useful for some.  The fold still leaves you with quite a long package.I&#39;d love to try the Kwiggle bike.  I don&#39;t think the strange seat will cause as many problems as people think, but I suspect the overall ride experience to be a bit bouncy and flexy. Maybe it&#39;s worth it for the small fold.For a more out-there design I think the Halbrad/Half-Bike[4] could be quite nice but it never really got past the prototype stage.  Under-seat steering is a bit of an adjustment too.[1] https://www.brompton.com/[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-bike[3] https://pacificcarryme.com/[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIC138vmlE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for having us here to discuss Kwiggle. I am the inventor and owner of Kwiggle and would like to give you some insights:We have been developing Kwiggle for 10 years and producing Kwiggle for almost 3 years.Every detail has been carefully designed to create a 10kg lightweight folding bike that can even be folded into hand luggage and still go as fast as a normal bike. We have selected materials and manufacturing processes for the drive unit and rims with the highest wear resistance in the bicycle market. We use high-strength aluminum and stainless steel parts for the frame and have extensively tested the stability of the frame and drive unit dynamically and statically.Our 35 suppliers for material, components and parts manufacture according to our requirements with highest precision, because precision is another important factor for stable and durable components of a folding bike.In the meantime, our greatest motivation is the many enthusiastic feedbacks from our many customers, who at the moment still come mainly from Germany. We are already shipping the Kwiggle all over the world and Kwiggle already is ridden on every continent.So we are happy if you take a close look. Please assume that we have already thought about almost every little critical detail that is discussed.So if you are looking for a very compact folding bike, feel free to take a close look.The movement on the Kwiggle is new, but very close to your natural walk. And when even a 85-year-old man writes to us, &#34;I can only do two things: ride a rollator and ride a Kwiggle, but I enjoy the Kwiggle more.&#34; Then you can assume that you can ride the Kwiggle very well, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks absolutely amazing, but calling it &#34;affordable&#34; at €1600+ is a stretch. You can find non-electric folding bikes for under €200 that are quite sturdy and dependable (although not that small when folded).A few months ago I bought a used folding bike for €100, equipped it with a motor and battery that cost less than €400, for use on train trips.Nothing feels better than getting out of a long-distance train trip, unfolding your bike and going about your way in a different city... No taxis, no complex public transport map to understand, nothing but freedom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The comments on this thread seem to be quite wildly missing White&#39;s point. Many of the arguments taking place here seem premised on the idea that Ken White has attempted to solve, once and for all, the &#34;cancel culture&#34; problem --- or somehow write a dispositive argument that &#34;cancel culture&#34; isn&#39;t real.He&#39;s not doing any of these things. He&#39;s responding to a specific NYT staff editorial.White agrees with many of you that disproportionate responses to speech happen, are harmful, and are occurring regularly. He cites several instances, from both sides of the American political spectrum. You don&#39;t have to come up with an elaborate argument about how White is wrong about how harmful &#34;cancel culture&#34; is; White almost certainly agrees with you (at least in a general sense; maybe not in your particulars).His point is that you have to discuss something more particular than &#34;the right to speak your mind without fear of shame or shunning&#34;. You&#39;ve never had that right. You can&#39;t have it. To be free of shame or shunning is to be free of other people&#39;s speech. If you&#39;re saying something provocative, you are almost certainly responding in a sense to something someone else said; if you think you have the right to speak without shame or shunning, so does the person you&#39;re effectively responding to. At best, you&#39;re arguing for what White has in the past mockingly referred to as a &#34;replevin of feels&#34;; at worst, what you&#39;re asking for is totally incoherent.This Substack post would be bigger news if Ken White had, Solomonically, worked out the whole problem of disproportionate responses to speech. He has not, and I think he&#39;s probably much too smart to try. He&#39;s just critiquing someone else&#39;s bad argument. That&#39;s all you really have to engage with here; you don&#39;t have to let cortisol trick you into believing this is an amassing of the forces of &#34;cancel culture isn&#39;t real&#34; that you must mobilize against."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;Our failure to have a serious discussion about defining “cancel culture” encourages this. When some people vaguely complain about “cancel culture” in a way that lends itself to promoting this constant partisanship, other people not unreasonably see it as partisan.&#34;Popehat seems to be falling into the trap of thinking the precisely defining something will lead to clarity. It rarely, if ever, does. Each one of us has our own conception of a term - wordfeel, if you will - and virtually no one actually knows or holds to the literal dictionary definition. We hear words and apply them if they seem right to us. Even if you managed to precisely define cancel culture, people would easily try to claim that some alleged cancelling event it is actually something else, &#34;accountability&#34;, &#34;showing you the door&#34;, etc.. Never underestimate someone&#39;s ability to lawyerly redefine what something is or isn&#39;t.Additionally, I think Popehat is dead wrong here:&gt;&#34;Saying we should “end cancel culture” means we’re saying some people should refrain from some exercises of speech and association to promote other people feeling more free to speak.&#34;No rights are actually being infringed by this. It is possible to have cultural mores that are in the spirit of free speech. The opposite stance, not calling on people to end cancel culture, is also accepting a reduction in speech. Even so, by Popehat&#39;s own worldview, because the government is not restricting cancel culture this shouldn&#39;t be seen as some infringement of liberty.  I don&#39;t know what Popehat actually wants here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the debate on &#34;cancel culture&#34; is a lack of specificity. The fact is that there are certain occasions where &#34;canceling&#34; seems fine, and others, where it does not. And I think a problem with the progressive argument is the refusal to acknowledge that there can ever be any excesses.For example, there is the case of Dorian Abbot, who was disinvited from an MIT lecture after he wrote an op-ed criticizing affirmative action [1], even though the MIT lecture had nothing to do with affirmative action. I just don&#39;t see how allowing him to speak about climate science significantly impinges on the free speech of the members of the MIT community who found his views objectionable. I think it&#39;s also significant that 73% of the US population agrees with Abbot (I support affirmative action for the record). Basically the message that I get from MIT&#39;s behavior is that if you have a thoroughly mainstream opinion, you better not mention it in public if you want to have a successful academic career. This is chilling for science. If I were still a practicing social scientist, I wouldn&#39;t touch any hot button social issue with a ten foot pole. Or at least not if I wasn&#39;t prepared to p-hack a socially acceptable result.I also think that shutting out views that you disagree with is terrible for personal intellectual development. Only hearing views that correspond to your priors is a recipe for group-think and intellectual laziness. I make a point of trying to read a wide range of opinions (National Review to Jacobin) because I believe having my ideas challenged makes them stronger. I don&#39;t see how you can have an informed opinion about anything without doing the same.Lastly, if the polls that nytimes cite are true, &#34;cancel culture&#34; is a huge political mistake for progressive. It risks making the democratic brand toxic so that electoral victory, and any real change is impossible.[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/dorian-abbot-mit.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a user, why would I choose this?I only see a benefit to developers for this, but from a user prospective going with another system is a downgrade.Assuming google works like Apple (correct me if I am wrong), disabling a subscription should be able to happen from a central location with a click or 2.If I instead go with the billing through a company not only do they now have my credit card information, but I have to go through them to cancel. Meaning they can send me through screen after screen trying to convince me to stay (dark pattern) or even worse forcing me to call to cancel.As a user, if you want to offer this fine. But as long as the ability to subscribe through Google or Apple is not removed I will be fine. But if this starts a trend of more and more apps having their own billing that then uses dark patterns to keep me subscribed... I will just end up spending less money on subscriptions than I currently do, and I have quite a few subscriptions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do see one potential customer benefit: rather than increasing your attack surface by giving two companies your CC info you just give one (google).  In theory Google is going to have more security than a bunch of smaller companies.I use Apple Pay whenever possible for this precise reason.  I don&#39;t want to trust Target with my CC info.Of course since under this scheme the company I&#39;d be sharing my card info with is the largest dossier assembling company in the world, so I wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with it.  But presumably they will collect the info anyway (even though they aren&#39;t subject to the same regulation as the credit bureaux or credit card networks), so perhaps going directly through them doesn&#39;t make things worse and at least eliminates one risk (spotify themselves)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For people wondering about how they get access to these systems, it feels like they use the weakest human link in the chain.I checked their telegram group and I can see that they specifically recruit people with access to VPNs/internal support systems. This okta breach seems to have happened through similar means. The group has made specific calls for access to gaming companies, hosting providers, telcos, call centers, and bpm providers. They offer payment.It doesn’t feel difficult to see how some overworked, underpaid support agent (or even a well paid disgruntled one) might decide to go with this. Just takes 1 well placed agent to give creds and this group has access to a huge attack surface instantly. This might sound like an overreaction, but corporations in the future might need to make least privilege access and access logging everything a priority from day 1.https://t.me/minsaudebr/162 (Link to the recruitment message)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this explains how the LAPSUS hacker group was able to breach Microsoft, NVIDIA, and countless others. Apparently, they have been inside of OKTA systems for nearly 2 months now.[1] https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/21/microsoft_lapsus_brea...[2] https://www.wired.com/story/lapsus-hacking-group-extortion-n...[3] https://analyticsindiamag.com/lapsus-hack-leaves-nvidia-in-a..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this is why I would ultimately never trust a centralised company with our authentication infrastructure: because something like Okta is an infinitely more attractive target than we are. Their offering is sweet, and I’m always tempted to just give in, but this confirms me in my decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder how much of this is part of a genuine attempt to bring a safe product to market, and how much is to pressure the German government (and soon thereafter, the EU) into making this sort of promise mandatory for all car manufacturers, including those that are ahead of Mercedes in the self-driving space. I.e. to create a legislative moat in an area where they&#39;re behind.While I don&#39;t agree with Tesla&#39;s strategy of playing it fast &amp; loose, I&#39;m afraid that risk aversion will lead us to demand perfect instead of the good enough.A car manufacturer might not be willing to accept 100% liability, but their system might still be a lot safer than a drunk driver returning home from the bar.Realistically we&#39;re not going to be able to pick &#34;well, don&#39;t drive drunk then!&#34;, it&#39;ll happen. By demanding that these system are that reliable before they&#39;re in common operation we&#39;ll have incurred a net loss in terms of safety.I don&#39;t know what the right solution is, probably some mixture of the two. Clearly you don&#39;t want manufacturers to be incentivized to ignore the risk associated with their systems, but you also don&#39;t want these systems not to be offered when they&#39;d be a net gain in safety.The point at which they&#39;re a net gain is not the same point that they become financially viable to the manufacturer from a liability point of view."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Handing over driving responsibility completely requires extremely particular circumstances. Right now, Drive Pilot can only engage at speeds under 40 mph (60 km/h in Germany) on limited-access divided highways with no stoplights, roundabouts, or other traffic control systems, and no construction zones...The system will only operate during daytime, in reasonably clear weather, without overhead obstructions. Inclement weather, construction zones, tunnels, and emergency vehicles will all trigger a handover warning.Those are some big caveats that mean that you won&#39;t be able to use this in most situations.  It is basically only good for stop and go highway traffic which is a situation that other driver assist features handle pretty well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mercedes is perhaps the only auto company that is both supremely innovative and supremely respectable at the same time.Tesla is innovative, but they get ahead of themselves, and Musk is a glorified internet troll who bullies and arguably lies.The Big 3 are respectable in that they don’t really overhype or misrepresent, but Mercedes will probably out-innovate them in self-driving like they’ve out-innovated them (and pretty much everyone else) in just about every other aspect that matters over the past century.Disclaimer: I drive a Toyota Sienna and a Subaru Outback. But I’ve seen a few Mercedes up close (and sometimes driven them) over the years. The only really crappy one in my experience was the ~2006 G500."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very sorry to hear that.You need to consult with a lawyer to decide the way to go from here. He/she can tell you what your odds of winning are, and what the best strategy is. As someone not emotionally involved with the case, and having access to all the details, an impartial person is the best one to trust. I don&#39;t think you should see this case as revenge or closure for the death of your son, because you will be disappointed one way or another. You also don&#39;t have the personal responsibility to fix the failings of such a huge company.Personally, the only advice I can give you is that the way you are living is unhealthy. It is an unimaginable tragedy what happened to you, but you have to somehow gather the strength to rebuild your life again. Your reaction is understandable. However, try to think of the way forward as much as possible. You are likely relatively young, and you have the possibility to start over. There is no way to change the past, only the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They offered to settle because they&#39;ve been forced to pay out for similar cases before. Just last year, Republic Services (who is almost certainly who you&#39;re referring to, if not WM, but RSC is closer to $40B) was found responsible in a similar case in Nevada and the mother was awarded $38 million by the jury: https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/jury-awa...It doesn&#39;t bring your child back, but working with an accident attorney who is compassionate and may be able to wage the battle without too much direct involvement from you may get you more of what you feel is justice in this case.I&#39;m so deeply sorry for your loss, by the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I stopped working so that I can go to the cemetery to stay with my son everyday. It&#39;s been almost two years.Hey, this is quite concerning. The pain must be unimaginable. And the atmosphere around you (understandably) is also not in a position to help themselves, let alone help others. But, if you do read this, please, get help. Somehow, someway. There is always a solution.This is a good first step. Seek for help like you sought help here, friend. Best of luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My company runs without containers. We process petabytes of data monthly, thousands of CPU cores, hundreds of different types of data pipelines running continously, etc etc. Definitely a distributed system with lots of applications and databases.We use Nix for reproducible builds and deployments. Containers only give reproducible deployments, not builds, so they would be a step down. The reason that&#39;s important is that it frees us from troubleshooting &#34;works on my machine&#34; issues, or from someone pushing an update somewhere and breaking our build. That&#39;s not important to everyone if they have few dependencies that don&#39;t change often, but for an internet company, the trend is accelerating towards bigger and more complex dependency graphs.Kubernetes has mostly focused on stateless applications so far. That&#39;s the easy part! The hard part is managing databases. We don&#39;t use Kubernetes, but there&#39;s little attraction because it would be addressing something that&#39;s already effortless for us to manage.What works for us is to do the simplest thing that works, then iterate. I remember being really intimidated about all the big data technologies coming out a decade ago, thinking they are so complex that they must know what they&#39;re doing! But I&#39;d so often dive in to understand the details and be disillusioned about how much complexity there is for relatively little benefit. I was in a sort of paralysis of what we&#39;d do after we outgrew postgresql, and never found a good answer. Here we are years later, with a dozen+ postgresql databases, some measuring up to 30 terabytes each, and it&#39;s still the best solution for us.Perhaps I&#39;ve read too far into the intent of the question, but maybe you can afford to drop the research project into containers and kubernetes, and do something simple that works for now, and get back to focusing on product?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at WhatsApp, prior to moving to Facebook infra, we had some jails for specific things, but mostly ran without containers.Stack looked like:FreeBSD on bare metal servers (host service provided a base image, our shell script would fetch source, apply patches, install a small handful of dependencies, make world, manage system users, etc)OTP/BEAM (Erlang) installed via rsync etc from build machineApplication code rsynced and started via Makefile scriptsNot a whole lot else. Lighttpd and php for www. Jails for stud (a tls terminator, popular fork is called hitch) and ffmpeg (until end to end encrypted media made server transcoding unpossible).No virtualized servers (I ran a freebsd vm on my laptop for dev work, though).When WA moved to Facebook infra, it made sense to use their deployment methodology for the base system (Linux containers), for organizational reasons. There was no consideration for which methodology was technically superior; both are sufficient, but running a very different methodology inside a system that was designed for everyone to use one methodology is a recipie for operational headaches and difficulty getting things diagnosed and fixed as it&#39;s so tempting to jump to the conclusion that any problem found on a different setup is because of the difference and not a latent problem. We had enough differences without requiring a different OS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grooveshark didn&#39;t use any of that. We were very careful about avoiding dependencies where possible and keeping our backend code clean and performant. We supported about 45M MAU at our biggest, with only a handful of physical servers. I&#39;m not aware of any blog posts we made detailing any of this, though. And if you&#39;re not familiar with the saga, Grooveshark went under for legal, not technical reasons. The backend API was powered by nginx, PHP, MySQL, memcache, with a realtime messaging server built in Go. We used Redis and Mongodb for some niche things, had serious issues with both which is understandable because they were both immature at the time, but Mongodb&#39;s data loss problems were bad enough that I would still not use them today.That said, I&#39;m using Docker for my current side project. Even if it never runs at scale, I just don&#39;t want to have to muck around with system administration, not to mention how nice it is to have dev and prod be identical."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Never start coding (making a solution) unless you fully understand the problem.While I agree with this in general, I find that to reall fully understand a problem, I need to attempt to code, or at least formulate, a solution to it.a) because when I break down a problem into its code-able component parts, I learn a lot about itb) because in the process of then actually implementing these parts I often discover edge cases or undefined cases (especially in naturally grown business-logic)c) because what the problem actually IS, is often not that clear at the start of the problem. Yes, in an ideal world, changing requirements would wait until the next version, however, sadly that&#39;s not what happens in the wild."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s one more from me: count your liabilities.1. Code is a liability. No code? No bugs. The best commit is one that removes unnecessary code. This includes dependencies.2. State is a liability. Multipliers for: hidden or non-obvious state, shared state, externally (by actors you don&#39;t control) accessible state, concurrently accessed/mutated state. Often the worst offenders are environment settings/configuration, such as Windows Registry, environment variables, installed dependencies, daemon services, etc, scoring full points.3. All publicly observable behavior is a liability. Also known as Hyrum&#39;s Law: &#34;all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody&#34;, or https://xkcd.com/1172/. Huge multiplier for systems with a long expected lifespan, and another huge one if you guarantee backwards compatibility to paying customers. Program under this assumption, and if you can hide or control your internal behavior, do it. E.g.: maybe don&#39;t output results reliant on a HashSet order - sort them.None of these are hard &#39;rules&#39;. Often the liability is necessary, or worth the saved effort or gained feature. But be aware of them, and minimize them where possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Listing Performance as the lowest value bugs me. I understand that most software isn&#39;t performance-critical, you can probably afford to use a garbage collected language for most use-cases. But putting performance last contradicts the high priority of Usability in the list, because Usability strongly depends on performance.Your product might still work if it has a second of lag after every operation, but I won&#39;t want to use it. And if there aren&#39;t any decent alternatives, I am going to experience irritation and sadness on a continuous basis.Jonathan Blow said[0] (5 minute interview) that software authors have an ethical responsibility towards their users. How many people use YouTube, or Windows? The time wasted might be small on an individual scale, say a minute a day, but multiply it by a billion people (eg. YouTube or Windows) and that&#39;s 16 million man-hours per year.I&#39;d argue the same responsibility exists just as strongly even if you have one user! Do you want to frustrate her, constantly waste her time? Of course not! She is not going to be very happy with you if you do that :)[0] Jonathan Blow on Success and Ethics in Software Development https://youtube.com/watch?v=k8gIJOy0c2g"</p>

There&#39;s always a chance that something bad will go wrong.However, this isn&#39;t just a matter of Hanlon&#39;s razor (incompetence vs malice), but more of a matter of an intelligent guesstimate of risk versus a lack of knowledge in some areas (wasn&#39;t this OVH&#39;s very first datacenter?), and a strong focus on reducing costs. Perhaps the latter went too far, and definitely some obvious mistakes were made by not having a universal power cut off of some sort, but dealing with the amount of power on tap in a datacenter is always dangerous, even when there is no fire at all.I&#39;m not saying we need to give OVH a complete pass on this. I&#39;m just saying that there are a lot of extenuating circumstances and, except for the power cut off, it&#39;s not clear that OVH made any choices due to extreme negligence or cost-cutting. In other words, they didn&#39;t do anything immoral. At worst, it appears that (even from the most anti-OVH party here), this was just a mistake in the design of a new (at the time) style of datacenter, and it did work properly for many years before there was a problem. Making a mistake is not immoral."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone interested, I maintained a server within the affected DC.OVH provided 3x the price of the service for the downtime. But for the recovery we needed to buy a new server from them as our backups were only accesible from dedicated machines...
At the end we basically received 2x the price of the server when discounting the temp machine. 
Communication during the downtime was not bad from OVH side, taking into account the huge amount of affected servers.
At the end, as a small customer I cant do or ask for much more. As it&#39;s not worth neither the money or the time. 
IMHO, 3x is not covering any business loses for anyone. We got our own backups within the OVH network and it took 3 additional  days to be able to access them as the network was a mess after the fire. That for some business is going to be a huge sum."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NVIDIA continues to vertically integrate their datacenter offerings.  They bought mellanox to get infiniband.  They tried to buy ARM - that didn&#39;t work.  But they&#39;re building &amp; bundling CPUs anyway.  I guess when you&#39;re so far ahead on the compute side, it&#39;s all the peripherals that hold you back, so they&#39;re putting together a complete solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This leads me to wonder about the microprocessor shortage.So many computing devices such as Nvidia Jetson and Raspberry Pi are simply not available anywhere.  I wonder what&#39;s he point of bringing out new products when existing products can&#39;t be purchased?  Won&#39;t the new products also simply not be available?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting. So without actually targeting a specific Cloud / server market for their CPU, which often ends with a chicken and egg problem with HyperScaler making their own Design or Chip. Nvidia manage to enter the Server CPU market leveraging their GPU and AI workload.All of a sudden there is real choice of ARM CPU on Server. ( What will happen to Ampere ? ) The LPDDR5X used here will also be the first to come with ECC. And they can cross sell those with Nvidia&#39;s ConnectX-7 SmartNICs.Hopefully it will be price competitive.Edit: Rather than downvoting may be explain why or what you disagree with ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m kinda confused why Unity keeps doing this - they keep putting out high-end demo after high-end demo, but that&#39;s not where there core userbase is. Their main users are people who build games for phones and indies, with basically zero usage in the AAA space. And Unity&#39;s performance/stability is still not that great afaik.It seems to me that they are trying to prove that they are a serious &#39;AAA&#39; engine, but these demos aren&#39;t that convincing to me - AAA is a lot more than putting fancy shaders on high-poly models, it&#39;s about handling huge amounts of objects in a dynamics situation, displaying large worlds via streaming, having a workflow that accommodates every creative professional, and offering great performance and visuals  even on very complex scenes.I&#39;ve hear that even these highly impressive demos are fake - they built a ton of custom code for each one they rebuild core Unity features, meaning if you wanted to replicate this for yourself, you&#39;d be in for a ton of development.Comparatively UE5&#39;s Nanite demo showed off a tech that&#39;s ready to go for production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is indeed rendered in realtime, but one thing to note is it&#39;s a &#34;4D&#34; capture, more-or-less meaning each frame of the animation is its own asset. This makes it possible to reproduce subtle physics like the lips sticking together slightly when the actor opens her mouth. The amount of storage space, alone, makes this impractical for anything other than demos. Unity claims they will be able to achieve this level of fidelity using a deep learning-based compression that will allow stuff like this to appear in game cutscenes, but all the movements will still be pre-baked. The only interaction possible will be moving the camera. At that point the technology will be very useful, but it&#39;s still a ways away from having such a realistic character that can react to you dynamically.(Though whether that&#39;s just a couple years of software technology progress, or a decade+ for hardware progress, who can say?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Look at our demo of a hyper-realistic human character!&#34;eighteen million things happen around the character to distract the viewer&#39;s attention from the human character throughout most of the videoNot the most confident tech demo.  Looks like a reasonable degree of evolution, but as they start to get up toward turn-of-the-century movie CGI in games, now you run into the same issues that you see in mocap for movies--including that a lot of details of an actor&#39;s expressions and movements actually aren&#39;t captured, so you have to have animators go back and laboriously add all those lost details back in to have something that looks convincing.(Mind, I say turn-of-the-century, but man, the fundamental techniques for rendering skin convincingly have come a long way, even in current game engines.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Built-in unit types are underrated. F# has them. Other languages should seriously consider adding them, despite the fact that feature bloat is a serious language problem and they&#39;re relatively niche: they are that useful, and I honestly don&#39;t think they would interfere much with other features.Something like:    unit type Meters = m
    unit type Seconds = s

    function sleep(time: Int[s]): void

    val speed = 5.4 m/s // Type = Float[m/s]
    val distance = parseFloat(prompt(&#39;enter time&#39;)) * 1 m // Convert unitless to meters just by multiplying
    val time = distance / speed // Type = Float[s]
    print(&#34;${time}&#34;) // Prints &#34;# s&#34;
    print(&#34;${time / 1 s} seconds&#34;) // Prints &#34;# seconds&#34;

    val complexUnit = 7 * 1 lbf/in2 // 7 lbf/in2
    // != 7 psi (too hard to infer) but you can write a converter function
    function toPsi&lt;N : Numeral&gt;(value: N[lbf/in2]): N[psi] {
        return value * 1 psi*in2/lbf
    }

It requires extending number parsing, type parsing (if the brackets aren&#39;t already part e.g. in TypeScript), and extending types to support units of measurement at least if they are statically known to be subtypes of `Numeral`.Naming variables with their units doesn&#39;t solve the issue of mis-casting and using units incorrectly, and newtypes are too inconvenient (and sometimes impossible without affecting performance) so nobody uses them. Even as a very software-focused programmer I encounter units like seconds, bytes, pixels, etc. all the time, they are almost never newtypes, and I get bugs from forgetting to convert or converting incorrectly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work at a company with two database fields, speed_kmph.The documentation read &#34;speed_kmph - This field contains the travelling speed in MILES PER HOUR - please do not be confused by the name&#34;.Woo, great job guys."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Java and Kotlin have a nice Duration class. So in Kotlin you can do  delay(duration = Duration.ofMinutes(minutes = 1))

which is equivalent to  delay(timeMillis = 60_000)

Using the optional argument names here for clarity; you don&#39;t have to of course.Sticking with the JVM, a frequent source of confusion is the epoch. Is it in millis or in seconds? With 32 bit integers that has to be seconds (which will set you up for the year 2038 problem). However, Java always used 64 bit longs for tracking the epoch in milliseconds instead even before the year 2000 problem was still a thing. Knowing which you are dealing with is kind of relevant in a lot of places; especially when interfacing with code or APIs written in other languages with more 32 bit legacy.Things like network timeouts are usually in milliseconds. But how do you know this for sure? Specifying, them in seconds means that there&#39;s less risk of forgetting a 0 or something like that. So, using seconds is pretty common too. You can&#39;t just blindly assume one or the other. Even if you use the Duration class above, you&#39;d still want to put the magic number it takes as a parameter in some configuration property or constant. Those need good names too and they should include the unit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These translation issues will be familiar to anybody learning a current, very much alive language, especially if you&#39;re reading informal forums (say, Youtube comments). You have the same types of abbreviations, more-or-less voluntary misspellings and jokes or references that only make sense from a certain cultural standpoint.I&#39;m sure most foreign language students will sympathize with the very frustrating and demoralizing situation where you read a sentence, understand every single word but you still have absolutely no idea what it&#39;s trying to convey because you&#39;re missing some idiom, reference or alternative meaning of one of the words.For the English monolinguals reading this, imagine studying English and stumbling upon the sentence &#34;I fell for her&#34;, except that you only know the literal meaning of the verb &#34;to fall&#34; so while you understand the words in isolation the sentence remains completely opaque and meaningless to you."</p>

If what you&#39;ve actually got is an inherited tremendous ball of spaghetti css, a need to change just one thing on the page, and scant prospects for future changes in the area, then it may be good engineering to use &#34;!important&#34; to make your change over a more complex solution. This is in fact the situation I find myself in at work somewhat often, although luckily I can&#39;t recall the last time I had to use &#34;!important&#34;.

As if they think you wake up and want to do CSS work.  CSS is not the goal. The website I&#39;m building isn&#39;t even the goal. The goal is to solve some problem.Everything that I have to do to solve that problem is an unfortunate (but inevitable) reality.  But let&#39;s be clear: the goal is to minimize as close to zero, how much time you have to spend doing these things.CSS, like all code, is a total liability. I want to spend as little time designing and writing it as possible. Which is why I hate CSS: it demands you know the exact current and future (hahahaha) structure of your webpage. `!important` is not some panacea, but I cackle at the ignorance of suggesting that the user is wrong for misusing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is very similar. I tried the first iterations of Gnome 3 and was very disappointed.At some point I tried Windows+WSL but that was a complete disaster.A couple of years ago I decided to try Fedora+Gnome+Wayland. It is an outstanding experience. Everything is smooth, the UI is beautiful. Now with PipeWire and Libadwaita things are getting even better. After some stagnation, the Linux desktop is gaining momentum again.There are a lot of hate comments for Gnome in this post. My advice for those reading is: Try it for yourself! Most of the haters haven&#39;t used Gnome since 2004. Just try it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is unfortunate that so many of the early comments are negative. Either Wayland is the future, or something that learns from Wayland&#39;s mistakes and leverages its ideas is. There is a really fertile field right now for experimentation in the world of compositors but I think people have been scared away by the long dark era of X Windows + binary graphics drivers. Maybe we&#39;re going to see a lot more of it on HN in the next decade?What kept me off Wayland was the screenshots thing, but the argument in favour of the idea is strong. The downside is Wayland&#39;s conception of permissions and interactions is too basic and crippled adoption for a few years but the fundamentals (blocking cross-application snooping) is going to be necessary. Operating systems have to be less trusting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to go back to GNOME on Xorg. GNOME on Wayland won&#39;t run my 4k display at a consistent 60Hz, which results in horrible issues in games and emulators, as well as massive numbers of dropped frames in 50/60Hz videos. It is set to run at 60Hz in the display settings, but actually seems to run somewhere in the 50s.The easiest way to see this is checking the &#34;stats for nerds&#34; while watching a 60fps YouTube video and noting the persistent dropped frames. glxgears also doesn&#39;t maintain a consistent framerate.This doesn&#39;t happen in Sway, so I can only assume there is some bug in Mutter that has persisted across several versions of GNOME and Fedora. So Wayland might be great, but my experience with GNOME on it has not been."</p>

Riders pay a subscription for the scooter and access to the battery kiosk.Seems like a really great option.  I would love to have that in my city.  We have dockless bicycles and scooters but a more capable and personal option would be awesome.  I&#39;d sign up in a heartbeat.Sadly my city planners do not seem aware of motorcycles as a transportation option.  We have no laws or infrastructure to encourage them or take advantage of the benefits.  At a state level we at least get to cut ferry lines, but that seems to be the only perk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if the electric car market (i.e. Tesla) is ripe for disruption.I read the article and thought back to the demo [1] Tesla did years ago of automated battery swap.  Tesla did it as a stunt; they publicly stated that they didn&#39;t plan to market that.As a Tesla owner, I don&#39;t want battery swap as long as I am paying for the battery as part of the price of the car.  I&#39;d be worried that my brand new max-range battery would be swapped with old worn-out batteries, and I would feel like I lost value.However, on road trips, I would much prefer a 5-10 minute battery swap over supercharging (which they no longer give me for free).  The electric car experience would essentially be the same as the IC experience.If Tesla (or someone) sold me a car without a battery, and I had to buy a battery &#34;subscription&#34;, I might go for that.  I&#39;d get a huge discount off the base price of the car, and now I wouldn&#39;t be concerned about swapping since it&#39;s not my battery.  I&#39;d do my normal day-to-day as usual, and on road trips or unexpected usage, I could swap out in minutes.  I could get on board with that.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5V0vL3nnHY

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another fan of Beyond Compare here, but I want to point out something everyone else has missed so far, which is that BC is great for comparing all sorts of files, not just code.For example, I use its &#34;Table Compare&#34; feature to compare log files from different machines, sorted by timestamp.  This lets me easily see the order of operations in a distributed system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Meld since years ago, and it&#39;s my default go-to diff viewer. The visual style they implemented helps me a lot to reason about how lines have been added or deleted from documents in the side by side comparison. Very neat!The directory contents tree diff is also really useful.I wish they made it even easier the basic case of comparing aribtrary text. Maybe it should be the default mode after opening the program, instead of having to click on a couple buttons, because I use it a lot to manually paste pieces of text. For example, logs from a server during testing, to compare what went different between runs.Another welcomed addition would be &#34;ignore masks&#34;. Some kind of regex input that could be used to quickly tell Meld which parts of the text to skip comparing. That way, comparison of log files could be made where a timestamps column would be ignored."</p>

That would make them bad regardless of how correct their expressed positions are about the Ukraine war.The fact that there has not been a strong push back confirms my suspicion that by now, everyone has gotten used to Node and NPM being insecure and silently accepted it as a way of life. Similarly, those Terraform scripts are apparently esoteric enough to only be used by a tiny minority of software developers, or else we would have heard about it in a different way.Thank god nobody did similar shenanigans to open source projects that are actually in wide use :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think this was an unexpected result of the situation with Russia, there wasn&#39;t really any other options, but interesting to see SpaceX launching a direct competitor to Starlink. I suppose they always made it clear that they were not going to let their investment in Starlink stop them launching competitors constellations.I am still somewhat surprised by the UK governments investment in OneWeb, I hope the strategy pays off and it becomes an important national infrastructure project. My thoughts where that it may be about providing a future proof network for the remote areas of the UK but we aren&#39;t exactly a big country so I&#39;m not convinced that&#39;s the case. The rubbish that was written about it being a route to our own GPS system after Brexit forced us to leave the Galileo program was clearly all fluff to make it sound more impressive and tie it to a post Brexit strategy in some way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Russian space program was the most impressive thing to me about Russians, so to see it destroyed before my very eyes saddens me. Russians are quite clever about making do with little, but I don&#39;t see how a declining country like Russia is today can compete with the Indian or Chinese space programs, who are also doing amazing things that don&#39;t get a lot of press in America."</p>

However it may ultimately be necessary because there are no Ariane 5 cores left, and the new Ariane 6 rocket is unlikely to have capacity for a couple of years.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like every Windows user, I have had a lot of frustrating experiences with the abusive behavior and dark patterns that have taken over the platform. Like when they started having Skype silently run in the background logged in with the user&#39;s Microsoft account without any notice or human intervention, and removed the setting to disable it from launching at startup so that it couldn&#39;t be prevented. I had to completely uninstall it, which didn&#39;t really help, because they still kept bringing it back after every update. I assume that they&#39;re going to do this with Teams now.For every egregious user-hostile behavior, you can search and find a ton of forum threads where people discuss at length how to reverse or mitigate them. The fact that Microsoft is aware of this and continues to prioritize this kind of abusive growth hacking over user trust, knowing fully how that impacts the company&#39;s reputation among enthusiasts, is perhaps more damning than the actual practices.Nobody at Microsoft who has decision-making authority actually cares. Contempt for the users is so deep in the DNA that this will never get better. It&#39;s disappointing, because it ultimately undermines all of the great effort that people elsewhere in the company have put into features like WSL that might otherwise make the platform attractive to modern developers.It creates a really adversarial posture between the user and the platform. When they introduce new features, I&#39;m reluctant to even try them because I don&#39;t trust their intentions. It&#39;s like being in an abusive relationship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can disable such apps like Skype using our tool Mirekusoft Install Monitor (https://www.mirekusoft.com/how-it-works/features/).Mirekusoft Install Monitor is more than an uninstaller. Once installed, Mirekusoft Install Monitor runs in the background and starts monitoring program installs in real-time. It&#39;s lightweight so it will have minimal impact on your PC. It watches the files/registry added to your system by an application installation, allowing you cleanly remove the program later should you want to do so and overall greater visibility into what changes were made on your system. It also makes it simple to better improve performance through the Performance/Startup tabs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article nails a lot of the issues with Windows 11.I bit the bullet and upgraded to Windows 11 late last year thinking it must be an improvement over Windows 10. It turned out to be a big step backwards.- Changing the default browser is a lot of work instead of a single click.- I can&#39;t move the task bar to the side, even though almost every monitor nowadays has much more horizontal space than vertical.- All apps are not readily accessible from the start menu; I have to click another button to get to them.- I have a 2-in-1 laptop, and turning it into tablet mode is wonky.- I can&#39;t choose to not have grouped buttons on the taskbar.- The context menus UX is horrible. Some context menu items are now two clicks away instead of one. Also what&#39;s with the excessive rounded corners and slim selection padding?- The stacked notifications is confusing, and always shows the calendar when I open the notifications panel.- Lots of crap pushed on me, like chat (aka Teams), widgets (which require a Microsoft account), 3rd party apps that look like they&#39;re installed but actually get downloaded/installed on first use.I was able to fix a lot of those issues with ExplorerPatcher [0]. However, one day after a Windows update, Explorer didn&#39;t start at all after login (black screen, I thought Windows was hosed). This has since been fixed. But I decided enough is enough, and finally &#34;upgraded&#34; back to Windows 10.The only good thing about Windows 11 is wslg, which provides out of the box support for Linux GUI apps (not available on Windows 10). But I can get the same result with an X server and some work.[0] https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/wiki/All-features"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having lived in Shanghai during 2005-2012 and seeing the construction boom there, I noticed some differences immediately after arriving in the US. It&#39;s common to hear about transportation projects taking decades to expand a few stations here. Mean while, since the time I left the Shanghai subway station has opened 21 new lines composed of 516 stations.Certainly, the air/water was worse in China but workers also had to work much harder (later nights, weekends, etc). But perhaps most importantly, the government would waste no time in getting land that it needed, and it certainly wouldn&#39;t ask for your consideration if it needs to do construction on a Saturday morning.While I appreciate that there is an inherent trade off between environmental consideration and speed, I think the author makes it clear that it&#39;s reached comic proportions in the US. The article is short, but I think the main premise is overwhelmingly accurate: The system exists to protect the status quo.There&#39;s also the reliance of transportation agencies on consultants:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m trying to build a house on empty land in Los Angeles. It’s about 15mins from downtown in Mt Washington. We bought the land in April of 2019 and started on the design and permitting process immediately. Despite it being in populated Los Angeles, we need a septic system, to widen the road and add curbs, move a power pole, relocate 3 trees, and extend a water line. We won’t have gas as we want to go all solar. All of this the city is making us pay for.Our permit for a small septic system took 14 months to approve.The power department has told us it will likely take 12 months for them to approve the pole movement (the city is making us move it as part of the road widening).The water main needs to be extended 12 feet, and it’s mandated that the utility company must do that work and it will cost us $75k.The tree permit took us 12 months to get and requires us to get a bond too.We still haven’t got approval for the road widening, it’s been almost 18 months. Keep in mind this is just the road in front of our house in a residential area of Los Angeles. There are lots of homes on our street already.I’m originally from Australia. The American bureaucracy is insane. The agencies don’t talk to each other. Often times we have been acting as the go between for different departments that worked in the same building!Los Angeles has a huge housing shortage. If my experience is anything to go by, it’s because the bureaucracy is so dense it takes years to just get the permits in place. It would be cheaper and better if I could just pay a bribe and get it done quickly.Americans seem to know what the problem is, but just accept that nothing can be done about it. Like you all know the DMV sucks and the USPS sucks, but everyone has just accepted that’s it’s just the way it is and decided to live with it. Why?! Hold your officials accountable to actually run government effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For public transit in particular, the US has billionaires and politicans who actively campaign against such projects [1]. The effect of this cannot be overstated. People buy into the propaganda that their taxes will go up and/or it will bring crime to their idyllic locales (where otherwise property prices keep the riffraff out).Landowners in the US have very successfullly voted in measures that limit further construction (including higher density housing and public transit systems) and increase the value of their holdings.I&#39;ve mentioned housing here because it directly impacts a lot of potential construction, particularly public transport. You cannot build anything other than single-family homes in much of the US. This lowers population density and makes public transport less viable. It also diverts tax revenue to build infrastructure for the required cars: highways, parking lots, etc.There are a lot of local problems here too eg NYC&#39;s scaffolding laws [2], corruption in NYC construction projects [3] and CEQA in California [4].[1]: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/climate/koch-brothers-pub...[2]: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2020/10/08/585902...[3]: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-...[4]: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/signature-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Higher education in the US is trying to fulfill so many roles it&#39;s unsustainable.    - teaching marketable skills so people can get jobs
    - teaching &#34;how to think&#34; and learning about art and culture
    - Performing cutting edge research
    - minor league sports teams

The large state schools are trying to fulfill all these conflicting roles. We should probably break them out to separate entities.If you have a physicist who&#39;s at the leading edge of research in their field, you want them doing that research, not teaching 18 year old&#39;s Newton&#39;s laws of motion. And they&#39;re mostly not doing that teaching, that gets farmed out to an adjunct paid starvation wages. So the kid who&#39;s paying through the nose to attend a top university with the best researchers doesn&#39;t get to interact with them much and gets an inferior education compared to one where they hired and properly compensated someone to actually focus on teaching.If we want to train people for specific jobs - create institutions that do that. If the upper class want someplace to send their kids to read poetry and binge drink for 4 years before they get a jr. associate position at their Dad&#39;s investment bank, create a separate institution for that. Major league sports should create and manage their own feeder leagues to develop players, no reason to cram that into a university. We should create dedicated research institutions so researchers don&#39;t have to pretend to care about teaching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sam Altman makes a lot of grandiose predictions and statements.For example, in 2019 he said “Human radiologists are already much worse than computer radiologists. If I had to pick a human or an AI to read my scan, I’d pick the AI.” [0] However, most people with domain knowledge in this space still would not want their scan not to be read by a human. The AI radiology apps are generally narrowly focused and useful for consultation not diagnosis. [1]In 2015 he predicted: “Self-driving cars are going to get here much faster than people think,” Altman said. He thought we’d see them in three to four years. [2]I think he would be wise to learn from Bill Gates that it&#39;s a bad idea to over-predict what will happen in the short term. &#34;We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.&#34;I&#39;ll add to this that it&#39;s generally a bad idea to make big predictions outside of areas that you have strong domain knowledge in. I doubt Sam Altman has strong domain knowledge around US higher education. Unfortunately, Silicon Valley culture is full of people who feel that because they&#39;ve succeeded in one domain they have some kind of hidden insight into others.[0] https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/26/sam-altman-on-ai-jobs-may-go...[1] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-020-07230-9[2] https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/elon-musk-sam-altman-say-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the writing on the wall is clear regarding student loans.The entire notion of taxpayer funded student loans is a scam on both taxpayers and students.  It’s a system that allows the colleges/universities to charge any tuition they want and guarantees there will be an artificial demand.For about a decade at least 1M student loan holders default per year. Long before the defaults reached that high, everyone involved knew that student loans were far outpacing the economic value, and yet not a single college or university stepped up in goodfaith to blow the whistle, they continued to suckle at the tit to the detriment of their own students.Education is supposed to benefit students and the nation as a whole but the ridiculousness of loans has ensured it ruins lives and at &gt;$1.5T in taxpayer funded debt that continues to grow exponentially it is a detriment to the country.Collapse of student loans will of course have an impact of the college/university landscape, but the industry as a whole will not collapse, rather tuition will “collapse”, or come down, to what students can actually afford out of pocket without going into debt.  And if the universities/colleges somehow can’t survive on existing taxpayers subsidies from the Dept. of Educations $68B annual budget plus out of pocket tuition rates, then welcome to the real world your university/college is a failed business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Stormlight Archive (series) by Brandon Sanderson has probably changed my life the most. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve enjoyed a book as much or have had one mean as much to me as I&#39;ve have with this series.The series is incredibly inspirational since despite being a high fantasy novel. In fear of spoiling the plot, I&#39;m being vague: it tracks the stories of (multiple) people who go through difficult life situations and learn to heal from depressive moments while having incredibly, intricate worldbuilding (which is excellent for taking your mind off of reality) and a twisty plot. If you go on the subreddit for this series, r/stormlight_archive, you&#39;ll see people talking about how this book (literally) saved their lives. I can tell you that in the most off-putting moments of life reading inspirational scenes from the Stormlight Archive has helped me stand up again. The messages and themes about life are simple, but also on-point. Overall, an excellent series. I recommend it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First and foremost: The Bible. Not the watered down &#34;everybody goes to heaven&#34; theology that most people subscribe to, but rather an evidence based approach that uses the Bible to interpret itself as it was designed to do.Secondarily, this book saved my life in the sense that it helped me understand my depression, a clinical depression so deep that my psychologist had never seen such a thing previously:Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy - Stephen C. Hayes https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0054M063A/Its scientific approach to understanding our own thought patterns gave me control- coping mechanisms- for dealing with my own feelings instead of ignoring (&#34;Burying&#34;) them and letting them slowly destroy me from the inside out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I submitted this because it is the best summary of NAT I have read, and it goes into some of the technical details. Kudos to tailscale for writing this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a really well written article, one of the best summaries of NAT traversal I have ever read. I started to laugh mid-way, because it&#39;s amusing (and a bit sad) the lengths we have to go to establish communications using the IPv4 addressing space.It&#39;s good to learn about ICE too. I had&#39;nt thought about the security implications : indeed this whole mess makes it very easy for an unprivileged attacker to trick the endpoints into relaying the traffic to their own gateway. For example, if I understand things well, another user behind the NAT can easily make the NAT device relay the traffic to them by sending probes at the same time. I&#39;m not sure how can this be defended against, and if it&#39;s even possible.Is anyone aware of any interesting reading on the subject of MITM of NAT traversal ?Are there any good software libraries that abstract away all these details"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Modern computing seems to be a story of &#34;worse is better&#34;, and not just the classical &#34;worse is better&#34; of Gabriel&#39;s paper but something that amounts to &#34;worse is better squared&#34;. Gabriel bemoaned the adoption of Unix and C over more &#34;well-thought-out&#34; designs, but Unix and C were at least designed. (&#34;Say what you will, at least it&#39;s an ethos.&#34;) The same could go for TCP/IP&#39;s lean design as opposed to the heavyweight OSI model. But it seems like even these designs are too onerous for the modern day, and instead we build what would normally go on top of Unix or TCP/IP on the Web. All platforms are now the Web platform, which was never designed to run programs and hence is a non-cohesive mess. All networking is now client-server, or indeed is now just HTTP requests: goodbye end-to-end principle (hello NAT!), goodbye protocols other than TCP or UDP. We can build the same things on this platform as we did with native platforms, but we have to do it using kludgy methods which sacrifice a lot of performance and only work 95% of the time: so instead of TCP, we get WebRTC, and instead of assembly we have WebAssembly. And what do we gain? We gain security, and we gain ease of installation (just go to www.zombo.com vs go to zombo.com, click on &#34;Downloads&#34;, click on &#34;Windows x64&#34;, wait 4 minutes for it to download... and so on).Can we do better? I think we can: if operating systems caught on to capability-based security, then the Web platform could become a legacy platform. (We see that phone OSes, which use capability based security, still direct us to &#34;the app&#34; rather than &#34;the site&#34;.) And adoption of IPv6 could void all the kludgy workaround of NAT that we&#39;ve had to develop.But we live in the world we inherit, rather than the one we imagine, so currently all we can do is traverse NATs and write webapps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Librewolf is not primarily intended as the definite browser but a sane base template for easily customizable and extendable firefox builds.The librewolf AUR package is a great starting point to make custom builds of firefox; between two json files in the settings repo you can tweak basically any relevant setting, bundle extensions (e.g. use custom forked ones without needing to either sign through Mozilla or disable security), search engines, use your own fxa/syncserver, handlers, branding, etc.All in a git repo and you won&#39;t have to redo things next time you reinstall the browser or get a new machine (anyone else ever scratched their heads trying to recall that one about:config setting?)Building and tweaking vanilla firefox yourself is quite an exercise. Librewolf makes it a breeze. The sane privacy-by-default standards is just the cherry on the top.https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was one of the two guys who came up with the original concept for Librefox.I was responsible for including uBO as default, among other things.Great to see that the project was brought back to life as LibreWolf - Mozilla lawyers had threatened us with legal action because the name was too close to their brand. They expected us to drop the &#34;Fox&#34; part of the name.Everytime I see LibreWolf on HN I feel proud that the spirit of Librefox is still alive.The biggest issue with LibreWolf and what&#39;s stopping it&#39;s further adoption is lack of auto-updates (especially on Windows) and lack of usability - it should work out of the box for everyone. Currently the security settings are too strict in default mode. There should be different levels of pre-configured security levels users can chose in the settings (i.e. &#34;standard&#34;, &#34;strict&#34;, &#34;very strict&#34;).(I don&#39;t use HN for commenting, which is why I created a throwaway account)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been using LibreWolf for a week or so since someone mentioned it in a comment elsewhere - UX-wise, it&#39;s pretty much identical to Firefox. I&#39;m happy it doesn&#39;t have Pocket and the rest of Mozilla&#39;s recent product launches arguing for space in my life. My Firefox setup was already pretty solidly &#34;paranoid/misanthropic&#34;, so I haven&#39;t really noticed any new issues from Libre, but you may.Overall, it&#39;s a pretty good implementation of &#34;Firefox By Mozilla-the-Foundation not Mozilla-the-Corporation.&#34; I&#39;ve been using Firefox at least in part because I think a mono- or even duo-polistic internet is a Bad thing, but Mozilla&#39;s been indifferent-bordering-on-hostile to me as a user class, so I appreciate LibreWolf as a kind of &#34;Chromium for Firefox.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like a good thing to me, because with &#34;AI-generated works&#34;, there&#39;s the potential to generate a massive amount of images and essentially try to pre-copyright a lot of content, so you can then sue people who produce legitimate works that somewhat resemble what you&#39;ve already copyrighted.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From Russell and Norvig, a famous story about difficulty in publishing with probably the first such AI-generated work:&#34;Two researchers from Carnegie Tech, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, rather stole the show [at the original Dartmouth AI Conference].  Although the others had ideas and in some cases programs for particular applications such as checkers, Newell and Simon already had a reasoning program, the Logic Theorist (LT).... Soon after the workshop, the program was able to prove most of the theorems in Chapter 2 of Russell and Whitehead&#39;s Principia Mathematica.  Russell was reportedly delighted when Simon showed him that the program had come up with a proof for one theorem that was shorter than the one in Principia.  The editors for the Journal of Symbolic Logic were less impressed: they rejected a paper coauthored by Newell, Simon, and Logic Theorist.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is how NYC raises money - when the revenue dips they send out the sidewalk inspectors, health inspectors, tow trucks, etc. and write up a bunch of fines.Most restaurants have a way to signal the kitchen that an inspector has arrived and they&#39;ll quickly toss everything they are cooking into the garbage because it&#39;s cheaper than getting a fine. Former mayor Bloomberg&#39;s planned crack down on soda drinks was more about issuing fines for not serving precisely 8oz of liquid - though the next mayor dropped it and all the special order measuring cups for the health inspectors went to a warehouse.I&#39;ve witnessed a fleets of NYPD tow trucks clearing out streets of UPS and Fedex trucks. They know what time the delivery companies hit various parts of town and they are ready for them.Recently the New York fire inspectors have started fining landlords for debris in the hallways (debris = amazon deliveries left at the door). So now if the delivery comes to the door you have to get it before the building super throws it away to save the landlord from being fined, if it gets left by the mailbox then the food delivery people steal it on their way out. No winning.About ten years ago there was a good samaritan going around feeding parking meters to keep people from being fined. He was arrested and taken to jail. They let him go without charges but not before he spent the weekend - because the person who processes releases doesn&#39;t work on weekends they said. I think he sued and ended up settling out of court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context for those not in NYC:* Illegal parking and idling are out of control throughout the city. This has been the case for years, but it’s reached new heights since the pandemic. Trucks and cars often idle because they’re parked illegally.* The city DOT, for a variety of reasons, is reluctant to redesign streets to prevent this behavior (e.g. by adding loading zones)* The police are reluctant to ticket for this behavior, and frequently idle in their police cars throughout the city.If a bounty system feels desperate/problematic, it is. Our city agencies have failed to deal with this problem and people are pissed about it. My hope is that this program is a bandaid until larger structural issues with the DOT and NYPD are addressed. We’ll see."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Mr. Slapikas said he pulled in $64,000 in rewards in 2021 for simply paying attention on his daily walks for exercise: “I would expect to get three a day without even looking.”That’s almost 10% of the total fines paid out last year, according to the article.I wonder what the distribution of payouts looks like. I assume it’s a small number of people collecting the bulk of the fines.Regardless, it looks like it’s working. Idling cars may not be producing the bulk of emissions, but it’s one of the easiest places to start cutting as it’s otherwise wasted fuel and emissions."</p>

Explicitly building the rendering pipeline really helped me understand the underlying data flow and rasterization techniques, which in turn made me understand GLSL much better. And extending the rasterizer with order-independent transparency, multicore rendering, antialiasing, and other niceties made me appreciate the work that goes into modern renderers.Highly recommend.[1] https://www.rayvertex.com/
