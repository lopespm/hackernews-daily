								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Mac App Store gives a hint at what would happen if there was any choice.  The amount of software actually available for the Mac is far, far greater than what’s listed in the store.  Furthermore, while some quality and notable apps are still in the Mac App Store, many well-known apps are not there.  The number of lousy apps is also extremely high every time I go to search or just look at the front page, to the point where Apple does itself no favors by even drawing attention to most of the apps on that store (and it gives the impression that “most” Mac software must be like this).If they simply listed all major Mac apps, e.g. linking to their web sites or download links or whatever, they would hugely increase the value of the Mac platform and bring enough direct benefit to developers to be worth some kind of fee (and of course Apple gets $99/year anyway).  Instead, they tried to port the same clueless, greedy, review-burdened scheme to that store, layering completely unnecessary requirements on top (like poorly-thought-out sandboxing).  And since developers had a choice, they mostly said No."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question about monopolies and market abuses.Apple released their phone in 2007, the App Store in 2008, and in-app payments in 2009. During that time their marketshare was fairly small, and it didn&#39;t start to really grow until they expanded availability to the Verizon network in 2011.Right at launch of the App Store, Apple announced its sales commission would be 30%. Then they extended that same fee to in-app purchases a year later. At the same time they set the rules that third-party app stores were not allowed, and that third-party payment processors could not be used.I&#39;m mentioning all of this history to make this point: Apple made these rules when they were not a monopoly by any definition. They released these products, with these rules, into a free market and let the market (both users and developers) decide which products to use and which products to develop for.Now, obviously, between 2007 and 2021 the iPhone has been a wild success. Its platform has grown in users and developers every year.So in terms of the framing of &#34;market abuse&#34;, at what point between the launch of these rules and now did Apple cross that threshold between free-market competitor who can legally control their own platform to monopolist abusing its power?I&#39;m asking this question not just to make a point, but because I think it will be instructive for future companies to understand where in the growth curve the rules they started with can potentially cross over into being &#34;abusive&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a German movie about the system that is used to gather TV ratings. It&#39;s a special box that some users get which reports what they are watching. Small sample size goes into a big statistic (not sure how accurate the portrayal of the system in the movie is). These boxes are given to the people who pay the German public TV fee, which excludes i.e. students (they don&#39;t have to pay) and some other groups. This group of critical people figured that out and started to hack into these machines to fake ratings. They faked the ratings away from stupid trash TV towards some higher quality stuff, documentaries, culture, ...
Obviously in the movie then the country saw a renaissance, everyone got smarter, yadda yadda, you get it.I feel like this is similar.
All tech savvy people block ads and analytics and at least the known tricks they use against us. So the internet only tracks the defenseless people and is then built to serve them (and or exploit them).Maybe we should engage in large scale AdWords fraud. Send come fake traffic away from Facebook and over to Wikipedia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected these numbers to be higher. However, an even more interesting metric is the 88% block in Firefox.Firefox may not have a great market share, but based on these numbers it&#39;s market share may very well be eight times higher than your analytics report. This can change the argument of &#34;it&#39;s only 3% of our users so we don&#39;t need to test on FF&#34; to &#34;it&#39;s a quarter of our user base, we should at least test it&#34;, depending on your target audience. I&#39;ve seen tons of people claim general Firefox usage is negligible based on public data from websites such as statcounter, but these metrics prove that those statistics are unreliable and should not be used.The best you can do is use server side UA inspection, though you can&#39;t really distinguish bots from real users that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am amazed at how non-techy people use the internet. I teach college and I will sometimes have students go to some web site. I am amazed at how few use adblocking and just accept all the ads and popups and overlays and crap. Even more than that, I will see them using something like google docs and google will put an overlay for some new feature and they don&#39;t click the X to close it. They just type away with that overlay in the corner. That drives me crazy. I don&#39;t know how they do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many people in this thread don’t understand how enterprise decisions get made.The business license costs $21/month, probably less in reality.Do you really think that businesses are going to jeopardize the workflows of their $250k/year assets over a very core piece of software for $250/year?Any alternative has switching costs and risks. Companies will just pay this. I see so many people saying “just do these 10 steps and it’s basically the same”. It just ain’t worth it for $250"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Minikube&#39;s docker-engine and haven&#39;t missed DockerForMac for some time now.Minikube sets up a Linux VM using MacOS Hypervisor.It even has a convenience command to configure docker-cli/docker-client.  $ minikube docker-env
    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=&#34;1&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This appears to be cutting of their nose to spite their face. We have a team of 50+ engineers that all use Docker for Mac for daily development tasks, but I suspect that will no longer be true in a rather short amount of time. Frankly, I don’t really know if anybody actually uses the UI components for it outside of starting and stopping the engine and for basic configuration of the VM. Everything else that comes with it is just useless cruft for our use cases.As soon as there is a viable alternative (and I’d be happy to contribute to the effort), I’ll be moving away from Docker for Mac."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It took me just a couple of minutes to find the bill in question, read up on it and find that most of the claims made in this article are incorrect.It&#39;s not &#34;rushed through parliament in 24 hours&#34;, it&#39;s been in a process since at least December 2020. The &#39;without a judge&#39; part is strongly misleading:  (5)  If subsection (4) applies, the applicant must:
  
  (a)  provide as much information as the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member considers is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and

  (b)  not later than 72 hours after the making of the application, send a duly sworn affidavit to the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member, whether or not a warrant has been issued.

Subsection (4) is about immediate threats.The AAT&#39;s decisions &#34;are subject to review by the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia&#34; (Wikipedia).https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display....This is just the digital equivalent of a police officer being able to arrest you without a court order."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m most curious about what they mean by &#34;ADDING&#34; data...Does this mean the police can create a social media account in your name? Imagine for instance that they suspect one of your family members of tax evasion. Can they create a fake social media account or email account registered to you, and impersonate you for the sake of entrapping someone else? Like hey uncle, love your new car, got any hot accounting tips? I don&#39;t even see anything in these laws that says the person whose data they&#39;re accessing has to be the target of the investigation.Imagine if at any time in any chat, even with your partner or parent or child, you couldn&#39;t know whether you were actually talking with them or a government agent, perhaps because someone they know is tangentially suspected of a crime - without the matter even being brought before a judge. Terrifying. This is how societies turn into places where everyone is completely fearful of saying anything at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a System76 Serval WS with AMD Ryzen 9 3900 and Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti manufactured last year. The laptop&#39;s internal display went wonky late last week but an external display still works fine. It&#39;s annoying to reboot -- the GPU drivers aren&#39;t loaded yet when the boot disk passphrase prompt is shown, so the external display doesn&#39;t show the passphrase prompt (and importantly: whether unlocking succeeded). It&#39;s within a 1-year warranty for parts &amp; labor. I&#39;m currently talking to with System76 support staff to ship it back for repair. The process has, so far, been easy and straightforward.In the past they had pushed a driver update that disabled the laptop display when multiple monitors are connected. I had recognized the problem since their system drivers are open source and was able to recommend &amp; review a PR to fix [0]. It was nice to see that patch go in.[0]: https://github.com/pop-os/system76-driver/pull/182"</p>

Something that improved them in the last 10-15 years, even incrementally.For example SSDs became much more common and affordable over the past 15 years and their parameters also improved.

Overall it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s in the Wikipedia style and some parts are very editorialized, e.g.&gt; As extreme ironing has branched off, the conditions can gain in extreme activity. For example, a branch of ironing has been developed that includes both bungee jumping and well-pressed clothing. Bungee ironing is what some would call the ultimate in the thrill of extreme ironing.[8]That citation leads to https://averyj12.weebly.com/extreme-ironing.html, which was clearly copied wholesale from Wikipedia (all its links and citations go directly back to Wikipedia).Looking at the history, there have been a lot of edits since that text was added in 2007, so it&#39;s surprising that someone hasn&#39;t rewritten it since then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a long case history in front on the NRLB about whether or not employees can use employer&#39;s resource (ie notice boards, email system, slack) for organizing. In general the rule has been that if employees can use something for general non-work purposes (e.g. setting up a baseball game on the weekend) then the company can&#39;t stop them from  using it for organizing.However the specifics (e.g. what if there is a policy about what topics are OK, but some OK topics are non-work, or what if there is a general work-only policy that is selectively enforced against organizing) have gone back and forth depending on the administration.Apple&#39;s behaviour is probably a result of a 2019 ruling [1] which opend the door to this kind of thing. Given that the administration has swung back to being fairly labor friendly, it&#39;ll be interesting if this gets to the NRLB to see if they find a way to make this illegal.[1] https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/labor-board..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think employer hosted employee activism is just ... always a problem.It&#39;s a minefield, and one with slack where the employer has all that data, what was said, and who... that&#39;s just a mess for EVERYONE.&gt;But that rule has not been evenly enforced. Currently, Apple employees have popular Slack channels to discuss #fun-dogs (more than 5,000 members), #gaming (more than 3,000 members), and #dad-jokes (more than 2,000 members).I would find those more acceptable if I were an employer, even an employee.Edit:  I had a bad typo in this post where I said &#34;employee hosted&#34; and intended it to say &#34;employer&#34; now fixed, thus some of the responses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt;Slack channels for activities and hobbies not recognized as Apple Employee clubs or Diversity Network Associations (DNAs) aren’t permitted and shouldn’t be created.Clearly the solution is to have an &#34;LGBTQ+ and pay equality&#34; channel./s if it isn&#39;t obvious."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In many ways I think this blog post really makes quite compelling arguments and honestly opened my eyes a bit.One (perhaps mad) idea for more secure access to a machine deep behind many levels of NAT where you, the sysadmin, have lawful access but are fed up with having to have a 12 KB ~/.ssh/config file in order to access it because of your university&#39;s overbearing IT department^W^W^W^W network topology, would be to &#34;just&#34; run an onionsite with onion services authentication [1], preventing it being publicly accessed without the pre-shared key. If your onion service just redirects to ssh (presumably with certificate-only auth) I can&#39;t help but think that this is almost an example of security by obscurity done right.[1] https://support.torproject.org/en-US/onionservices/client-au..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had to do some basic sysadmin stuff over tor and I disagree with OP.Two things that failed mieserably, fetching a file that was just shy of 5M, and a reverse SSH tunnel.The SSH tunnel was unusable, it would only last for minutes at the most. I wish I could use mosh but that requires UDP.The file transfer was actually done with curl and the file was often incomplete.This was all done within Europe where we have the highest concentration of tor nodes.So no, I don&#39;t think tor is appropriate for sysadmin tasks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the dissonance comes from the fact that a job is much more than the core activity.When we speak of pottery as a hobby, we think of handling clay, sitting in front of a pottery wheel, choosing a fitting glaze, then admiring our finished work. The focus is on exploring and enjoying the process. You have complete control over the process and you can do as much or as little as you like because there is no delivery pressure. Sounds fun!But a pottery business is a different beast. Now, the act of making the pottery is a much smaller part of the overall workload. You have to deal with marketing, sales, payments, inventory, and communications. Your pottery time is no longer about exploring, but about replenishing inventory or handling custom orders in time to avoid bad reviews. You can&#39;t just make a piece and be done with it, you have to carefully pack it, handling shipping, drop it off, and hope that nothing goes wrong. If it does go wrong, you now have to deal with the fallout and handle angry customers. Most customers are fine, but it only takes 1 irrationally outraged customer to ruin your day.Hobbies, by definition, can&#39;t be a job. You can try to make a job or business that includes your hobby, but it&#39;s a superset of the hobby with numerous other activities that you may or may not enjoy.I do actually know a lot of people who enjoy running businesses. You might say that businesses are their hobby and delivering results to customers is their passion. Not surprisingly, they&#39;re doing quite well in both business and the mental health department. Lucky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first half of the article resonates with me. I didn&#39;t use to have hobbies and I used to feel like a machine just going to work, coming back, sleep, rinse and repeat. I love programming but after writing nth CRUD app in flavor of the month framework / technology, it just isn&#39;t that fulfilling anymore. I picked up couple of hobbies - teaching Sanskrit and playing guitar and my life has improved drastically. I no longer derive meaning only from work. Both hobbies are just hobbies and I do it for fun only with no intention of monetizing them. In fact, I couldn&#39;t monetize them even if I wanted to. Sanskrit is too esoteric to have any commercial value of any kind. And I truly suck at guitar. Nobody&#39;s ever gonna pay me to play guitar. But whatever I can play, gives me pleasure, so I do it. My dad asks me why I waste so much time in useless hobbies when I could be investing that time working towards next promotion and pay raise. I reply to him, they are not useless if they make me happy and content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Doing what you love&#34; is a total new-age garbage scam, only possible because we (most of us on HN) collectively live in the wealthiest, most powerful empire the world has ever seen, and nearly all of the important work (food, defense, fuel, manufacturing, etc.) is done by lower class citizens who don&#39;t know what an API is. Sure, the management of the empire requires critically talented minds, but how many roughnecks know what C++ is, and how many executive vice presidents know how to operate an oil rig?Don&#39;t do what you love, do something that allows you and your family (or you and your community if you&#39;re not up to the task of having a family) to build resilience, and then love your life outside of the work you do to provide for it. If that&#39;s making 200 Gs per year for 10 years slinging Javascript and then getting out of debt with the bank, do that. Don&#39;t worry so much about &#34;loving your career&#34;, I promise you no migrant farm workers harvesting your berries love their career, and yet I doubt they wake up with internal mental crises because they haven&#39;t achieved self-actualization at work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I get older, the less I identify as my current state and the more I identify with the person who transitions through states. My change in perspective has reduced my anxieties and anger significantly. &#34;This too shall pass&#34; and all that. The more of my self image is focused on superficial things, the more I will take things personally. What we are angry about tends to be a reflection of ourselves more than the current state of affairs.If I see myself as a busy professional I might be much more aggravated by someone at the grocery store holding up the checkout line with EBT (since I am busy they must be lazy!). If I see myself as a social climber I will always be worrying if people are using me for something (since I am using them!). If I identify with my wealth I might develop some neurosis regarding the sight of the homeless (since they represent ultimate failure!).I don&#39;t believe in reincarnation but it is a helpful thought experiment to think about what benefits and drawbacks your particular incarnation of life holds and how those might be different if you were incarnated elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have mixed feelings about this.Younger me learned a lot of problem solving skills and most importantly spent a lot of time learning how to read by playing RPGs and games that required lots of reading. My reading skills would not have been as advanced if i wasn&#39;t playing text heavy games that had a lot of plot like Square Enix games and the CRPGs of the time.Modern games though are clearly designed to get you as addicted as possible and to play as long as possible to an extent that made the old school 90s RPGs grinds look tame and mild. (the grinds in those games basically existing to make sure you had to play long enough to not be able to return it to the store or beat it via rental)Modern UX of games is designed so that you dont have to really read or understand the game mechanics even to be able to play and get into that feedback loop. To the point where when a game comes along like Dark Souls that asks you to learn the game systems to beat it, gamers go gah gah over &#34;how hard&#34; it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People talking about the benefits of games reminds me of people talking about the benefits of, say, a glass of wine with every meal: it&#39;s worth looking into but at the same time it&#39;s the sort of thing that obviously doesn&#39;t scale linearly with the amount/intensity of consumption.I similarly have mixed feelings as well, but for slightly different reasons. I&#39;ve read about studies that say that musical training (which is often believed to translate to improvements in other cognitive aspects of life) doesn&#39;t actually correlate to said improvements, and I suspect that the same might be true for games (e.g. solving game puzzles doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you get better at school math or whatever)This line of reasoning is also supported by research on correlation between games and violence (i.e. the consensus is that no such causation relationship exists).All of these suggest (to me) that gaming is just its own activity without much impact on life other than opportunity cost itself.However, there are some aspects of gaming that can affect overall well-being, specifically aspects related to repetitiveness (e.g. grinding). Repetitiveness is something that does come up in a lot of disciplines (e.g. its soothing effect in autist kids, or repetitiveness as tool in the context of meditation, etc).The &#34;addictive&#34; aspect isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing either, IMHO. Games are, almost by definition, supposed to be engaging. But that addictiveness may come in a form of trade-offs, for example, back in the day of grindy RPGs, delayed gratification was basically the entire point of grinding. The one aspect that I think is justly vilified is monetization strategies that tie to addictive elements of gameplay (especially the gacha variety) and this is something that I&#39;d actually commend China for trying to address via regulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: Involved in both KDE (including kde pim and kalendar) and Nextcloud. See bio.* I wouldn&#39;t call Nextcloud codebase old. It&#39;s a PHP 7.3 codebase with sure quite a lot of legacy stuff but a lot of thing has been improved and refactored with the time. It&#39;s maintained, there is an active community and an healthy enterprise behind the project. IHMO  this is that matters more than the programming language used.* SabreDAV supports WebDAV and this is that we are using at Nextcloud for our webdav/caldav and carddav support.* KOrganizer does run on Windows but it require to be built from source. I have been told that a better Windows support is being worked on for the entire PIM suite and I hope that at some point exe can be distributed. Technically there is nothing that makes it impossible to use on macOS, we just need more helping hands to help with fixing the platform specific issues. There is also a modern alternative to Korganizer being worked on called Kalendar. More on it can be learned on https://claudiocambra.com/ (Disclaimer: I was the mentor of this GSoC project)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“ MarkMonitor sells themselves as the domain registrar that does not make mistakes. (…) MarkMonitor is not a cheap solution to this problem, but it is widely used (apparently by &#34;more than half of the Fortune 100&#34;, per the page)“And then:“ MarkMonitor does not have a way of disclosing security issues, which inhibited reporting this to them in a timely manner. They have not responded to any of our communications.”Should anyone be surprised that a company that claims to not make mistakes, but has no way to report vulnerabilities gets their vulnerability on the front page of HN? (And this is a good case scenario, as opposed to their customers being hacked: which could have happened by an attacker claiming some of these domains)Let’s hope they make at least the change of putting a bug bounty program in place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oops. People pay a lot of money to MarkMonitor because their promise is to not make such mistakes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This issue is not entirely the fault of MarkMonitor. While they need to be careful with handling parked domains, AWS is at fault for not being more stringent with claiming S3 buckets. Google Cloud, for example, has required domain verification for years, rendering this useless.This sounds like more of an Amazon problem than a MarkMonitor problem to me. And it makes a good case for using other cloud providers over AWS, as with GCP this attack wouldn&#39;t have been possible. Merely creating the DNS records pointing to the cloud provider&#39;s nameservers shouldn&#39;t be enough for anyone to then claim it and start hosting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classical music is one of the hardest genres to surface through existing music apps.Where an app may have an &#34;artist&#34; field, classical music will have &#34;composer&#34; and then for the performers it will have &#34;orchestra&#34;, &#34;conductor&#34;, &#34;principal soloists&#34;. For an opera all of those are primary fields that could be considered &#34;artist&#34;.The variations of the data is huge, only last week I had to correct Tchaikovsky in my own data and looking at the variations I see online:    P. I. Tchaïkovski
    Peter Ilyitch Tchaikofsky
    Peter Tchaikovsky
    Petr Ilitch Tchaïkovski
    Piotr Ilic Tchaikovskij
    Piotr Ilyitch Tchaikovski
    Piotr Tchaikovski
    Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (this one is arguably most correct)

This is something everyone gets wrong, and yet whomever gets it right is going to help make it easier for people to find and celebrate classical music, and to expose more people to classical music.Even if today you know that you love Beethoven&#39;s Symphony No 3... finding the best performance and recording is almost impossible, and if you do happen to stumble upon it on a streaming service getting back to it later (if it wasn&#39;t the only one in your recents) is difficult.I&#39;m really glad someone is investing in this, and it needs to be a different app / interface to handle this difference in metadata and in weighting of the fields. Capturing the intent of &#34;oh, this person really just wants to search Gould as a principal soloist and weight the search that way&#34; is far easier when you have an app that can provide a classical music perspective and filter over an existing library.PS: Plex does this really badly too... whatever you do, don&#39;t let the Plex Music Agents decide the metadata, Verdi disappeared and had the metadata for Veridia which I believe is a rock band."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Primephonic is no longer available for new subscribers and will be taken offline beginning September 7. Apple Music plans to launch a dedicated classical music app next year combining Primephonic’s classical user interface that fans have grown to love with more added features. In the meantime, current Primephonic subscribers will receive six months of Apple Music for free, providing access to hundreds of thousands of classical albums, all in Lossless and high-resolution audio, as well as hundreds of classical albums in Apple Music’s Spatial Audio, with new albums added regularly.This is utter insanity. I understand acquiring, and &#34;sunsetting&#34; the acquisition when it makes sense, blocking new user signups, and heck I&#39;d even say its pretty cool that they&#39;re planning on releasing a totally separate experience for Apple Music classical listeners.But why shut down Primephonic before this new experience is ready? It just pisses off the already niche and hesitant customer-base you&#39;ve announced you&#39;re trying to court!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most interesting thing about this is that Apple&#39;s pre-announcing that they&#39;re going to be launching a dedicated classical music app. Presumably it&#39;ll be very closely based on the current Primephonic app, and worked on by the same developers.This has some close parallels to Apple buying Workflow and turning it into their now-platform-standard Shortcuts app. It&#39;s still being worked on by the original developers, too.Shortcuts has been given fairly high priority in all Apple&#39;s recent OS releases, particularly as it ties into their home automation ecosystem, and it&#39;s resulted in surprising bursts of popularity. E.g. last years &#34;#aesthetic&#34; complete-homescreen-customization boom was entirely based on using Shortcuts as a hack to customize app icons.It&#39;s been honestly weird to see such a relatively high profile part of the OS being run as a mostly-independent subsidiary like that, particularly given Apple&#39;s notorious control-freak ways. Them expanding the approach like this rather than just cramming it into Music suggests that they think it&#39;s working well for them..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The post title was a tad misleading - I got the impression that it was saying that Godot isn&#39;t ready and we shouldn&#39;t wait for it to become ready. I suppose it got my attention by being like that, and that was the point. Maybe it&#39;d&#39;ve been better as &#34;Stop Waiting for Godot - Game Jam&#34;.Happy to see Terry Cavanagh is trying Godot. I love Super Hexagon and VVVVVV, and am planning to play Dicey Dungeons in the future. Looking forward to see what he makes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a friend who&#39;s been trying to go all-in on Godot but decided recently to switch over to something else, largely due to ongoing issues with its lighting system. When toying with it, he encountered poor lighting overall and some particularly counterintuitive behavior with the (rather simplistic) lighting system.For example, a simple scene with a wall intersecting the floor and a light placed on one side. In this scenario, you get weird light spilling around the edge onto the vertex where the wall meets the ground (see [0] and [1]).  There&#39;s also poor handling of multiple light sources; if you cast a shadow and place a light directly on top of the shadow area, it&#39;s impossible to displace the shadow (see [2]). These sorts of things are very noticeable, and part of the recent work that they&#39;ve just released was supposed to address this. However, these examples came from the most recent release, which made my friend begin considering other options with more robust lighting.[0] https://imgur.com/rsxjV5u

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Would love to see Godot become the Blender of game engines: a genuinely professional-grade tool despite being free and open-sourceUnity, its closest peer, is a piece of crap in a lot of ways. But it&#39;s a piece of crap that has a lot of important features. I look forward to the day nobody ever has to reach for Unity again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of this is because our profession does not have an accepted universal bar everyone can jump over to be considered ‘qualified’.  Every technical interview feels like rolling the dice in proving I am a competent developer.  Giving me 50 minutes in a high pressure situation in an environment i am unfamiliar with and people I just meet will never product my best results, and then add to the fact that I could be asked any question, and my ability to answer is it being ranked against other candidates.  Maybe someone else _just_ did a similar question in another interview and it’s fresh on his mind.  Maybe someone spend their entire career focusing on just this type of problem given in the interview, but the question in the interview is only partly related to the actual job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We made the interview process very simple and traditional in our current organisation. 30 minute chat, judge whether the person can do the job or is a good fit, if yes then offer a year contract with 1-3 months of evaluation period. Changing a job is risky also from the candidate&#39;s perspective so if the person is pretending, the lies will catch up. Most of the scenario it has worked pretty well.Sometimes, people who you think are not capable to do the job, often outperform expectations too. It is all about taking a risk on a person and giving them respect and a chance. We could have done leetcode, or pair programming session. It takes more energy and effort to do it from both sides and probability of finding a good candidate is more or less the same."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very few firms want to hire juniors, while nearly all firms desire senior-level talent.This manifests inflated job vacancies because so many firms have an evergreen job posting for &#34;Senior Full Stack&#34;.  Because talent is scarce these roles rarely get filled (hiring managers expect million-dollar candidates to accept $100-200k compensation).Also, because lots of software requires specific expertise, there are vacancies that can&#39;t be filled because of a knowledge gap (novel industries / projects, etc).  For example, how could SpaceX possibly fill all their engineering roles?  Surely money is not a limiting factor, but rather the limited supply of qualified expert rocket engineers?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Full title too long for HN &#34;French Appeal Court affirms decision that copyright claims on GPL are invalid; must be enforced via contractual dispute&#34;There was a brief HN discussion on the initial ruling 2 years ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24478769 the case just went to appeal earlier this year.Note that the last HN discussion never really happened, it gathered both too many votes and flags in 20 minutes and got automatically hidden, only to be unblocked by a mod later. It would be great if you could refrain from flagging this time, even if the ruling comes as a culture shock to you.I assure you it is not clickbait. The authors of GPL software are really spending years and a fortune in court only to have all their copyright claims dismissed. The ruling passed the High Court (TGI), the Appeal Court and the CJUE."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I think is the real meat of the story:&gt; That is to conclude, by having a contract (a license is a contract), you lose your rights to pursue any IP/copyright claims (the two are exclusive in French law).GPL was written by lawyers for the American system of law and France is not part of the USA. The systems of law are different and therefore the implications of GPL-licensing code are different.I&#39;d be very surprised if France is the only country that treats software licenses like this. The basis of the USA system of law is completely different from even other European courts, let alone non-Western systems of law. Assuming you can write a license for use in the USA and enforce it the world around is quite foolish."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The Rust or Haskell compilers, for example, insist on policing whatever private understanding you might have about the meaning of your code.The thing about &#34;private understandings&#34; is that they&#39;re just another way of saying &#34;we expect ceaseless, flawless vigilance&#34; (as one writer put it), not to mention &#34;flawless communication and training.&#34;Languages which impose weird restrictions tend to do so because it allows them to offer (nearly) ironclad guarantees about something else.There are certain programming idioms that work brilliantly in Haskell. Those same idioms would be utterly miserable in the presence of unrestricted mutation.Or to take the author&#39;s other example, Rust forbids shared mutable state, and it keeps careful track of ownership. But I can freely use native CPU threads without worrying about anything worse than a deadlock, and I can bang directly on raw bytes without worrying about anything worse than a controlled runtime failure. And this remains true even if team communication occasionally fails or if someone makes a mistake.Sometimes I want to rule out entire classes of potentially dangerous mistakes, and not just have a &#34;private understanding&#34; that nobody will ever make certain mistakes.As always, it&#39;s a matter of using the right tool for the job. If you need to write a high-performance, heavily-threaded network server that parses malicious binary data, Rust is a great tool because of those restrictions. If you need to do highly exploratory programming and invent new idioms to talk about your problem domain, Common Lisp is awesome. And if you need to build libraries where everything has a rigid mathematical structure, Haskell is a great tool.In my experience, Commony Lisp is a deeply opinionated language, and its most dramatic opinion is that &#34;your code and your data should have identical representations and structures.&#34; And for the right problem, that restriction is extremely powerful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was younger I used to write a lot of Common Lisp. A lot. And I also had this idea that Haskell/OCaml/Scheme were strict, ivory tower totalitarian languages, while Common Lisp was this incredibly powerful, expressive, liberating tool. For building organisms, not pyramids, like Sussman said. And the S-expressions were aesthetically appealing to me. But at the time I was working mostly on smaller commercial projects and solo open source projects.Maybe it&#39;s cognitive decline from no longer being a teenager, or the experience of working on larger, O(100,000) line codebases with large teams, but nowadays I find a high degree of dynamism just exhausting. I don&#39;t want more expressive power, I want fewer nightmares.A common problem I faced with Common Lisp is I&#39;d write some module, then go on to write another module that depended upon the previous one, and get an exception through from the first module. Usually a type error. And I&#39;d have to go back, context-switch, fix that, and climb back up to the other level.With ML/OCaml/Haskell that is far less common. Being able to look at a module and say, &#34;this is done and it&#39;s correct&#34;, is a very powerful thing. Confidence, rather than safety, is the primary benefit of static typing for me.And I find that I no longer use the REPL. I&#39;ve been working on a compiler in OCaml and for some reason Dune won&#39;t run utop (lol) so I&#39;ve just not been REPL&#39;ing and it&#39;s not been a problem. The code typechecks. Things work on the first run. If I change something, I get notified what needs updating.The problem with interactive development is that it&#39;s like unit testing: it can prove the presence of bugs but not their absence. Type systems can eliminate large classes of bugs ahead of time.Just so this is not entirely negative or depressing: there&#39;s something beautiful about how maximalist Common Lisp is. It&#39;s a big, messy language with every programming paradigm (and you can invent new ones) and different naming conventions in the core language itself. I was learning new things about Common Lisp years into using it productively. And I compared the experience to moving to a huge stately home, that has a room for the piano, a vast attic, a wine cellar, all manner of things, and then trying to move back to a shoebox apartment. Where do I fit the piano? CLOS, the MOP, the Lovecraftian beauty of LOOP and FORMAT: it&#39;s like a wild garden next to the (comparative) spartan minimalism of practically everything else. And it&#39;s beautiful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These &#34;big idea languages&#34; tend to assert a kind of &#34;programming ideology&#34; over reality, and tend to, in my opinion, distance you from the thing you are trying to do, often, they claim, &#34;for your own good&#34; ... &#34;You want to give HOW many objects a mutable reference to this value?&#34; complains the Rust compiler. &#34;Are you insane? You are a Rustacean, you don&#39;t do that kind of thing!&#34;I agree with the spirit of this line of thought: in general I favor pragmatism over zealotry, and I think it should be up to the programmer to determine how a tool should be used, not the tool itself.However when we talk about something like the safety constraints imposed by Rust, it&#39;s more about citizenship than it is about the compiler being overly opinionated.  By baking those constraints into the language, I can have confidence when I use third party code that it reaches at least some standard in terms of memory safety and thread safety.  Much in the same way as a strict type system, those constraints free me up to not have to think about certain types of issues.If I am writing code which only I will consume, I&#39;m also free to use escape hatches to sidestep these constraints when I know they&#39;re not relevant.I&#39;ve written tens of thousands of lines of Rust by now, and I&#39;m still not convinced the Rust model is the right one in terms of achieving its goals, but I think the approach is &#34;reality based&#34; with respect to avoiding some of the problems which can occur while developing software in collaboration with others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After spending years in manufacturing IT, there are hundreds if not thousands of systems like these running, where the company that created the software is long gone.This where you end up with DOS, Windows 3.1 and even Windows NT computers controlling machines that make millions of dollars worth of product, 24 hours a day.We&#39;ve spent hours scouring eBay or industrial auction sites finding parts of computers to keep &#39;just in case&#39;. None of this software virtualizes easily or can even be moved to a machine of similar vintage without relicensing. Some of it is hardware dongles, some of it software keys.It seems like you could create quite a business being able to crack this software. Companies would pay tens of thousands to get these machines running. Often times the &#39;new&#39; version of the hardware and software is $100,000 US.In a few years, internet-based licensing will be the thing to crack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microsoft used to release a &#34;checked&#34; build for each version of Windows on MSDN/Visual Studio Subscription downloads. [1] This was a build with the same compiler optimization settings as the release build, but with debug-build-only assertions and checks included. In the checked build kernel, the system uptime had 49 days artificially added to it [2], precisely to help developers find out problems like this.At one point when I was on the Windows team at Microsoft, there was an internal push for us to selfhost (dogfood) checked builds of Windows, since they theoretically provided better bug telemetry than &#34;free&#34; builds (release builds, which are free of debug-only code). &#34;Slows your dev box down by just half!&#34; was the basic pitch of that campaign in a nutshell.[1] I don&#39;t know if this was ever done for Windows 95. It was done for Windows XP up to Windows 10 version 1511, but it appears to have stopped since then, at least according to my quick search.[2] https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EPILOGUEHere&#39;s the exact point of the crash (cued to 5 seconds prior): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdrRoSdBM5M&amp;t=9778sThe counter overflows/resets, everything wraps around, the system counts 6 more seconds, then Windows 95 freezes.The mouse cursor still seems to work, but the message pump seems to have frozen, to the extent that End Task itself is unresponsive, and a second CTRL-ALT-DEL is needed to reset the machine.---This whole thing started back in July, over here (warning: megathread): https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1413694652822163459"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having used Windows 95 back in the day, I am deeply impressed someone managed to keep it from crashing for so long.I have seen a Windows NT 4.0 system with an uptime of more than five years, but with Windows 95, even a whole day of uptime was pretty close to a miracle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been watching this project for a long time and personally am very excited. The fact that it’s #1 on HN today (congrats!) makes me think I’m not the only one.There are also a lot of valid concerns in these comments about privacy and use of algorithms. A lot of it depends on what you’re looking to gain by adopting a new service/switching away from something else and individual concern.Personally, I’m looking for a place to store personal photos: friends, family, travel etc. Critical needs
- easy sharing ideally not locked into Apple’s ecosystem
- not to have my photos mined for advertising and social graph data (most important)
- ideally around for the long haul but in my mind this is for sharing, not backupI’m not particularly concerned about warrants, government surveillance etc. Again for me this is about sharing so the expectation of true privacy is low. Any photos I considered sensitive I would store elsewhere.For me, the biggest point of confidence I have in this project is that they charge money from day 1 and don’t have a forever free plan. I’m excited about projects that offer the benefits of “social” but where the software, not my data, is the product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The monthly storage costs are too high. For the price of 1TB from you (15€), I can buy more than 2 TB just about anywhere else.Commercially, Apple and Google are both 2TB for 10 CHF and Amazon gives you unlimited as part of a Prime membership. Storage providers like Backblaze and Wasabi both charge around $5/TB and that&#39;s really the table-stakes price. For the more DIY-inclined, Hetzner sells a 2TB OwnCloud instance for 9.90€/month.I&#39;d prefer to buy software from you than storage. It&#39;s out of the question for me to pay you per TB but I&#39;d consider paying a flat rate for software I then host myself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d love for something like this to exist (a fast, clean, well-designed mobile and desktop app for backing up my photos with E2E), but I’d only switch from one of the big providers if it were FOSS and I can bring my own backend target (e.g. S3, SMB, FTP).In a perfect scenario I could generate my own private key to plug into my client devices and just have everything push to private S3 (and then from there  archive to the cheapest, coldest glacier tier after it’s been synced to my home storage).This to me would not be that complicated to build, but would essentially provide E2E Photostream and a backup of last resort in the cloud.Obviously (as is the problem with all FOSS) you have the dilemma of how do the developers get paid, which I’m sure is why you went down this yet-another-paid-cloud-provider route instead of what I’ve suggested above.All that said - I like what you’re trying to build, I could see it being useful to some, but providing E2E photo storage as a direct-to-consumer service is IMHO just asking to be held liable later for what your users store there should you gain any considerable traction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Was listening to Ben Evan&#39;s podcast earlier today and he had a stat from the Apple / Epic trial that shook me a bit - in a given month in 2016 something like 0.05% of Apple users were spending in excess of 450 USD on in-app purchases.  And that was 54% of App store revenue.This is basically addicts gambling.  Its the sort of numbers you see at Casinos and online casinos, and ... i dunno. It saddens me.  Yes the vast vast majority of players have a &#34;bit of fun&#34;, most never pay for anything, but all the profit comes from the addicts.Even in IOS App Store.  Which really did look like it was trying to avoid that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to chat about it, HN, since otherwise I&#39;d just be playing more Genshin Impact.My capsule review of the game nobody asked for: if you like Breath of the Wild, you&#39;ll likely enjoy it a lot. It is not as pure of an exploration game at BotW is, and the emergent game mechanics that made BotW such a joy, a toy which produced its own unique stories with every player, are mostly absent. The exploration doesn&#39;t tie in closely with the plot like it does in BotW.But, other than that, it&#39;s an extremely, extremely effective game. Excellent art and music design; the graphics compare favorably to anything I&#39;ve ever seen in an AAA game if you like this anime-inspired visual style.I find the combat similar to single-player WoW with more interesting strategic choices (regarding party comp, etc) and less interesting tactical choices. Harder encounters are fun puzzles to solve.While the actual story in the game is nothing we haven&#39;t seen done better before, the character interactions are an extremely interesting Chinese take on Chinese/Japanese/Western fantasy tropes. Someone could get an East Asian Studies thesis out of it fairly easily. It&#39;s amusing to &#34;read&#34; with that cultural commentary lens on; the localization is also surprisingly well done (including both English and Japanese, to the extent you credit me with being able to perceive that).The metagame about how to progress as quickly as possible, and where to invest your resources / how to harvest them efficiently, also pushes my buttons very effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Gacha games are named after the onomatopoeia describing vending machines in Japanese malls and arcades which dispense toys and trinkets for, typically, 100 to 200 yen (about $1-$2). The pool of trinkets is displayed prominently on the machine; which trinket you get is effectively randomized. If you had your heart set on a particular one, you might spend much more than $1 on getting it, and some children (and adults!) very much do. Many very successful games have a monetization strategy which descends from a variant of this.I am sorry to say this as someone who usually agrees with &#39;patio11 on everything, but both gacha and the &#34;monetization strategies&#34; inspired by it (be they hawking in-game currency or trying to mine email addresses) sound like a terrible idea.I don&#39;t want gacha, or any of these monetization strategies in my ideal consumption model. I want to look at a toy in the store and buy it while knowing what I am getting. This gacha model sounds like it&#39;s incentivizing gambling from a very young age.Am I too close-minded? Idealistic? Missing some crucial part of the article? I&#39;d like to hear, because nothing seems good about this at the moment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This web page does a terrible job representing the necessary install steps. It looks super combined but can be combined into three or maybe four commands.I think it would be massively helpful if the devs would upload a DEB/Flatpak file somewhere instead of having compilation instructions as the primary install method. Sure, if you run a funky Linux like OpenSUSE you need to follow and convert installation instructions, but for Ubuntu (which the guide is targeting) you really don&#39;t anymore.That being said, on Arch (and Arch-derived) systems you can find this in the standard software store under the name snis-git if you&#39;ve enabled the AUR."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, author here.  I&#39;m a little hesitant to wade into these comments, but I&#39;ll try to answer a few questions I see popping up, and some that I just made up.1. Why do I have to compile the thing myself?Because packaging on linux is a nightmare.  For a long time, Linus Torvalds did not offer linux binaries for his &#34;subsurface&#34; diving program, but did offer them for Windows and Mac.  Now there are linux subsurface packages, but Linus doesn&#39;t do them himself.  If Linus can&#39;t be bothered to make linux binaries, you know the situation is messed up. I figure, if the game is good enough, then someone (besides me) will make packages.  If that doesn&#39;t happen, well, I guess the game isn&#39;t good enough.  And I&#39;m ok with that.2. Why don&#39;t the devs do this or that?&#34;The devs&#34; is mostly just me. I do what I feel like, this is my hobby project that I do for fun.3. How does this compare to Artemis/Empty Epsilon etc.?It&#39;s more properly 3D than Artemis or Empty Epsilon.  It has a much nicer Lua API for making mission scripts than Artemis&#39;s XML based system.  It doesn&#39;t have as many mission scripts as Artemis or EE. It feels a little more &#34;millenium falcon&#34; than &#34;Enterprise&#34;, mainly due to the turret gun, I suppose.  I think the planets, especially the gas giants[1] in SNIS look cooler than anything in Artemis or EE.4. Why does the game design suck?It&#39;s hard to make a cooperative bridge simulator that&#39;s fun at every station all the time. Back in 2012, I heard about Artemis, and thought it was a cool idea, and it seemed like a neat project, so I started working on my own interpretation of the genre. It&#39;s hard to know how things will turn out without just trying it.  It came out the way it came out (so far).  A lot of the fun in this type of game has to come from the participants. With the right participants with the right attitude, it can be pretty fun. Some parties are fun, some are dull. Alcohol sometimes helps.5. Why doesn&#39;t it run on Windows or Mac?It used to run on Macs, but then support for OpenGL on Macs became problematic.  Maybe someone could get it to run on Macs again, but not me.  It will run on Windows using the Windows subsystem for linux, however, the graphics will be software emulated, which is generally not good enough.  Trying to compile natively on Windows would be a big job.  It uses pthreads extensively, and some other various linux-isms here and there.  Windows and Mac were not a priority for me because I don&#39;t have either of those machines, and I was mainly interested in playing the thing with my friends. Besides, Windows and Mac already have enough games.6. Can you run the game remotely, or does it have to be on a LAN?Maybe. I&#39;ve never seriously tried to run it remotely.  I have tried it once or twice, with the server running on a digital ocean server in New York, with my clients running in Virginia, and it worked better than I expected it to.  It does have a voice chat feature built in (added after COVID appeared), and that seemed to work.  But my test was limited to about 5 minutes of messing around, and only a couple of clients.  Each client will require about 100k/s of bandwidth.  This can be greatly reduced by reducing the number of objects (asteroids and NPC ships) floating around in the simulation, but I haven&#39;t really experimented much with running this thing other than on a LAN.7. Will it work on a Raspberry Pi 4?Yes and no.  Some stations will work. SCIENCE, COMMS, and ENGINEERING seem to work alright.  More graphics intense stations don&#39;t work so well (MAIN SCREEN, NAVIGATION, WEAPONS, GAMEMASTER).[1] https://github.com/smcameron/gaseous-giganticus"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is actually better for most consumers. The SLC cache was increased nearly three fold and the controller is a superior one (it now uses the same one as the 980 PRO). TechPowerUp[0] has a much better post on this, and you can clearly see there that the new one is better in most cases than the old one.The only ones disadvantaged by this change are people who constantly write &gt;42GB which I would think are video editors. (The old version would get a speed reduction to 1500MB/s after overflowing the SLC cache (42GB), the new one goes down to 800MB/s after overflowing (115GB))P.S.: Not defending this, just clarifying because most posters here seem to believe it&#39;s a straight up downgrade. Should also be worth noting that Samsung changed the product box, product number, firmware version and the spec sheet for this change. So they&#39;re significantly better than the others who have done similar moves. That said, I still believe that they should have called this the 971 Evo+ or something, as it&#39;s genuinely different.[0]: https://www.techpowerup.com/286008/et-tu-samsung-samsung-too..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work in their SSD vertical on the software side. For what it&#39;s worth, SSD/memory business unit is their pride. They never used to cut corners and do rigorous testing to ensure their customers aren&#39;t screwed over. Even when a bad batch of SSDs were shipped by mistake, they would recall/refund all of them proactively. When ever a new model is released, they would first ship limited units to a set of SSD enthusiasts including gamers in Korea. One such time, there was a BSOD reported by a single tester in some edge case - &gt; they sent a lot of team members in person to chase and fix that issue.So I really doubt they would do anything stupid to get some quick bucks at the cost of reputation.On the other hand, their smart tv division is absolute garbage and employees themselves wouldn&#39;t buy Samsung TVs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reporting is this case is a little dramatized IMHO. As you can read here [0] they actually use the controller from the 980 Pro and more dense NAND, Billy Tallis from Anandtech filled in some missing technical detail. You actually gain performance in the random 4K case, which is important in day to day operations but you loose sequential write speed if you exceed the SLC-Cache of 115GB.This differs quite significantly from WD silently changing the Blue drive from TLC (okay with Cache) to QLC which nets you write speeds lower than HDDs after the cache is full. Crucial did TLC-&gt;QLC on the P2 too, but you could get those drives for 30% less up until a week ago.(edit) forgot to mention ADATA who switched the controller of their SX8200 Pro [1][0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28320640

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very few things surprised me as much as rail design when I was studying structural engineering. Surface tension and fluid dynamics were both trippy too, but I expected those things to be complicated and while surface tension blew my mind due to the relative simplicity of the proof, and fluid dynamics blew my mind because it was somehow 100x more complex than I estimated.Walking into rail design was hilarious. I worked on motorcycles and did some car stuff. I figured it was obvious, and sorta dismissed this assignment as a joke. Nope. My dismissive intuitions were just flat out wrong. It kinda leaves an impression on you to sorta avoid saying you know for sure before putting in some amount of work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another way to think of how this works is to look at crowned pulleys:https://woodgears.ca/bandsaw/crowned_pulleys.htmlIn the train&#39;s case (if we ignore the gap between the wheels), the pair of wheels work like a crowned pulley, and the track finds center like a belt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Motorcycles turn at speed by a similar principle, though the cones arrangement is a bit flipped around.I usually demonstrate it with two solo cups put mouth-to-mouth, to make a pair of facing cones that represents the motorcycle tire.  The starting condition is that you&#39;re above parking lot speeds, and the bike is stable and is dynamically inclined to stay perfectly upright.  To go left, you turn the bars right to upset the stable bike onto the left cone, and it goes left.  To go right you turn the bars left and it upsets the bike onto the right cone, and goes right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better headline - users willing to give up privacy for convenience.Reality - there was a period where the icloud backups created backups that apple did not have access to. Critically, this mean that if you had any of a wide variety of things happen - unless you were very good about key management - your content was lost for good. ALL your photos (which could be heartbreaking) etc.It turns out this is NOT what people want. They want apple to have access to their content, so when they have a device stolen and don&#39;t have a super long recovery key properly saved, they are not hosed.Same issue BTW with bitlocker on windows. People DO NOT save those recovery keys, even if they should. Microsoft added a way to force a backup into an account admins and others would have access to, thank goodness, because otherwise users there would be hosed as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m continually surprised that people can&#39;t seem to understand E2EE. For whatever reason they assume it means a message is encrypted forever and unreadable by anyone.There is zero guarantee from any E2EE system that the data is encrypted at rest by the sender and receiver. In fact in most cases, the data is not encrypted at rest because people want to do silly things like read messages.The exact same vulnerability exists  on every platform that&#39;s automatically backing up local data to the cloud. Even if you disable cloud backups you&#39;re still stuck if whoever you&#39;re messaging has left them enabled.The only meaningful way around this hole when it comes to messaging apps is row-level encryption on the backing store. This has a lot of problems of its own and potential holes when it comes to indexing and searching."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work with tungsten carbide cubes during my PhD thesis. They&#39;re used in multianvil high-pressure synthesis. With the right setup you can reach almost 20 GPa of pressure. Not as much as with diamond anvil cells, but you have more reasonable sample sizes (a few milligrams). And thats still like the pressure pretty deep into Earth&#39;s mantle.I also used the opportunity to snap a neat picture of a polished WC cube: https://imgur.com/C2YiMqb.jpgI always had fun handing them over to students because everyone is surprised by the sheer weight of these things.Tungsten carbide is actually quite dangerous after it has been subjected to a lot of stress (Such as being stuck into a 1000 t press for a high-pressure synthesis). They have the mean tendecy to explode into super sharp pieces when you&#39;re not expecting it, so wear goggles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" &gt; I struggled a lot with deciding to buy a cube. It felt wrong to spend so much money on a featureless hunk of metal.When I bought my cube, I used it as an exercise to fight back against my frugality.But it wasn&#39;t meant to be: it was delivered to the wrong address and I received a full refund.Then my neighbor delivered it to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got one as well, around the same time actually, as a gift. I also fell into a strange fascination with it and find it fun to hold in the exact same ways as the author. Folks tend to get me 1&#34; element (or sometimes non elemental but interesting in another way) cubes as gifts now which works out as it gives a great range of price to choose from while maintaining surprise with the guarantee I&#39;ll enjoy it.I&#39;ve had my sites set on something this size https://midwesttungsten.com/tungsten-cube/ for a while now. (about as much as I would feel safe setting down or handing to people considering the hard edges and chance of accidents) I&#39;ve more than had the spending money to do it for a long time but much like the author I&#39;ve just had a hard time justifying it. I suppose it&#39;s still less ridiculously than what many spend on car hobbies or whatnot. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll eventually get something of the nature.I&#39;ll also add I was extremely surprised others enjoyed it as well. Of all of my desk toys/models/prints it&#39;s generated the most talk amongst friends and coworkers.I&#39;d like to experience a sizeable amount of iridium some day  as well.Edit: One of the most fun gifts I&#39;ve received (beyond the tungsten cube) was a 1&#34; magnesium cube. Apart from being a ridiculous fire/blinding risk capable of easily melting through the tungsten cube if set off it is even lighter than  an equivalently sized aluminum cube."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;One City Hall insider suggests that San Francisco overreacts to issues that are in the national news, and designs solutions to the country’s problems rather than its own. For example, when Mr Boudin ran on his platform of less punitive justice, San Francisco already had one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country. In 2019, 106 adults were in prison for every 100,000 people, one-fifth the rate in California and the nation. If the rest of the country behaved like San Francisco, the prison population would decline by 80%, says James Austin of the jfa Institute, a think-tank that evaluates criminal-justice policies.This seems like a very reasonable hypothesis"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestin things about Ada:- language designer have a document where they explain their choices, the Ada Rationale:
http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rationale12.html- there is an annotated version of the standard, and it&#39;s freely available as the standard:
http://www.ada-auth.org/arm.html- A language test suite was developped at the same time of the language:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Conformity_Assessment_Test...The last point was also in retrospect not sot good for the language ecosystem: buyers wanted a 100% on this test suite before considering your Ada compiler, which means dev had hundreds of compiler bugs to fix and no paying customers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with Ada a lot during the 90s (and even maintained the Linux port of GNAT early on). This document does not address one thing that I am curious about. What does the modern, idiomatic Ada programmer do about memory management? Are library implementers still required to use Unchecked_Deallocation? I don&#39;t see how a language where Unchecked_Deallocation is used can be considered safe at a time when we have modern choices with automatic memory management.Edit: I guess another way to put this is, &#34;Can a non-trivial project be developed in modern Ada without using Unchecked_Dealloation?&#34; Because I don&#39;t see how I can consider a library safe if it is allowed to call Unchecked_Deallocation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went to a college that taught CS in ADA, and I never took CS because I tested out of 101, but I ended up fixing attempts at the problem sets for about half my dorm section (this was okay as long as and they documented it).Well anyway, I found it to be very easy to pick up just by reading, hard to make semantic errors, and easy to modify without breaking things. The pace of learning for the entire cohort, mostly non-CS students, was, I think, much faster than e.g. C++ and possibly more complete than e.g. Python. It’s pedantic and exact, but it uses real english language keywords and modifiers.I went to a different school later where I did the same thing but it was taught in C++. It seemed like many students would get by purely by repeating patterns that they didn’t understand. And I started to catch myself in that trap as well, realizing that I had a lot to learn.But I wasn’t going to be a programmer; I was going to be a theoretical physicist cogitating on the deep mysteries of the universe. Fast forward…. D’ohhhh."</p>

If you want to fix it, you put in legal protections for people to do business, rather than this informal and/or ad hoc regulation through the shifting influence and agendas of arbitrary special interest groups.&gt; The financial and tech industries’ prudishness is unfortunately increasingly reflected in government policy, typically under the guise of protecting children and other vulnerable communities.This is the Guardian getting causation extremely wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case any Discord employees are reading this: please don&#39;t remove the ability for bots to read message_content , or make me jump through verification hoops either. Reading raw messages is absolutely crucial for moderation bots and, well, just about every other fun and interesting bot.I don&#39;t write discord bots so you can type a slash command to do a thing. That&#39;s boring. Good bots can read messages. Discord will be very &#34;not dope&#34; and &#34;not cool&#34; if bots are forced to become a sterilized pick-list of interaction options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always very thankful that we even have people that work so hard towards FOSS libraries to begin with. It must feel pretty bad to receive those responses from employees telling him about the things he should do that are &#39;um&#39;, &#39;easy&#39; and &#39;dope&#39; when there&#39;s clearly been many longstanding feature and communication issues already (as if being the person working on a FOSS library for no compensation in your spare time that empowers a company whose employees&#39; are getting 7-8 figure exits within a few years wasn&#39;t already bad enough).My general pessimism with this situation is how proprietary everything has to be to begin with; the idea of a single company storing the full history of everyone&#39;s messages and interactions is already bad enough without them requiring the government ID of their users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile, I see fleets of user-bots happily chugging along under the radar hoovering up data.  Just like the post author said:&gt; the crux of malicious bots were, and still are, user-bots.Seems almost laughable that Discord is making hoops for legitimate bot developers to jump through while taking little action against user-bots.I suspect that Discord wants to get a chunk of the big money that game bot developers are making, and are pushing bot developers into a more rigid API that will eventually include in-app-purchases.  The article author also said:&gt;  No longer will bots thrive with a sandbox limited only by your imagination, but instead Discord is now the sole gatekeeper of approved use cases. The future of Discord bots relies solely on the interaction system; things have to be explicitly written and supported by Discord employees"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Any user of any Facebook property needs to understand well in advance that the company engages in active psychological manipulation and experimentation on its users and then decide if this clashes with their personal autonomy.Remember them talking about how they engaged in experiments on their users by trying to influence their mood via intentionally showing their various groups different types of content algorithmically on their news feed? Or when they intentionally kept crashing their Android app to see what’s their user retention rate even on faulty software? Or just open up the app on two phones of the exact similar make and model and see the app menu?My personal anecdote and experience with this is that they also use random errors to disguise bans. I have a personal and a dev account which I made the first time I accidentally got banned for 24 hours because it also reset OAuth app keys, the next time I got banned I logged in to my dev acct. and tried to make a post, since they managed to associate the two accounts, I ended up banned on that one, too. But it didn’t say that, it kept throwing random errors as if it was only a backend issue. These disappeared once my main ban was gone.So all in all my point is, people should understand that the platform outright does these kinds of things and use or find alternatives based on that"</p>

I have a game on facebook for a decade, where users sometimes try to send some link to their friend through messenger. FB blocks it every few weeks and users have to beg them to unblock it every time. What a terrible company to invest in"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny how two people can hack two separate home phones to run DOOM without realizing it until after the fact.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Around 10 years ago i worked in a company that had lots of software and physical VOIP phones. One of the models of phone had a pretty nice colour screen on it. I forget the brand .. it might have been polycom.At that time I was very much into nmap&#39;ing everything and noticed that these devices had all sorts of interesting ports open including telnet and ftp. FTP was read only for anonymous but it was trivial to download and crack the passwd file and discover that the admin password was something like 1234. My colleagues and I only got as far as showing images on the screen to surprise people but my imagination was running wild with the surveillance possibilities (let alone doom!).This was one of my first glimpses as how bad security on commercial embedded devices can be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a line that resonates with me, and the one which some negative comments might overlook (3 hours in, at least):  &#34;What can you say in this language that would 
  be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? 
  In the process of learning how to say things 
  you couldn&#39;t previously say, you&#39;ll probably 
  be learning how to think things you couldn&#39;t 
  previously think.&#34;

This is one of the value propositions of language. It&#39;s one of the ways we learn new things, and thus become more capable of doing valuable work as people.Criticisms of this essay in comments so far have seemed to fall into these buckets:  1. Lisp? Macros? Boo. (Not novel/too weird/etc)

  2. Languages are solved, not important; I build systems.

  3. I don&#39;t like the tone of this essay.

(1) and (3) are side points, unrelated to thesis. (2) is the interesting one, and at the heart of what the essay talks about.I&#39;ve always been in the pg camp on this one. Sure, systems are the thing, we can&#39;t be purists, etc -- but saying that languages don&#39;t matter, for us, would be like rocket engineers saying that materials don&#39;t matter.If you&#39;re building a table, you can make it out of almost anything; a table is a solved problem. Wood, carbon fiber, steel.But at the limits of what&#39;s possible, like a rocket, the material&#39;s properties, limitations, and weaknesses in extreme circumstances matter.You can definitely imagine that important things are happening, in the maker&#39;s mind, when they start working with a new material, seeing what others are able to do with it, seeing how the making process is easier, or what steps are unimportant/unnecessary now vs. in their usual materials. And that informs their thinking, going forward, about what&#39;s possible in systems they might build."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smartI think this heuristic fails, with my poster-child counter-example being Nock and Hoon, the languages used to implement Urbit.  Those languages are unquestionably weird, and I think their median user is pretty smart -- you have to be pretty smart to use those languages because they are intentionally designed to be difficult to use.  But I don&#39;t see any merit whatsoever in Nock and Hoon, at least not with respect to giving you any leverage in programming.  C++ is another example.  It&#39;s not considered weird, but I think it would be if it were not so widely used.  Again, to use C++ you have to be smart because you have to know the locations of a zillion and one hidden land mines.  But the appeal of these languages is not the leverage they give you, it&#39;s the barrier to entry.  Once you invest the time to learn them you become a member of an exclusive club.  In the case of C++ at least, being a member of the club gives you leverage and opens up employment opportunities.  But that doesn&#39;t make C++ a good language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting aside the other controversial things that Graham says in this post, I think we could find common ground and have some fun technical discussion by focusing on this angle:&gt; What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others?The first experience that comes to mind for me was XSLT.  Early on in my technical writing career, I needed to convert the Doxygen output of a C library to a more barebones HTML output (so that the reference docs would have the same branding as the rest of our site). I used XSLT to extract only the bits of HTML that I needed and I transformed them into nice, straightforward, semantic HTML. It took me a while to wrap my head around XSLT&#39;s flow but I was amazed to find that a task that would have taken probably 50-100 lines of looping and condition checking could be accomplished in literally 1-3 lines of XSLT.Would love to hear other&#39;s experiences along these lines (i.e. concrete examples)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How do you deal with data loss if there isn’t a perfect match between the data models? For example, if I’m looking to migrate from GSuite to Microsoft Office365 (or vice versa) and there’s not a 1:1 mapping. Or if the behavior of the same spreadsheet formula is slightly importantly different? These are complicated examples obviously and maybe you’re not tackling them yet, but I think I see (at least as an external observer with limited visibility) a lot of the internal teams really focusing on those corner cases where the data loss path and other migration challenges rather than the happy easy-to-automate piece.Similarly, how do you see this service scaling beyond a boutique consultancy or outside of a handful of cases where it’s easy? If you’re successful, do you think vendors won’t do everything to make your access more difficult or cut you off completely? If you see it more as a “we force the vendors we integrate to sign a mutual agreement” kind of strategy, how do you see yourselves not becoming a gate keeper and velocity bottleneck for feature development (ie company wants to roll out feature X and now they need to involve you first so that you can write migrations to …?)It’s an interesting idea so curious to hear your thoughts about the challenges."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wix is an interesting choice.  I remember during the recent feud between Matt Mullenweg (Wordpress founder) and Avishai Abrahami (Wix CEO), Matt said this:&#34;They are so insecure that they are also the only website creator I’m aware of that doesn’t allow you to export your content, so they’re like a roach motel where you can check in but never check out.&#34;So I guess there&#39;s probably demand for a nice export tool there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a $100M SaaS in a different space but the underlying tech is identical. I had this idea ~10 yrs ago when we first started writing our own import logic to move users over from competing services.The engineering challenges to make this work flawlessly is going to be substantial to say the least. I GET from ~70 data sources right now...I couldn&#39;t imagine having to GET,POST, CHECKPOINT and DIFF with all the edge cases that appear.Best of luck but this is a very hard problem to solve.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.htmlQ: I&#39;m a student of visual communications and asked myself why links are blue. I found some answers that might be, for example blue is a color of learning, but I&#39;m not sure what is right. Is there any reason, why links are colored blue ?A: There is no reason why one should use color, or blue, to signify links: it is just a default. I think the first WWW client (WorldWideWeb I wrote for the NeXT) used just underline to represent link, as it was a spare emphasis form which isn&#39;t used much in real documents. Blue came in as browsers went color - I don&#39;t remember which was the first to use blue. You can change the defaults in most browsers, and certainly in HTML documents, and of course with CSS style sheets. There are many examples of style sheets which use different colors.My guess is that blue is the darkest color and so threatens the legibility least. I used green whenever I could in the early WWW design, for nature and because it is supposed to be relaxing. Robert Cailliau made the WWW icon in many colors but chose green as he had always seen W in his head as green.One of the nicest link renditions was Dave Raggett&#39;s &#34;Arena&#34; browser which had a textured parchment background and embossed out the words of the link with a square apparently raised area.[See also https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-hyperlinks-are-blue/ which links to the answer above but also contains a few other references.]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given the author&#39;s &#34;conclusions&#34; about Windows&#39;s influence here, it&#39;s probably worth mentioning that Windows 3.x (including both 3.0 and 3.1) used green for hyperlinks in its help system by default (which was hypertext but not HTML):  https://i.imgur.com/ZjX5xIW.pngGreen hyperlinks stuck around in the Windows 95 help system, and were eventually replaced when Windows 98 switched to Microsoft&#39;s new HTML Help system which defaulted to blue hyperlinks (inherited from Internet Explorer)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mosaic was the first browser I used, and the first I wrote websites for (I still only test in one browser ;) ).Something the article doesn&#39;t touch on is the fact that there wasn&#39;t really such a thing as hex colors like &#34;#0000ff&#34; back then. You could use them, but no one did because they weren&#39;t guaranteed to work properly. There was a list of 256 &#34;web safe colors&#34; that you could use that were the 8 bit palette that most computers supported in VGA graphics (at 640x480 resolution), and then a further list of HTML colors that could be used if the user had a graphics card that could use 16 bit SVGA graphics. Using 24 bit hex code colors didn&#39;t come along until a little later, when computers were likely to display them properly.In other words, links weren&#39;t #0000ff. They were &#34;blue&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ansible is abysmal. I don&#39;t know why anyone still chooses it. It&#39;s a mess of yaml and what feels like a million yaml files that is always extremely hard to follow. Honestly writing some python, or bash is a lot easier to follow, read, and understand. The only thing it has going for it is the inventory system. I wish ansible would die already.The tips mentioned in the article are helpful, but still beyond the initial development of roles, maintaining roles is a pain no one can alleviate. It is the perl of automation. I wish people would stop using it. I&#39;ve yet to start a job where people haven&#39;t regretted going towards ansible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a damn shame it took until this article for me (and it appears some others) to learn about the console and the debugger; those seem like massive time savers! My own biggest helper has been to use &#34;ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK=yaml&#34; wherever &#34;ansible-playbook&#34; is called (https://jpmens.net/2021/03/12/alter-ansible-s-output-on-debu...). It makes the verbose output much more readable and is especially handy for tasks that can spew thousands of lines at ones (e.g. &#34;apt update/upgrade&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m using ansible for some years already. The biggest game changer for me was ansible molecule [0].I integrated it to the repo, where I store my code and it just runs all the test cases for my code. It saved me a bunch of hours of investigation in test environments before I even released the code. Highly recommend to try it even for a small project.Apart of that play with ansible strategies if you have more than one server to apply the role. It really might save you some minutes of a runtime.[0]: https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not entirely defending things but observing that if you are of a view that IPR is basically absurd, &#34;stealing&#34; it may be equally absurd, but rational.After you&#39;ve stolen it, it&#39;s still &#34;there&#34; except for the exclusivity.Chips will still exist, fab lines will still run. Profits have tanked, sure. Innovation is probably stifled but that&#39;s an opportunity loss.There&#39;s a long history of stealing IPR at the state level around the world. States do this, private individuals do this, assets get seized everywhere from time to time.&#39;Sovereign risk&#39; has always to be factored in to any business venture, anywhere. Nobody can possibly have been investing millions in China mainland without knowing this risk going in. At this point, &#34;outrage&#34; is part of the negotiating tactics. Outrage won&#39;t really stop this happening here or anywhere else. Bilateral consequences might? What Chinese assets will somebody seize?The German petrochemical and drugs sector was economically robbed postwar WW1 and WW2 and personally I think somewhat rightly so. Bayer made cool drugs, but also helped the nazi party. Russia and America both took things as expropriation. Postwar, but.. does war make this IPR and asset claim really that much better?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the current course continues this seems likely to lead to a bifurcation of the Arm ecosystem - presumably with Arm customers outside of China competing with incompatible products exported from China based on Arm China designs.I don&#39;t have any insight into the quality of the Arm China team but isn&#39;t one possible outcome that there is strong competition between the two ecosystems. So we could be in an Arms race (sorry!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Apple agrees to make sure the search results in the App Store are based on objective criteria.I cant help but laughed when I was reading it. What were they doing before that?I thought the most important part was the next bit,&gt;The settlement, which must be approved by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, comes as Apple is awaiting a ruling in a separate lawsuit, brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games, which seeks to force Apple to allow rival in-app payment and store options.&gt;The same federal judge is hearing the Apple-Epic case and a ruling could come at any time.My guess is that the way things are going in these cases are not in Apple&#39;s flavour. And for all the court case I followed over years Apple tends to be the favourite in court. Rightfully or not. ( Some of the Judge are very clearly biased ) But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers was clearly trying to get to the bottom of things. And asking some very hard questions.Is this enough? I am not sure if Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is easy to please either. And let&#39;s not forget this is US only. EU are grinding their teeth. Then there are South Korea and Japan. And China is surpassingly quiet in all of these.Phil Schiller was right, if Apple were to ever change its fee structure, that it should do so “from a position of strength rather than weakness”.     It was unfortunate Steve passed away soon after that email."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Developers can communicate directly with customers about alternative payment options. Customers have to consent and be given the right to opt-out.This is a huge step forward (though it falls well short of the ideal case) for iOS development. Having the ability to tell customers about other, often cheaper, payment methods removes a substantial barrier for some apps that have high-priced subscriptions.Positive as this change is, there is still a lot of ground to be won here. I&#39;m fearful concessions like this will work as legal currency in the Epic case, instead of momentum pushing ongoing shifts in app store policy. Can someone with more legal understanding weigh in on that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulations.
It&#39;s not easy! But it can be done. It depends on what your priorities are. Here&#39;s my tips from the time our new baby was born.#1 Set aside time to work
This is the important part, you can&#39;t &#34;work when you&#39;re inspired&#34;. Set aside the 2-3 hours you need per day. At the time I had a full-time job and the baby was born. My partner at the time was a stay-at-home-mom, which helped a lot. But I had duties to be with the baby in the evenings -- feedings, etc. I watched a movie or series with my partner after the baby was sleeping, THEN I went to work when my partner was sleeping.#2 Constraints are important
Because of the minimal amount of time (few hours per day) you have to spend it wisely. In this case, I had a strong to-do list with few distractions. I would work on that list and try to finish a few items (completely) every night.#3 No distractions
No social media was consumed. No YouTube, no instagram, no twitter, tv off. Back in those days these services were just starting anyway, so things were kind of &#34;new&#34;.#4 Motivations
Biggest motivator was my family. Living in New York City was not easy in a nice apartment and a family to support. I knew my side project HAD to work and it DID because I had NO choice. Even with an almost 6 figure job, it would not have been able to do everything, even in 2004.At some point, you have to balance out things. You CAN&#39;t spend all your time with your family.And you can&#39;t spend all your time with your job.You have to have some time for each one. And where people fail badly, is when they spend quantity instead of quality time with kids or work.Believe me, its best to spend less, but QUALITY time with your kids, rather then a whole lot of random time.Your mileage will not vary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; there is an important distinction between “working hard” and “maximising the number of hours during which one works”.  In particular, forcing oneself to work even when one is tired, unmotivated, unprepared, or distracted with other tasks can end up being counterproductive to one’s long-term work productivity, and there is a saturation point beyond which pushing oneself to work even longer will actually reduce the total amount of work you get done in the long runWorth highlighting, for those of you that are skipping through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there&#39;s anyone I&#39;ll listen respectfully to about the value of hard, diligent work, it&#39;s Terence Tao.Reminds me of Richard Hamming talking about his professional envy of John Tukey:One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode&#39;s office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?&#39;&#39; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.&#39;&#39; I simply slunk out of the office!From &#34;You and Your Research&#34;: https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve held for a long time that you must know the rules quite well before you&#39;re &#34;allowed&#34; to break them, and I think this reinforces my opinion on that.Additionally, I think the obsession over &#34;intelligence&#34; and &#34;natural ability&#34; is vastly overstated, in general.  It absolutely helps, and it compounds, to be smart, but a person who &#34;works hard&#34; is infinitely more valuable to their colleagues than a smart person who doesn&#39;t, and tries to rely on raw intellect.My problem, and I wonder if others have this issue as well, is how hard it is to know these things intellectually, and also apply them to my life.  I just cannot, for the life of me, maintain a &#34;work hard&#34; mindset.  I&#39;m still trying, but I very often fail at this, and its frustrating because I know how valuable it is to being good at what I do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if this will be good or bad for the competitiveness of China if they are able to enforce it.The company I work in now has no problem competing with Chinese companies working 996, despite us working 7.5h days and having way more vacation days. I believe part of that is that working longer hours doesn&#39;t necessarily make you more productive, as has been discussed in tech communities for a while now.The thing is, to be productive with shorter working hours requires a very different culture. The company I work in now has a very flat structure, and people are encouraged to work on side projects that can improve productivity, and there&#39;s a focus on continuously improving methodology. The last company I worked for was Chinese-American (based in US, but 99% Chinese working there), and it was the exact opposite. Decisions on what to work on was made top-down and results were mainly achieved through brute force. Although since we worked in a somewhat independent office in Europe we ended up with a hybrid system.So the question is, will a shift away from 996 lead to a shift in work culture that increases productivity, or will they just work fewer hours with the same culture?That seems to be the problem for the CCP in general. They want to make improvements, but they don&#39;t really get to the root of the problem. They crack down on after-school tutoring for instance, but they don&#39;t change the Gaokao system, so tutoring will just go underground."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Chinese myself, I&#39;ve been through a lots of this kind of paper reading club. And yes, you read the law you then you roughly know what is illegal. And clearly, those people in the reading club can read paper text in it&#39;s literal means, so that&#39;s a cognitive pass, congrats!However, let&#39;s don&#39;t forget that you cannot form labor union without blessings from the party. Let&#39;s also don&#39;t forget that in China, company can fire people really easily, they just hide those unfair or even discriminatory reasons under the table, no one will help you because helping people is too costly.There is a labor union in China of course, The labor union, called ACFTU, or All-China Federation of Trade Unions. I don&#39;t remember when was the last time they actually sued someone/company, maybe never.Personally, I don&#39;t think those paper laws and paper institutions are actually there to serve the general public. So I don&#39;t even care what they&#39;ve said, nothing will change for the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once had a chinese colleague who came to europe for a few years. She always thought we were lazy for working so short and every argument i brought up about mental health and work efficiency was met with a: &#34;but it works for us&#34;.What i did not understand back then is the absolute replaceability of personel in the chinese market. You work long and hard or tomorrow someone else does it.Not only is this a big reason of the economical prowess of china in my opinion, i fear that this work-ethic will come back sooner or later to europe to &#34;stay competitive&#34;.In the face of bankcruptcy or market pressure... managers tend to make irrational and/or unethical decisions. And they will find a way to circumvent the laws.
I am also sure that chinese companies will find a way to circumvent the 996 ruling here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at Facebook for some time, and did a bunch of data work. We had this culture of building something, looking at the results between the experiment groups, and then choosing the statistically more successful one -- i.e. a newsfeed algorithm that had better engagement.This sounds great at first, and certainly is straightforward if you want a promotion. But behind the scenes some of us had this thought that our observations only amounted to short-term gains. Although we had small long-term experiment holdout groups, the truth is they were rarely reviewed because it was unsexy.My current thinking is that features like the echo chamber effects from Facebook&#39;s algorithms, Snapchat&#39;s snap streaks, and clickbait like this, all serve to optimize short-term engagement. Yeah, I want to watch that sexy new show or keep my streak going or have my opinions validated. But there&#39;s a diminishing return on clickbait, hollow articles isn&#39;t there? I can only fill up so much time with garbage like that before I&#39;m bored. I can only like so many posts before I feel like they&#39;re all the same. And once my snap streak is broken I hate snapping.The data/engineering/product loops at tech companies favor boosting short-term metrics; The employees are incentivized to do so and this is what they measure, so this is what they build. That&#39;s why we end up with features like this. That&#39;s why Snapchat fell off. That&#39;s why Facebook fell off. And that&#39;s why Netflix feels increasingly stale (despite there being a lot of quality content if you dig)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I quit my Netflix subscription.The algorithm seems to have picked up the fact that I like watching SciFi and Zombie movies, so my Netflix homepage was this dark place filled with Sci Fi and Zombie movies.One problem with this is that Netflix only has a handful of good SciFi and Zombie movies, and I&#39;ve seen them all. So the homepage was filled with movies I&#39;ve seen already, or the dime-a-dozen copycat movies that just rehash some ideas from popular movies in a slightly different way.The much bigger problem is that even though I like watching Zombie movies, I actually enjoy lots of different movies. But somehow the Netflix algorithm only ever shows me this one genre.So I cancelled my Netflix subscription, and went back to occasionally renting a film on iTunes or Amazon. I watch less now, but I end up watching more diverse and more interesting films."</p>

My messages to the modteam are being ignored and Reddit support won&#39;t help because &#34;moderators are free to run their communities as they see fit&#34;.I have been locked out of engaging with the communities I was most interested and active in, for no apparent reason and likely forever.And this is just one of many reasons for why having so few moderators control so many communities, is such a bad thing. Allowing them to operate without oversight or accountability is not helping the situation either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the face of it seems strange why anyone would want to moderate popular subreddits, just seems like a lot of unpaid mundane and never ending work.Younger me might of been excited to do it from the perceived status perhaps.I do wonder how many off-site deals are done with moderators and third parties.  There’s a lot of traffic these people are able to steward and influence I imagine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funnily enough, I was shadowbanned from the only community in reddit that I was active and cared about (/r/firefox) after respectfully complaining about the redesign in 2 different posts. Maybe there&#39;s a threshold of how many times we&#39;re allowed to complain over there?This was my first shadowban and teached me:a) It&#39;s not worth to invest time in these communities.b) To be shadow-banned is extremely insulting, especially if you didn&#39;t engaged in inflammatory or abusive behavior.c) I will not engage in a community that shadow-ban people even if they have inflammatory or abusive behavior, everyone should, at the very least, understand why they we&#39;re banned and learn from it.Thankfully, nothing of value was lost and now I simply don&#39;t care enough about Firefox or Reddit anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in charge of sourcing components for multiple companies right now.  I believe they could double (100%) prices and companies would pay it.  There&#39;s chips that I&#39;m sourcing from obscure places in China just to get the part and paying whatever price they ask.Designers are getting overwhelmed because they&#39;re having to redesign boards for components that are available, only to realize by the time they finish the changes, the part they redesigned for is also out of stock.There&#39;s been some talk of a Chip-induced cold war, and I would say that&#39;s not crazy given the market conditions. I also love the guy who posts here all the time saying he works for the company that makes the machines that makes the chips and they can&#39;t make more machines because they don&#39;t have the chips that go in them.  XD"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Supply shortage is another way of saying demand excess. I don’t see much evidence that TSMC ever really slowed production, at least for their most advanced processes that are in high demand.This is yet another way we’re all forced to pay the price for cryptocurrency. As long as GPUs are profitable for mining, they will be purchased and put to work. The saddest part is that each additional GPU added to the mining networks only makes the overall system less efficient. Mining difficulty is automatically adjusted upward to cancel out the additional computing power. The networks processed just as many transactions last year as they do now, but countless new GPUs have been added to the mining network due to the incentive structure of mining. It’s a race to the bottom, consuming ever more GPUs and energy until equilibrium is reached.It’s frustrating to watch so much of the output of our most advanced chip manufacturing be diverted straight into making arbitrary proof-of-work systems less efficient so someone can capture incrementally more coins. And now we must all pay higher prices for everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. This is specifically mainstream node, or everything except leading edge 3nm / 5nm.2. Those price has been like that for sometime since the chip shortage. They just make it official now.3. The mainstream and social media will and always have been blaming it on TSMC.4. Everyone wants all the capacity they need, while not paying a cent more. This announcement will &#34;somehow&#34; made it fair for everyone in the industry.5. The current component price has very little to do with wafer pricing. As with all commodity pricing, they will only swing back once supply catches up.6. In general I think this is a good, TSMC has been leaving far too much money on the table and benefiting GF and SMIC."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally, I think the web/browsers has churned far too much, and if that stopped happening, perhaps we would get more accessible sites and browser diversity as people &#34;stop looking for new dogs and start teaching new tricks to the old ones.&#34; Of course, Google would try its hardest to never let that happen, since change is its weapon of monopoly.Related: Stop Pushing the Web Forward (2015) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9961613"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should also make caniusebutdoesitactuallyworkThis to refer to my annoyance of browser makers leaving incomplete implementations stagnant for years.As an example, the &lt;dialog&gt; element, a browser-native standardized spec as promising replacement for alert. Except that it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s inaccessible at its core.And nobody fixes it, it&#39;s just left in this broken state forever.&lt;section&gt;, the element that was supposed to cut up an HTML document into multiple outlines, hence making componentized SEO-optimized headings easy and better, do nothing at all.CSS columns, a simple and easy way to distribute text, were unusable for 8 years because Mozilla refused to fix their own small bug. Which pales compared to the extraordinary amount of Webkit bugs that are absolutely never ever fixed.Form controls, since the very invention of them, are terrible. It has cost the world billions, as worldwide every single developer and project has to reinvent some of them, often breaking basic accessibility in the process.I could go on, but I&#39;ll sum it up as the failure to address extremely common real world problems, and to just let broken buggy solutions linger. When you accept a standard and implement it, bloody finish the implementation. Fix bugs. Otherwise, what is the point?I&#39;d call this hardening the web. There&#39;s no reason I can see why you can&#39;t harden it whilst also making progress on new features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another example of this is SharedWorker.Here it is in the standard: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#dom-shar...Safari/Webkit removed it in 2015 (edit: maybe even earlier!) and never reintroduced it:
https://caniuse.com/sharedworkersHere is the apparent reason for cherry picking features:&gt; The implementation of Shared Web Workers was imposing undesirable constraints on the engine. It never gained any adoption.https://stackoverflow.com/a/48193804Edit: Here is the ticket for it’s reinclusion https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149850Turns out it was removed temporarily because of internal architecture changes, and never reintroduced because of lack of adoption. Of course the biggest barrier of adoption is Safari not supporting them, so talk about a self fulfilling prophecy.&gt; This feature was originally removed temporarily during multiprocess bring-up, and actual usage on the web has been pretty low. We&#39;re willing to reconsider if there is significant demand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I manage hundreds of linux servers... from my windows desktop and mac laptop.This will be super unpopular, but Linux missed the desktop boat 20 years ago, and my feeling as someone who at the time built his gentoo OS&#39;s from source, it was the fault of a few things:1) Fragmented gui development. There were too many projects with none focusing on really making a better gui than mac/windows.2) A lack of bread and butter 1st class &#34;business&#34; apps - you know, office. OpenOffice is fine, IF you are ok with the janky ui and no one knowing how it works.3) lack of open source exchange type mail/cal/etc server and outlook-like client). Holy fudge, I tried to get this going and people just crapped on me for suggesting it.4) Until recently, installing on laptops was an absolute crap shoot.5) Just, apps, in general. Gimp is fine, but it has never been close to photoshop. GUI standards are all over the place, etc. People go to a platform because it has the tools they want. The real fallout from point 1 is no one would ever port apps to linux (a little hyperbolic - a lot of high-end post production apps and audio apps all made it over). Open source yadda yadda, thats nice (this is not a brush off, it IS nice), but the ecosystem could be light years ahead of where we are now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone new to Linux from 20 years on a Mac -- what&#39;s the deal with everything being free?Seriously, where are the &#34;take my money&#34; opportunities. I don&#39;t want free OpenOffice. I want to pay $100 for something better, whatever the heck that is, maybe a little less clunky. I don&#39;t want free open source Notes app, I want to pay for something that&#39;s polished.The Linux community is incredibly giving and passionate and it seems like it&#39;s all &#34;free&#34; but sucks up my time. I couldn&#39;t even figure out how to slow the scroll of my trackpad on Ubuntu after lots of digging.Please, coming as a Mac user, take my money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t use Linux b/c it&#39;s the best desktop.  I use it for two fundamental reasons:1. With enough time and effort I can make it do whatever I want it to do (that can be done).2. I&#39;m a Python web developer and we deploy to Linux so it means I only really need to learn one OS (time to learn is in limited supply for me as man who cares about family life).What this means practically for me is that 95% of what the OS provides works the way I want it to.  I have a handful of things I customize and I&#39;ve scripted those (Linux is great for scripting) so it&#39;s easy to apply when I refresh my OS every 1-2 years.It also means I don&#39;t have to do things the Apple way, I can make it work the way I want it to work (within reason).It also means I don&#39;t have an OS that will put advertisements in the start menu (that was the last straw for my family using Windows, everyone uses Linux now).I realize if I was a lawyer and needed Microsoft Office or a designer and needed the Adobe Suite, then I couldn&#39;t take this approach or would need to run a different OS in a VM.  I wish the Linux desktop would be an attractive target for all popular commercial apps to support it.  But I&#39;m not holding my breath, that&#39;s not why I use it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you for sharing. I read this a while back and it still hits me just as hard. My brother passed away nearly 6 years ago and left under similar circumstances to the author&#39;s father. He also left a tattered, and similarly-chaotic journal.I was really torn about reading it at first, but he was the type of person who wanted to go ahead of the pack and clear the path for others. His journal was the last way for him to do that.He was older than me and, reading it years after his death, it&#39;s shocking to see the differences between our lives at the same ages. He always seemed older and wiser, but now -- having just turned the age he was when he died -- I realize why he felt so lost and lonely. Being an adult in your mid-twenties is difficult. I have it easy, and I&#39;m having a hard time. Throw in years of battling addiction and no college education, and you can&#39;t help but feel the entire world is against you.Losing an older sibling is a strange experience. The longer you go without them, the smaller the age gap between you becomes. Eventually, you&#39;re older than they will ever be -- I haven&#39;t reached that point yet but just thinking about it puts a lump in my throat.I&#39;ve considered publishing bits and pieces of his story on a blog, or in a book, someday. Anything that could help people in his (or my) situation feel less alone. Although, I don&#39;t think it would be much help considering his story ended.Not sure why I posted this comment. There&#39;s not much substance here other than evidence of another touched soul."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for this article and hit me really hard. My mom passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago. She was just starting to enjoy retirement and time being a grandmom. Her journals were note books and mostly documents of what she had done in two year of retirement and things to do with the boys. It&#39;s so hard to look at the plans of things to come and what she was thinking of... like the planning of my oldest son&#39;s 9 3/4 birthday in a year because he&#39;s so in to Harry Potter. It&#39;s a unique treasure to see the inner workings of her mind and something I wish everyone got to experience after a parents passing. We&#39;ve left the stack of them out at her house so the rest of my siblings can go through them as the pass through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really moved me. My dad went through brain surgery last year and his four sons converged from around the country. We all barely speak to each other. A holographic will was produced, ten loose leaf pages in impossible handwriting, the last few pages written by him right before he went into surgery while his fourth wife held the pad and guided his hand with a pen. I wish we had conducted ourselves with grace, but two of my brothers are lawyers, so we&#39;re shouting at each other in his house while he&#39;s having a full craniotomy. Luckily he survived and is back somewhat in his faculties for now, and seems cognizant that he doesn&#39;t want to leave this strife behind between his wife and his kids. But this still made me choke up because there&#39;s not much anyone can do. I think about my dad&#39;s regrets and his father&#39;s and see them repeated in myself and my brothers. None of us knows what we&#39;re really doing, do we? We&#39;re all trying our best to pretend we have some control."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Agreed on all points.Interesting to see this:&gt; You can argue that all of this has existed for a very long time, back from the days of all kinds of toolbars and extensions that created multiple levels of address bar nesting in your web browser and taskbar.What I find ironic about the whole situation is, back then it was universally known that those toolbars and extensions are distributed by assholes. The whole software category was called by various pejorative names - &#34;adware&#34;, &#34;spyware&#34;, &#34;malware&#34;. There was a whole ecosystem of tools and tricks to get rid of them, as well as preventing them from being installed in the first place.Something weird happened over the past decade. We find ourselves in times where most mainstream software from renowned companies should be, by the standards of the toolbar era, classified as malware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is globally so true, but there is a major error:It is not &#34;needs of developers&#34; the problem, but the &#34;needs of product manager,  marketing, c-level asshole&#34;.Like for telemetry, most of the time the business side &#34;can&#34;, so they do.And again, for specific app and co, most developer would complain and not like release such user-hostile software but  they are forced by business to do it.Like this stupid project manager that thinks that his product/software is the most important in the world and there is no reason why a random user would not want to install it and also that the user computer belongs to him and to the company because he is using the product, without shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, I just ran into this. I work on a product that has a 3rd party API so other people can write plug-ins to extend the functionality of the app. It&#39;s great for users and developers. We received a bug report related to a particular plug-in, so I went to download their demo to see if the problem was on our end or theirs before contacting them. Here&#39;s how the process went:1) Go to their website and click &#34;Download&#34;
2) Prompted to enter email address with no way to opt out. Shit. Go to mailinator.com and create a fake email address to enter. Enter it.
3) Wait for them to send the real download link to my fake email.
4) It came in almost instantly. Great! Click on the link.
5) Click to download the installer package. Wait a few minutes.
6) Run the installer package.
7) It needs the same email address and password so it knows I&#39;m a &#34;legitimate user&#34; just to install the thing.
8) After entering it, it kicks me back to the web page for some reason. No idea what it&#39;s looking for or what I&#39;m supposed to do on the web site, so I go back to the installer. Oh it&#39;s not an installer. It&#39;s an installer installer. It&#39;s going to download the installer I want from a list of dozens of possible installers. Download the real installer.
9) Run the real installer - It lists dozens of products. Find the one I want. Install it.
10) Prompted for email and password again.And keep in mind this is all before I&#39;m actually a customer. I haven&#39;t paid anything and am trying to evaluate the software to determine if it fits my needs. (Or I would be if I were an end user.) Honestly, if this weren&#39;t for my job, I would have given up on step 2. Fuck these people. I&#39;m trying to save them time by seeing whether the bug is ours or theirs, but they&#39;re actively wasting mine and everyone else&#39;s who downloads this crap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is this not fraud?If you as a company source a device for reviewers and then change the specs in a way that you do not communicate, that is intent to defraud.If you bought a corvette because all the car reviews said it went 0-60 in 5 seconds, and then you buy one and it takes 10 seconds to do the same thing, you’d have a pretty good argument - especially if everyone else experienced your same situation.I’d be surprised if a class action suit or FTC investigation doesn’t happens within the next year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very happy to see that Sailfish keeps shipping because more alternatives are always good.I tried to use it a while ago (Sailfish 3) but was driven off it because of the huge gap between the marketing and the actual reality.The claim that they are privacy and security focused was total bogus (and perhaps someone can comment if it still is).To use the phone features, a Jolla account is needed, so it will &#34;ping home to Jolla&#34;. Privacy policy is pretty standard, so they reserve the right to track you all they want and of course, this is tied to your license, payment method etc. So much for privacy focused...What fully drove me off was that they launched full disk &#34;encryption&#34;, but the LUKS encryption-key password they used was the user&#39;s numeric pin (4-8 digits long). So encryption keys could be bruteforced by a kid and they seemed to be fine with it (I don&#39;t know if nowadays it supports a passphrase).Then I also learned that apps in the &#34;app-store&#34; were not signed in any way so impossible to certify that what you are installing is actually coming from the app repository etc. the phone was just lacking basic security all over the place.I hope they are closer now to closing the &#34;gap&#34; between their marketing and the reality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Sailfish on a Sony Xperia XA2, as well as an iPhone and Android phone.The Sailfish UI far outclasses those other two. It&#39;s simple, consistent, and pretty. That&#39;s all one can ask for! And it&#39;s familiar Linux underneath, with easy access through SSH - no rooting required. This is the phone that everyone else wants, whether they realize it or not...In comparison, I find iOS annoyingly inconsistent and obtuse. Android is straightforward, but feels like a step backward.I just wish Jolla had bigger investors, and more developers. It&#39;s really a breath of fresh air in the claustrophobic (and increasingly dystopic) mobile landscape..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m confused. Where does this say the vaccine is mRNA? The Valneva VLA15 website explicitly states &#34;VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine&#34; [1], and the linked press release calls it a &#34;investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine&#34;. Does nobody actually read these things?See [2], &#34;Subunit Vaccines&#34;.[1] https://valneva.com/research-development/lyme-disease/[2] https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/vaccine-types"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prepare to read the headline &#34;mRNA vaccine trial for &lt;...&gt;&#34; a lot in the future. My guess is that they are going to produce mRNA versions of basically any vaccine (and then some) in the future. The nice thing about the technology seems to be that you only need to exchange the mRNA payload while the surrounding delivery method can be reused. That makes it not only a fast method to create a vaccine but a very convenient way as well. Nice side effect might be that for the next pandemic, we might have doses for everyone ready at the moment the trials are done.
Take that with a giant grain of salt because I&#39;m not in the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually had Lyme disease when i was younger. Curiously enough, i didn&#39;t get the somewhat common rash after the tick bite, but instead it was discovered later, as a part of blood testing. I was submitted to that after my relatives had concerns about how lethargic i was being, as well as because i was experiencing joint pain, which the blood test later seemed to confirm.If i recall correctly, i was given antibiotics and felt pretty bad for a month onwards, though nowadays i&#39;m not aware of any lingering long term effects, apart from maybe my short term memory being slightly worse than i&#39;d expect it to. Of course, i think that in my case i had it pretty easy, since some other folks are known to develop symptoms that are considerably more worse. Whether there will be any lingering consequences in my future because of it, only time will tell.A vaccine would definitely be welcome, especially because of how common ticks are here in Eastern Europe - any walk in the forest might end with more than one of them on your clothes. If you have dogs, you&#39;ll probably have to remove dozens of those from their fur every summer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wrote the ad. Holy cow, I didn&#39;t expect to be #1 on Hacker News. Will answer any questions.Here&#39;s one you might ask: Why? I&#39;m pushing 60 and I&#39;ve attempted to interview for developer jobs over the last year. Got nowhere despite 40 years of experience. Getting really, really tired of this industry&#39;s attitude toward people like me.Based on questions below, I&#39;ll give a bit more. Earlier this year I had a personal referral into Facebook for a developer position. They do hiring centrally. A very young person in the HR department spoke to me, put me in the central database, and apparently shopped my experience around to a number of different groups. No takers. No one wanted to interview me, so the application died. Never did a tech assessment.So now I&#39;ve started a new group, and I expect this thing is going to generate a lot more money than any work at Facebook ever would. So Facebook did me a favor. Still, it rankles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I naively moved from New York to Silicon Valley when I was 52. Not saying there isn’t age discrimination in NYC, but here it’s a nightmare.The drop in my interview track record since  my 40s is stark. 2 years ago, after 6 months during which I failed to get 6 jobs for which I interviewed, I made it to the final round for a position at a startup and was subjected to the usual all-day grilling. The CEO was an older man and the hiring manager was in her late 40s, but all the other interviewers were in their early 20s. I left convinced I had nailed the interview and feeling optimistic. On the way home, the hiring manager, bless her soul, took the unusual step of calling to tell me the team had overruled her own enthusiasm for hiring me and she felt terrible about it. Without saying it in so many words, she made it plain it was because of my age.The age discrimination here extends beyond getting hired. I’ve been subject to cruel jokes and shunning in the workplace that, were I in another disenfranchised group, would be labeled workplace harassment and likely subject to strong discouragement by management at the very least.Some people in these comments ask the source of the age discrimination as if they are skeptical and astonished, Astonished!! such a thing could be going on. They look for a rational explanation. Here’s the explanation: we are tribal animals. From young people’s perspective, they are “Us” and we olds are “Them.”Sometimes young people are conscious of their hostility toward us and sometimes not, but that’s it. It requires no explanation more than that.It’s traumatic to be subjected to treatment like this, to the point I have stopped looking for a job. Humans are not built to tolerate constant social rejection, and it’s more important for me to be alive than to be wealthy. I’ve withdrawn from the tech world and started a business that will not make me and my family wealthy, but will support us, albeit with modest means.I hate the fact that I have become a bitter old man at 57!! I hate that Silicon Valley has come to this!!I’m working through my bitterness and will get over it someday. And I will have the good fortune to leave this dystopia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The hiring process is in the form of a paid, short-term consulting gig that will lead to a full-time offer if we like you and you like us. We&#39;ll give you some tasks, you&#39;ll get them done, and then we&#39;ll talk. No need to quit your day job to do this gig; we&#39;ll work around your schedule.Interesting. I look forward to hearing if this works out long term. I&#39;d be worried about legal implications of something like this but IANAL."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This are beautiful.I had a go at doing roughly the same thing a couple of years ago [0]. It was mostly straightforward, but the part I really struggled with were rendering the sea. The encoding of OSM coastline is quite quirky [1]. When the edge of the rendering intersects with the coastline it&#39;s very tricky to compute which side of a coastline is sea and which is land. As an example - how would you render this [2]?I wasn&#39;t sure how I could solve this, so I wrote up a more abstract formulation of the problem here [3], and asked for help. I think the proposed solution make sense, but I think I would have to implement it by rendering individual pixels and wouldn&#39;t be able to lean on a higher level graphics library.I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how the author solved this problem.[0] https://twitter.com/willsewell_/status/1172523752699113473[1] https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:natural%3Dcoastline#...[2] https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/22.0330/88.8819[3] https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1104642/im-s..."</p>

A course I do each 6 months that just gets me to run something for an hour (from astronomy to 3d-printing).I know i could do it myself but the 10 -20 hours spent on each install wasted though bad configs seems something I would happily pay to avoid.[#] Not a &#34;re-education&#34; camp.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge fan of Readability Mode and use it often.  It&#39;s proof that Web design isn&#39;t the solution, Web design is the problem.For those who are using e-ink devices, or even just standard tablets, EInkBro is another immensely useful tool.  Yes, it&#39;s a standalone browser, not a mode on Firefox, Safari, Vivalti, etc.https://github.com/plateaukao/browser(Available through Google Play, F-Droid and other sources.  Android-only, sorry iOS fans.)What it offers over standard browsers is that it&#39;s optimised for e-ink displays.  That is, it favours pagination over scrolling, runs to full-screen, can easily adjust font size up or down (no more itsy-bitsy-teen-weenie-yellow-polka-dot HN fonts), bold text, and has its own reader mode as well.Even on a standard tablet, some of these features are a huge step above and beyond the mainstream browsers.The feature-set is limited, some of the UI is a bit rough, and a few things are just plain broken (if you need to edit entries in the JS or Cookie enabled/disabled sites ... you have to delete all data and start over again).That said, my usage is evolving from sending individual pages to EInkBrow when I want to do long-form reading, to using it at least part-time as a primary browser.  (Mozilla Fennec Fox is my first choice, still.)  The browser is stable and very much usable despite this.  The developer is responsive to requests and bug reports.What&#39;s most refreshing is that the design principle is readability of Web content, as determined by the user, and not by the page author or publisher."</p>

The voices don&#39;t sound human so it takes some getting used to.On linux the voices just sound more harsh. To the point I don&#39;t want to use it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a powerful piece that resonates with my own experience. I went through a period of severe burnout that took me a couple years to recover from. One of my later insights was that burnout doesn&#39;t merely entail working too much (although that&#39;s certainly part of it); burnout often involves pouring too much of your heart and soul into something that does not love you back. I describe burnout now as a kind of &#34;unrequited love.&#34;So many of us go above and beyond for our companies/projects/teams/whatever. The author here describes overcommitting at work. We might have the best of intentions, but at some point, we don&#39;t see the returns we yearned for and start to question what all this self-sacrificial giving is for.  That is when burnout really sets in. I&#39;ve had friends burn out while working for hostile or indifferent managers, startups that are trending the wrong direction, companies that engage in illegal or unethical behavior, etc.A second insight was that burnout can play a positive role in our lives. It&#39;s like a circuit breaker that trips to protect us from a damaging situation. When we feel burnout coming on, it&#39;s a warning to pay attention to an important misalignment in our lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This person understands what actual burnout is. You get really seriously fried, like &#39;can&#39;t function in any sense&#39; fried. The references to &#39;you have to decide what we&#39;ll watch on netflix because I literally cannot choose a thing&#39; rang very true to me.I generally needed more than a couple months but less than a year, and the removal of whatever it was that I&#39;d burnt myself to a crisp trying to control. Over my lifetime that&#39;s been everything from overcoming homelessness, starting a business, transitioning the business to Patreon, trying to have a relationship: it&#39;s been a lifelong process of learning that I can&#39;t have things (even very desirable things) just by pushing harder to earn them. Quite often I just have to give up and not have the thing.The more I learn that, the less I&#39;m riding the edge of burnout.:)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, I&#39;ve started feeling like I&#39;m close to burnout. But quitting doesn&#39;t really seem like a helpful option.Could I actually take months off recovering? No. I&#39;d have to immediately start leetcoding and remembering what all those trees are for so that I could become employed again later on. And risk having to take a job that pays way less than before.Which brings me to my main point: I don&#39;t see an option where the work ever actually truly ends. There&#39;s always more. Always things I need to be doing. And until I have enough to retire, I have to keep grinding.Vacation doesn&#39;t help. It just puts me farther behind."</p>

So stupid… at least CC merchants can blame chargebacks or something.I guess it’d help if laws were clarified, in the UK where they are  based as well.Maybe we’ll find out if something changed soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone think this was a failed pivot from the p0rn and the backlash was so great that they backpedaled?It actually reminds me of Ebay. Ebay became big with online auctions but as soon as they did they seemed to want to no longer be in the auction business. Instead they wanted to be in the online retail business. Maybe because there was more money per customer. Maybe because online retail was larger. Personally I always found Ebay&#39;s retail move to be weird and off-brand with a subpar user experience.Something about this Onlyfans move just doesn&#39;t sit right. Like who were the banks or payment processors that supposedly forced this? I haven&#39;t seen anyone claim responsibility (officially or not)."</p>

Ask any AV company how their detection works, and it will include a variation on this.This same tech can (and will likely) be used to find the owners of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency wallets, honeypot tokens, community identities, and to provide profiling information to the company&#39;s political masters. The collisions in the hashing scheme mean that you can insert anything you want onto peoples devices and get them pulled into the legal system once it is flagged, where the process itself is the punishment. The whole scheme is too stupid to ever have been about reason, it&#39;s just pretexts and narrative, and this is as good a time as any to exit their ecosystem.Apple really picked the wrong time to attempt this, as I do not see anyone who understands how evil this is ever forgiving them. The most charitable thing I can say about it is that they&#39;re probably just doing it as part of a deal to avoid anti-trust plays, where Apple plays ball with the feds and its parties, and the storm just magically passes them over. The good news is running OSX made me lazy, and getting back into running a linux or freebsd laptop again is going to be fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;So what happens when, in a few years at the latest, a politician points that out, and—in order to protect the children—bills are passed in the legislature to prohibit this &#34;Disable&#34; bypass, effectively compelling Apple to scan photos that aren’t backed up to iCloud? What happens when a party in India demands they start scanning for memes associated with a separatist movement? What happens when the UK demands they scan for a library of terrorist imagery? How long do we have left before the iPhone in your pocket begins quietly filing reports about encountering “extremist” political material, or about your presence at a &#34;civil disturbance&#34;? Or simply about your iPhone&#39;s possession of a video clip that contains, or maybe-or-maybe-not contains, a blurry image of a passer-by who resembles, according to an algorithm, &#34;a person of interest&#34;?What I don&#39;t get is what prevented these things from happening last month?  Apple controls the hardware, the software, and the cloud services so the point at which the scanning is done is mostly arbitrary from a process standpoint (I understand people believe there are huge differences philosophically). They could have already scanned our files because they already have full control over the entire ecosystem.  If they can be corrupted by authoritative governments, then shouldn&#39;t we assume that have already been corrupted?  If so, why did we trust them with full control of the ecosystem?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very well-written post. Ever since this program has been announced I have struggled with talking about the implications succinctly.Online, I never know if an interlocutor is even arguing in good faith, but even in person it&#39;s difficult to balance talking about all the ways that the claimed safeguards are meaningless, how the benefits don&#39;t really make sense, how this is markedly different from other infringements on privacy with the need to be concise and explain that the real problems aren&#39;t just theoretical because similar invasions of privacy are killing actual people around the world already.Anyway, I think the only practical way that this could resolve well, is if Apple saw a precipitous decline in its iCloud brand, then it could be argued that they had to abandon this plan for purely business reasons. A serious movement to abandon Apple services ($17.5B revenue in 2021 q3), might empower the people within Apple who opposed this reckless plan from the beginning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s been frustrating watching the Spotify (and general movement) with podcasts fragmenting and going exclusive. Spotify won with music because it improved upon the existing state of listening to music and offered a free or cheap solution that was even a compelling alternative to piracy.Podcasts for the most part were in the ideal state for consumers, almost always free and mostly client independent distributed w/ RSS. I don&#39;t think there is much of any argument that Spotify can improve that state for consumers by taking a podcast exclusive. These deals are just payouts for the hosts not investments that make the shows better. Most even very successful podcasts likely have low opex (some exceptions like NYT Daily) and don&#39;t benefit from a big pile of cash.On a different note regarding the Rogan Deal, Spotify took ages to add video streaming support on Apple TV (main way I would catch Rogan) which basically caused me to quit casual watching. They also only recently added offline playback for Apple Watch and even then it&#39;s premium exclusive and requires manual downloading of eps. I don&#39;t understand at all why an enormous company like Spotify is so neglectful of the entire apple ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hearing &#34;Exclusively on Spotify&#34; on any podcast ad is a sure-fire way to make sure I never listen to an episode. One of the great features of podcasts is the flexibility in listening platform and I&#39;d really rather not switch to Spotify&#39;s substandard user experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spotify is just not set up for long-form video content. The discovery aspect of YouTube is one reason why it reels you in. You&#39;re scrolling through your feed, you see an interesting clip, and you click on it. Another big part of YouTube is the comment section. Spotify lacks on both fronts. I also think the JRE clips were a big part of what sucked people into watch full epsiodes. If a 5-7 minute JRE clip were interesting I might jump in and watch the whole episode. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve done that or done it as well on Spotify."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the author is on here - reckon you could beat up on simple random tokens a _little_ bit more? In particular how easy they are to identify and prevent leaking (easily fixed by adding a prefix).I work on secret scanning at GitHub. When token issuers use easily identifiable formats for their tokens we can easily spot them when they&#39;re accidentally committed. We can then work with the token issuer to automatically alert them of those leaks. A good example is AWS - if you commit an AWS key and secret to a public GitHub repo we will tell AWS about it and they will tell you about it (and quarantine the exposed keys) within a few seconds. We work with dozens of other token issuers too, though - some of the latest we added were Linear, PlanetScale and Ionic.The above relies on tokens being identifiable - we can&#39;t send hundreds of partners everything that looks like 32 hex chars. In future we want to be able to do even more sophisticated things, like ask users for confirmation before the push code that contains secrets. We recently changed our own token pattern for that reason.GitHub secret scanning program: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/secret-scanni...GitHub&#39;s updated token format: https://github.blog/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentica..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great.One thing that&#39;s worth remembering about randomly generated tokens is that it&#39;s important to always use safe comparison methods when comparing them to the stored one - otherwise you could be vulnerable to timing attacks.In Python you can use secrets.compare_digest(a, b) for this: https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.compa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post reminded me a little of https://blog.thea.codes/building-a-stateless-api-proxy/ from 2019, an absolutely brilliant hack that attempted to make up for GitHub&#39;s lack of finely-grained API tokens.The key idea there is to build your own custom proxy for the GitHub API, then issue tokens for it which are actually encrypted bundles of the full-permission API token plus a set of rules about what the proxy should allow it to do - only allow a GET to paths that match &#34;/gists/.*&#34; for example.It&#39;s somewhat similar to Biscuits storing a Datalog program &#34;to evaluate whether a token allows an operation.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was at IBM 15 years ago, IBM was far from being a monopoly, since there were plenty of competitors in the hardware space (HP, Sun, Dell, etc) and in the software space (Oracle, SAP, etc.) and in the Services space (Accenture, PwC, KPMG, etc.) employees still had to complete annual legal training that was very similar to what was described in the post.Any large company with half-way competent legal counsel is going to tell their employees not to say, &#34;our goal is to crush our competitors, dominate the market, and hear the lamentation of their women.&#34;  Instead they will tell their employees to focus on making life better for their customers.   It&#39;s a much healthier way for product managers to focus, and what you might do if the goal is &#34;crush/dominate the competition&#34; is *not* the same than if the goal is delight the customer.   So it&#39;s not just a messaging strategy to prevent embarassing e-mails from coming out at trial; it&#39;s a business strategy, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such an uncharitable interpretation of the training materials. The material there is not saying &#34;if you want to speak about things that raise antitrust concerns, use this coded language&#34;, it&#39;s saying &#34;don&#39;t do these things, and just focus on building a good product&#34;.Like, the thing here that really boggles my mind: if the training materials had said literally the exact opposite of what they do: &#34;crush the competition, find ways to prevent competitors from competing fairly with us&#34; etc. — someone like the author would write an article vilifying them. (And rightly so.) So the company instead says &#34;focus on our product; competition is good and okay&#34; and … they&#39;re vilified for it. Damned if they do, damned if they don&#39;t.By this article&#39;s twisted logic, any company focused on their product is just engaging in newspeak for thinly veiled anti-competitive behavior. Or is it just if Google does it?(It kills me to argue this, since I think normally these threads/articles spawn good debate about the size and scope of FAANG. But… this one is ridiculous.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is about being careful what you put in writing, because the discovery process for lawsuits will find your carelessly written email and opposing lawyers will take it out of context, and do you want to end up in court years later explaining what you meant?Google has so many employees that they need training to limit the damage from random chatter and speculation.It’s more cumbersome to have to talk about some things via video chat, but it’s not about limiting thought."</p>

The edge cases requiring immediate human attention are still too frequent for the human safety driver to be remote, as is the case in Phoenix.Also, just a reminder that Waymo in Phoenix is nowhere close to being level 5, since it is still heavily geofences and requires those remote safety monitors. I still think that true level 5 (i.e. ability to drive autonomously everywhere with zero human oversight with a safety record equivalent to the median human driver) requires AGI.

If they can nail it there, that&#39;s 2/2 for busy, urban street driving (SF) and &#34;boring&#34; suburban driving (Chandler, AZ). They&#39;ve been quietly very confident of their tech, but this is a real test.Tangentially, I&#39;ve also noticed that Waymo has picked up pace ever since the recent leadership changes. They are publishing more blog posts, offering more insights into their tech and generally seem to have increased their PR game. I wonder if that was a mandate from Alphabet leadership to show some urgency."</p>

Already since recent iOS versions have started popping up an alert to grant access to local network resources per app, I&#39;ve noticed this popping up on several apps that have no business mapping and fingerprinting my LAN. Including the Facebook app.It&#39;s weird how a company can be so internally disconnected. This entitlement is a good privacy-preserving hurdle to prevent scummy apps from interfering with your local network and fingerprinting you.

I was starting to suspect no actual humans other than the developers and the managers work at FFANG at all given how hard it is to contact them. Perhaps in this case it is not a human either but a neural network of a sort.Anyway, I believe everything should be done this way, through communicating with humans. Humans should study every ad and every app before it gets published (but I support side-loading for users willing to opt-out), humans should review every video before it gets de-monetized or removed, humans should communicate on every appeal. I would vote for a law mandating this.PS: The more news of this kind the more I feel like buying an iPhone perhaps. I don&#39;t like how they restrict the users but I bloody adore how they restrict the apps (with exception of some cases like iDOS, terminal apps, alternative-engine web browsers etc - I certainly don&#39;t like Apple banning them)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, this is about Bonjour, which is pretty cool. David Abramson and I released a multiplayer Horse Racing game, called PocketJockey on iOS 2.1. During game play each device would play its local copy of the William Tell Overture. We used packet latency to synchronize tracks. You would then bounce up and down as though you were a jockey. If you bounced in time to the music your horse would go faster. There was an announcer that would announce the status of your horse, which was also in synch. Up to 4 players could be playing in the same room with the exact same music and announcer emanating from their pocket. All on the original iPhone. To use an overused term, the experience was &#34;magical&#34; That&#39;s what you can do with Bonjour.So, what&#39;s the attack vector? A back door, perhaps? Bonjour requires a user approval dialog. A misleading title of the dialog may allow someone to connect. Maybe extract private data.Imagine a peer-to-peer chat app. Say, in Hong Kong --  during a protest. Or in Kabul -- during an evacuation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well... we have 3 node MongoDB cluster and are processing up to a million trades... per second. And a trade is way more complex than a chat message. Has tens to hundreds of fields, may require enriching with data from multiple external services and then requires to be stored, be searchable with unknown, arbitrary bitemporal queries and may need multiple downstream systems to be notified depending on a lot of factors when it is modified.All this happens on the aforementioned MongoDB cluster and just two server nodes. And the two server nodes are really only for redundancy, a single node easily fits the load.What I want to say is:-- processing a hundred million simple transactions per day is nothing difficult on modern hardware.-- modern servers have stupendous potential to process transactions which is 99.99% wasted by &#34;modern&#34; application stacks,-- if you are willing to spend a little bit of learning effort, it is easily possible to run millions of non trivial transactions per second on a single server,-- most databases (even as bad as MongoDB is) have a potential to handle much more load than people think they can. You just need to kind of understand how it works and what its strengths are and play into rather than against them.And if you think we are running Rust on bare metal and some super large servers -- you would be wrong. It is a normal Java reactive application running on OpenJDK on an 8 core server with couple hundred GB of memory. And the last time I needed to look at the profiler was about a year ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used cassandra quite a bit and even I had to go back and figure out what this primary key means:    ((channel_id, bucket), message_id)

The primary key consists of partition key + clustering columns, so this says that channel_id &amp; bucket are the partition key, and message_id is the one and only clustering column (you can have more).They also cite the most common cassandra mistake, which is not understanding that your partition key has to limit partition size to less than 300MB, and no surprise: They had to craft the &#34;bucket&#34; column as a function of message date-time because that&#39;s usually the only way to prevent a partition from eventually growing too large. Anyhow, this is incredibly important if you don&#39;t want to suffer a catastrophic failure months/years after you thought everything was good to go.They didn&#39;t mention this part: Oh, I have to include all partition key columns in every query&#39;s &#34;where&#34; clause, so... I have to run as many queries as are needed for the time period of data I want to see, and stitch the results together... ugh... Yeah it&#39;s a little messy."</p>

Anyway, it started showing me ads and the TV eventually became sluggish less than a month after owning it. Returned it as defective.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Security and convenience are usually in direct competition with each other.  Customer service people have to listen to people yell at them when convenience is sacrificed and aren&#39;t held accountable for security problems.  They therefore optimize for customer convenience.  I don&#39;t completely fault them for it. If anyone has had the frustration of sitting on the phone with a customer service rep trying to remember a PIN code that was setup 5 years ago when signing up with an ISP and was never thought about since, you can probably understand it.It is easy to blame a single person or a single company for poor practices, but I have yet to encounter any real solution to this problem that allows someone to prove they are who they say they are which is able to hit the sweet spot between too many false positives (hijacked accounts) and too many false negatives (valid customers locked out).If I was a security-minded person looking for startup ideas, this is the problem I would be looking to solve."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can almost guarantee this is due to licensing issues with the camera firmware. Modern cameras aren&#39;t just hardware any more. They&#39;re a mix of hardware and advanced processing algorithms that really do make a huge difference in the final output. Those algorithms are often licensed from 3rd parties with specific licensing requirements.Sony has been reasonably good about enabling open-source and fixing these things in the past, so I&#39;d give them the benefit of the doubt that they&#39;ll try to find a way to enable the cameras on unlocked phones in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AFAIK similar thing happens with Sony smartphones. They claim to officially support AOSP. But:&#34;If you unlock the bootloader, you may void the warranty of your device and/or any warranty from your operator. See your device’s warranty statement for details. Additionally, due to the modified device software, Sony’s repair network will likely have to replace key components before it can properly test, repair and verify your device using our repair tools and software. Consequently, if Sony performs a warranty repair, Sony will likely charge you a significant service fee for the additional costs caused by your modification of the software.&#34;And regarding camera:&#34;Certain pre-loaded content on your device may also be inaccessible due to the removal of DRM security keys. For devices running recent software versions, for instance Xperia Z3, the removal of DRM security keys may affect advanced camera functionality. For example, noise reduction algorithms might be removed, and performance when taking photos in low-light conditions might be affected. The secure user data partition may also become inaccessible, and you will not be able to get any more official software upgrades if you unlock the bootloader.&#34;I was very enthusiastic about Sony smartphones when I first read about them officially supporting AOSP, but after reading those terms I just bought cheap Android One Xiaomi instead, who supports unlocking bootloader with a single click, does not void your warranty or break your camera and you can easily re-flash original firmware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the surface this seems blatantly illegal: after the sale is made the no-longer-owner removes functionality.Can someone please explain how this is legally not some sort of theft, or bait-and-switch, or ... something?I read comments about firmware licensing, or Japan&#39;s camera noise thing.  Those sound like Samsung problems, while disabling a camera sounds like an actionable user problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone interested in open hardware mice, I have to recommend Ploopy: https://ploopy.co/Plug-and-play, flash your own firmware if you like. Current models ship with QMK (open firmware), although I believe my older trackball didn&#39;t, I&#39;d have to flash it.I have both a left-handed trackball (rare!) and a right-handed mouse from them, I like to alternate.Two obvious complaints:- They&#39;re really expensive- They&#39;re 3D-printed, which means manufacturing isn&#39;t polished. My trackball had a sticky mousewheel, which I ultimately had to buy a replacement for and swap out. My mouse has some rough edges I haven&#39;t filed down yet, and the 3D-printed texture may not be for everyone.The good news is that it&#39;s easy to make replacement parts and repairs yourself!Still, I wish they would make mass-produced versions with more conventional and precise manufacturing techniques, just with the option to 3D-print your own parts if you feel like it / need to. Maybe that would bring the price down while also improving build quality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The transition to endemic COVID-19 is also a psychological one. When everyone has some immunity, a COVID-19 diagnosis becomes as routine as diagnosis of strep or flu—not good news, but not a reason for particular fear or worry or embarrassment either. That means unlearning a year of messaging that said COVID-19 was not just a flu. If the confusion around the CDC dropping mask recommendations for the vaccinated earlier this summer is any indication, this transition to endemicity might be psychologically rocky.&#34;Diseases that are endemic today, such as chicken pox, once caused epidemics with massive body counts, notably in North America.  No vaccines, no advanced medical care, and no natural immunity meant that some villages just ceased to exist.Today, thanks to air travel, the world is a village.  Wuhan is exposed one week, and the world the next.  We, the natives of that village, have vaccines and advanced medical care in finite quantities, plus a better understanding of how to reduce transmission rates.  That&#39;s gone a long way to soften the blow.  The transition from pandemic to endemic usually kills a lot more people in a given area, and the area effected right now is everywhere.The thing is, COVID-19 is not endemic yet and, even once it is, will likely retain the capability of mutating into a strain that causes a new deadly pandemic.  Flu is endemic, but another 1918 could happen at any time.  Until we&#39;ve built up immunity to several different strains of COVID-19, every new strain has the potential to overwhelm our medical systems, and a unusually contagious and deadly mutant will always be a possibility.It&#39;s not as simple as flipping a switch from &#34;life threatening pandemic&#34; to &#34;quotidian endemic&#34;.  There are shades of grey in between that cause varying strain on hospital ICU&#39;s, and the transition isn&#39;t one-way.Our village will be hit far less hard if we behave intelligently about disease prevention.  Turning vaccines into a political wedge issue is one of the stupidest things I&#39;ve seen in my life."</p>

We know that dogs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, mink, white-tailed deer, a gorilla, and a tiger have been found to have been infected with covid-19.  It is implausible that it will ever cease to have an animal reservoir, especially given the finding in Canada of 30% of white-tailed deer having it.Of diseases that get as widespread as this, with animal reservoirs, I don&#39;t believe there is any case of eliminating it.  But, like vaccines can teach the immune system how to respond more intelligently (and less self-destructively) to covid-19, hopefully society can learn to respond more intelligently, and less self-destructively, to the fact that it&#39;s always in circulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I recall correctly, Specialized Bikes pulled all their products from Amazon a while ago, pointing to the failing local bike shops eventually hurting the bike business for everyone.Bicycles are not toys. They are vehicles that need maintenance. You can do much of that maintenance yourself if you&#39;re a nerd, but the vast majority of cyclists are dependent on local bike shops to sustain the cycling community.The bicycle/parts manufacturers need a large cycling community to sell products to. The large cycling community will have novice and intermediate cyclists that will abandon cycling if their bikes break down. The novice and intermediate cyclist need local bike shops to do maintenance on their bikes at affordable rates. The local bike shops need a revenue stream beyond labor for maintenance to be affordable. Thus, the major bicycle manufacturers need to give a oligopoly status to the local bike shops in order to keep their user base large.As a life long cyclist, I&#39;ve seen the industry grow and wane, and throughout it all, I&#39;ve seen the vast majority of people think bicycles are some type of sports-equipment. Decisions like this are one of only a few business models that I can see sustaining the community. I&#39;m actually surprised and optimistic to see the major manufacturer Trek start building their own brick and mortar shops in certain major cities, though I&#39;d prefer to see this happen through a major cooperative between the various brands. If you care about making cycling a serious, sustainable transit alternative, we need to maintain the entire ecosystem of ridership, which means the race to the bottom on amazon must be stopped."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: &#34;PNW wasn’t the only business growing tired of Amazon. Kerson and his team asked buyers at every retailer who stocks PNW parts to remove them from their Amazon stores too, so that everyone involved could maximize their profits and not undercut each other.&#34; ...  “We set up these calls and we were not expecting them to go very well,” says Marshall, “As soon as we started talking about it the buyers were really excited.”From the FTC: &#34;Price fixing is an agreement (written, verbal, or inferred from conduct) among competitors that raises, lowers, or stabilizes prices or competitive terms ... Price fixing relates not only to prices, but also to other terms that affect prices to consumers, such as shipping fees, warranties, discount programs, or financing rates. Antitrust scrutiny may occur when competitors discuss the following topics: ..., Capacity, Identity of customers, ... Defendants may not justify their behavior by arguing that the prices were reasonable to consumers, were necessary to avoid cut-throat competition, or stimulated competition.&#34; [1]Is there a lawer who can say if that was price fixing?[1] https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can someone &#34;sell me&#34; on Deno? I&#39;m still not sure why I should be interested in this versus for example NodeJS. Most of the features it lists seem rather dubious.&gt; Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.Great, but we&#39;re talking about server software so the first thing any project is going to do is enable all of that. And it&#39;s not like you can trust this on the server, you&#39;d still need to sandbox to process if you truly want isolation.&gt; Supports TypeScript out of the box.Okay so it&#39;s coupled to Microsoft&#39;s take on Javascript. What about Flow or any of the other compiles-to-Javascript languages? What&#39;s wrong with using Babel with sourcemaps?&gt; Ships only a single executable file.I guess that could be convenient but I&#39;m struggling to think of a situation where installing node has ever been a problem.&gt; Has built-in utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a code formatter (deno fmt).Is this not the job of the package manager? Or does deno force you to use itself as the package manager? Will that not just bring about another npm situation in a few years?I feel like I&#39;m clearly missing something with how excited everyone is about deno, but I have no idea what it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a long-time Node user but decided to use Deno for a personal project and found that it&#39;s is a pleasure to work with. Some highlights:  - TypeScript works out-of-the-box without configuration
  - includes modern browser APIs like fetch() without needing to import additional dependencies
  - The Deno-specific APIs (like Deno.readTextFile()[0]) are Promise-based and have intuitive interfaces
  - The Deno standard library[1] reduces the need for 3rd party dependencies, since it covers a lot of cases where one would be needed

I haven&#39;t yet used Deno in a commercial product, but I believe I will in the future because Deno seems ready for primetime.  [0]https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.readTextFile

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When this topic is applied at scale, I feel that the article is discussing &#34;Tech giants don&#39;t want to recruit the people they need to handle customer support&#34;, with extra steps.Tech scales cheaply. People do not.The argument here, which I wholeheartedly support, is that people deserve transparency - we should know what happens to our data. The sum of human interactions, our actions as a group, our foibles, best natures and choices are sitting behind NDAs and firms that are essentially imperial, a state that no one wants.Firms like the power, but not the cost. But any more equitable state will require legions of people to respond to all of those complaints raised in a day. Which costs money.Making that information transparent, giving reasons, creating an appeals process (the santa clara principles) is expense.I bet that no firm wants to, and if forced to do so, they will shift the costs to someone else. Either firms that treat all of those escalations as fodder to churn through or upsell, or to tax paying citizens.Kafkaesque bureaucracy? If anyone is willing to take the other side of a bet, I&#39;ll bet that there is ONLY Kafkaesque bureaucracy here. Get more people, then  you get more lopsided human bias influenced decisions. Get more automation, and then you have the current state of affairs - no nuance, no clarity and the unfeeling boot of an automaton on your account.&#34;Which KPI defined the fate of humanity? Appeals addressed per second&#34;Final point: In the real world, if you have open transparent rules, then it takes human time and physical action to appeal or tie up the system.In a digital system, open and transparent rules mean that someone will eventually automate a way to tie up your appeals que at no cost. Ban the user? New account shows up in 10 seconds.I have no idea how to address this last difference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What magnifies this problem is that unrelated, offline companies are more and more frequently requiring you to use these tech products in order to do business.  On United, you can&#39;t buy a drink on the airplane without installing an app (only available to serfs of the apple or google empires).  You can&#39;t attend a Cubs game in Chicago, again, without an app (no physical tickets, before pandemic).  You can&#39;t see a menu at a restaurant without a smartphone and personal internet connection.  Order carryout only through an app, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is what will happen with this technology... nothing. The company is an IP play where they have locked up this concept in IP and will try and force it on jurisdictions by various means of legislation to ensure they can get the highest prices possible for said IP. Incumbents will resist choosing to continue with current public domain technology. In 30 years when the IP expires it might possibly come into more common use. The current IP regimes are a complete disaster and are hamstringing human progress.PS: Also scroll compressors are substantially more energy efficient than rotary and various means of staging is even more efficient yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the explanation of the A/C fluid cycle is haphazard and the description of how forces relate to crankshaft position is completely wrong.  The crankshaft actually applies maximum force to the piston while approaching top and bottom dead center, when the mechanical advantage is greatest, and the least at mid stroke, where the torque of the motor is most directly opposed by the pressure of the gas against the face of the piston.   This is good, however, because it marries well to the available power through an alternating current system.The design described does seem to have fewer moving parts, which is good.  But the advantage of linear vs rotary motion with respect to forces seems sketchy.  Field strength in the linear system is likely to vary across the travel and would still need to be synchronized to the alternating current to prevent motor stalls.  (Edit 50 of this comment: this effect is actually illustrated directly in the video here: https://youtu.be/2TFiL5BM3ss?t=348  Imagine the field lines directly correlate with force applied, and mentally plot the quantity of field lines over time as you watch the animation.  Turns out it looks precisely like the force chart of a rotary compressor.)The primary advantage of this pump, to me, seems to be reduced weight/complexity and lower friction losses.  For it to operate with low starting load it would likely need to essentially vibrate its way to full travel (confirmed at 7:47 in the video), something rotary compressors can’t really do.  If you try to restart rotary compressors too quickly after stopping, the high head pressure will stall the motor.  This causes it to effectively be a dead short minus winding resistance, pulling much more current than average (known as LRA or locked rotor amps) with no cooling.  This will heat the motor quickly until it thermally trips or burns up.  This is why you will frequently see restart delays in A/C systems.For what its worth, scroll compressors have been around forever and share some of these advantages, but aren’t dominant in the industry because of the additional complexity in manufacturing.  They have an additional advantage of somewhat continous output pressure, which *significantly* reduces ambient noise and vibration.  They also have fewer moving parts and are generally more reliable.All of these advantages convey to standard air compressors by the way, something I&#39;m a little surprised they didn&#39;t mention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do note that Magtor is currently only claiming to be able to compress air, not air conditioning fluids / refrigerants. They add that &#34;[a]lthough air compression is a first milestone for Magtor, the medium-term goal is to bring Magtor efficiencies to climate control engineering allowing products such as fridges, heat pumps and air conditioning units to become 30+% more efficient&#34; [1].It&#39;s hard to verify more on the design. They offer a lot of explanation and tests, but no independent review is given. Main question on YouTube about scrolling compressors (used in newer fridges) is anwered a bit vaguely [2].The patent portfolio page is very grandiose [3] but doesn&#39;t care to link anything. A quick search doesn&#39;t turn up much to do with air or fluid compression, only &#34;Magnet device comprising stators and translators&#34; [4] and similar, which don&#39;t mention compression at all.[1] https://www.magtor.tech/who-we-are/[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TFiL5BM3ss&amp;lc=UgxHEJkjlZ9fZ...[3] https://www.magtor.tech/intellectual-property/[4] https://patents.google.com/patent/US10943721B2"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, surprised to find myself here and appreciate all the discussion. I&#39;m the author of the above project and wanted to shed some light on the inspiration for the project.It started as a simple weekend project based on an off-hand comment someone made in a security professional chat I&#39;m in. I had used duress words in military and translating the concept to a PAM seemed like a fun exercise. Also supports my current shift towards swapping careers from pure software engineering to cyber-research or cybersecurity generally. So in the end, it was a weekend project that served a dual purpose as a resume stamp.The design use case I had in mind was more benign; such as corporate espionage or journalists getting their devices confiscated (maybe keep a sticky note on the laptop that has a duress password on it as a red-herring). Comments to the effect that law enforcement would image a device are very relevant as any competent law enforcement agency should have their staff trained to get the device fully powered off and hand it to someone that can maintain a chain of custody and get a golden image for use in potential criminal charges.One thought I had was to apply this to SSH auth for honeypots and if a rockyou.txt password is attempted it runs some routines that aid in crafting the honeypot before the intruder drops to a shell prompt. Another even more light-hearted implementation could be you have password X is the one you login to normally and your &#34;duress&#34; password Y just clears your browser history and is the one you give your spouse for when they log into your computer :). I&#39;m sure there&#39;s use cases in the full spectrum and with it being a relatively simple implementation with user generated scripts, it&#39;d be easy to extend to any potential use case.In any case I&#39;m glad it prompted such a good discussion. Feel free to submit issues if there are particular feature requests or bugs that one might run across. Additionally if there&#39;s a PR up, I&#39;m currently the only dedicated dev on the project and welcome anyone that wants to review my PRs; always prefer a 3rd person review even on my own projects. I created a demo video using Pushover and in the process of doing the demo uncovered some bugs that I patched as well as some fixes to the documentation. Again, glad you all found this interesting and humbled it fostered such a good discussion."</p>

One night, the keypad was acting glitchy. Partially out of frustration (countdown is running), and partially to test, I ended up accidentally engaging the duress code by tapping a convenient corner number, which resulted in NNNNNNNNN-PIN.After law enforcement had surrounded the building, a quick chat and search alongside a few officers got it all sorted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are multiple levels of protection one might want.I.e. when you are being selected for random questioning entering US as a non-US citizen, you&#39;d benefit from steganography-like approach: you give a password, and relatively bland, non-personal stuff shows up, giving appearance of full access to a system.If you only care about your privacy, the next one is to have a destroy-everything script (and it&#39;s not that hard: usually, passphrases are only used to decrypt the actual encryption keys, so overwriting those keys should be super fast).  This would also work against unsophisticated attacks which are not going to really cost you your life.If there is a potential for you to be a target of a sophisticated attack and the attacker does not care about taking your life, the biggest benefit is to have a way to inform someone of your whereabouts while you are actually giving access, ideally in a way that buys you time (eg. &#34;webcam has detected stress on your face, please wait another 6 hours before trying to log in again&#34; — sorry, company mandated software, when it happens usually, we call support)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few highlights from a conversation with a friend who works for Zeiss and regularly deals with ASML (take this with a grain of salt, I may have misunderstood some of it and he also may not be an expert in all of these areas):- The lenses (actually mirrors for EUV) only demagnify by a factor of 4. So your wafer template is already extremely small and costs millions to produce.- 13.5nm is pretty much the smallest wavelength you can reasonably handle. If you want to go smaller, you have to build a particle accelerator. (He heard that from a colleague, wasn&#39;t sure how much of that was actually true.)- The prices in this Twitter thread are pretty spot on. The EU wants to invest into chip making to become more independent in this area. But the sums they&#39;re talking about wouldn&#39;t even pay for one such machine. Politicians don&#39;t seem to be aware of the dimensions we&#39;re talking about here.- Also in the thread, ASML has a monopoly on this tech. Others have not invested into EUV and by now, it&#39;s pretty much impossible for anybody to catch up.- Everyone&#39;s hiring like crazy atm. He started home office during Covid and now Zeiss says he can&#39;t even go back to the office because they don&#39;t have enough office space anymore. He doesn&#39;t mind. Everyone&#39;s distributed all over the place anyway so whether he does conference calls at the office or at home makes no difference.- He said they&#39;re not very affected by the chip shortage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah yes, ASML. I have a number of friends and ex-colleagues who work there. Unsurprisingly, due to their importance, ASML are extremely well-known inside of the Netherlands. It&#39;s one of those companies that spun out of Philips Electronics and became very successful (NXP is another good example).A lot of research and development is still going on in the area where Philips had their research labs. If you&#39;re curious to see what kind of high-tech is being worked on in the &#34;Dutch silicon valley&#34; I suggest you Google &#34;Brainport Eindhoven&#34; or &#34;High Tech Campus Eindhoven&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like ASML is the company that almost everyone who would care has heard of at this point. Granted, I hadn&#39;t heard of them 3 years ago, even though I work directly with HW designers.Its just funny how they&#39;re going through the hype cycle in their level of public awareness. Give it 3 years and (hopefully) the &#34;general public&#34; won&#39;t have to care about them again, because chip shortages are resolved

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article says that employees of the AI company (ShotSpotter) manually reviewed and classified the sounds as gunshots:&gt; records showed that ShotSpotter actually initially picked up what sounded like a firework a mile away, and this was later reclassified by ShotSpotter staff to be a gunshot at the intersection where and when Williams was seen on camera.So the AI didn’t even make the call. The staff did, manually. I assume that means the actual audio is available and entered into evidence?If humans are making the call then blaming AI seems like a stretch. That’s almost like blaming the motion detection algorithms for triggering video recordings that were later reviewed by humans. It’s still humans reviewing the recordings and making decisions."</p>

I think that in itself is as much of an issue as the quality of the evidence. How can the government justify taking year away from the life of a man who has not been convicted of anything?"</p>

A lot of us on HN are developers and software engineers who pioneered the technology for a paycheck or are using this technology for a paycheck.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve created ~five new projects over the past year using SQLite and I&#39;ve got into the habit of creating tables like this:  CREATE TABLE tIssue (
    id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL CHECK (typeof(id) = &#39;integer&#39;),
    col1 BLOB NOT NULL                CHECK (typeof(col1) = &#39;blob&#39;),
    col2 TEXT                         CHECK (typeof(col2) = &#39;text&#39; OR col2 IS NULL)
  );

This has saved me from a lot of errors and has been useful, but it&#39;s just so easy to let things drift, e.g. removing `NOT NULL` constraint and forgetting to also update the check constraints. I&#39;m also horrified at the auto-conversions that I&#39;ve just learned about from this link that I&#39;m not protected from.I&#39;m very much looking forward to using strict tables."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really welcome.  One idea for an approach I had a while back (but haven&#39;t attempted writing code yet) was to see if &#34;personalities&#34; could be implemented.For example a &#34;PostgreSQL&#34; personality (set via PRAGMA maybe?) which dynamically imposes the same type names and &#34;limitations&#34; on SQLite as PostgreSQL.Ditto for other SQL dialects (MySQL, etc).SQLite already has the flexibility to allow the data types, so this idea is a way of putting constraints in place that are really beneficial for a _lot_ of common use cases.eg &#34;You&#39;re using SQLite as a local test for a [PostgreSQL/MySQL/etc] prod database&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"2D games had so many tricks that they often looked better than their 3D replacements for quite some time. If you were able to do every pixel by hand for a few views you often ended up with more detail than you could in the low amount of polygons available early on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Fake perspective&#34; was problematic in early flight simulators as well where texture-mapping was used. The classic example being a long runway.If the runway was a long polygon and you had a long texture map (with a dashed centerline for example) the standard code to map the bitmap to the projected runway polygon would not in fact apply perspective to the bitmap — the intervals between the dashes would be a fixed not perspective distance.The solution was to break up the runway into a whole bunch of shorter polygons — each with a bitmap of perhaps one stripe/dash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nowdays, I make the distinction between maintainable programs and hackable ones, the later of course being, imo, way better. What I mean by that is essentially that the ratio # by-design features over simplicity of code of the hackable program is considerably higher than the maintainable program (but there is no method to write a hackable program, you either have the sensibility for that or you dont, from my own observation - I&#39;ll be happy to discuss the nuances of that statement).I don&#39;t know today but blizzard used to write its game in the hackable way - which is both a feat and rare. Take WoW for example, do you know how the 3d engine basically work? It&#39;s so simple and so powerful, you are not going to believe it. WoW is made of levels that are connected by portals. That&#39;s it. A level will have portals that will get you to other levels which in turn will have portals which lead to other levels. For example, when you are &#34;outdoor&#34; (with quotes because the engine doesn&#39;t know outdoor actually, it knows levels!), you may find a portal that leads you into a tavern for example. Once you are in the tavern, the program can ignore the rest of the world and focus the whole computer resources on the tavern, just like that, by-design. So you&#39;ll have taverns as detailed as all of what you can see in the exteriors. Better, you can have landscape in each and every level. (note when the player is in the air, say on a gryphon, some portals are ignored.)This is both incredible simple and powerful. Remember the game run on early-2000 PCs. Imagine what you can do with that. Caves? Done. Houses that leads into catacombs? Done. Incredibly detailed cities? Add walls and portals, done. Texture streaming? Well, d-o-n-e. Buildings that leads to indoor landscape? Done.I wouldnt make a game engine differently today.As a comparison, I&#39;m working on one of the most played game in the world atm which is a maintainable program. You have no idea the pain in the ass in comparison just to add simple features. Oh yeah the code is readable. You can fix bugs. But features, just forget it, it takes a shit load of money to get one done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nabokov&#39;s solution to this dilemma, reread. The only good reader is, as he said, a re-reader. If we&#39;re honest nobody can actually remember more than a dozen books, and if you pick the right ones there&#39;s more to learn in any of them than you can learn in years.It&#39;s similar to the sentiment that the only way to understand a poem is to be able to recite it from memory, or the fact that some pianists play nothing else but Bach and yet reach mastery. Everything&#39;s already in there, or most of it anyway.Requires a different mentality, one that treats reading or perception and deep study as the thing to care about, not &#39;absorbing information&#39; or &#39;knowledge&#39;.Umberto Eco once pointed out that the size of the unknown, the books one has not read are magnitudes larger than the books one has read, so to treat knowledge as some sort of priced possession to climb in the pecking order is meaningless, what matters is being adequate in understanding the few things one actually has the time to study."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Because when you’re finally in a situation where you could use its insights, you’ve completely forgotten them.I once read a short essay by Patrick Süskind (author of &#34;Perfume - The Story of a Murderer&#34;). I am paraphrasing, but in it, he discusses his embarrassment that he cannot remember even major plot details or character names of great works of world literature, although he has read them multiple times and they deeply inspired his own work. He then makes an interesting speculation: if a book really and deeply influences you, then maybe actively remembering facts and insights of the book becomes harder and harder, because the book&#39;s ideas have been so deeply ingrained into your brain and thinking that you cannot remember them as facts independent of your thinking. But this doesn&#39;t mean that you have &#34;forgotten&#34; them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way to remember what you read is to make sure you understand all the words in the text, the way they apply in context.It&#39;s the micro-misunderstandings that lead up to the macro-misunderstanding which manifests as &#34;forgetting&#34;.Other commenters also mention applying what&#39;s in the book. That is 100% true, when you&#39;re reading about how to do something. If you&#39;re reading a fact-based book (non-fiction) but not about doing something I usually take a break from the text and think about how it would apply to the subject I&#39;m studying. But it&#39;s just obvious that you can&#39;t get a concept if you don&#39;t understand the words that describe it.The target is conceptual understanding. It&#39;s got nothing to do with memorization. TO get the meaning of a song, for instance, it&#39;s not necessary to memorize the lyrics.One real-world example, I was taking care of my father in the hospital and I noticed one of the techs telling him that he needs to order his dinner from the &#34;dysphagia&#34; menu. I asked her if he could have some other soft foods from home and she said, &#34;all I know is that he needs to order from the menu.&#34; I asked her what dysphagia means, honestly I didn&#39;t know. She didn&#39;t know. I looked it up and told her it means &#34;difficulty in swallowing&#34;. She realized that she never actually understood the concept of WHY one needs to order from the menu. As if the food is somehow magic. So that helped her understand the concept of the rule, and why it applies and I am sure she hasn&#39;t forgotten it.I don&#39;t take notes, mark up pages or speed read or use any crutch, trick or technique to study. I just get the definitions of words that I don&#39;t understand and I do just fine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love walking and there are many parks next to where I live. However I am never able to fully enjoy it or indulge in any longer thinking activities as most of the time I&#39;ll be interrupted by either elderly people asking me &#34;to go back where I came from&#34; or random ID checks by undercover police. This happened a lot (5x times) over the last year when I decide to go and walk in a park, once even during an online call with my team. I live in a medium sized city in Germany and come from North Africa / France and it might show a bit too much.
As a mitigation I once seriously considered changing how I look by for example dressing more like a dad or walking the neighbors dog as an alibi for being &#34;normal&#34;. Maybe it would have interested the old ladies too, who knows. 
For the time being I&#39;ll keep at walking on streets or inside the city as it&#39;s less strange to see foreigners there. Can&#39;t wait to have my private forest :&#39;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a person who walked 8/15 hours for two months straight I can relate to most of the statements written by the author. I believe that listening to music or other recordings takes away from the experience and the mental gains that walking provides, and this is why I skip the headphones during my adventures.I can attest that after 10 days of continuous autonomous movement the mind switches to a &#34;primordial&#34; state that, as a non academic, I believe can be very easily attributable to our nomadic, hunter-gatherer past.Attention gets sharper, acumen rings free, the range of senses expands, creative impulses flourish and it&#39;s easier to perform tasks in unexpectedly smart ways.I suggest those who would like to give it a try embark on a walking adventure that is at least two weeks long, either on pilgrimage routes (which offer great views and allow one to save money thanks to the hospitality options available) like the Camino de Santiago de Compostela / Fatima or long trails such as the Appalachian Trail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yet another great mind (also an infamous introvert) who used to take long walks to refresh his mind was Paul Dirac.  From his 1963 interview [1] with Thomas Kuhn, he describes how a decisive Sunday walk made him see the analogy between commutators in quantum mechanics and Poisson brackets in classical mechanics:&gt; &#34;I used to take long walks on Sundays and get away from the work altogether, and at the end of those walks I would perhaps go on with my work a bit in a refreshed state of mind. And after one of these Sunday walks it occurred to me that the commutator might be the analogue of the Poisson bracket, but I didn’t know very well what a Poisson bracket was then. I had just read a bit about it and forgotten most of what I had read, and I wanted to check up on this idea, but I couldn’t do it because I didn’t have any book at home which gave Poisson brackets and all the libraries were closed. So I just had to wait impatiently until Monday morning when the libraries were open to go and check up on what Poisson brackets really were. Then I found that they did fit, but I had one impatient night of waiting.&#34;[1] https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a spy is only getting harder.  I remember reading a few years back how biometric scanning meant the CIA spy could not enter CountryX as a Textiles importer one week and a Olive salesman the next.  They had to bribe people at the passport office into fixing their biometrics etc.Now this sort of thing must make it almost impossible. You can&#39;t even leave your mobile at home accidentally - that would trip alarm bells, especially if your contact does it at the same lunch hour.Spying seems to be a necessary part of how States understand one another.  If human level intelligence work simply gets blown apart by technology then yeah we can keep track on what the other side is doing, but so very often we want to know why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Location history is default off - but in general is useful enough you&#39;ll want to turn it on. To have it turned on you would need to* Sign into your google account* Turned on location history (google account level) - default is off* Turn on location reporting (device level option).---A reasonable balance I&#39;ve found is to have Google delete old location history - to do that you go to Google Maps Timelinehttp://www.google.com/maps/timelineThen do automatically delete location history. This deletes after some time. So you get the benefits of history without the forever record.---You can also see what location history has been tracked for you with Takeout. Some cool visualizers there."</p>
